 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will conduct a suite of genetic studies aimed at increasing fundamental knowledge of gene flow and molecular systematics of organisms associated with mid-ocean ridge systems and cognate environments in the deep sea.  Over the past decade, the investigators have amassed an extensive collection of specimens from fast-, intermediate-, and slow-spreading systems throughout the world's oceans.  The primary objectives of this project are to extend ongoing studies of gene flow, genetic diversity, and evolutionary relationships to samples recently collected from the southern East Pacific Rise (7 degrees S - 32 degrees S latitude) and to continue studies of evolutionary relationships and biogeography of deep-sea hydrothermal vent and sulfide seep organisms throughout the world.  In particular, the investigators will search for evidence of connections between the southern East Pacific Rise, the central Indian ridge system, and western Pacific back arc basins.  Preliminary data indicate that there are several \"morphospecies\" at 31 degrees - 32 degrees S that may be related to, or conspecific with, named species for the western Pacific (Lau and Manus Back Arc Basins and Mariana Trough).  This project should provide a comprehensive picture of ecological, geological, and evolutionary processes affecting the dominant invertebrate species that live in some of the most extreme environments on our planet.  The biodiversity aspects of this research have been recognized with a supplementary award (NIH) to facilitate materials and technology transfer to parties interested in marine natural products discovery.",
