Specific equipment to be acquired includes a spinner magnetometer, an alternating field (AF) demagnetizer, and a thermal demagnetizer.  Dennis Kent recently accepted a tenured faculty appointment at Rutgers University after a long and distinguished career at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  He continues to hold an appointment at LDEO and maintains the paleomag lab there that he was instrumental in building.  The LDEO lab houses a shielded room, a 2-G superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) and some 1970's vintage paleomag equipment including an AF demagnetizer,  thermal  demagnetizers,  and a spinner maagnetometer.  This equipment will be housed in new space at Rutgers University where Kent will be actively involved in teaching undergraduate and graduate students.  The new equipment will replace outdated and no longer supported equipment and will offer superior capabilities for paleomagnetic investigations of the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and for magnetostratigraphic research.\r\n***\r\n",
