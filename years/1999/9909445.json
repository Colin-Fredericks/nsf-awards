 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty states that regular and effective monitoring are required to facilitate the assessment of the impact of activities on the Antarctic environment.  This project will initiate the monitoring process for the United States Antarctic Program with a study of the temporal and spatial scales of various types of disturbances in and around McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  This will be accomplished by the establishment of an observational system over a three-year period.  The system is designed to determine the scales of natural and anthropogenic change in terrestrial and marine habitats.  A series of system attributes (or indicators of change) within these two habitats will be measured by a combination of aerial photography and point-data sampling grids at various spatial scales.  The study will determine the spatial and temporal scales of change and its origin, the efficiency of the observing system in documenting relevant changes in important habitat characteristics, and the utility of various approaches to reference or control locations.  Modern Geographic Information System techniques and geostatistical methods will be used to organize the diverse datasets within a coherent and coordinated framework.  The study will provide fundamental scientific information for developing a long-term strategy to document and minimize the impacts of scientific research and support operations on Antarctic resources and values in the future.\r\n\r\n",
