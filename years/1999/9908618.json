The objectives of the program are to have the nation's state geological surveys better train students to scientific field techniques and geologic mapping and to excite and encourage students to work in the field, side by side with experienced geologic mappers and field geologists, who will be both teachers and mentors.  The success of the program will be assessed by interviewing students and their teacher/mentors and tracking the students' careers.  These compiled data will be reported to the general geoscience community.  Individual state surveys will select students from geoscience departments and summer field camp programs nationwide and from the summer field-training program administered by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers.  It is expected that most state field projects will be linked to funded research through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey) or other federal, state, local agencies or the private sector programs\r\n",
