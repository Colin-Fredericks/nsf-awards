 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ragozin plans to investigate several topics connected withmultivariate polynomial and generalized spline (energy minimizing)approximations, numerical integration, and fast computational methods for multivariable potentials and related functions.  These investigationswill aim to develop methods for approximating functional relationshipsamong (large) finite data sets when the underlying data points are drawn from finite dimensional spheres or other compact spaces with a high degree of homogeneity, or from high dimensional Euclidean spaces.  The high degree of symmetry and homogeneity of spheres and Euclidean spaces,and the use of radial functions, which respect much of the symmetry and homogeneity, provide a major unifying feature of the different investigations. In each of these domains there exist a well defined and effectively computable set of (invariant) polynomial kernels whichdepend on many fewer parameters then the underlying space, but which can and will be used to develop the sought after approximation, integration and fast computational processes. The development of explicit approximation processes on spheres and Euclidean spaces, together with computable bounds on the errors in these processes, will enhance the infrastructure for practical scientific computation.  By reliance on radial function expansions, practical computations based on scattered data sets become feasible.  The fast computational methods forpolyharmonic radial functions in Euclidean spaces will extend existingmethods for thin-plate splines in ordinary three space, and facilitateeffective  application of multivariate Laplacian spline interpolation andsmoothing techniques, including cross-validation, to extremely large data sets.Many scientific and engineering problems involve modelling the complexfunctional relationships between two, three or more continuousquantities. The aim of this research is to develop new mathematicaltechniques to approximate such relationships by simpler functions,together with estimates for how close these approximations come to thetruth. By use of combinations of simple functions which depend only onthe distance between two points in space or on the surface of a spheresuch as the earth, this work hopes to provide highly efficient means ofapproximation and modelling; computational codes which exploit thesemethods should be able to deal in practical time with extremely largedata sets.  For example, existing methods based on exact modelling require several quadrillion operations for sets containing 100,000 points. Methods based on the approximations developed here will reduce this by afactor of a billion, so only several million operations are required.Todays computers can rapidly handle this number of operations.",
