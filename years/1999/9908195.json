 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to organize a workshop for participants to identify a research agenda that will serve the National Science Foundation in its effort to guide the enineering research community involved in design and construction of capital facilties.  The architecture engineering construction (AEC) industry has been changing at an ever increasin pace, due to specialization, fragmentation, litigation, and globalization.  These have led to the high complexity and uncertainity so characteristic of most projects being developed today.  Despite the challenges ahead, oppurtunities abound thanks to a shift in thinking regarding the engineering and construction process combined with the availability of new information technologies, organiational and contractual restructing, and means and methods.  This shift makes it conceivable to achieve true integration among all AEC players so as to result in increased value delivered to owners.  The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners who are active in the field so they can discuss the advancement of theory for construction engineering and management and research efforts to support its development.  The workshop will be oranized jointly by a PI at Berkeley and a PI at Stanford as follows.  First, potential participants will be solicited by electronically issuing a request for submission of \"whitepapers\" or \"position papers.\"  Second, the submissions will be posted on the web and submitted to public a vote (each author will be able to vote for his or her five favorite papers).  Third, taking the outcome of the vote as the basis for decision making, the PIs, together with a steering committee, will select participants to the workshop.  Additional considerations for selection of workshop participants are:  representation of sectors (industry and academia), ability to lead discussion sections, and academic rank, and research experience.  Fourth, the workshop will be held in late August at Stanford University.  Finally, all preparatory whitepapers, summaries of the discussions, and the conclusions of the workshop will be posted on the web, hosted at a site at the University of California, Berkeley, so as to reach the widest audience possible.",
