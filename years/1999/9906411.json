 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will examine German and American judicial approaches to the postwar prosecution of Nazi war crimes, especially \"euthanasia\"-related crimes committed by German doctors and medical personnel. The aim of the project is to examine the variety of assumptions (ethical, epistemological, anthropological, and theological) that guided the judges, counsel, and other participants in these trials. Such assumptions pertain to the following: (1) the types of evidence considered probative on issues of guilt and innocence; (2) defenses permitted/forbidden by American and German courts; (3) judicial views of Nazi criminality (i.e., whether jurists believed that the Nazi elite planned the massmurder of European Jewry and other groups from early on in the regime, or instead held that genocide occurred as a series of improvised, ad hoc measures to deal with unmanageable populations of Jews in the East); and (4) judicial conceptions of Nazi medicine and science. Prior literature on postwar national trials of Nazi defendants has largely focused on one national trial, and on issues of the quality of justice achieved by prosecutorial authorities. One exception to this trend is the recent work of Dick de Mildt, who has studied an array of national trials from the Nuremberg International Tribunal in 1946 to the present day. Even de Mildt, however, has not situated national trials in a comparative framework that allows for their cross-cultural comparison. The research project will seek to construct such a framework, thus filling a significant gap in current scholarship on the national trials of Nazi defendants. Research will proceed in accordance with two hypotheses. (1) The German judiciary and legislature were more concerned with the subjective state of mind of the accused than were their American counterparts. This heightened interest in subjective intent was a product of two situational factors: first, the Germans were confronted with cases in which they had to adjudicate the guilt or innocence of \"respected\" professionals, cases in which the German educational system that had trained the defendants was also under indictment; second, German jurists were deeply influenced by a Kantian ethical tradition, which emphasized the subjective intentions of moral actors in assessing the nature (admirable or culpable) of their actions. (2) The Americans regarded Nazi science as non-science or pseudo-science, characterizing the euthanasia doctors as criminals guilty of first-degree murder. The Germans, on the other hand, were more inclined to see Nazi science as an extreme form of science, leading them, in some cases, to either acquit euthanasia defendants or to mitigate their sentences. \tSubjects for study will be the trials of the \"euthanasia\" gassing experts, a group of medical doctors brought before German courts between 1948 and 1986. After analyzing the German cases, the project will contrast the German approach to Nazi medicalized killing with the earlier American euthanasia trials (part of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal's larger medical case involving doctors and scientists of the Third Reich). Documentation on these trials will be reviewed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum library and archives, the National Archives, the Stautsanwaltschaft for Frankfurt, Germany, and the Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Research will utilize both primary and secondary source materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
