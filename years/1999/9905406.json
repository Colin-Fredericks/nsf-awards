 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nSimons\r\nRNA-binding proteins are involved in all aspects of gene expression, including replication, transcription, translation, ribosomal and messenger RNA processing and decay, RNA splicing and editing, and RNA transport and export.  Ribonucleases are key players in these events.  Ribonuclease III (RNase III) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific endonuclease that is widely conserved, playing vital or essential roles in RNA processing and decay.  Each RNase III monomer (of the functioning dimer) contains a single copy of the dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM) found in a large number of diverse proteins known or thought to bind dsRNA.  RNase III also contains a highly conserved catalytic domain (catD), so far unique to this enzyme.  Recent and important evidence reveals how the dsRBM binds to dsRNA as an independently folded protein module.  Other recent evidence shows that catD is also an independent module, possessing robust and specific endoribonuclease activity under specific conditions.  These studies suggest that the dsRBM and catD subdomains of RNase III likely interact with one another through a network of intimate contacts, to stabilize binding and to create a more efficient catalytic site.  Subdomain contacts within otherwise modular proteins, including other RNA-binding proteins, are not well-understood.  This research project comprises an integrated genetic assault on RNase III structure and function at the subdomain level, through well-defined specific aims.  Key biochemical work will directly test genetic predictions.  The principal determinants of RNase III dimerization will be examined in vivo, through the isolation of point mutations in a novel genetic screen.  The potential contribution of dsRNA substrate binding to dimer stability will be carefully assessed, aided by existing well-characterized dsRBM point mutations that prevent binding.  Substrate-binding determinants in catD will also be sought.  Potential interactions between dsRBM and catD will be studied carefully, with a newly developed in vivo assay in which RNase III activity is reconstituted from the individually expressed subdomains, as well as with the recently developed prokaryotic two-hybrid system and other means.  These efforts will yield important insights into dsRNA-binding, RNase III catalysis, and modular protein structure and function in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimons\r\nRNA is one of the storehouses of genetic material in all cells.  RNA-binding proteins are involved in all aspects of RNA function.  RNase III is one such RNA-binding protein.  It is found in most cells.  RNase III contains an RNA-binding module (RBM) found in a large number of related proteins that bind RNA.  RNase III also contains a catalytic module (catD), unique to this protein family.  Recent and important evidence suggests that the RBM and catD modules interact with one another through a network of intimate contacts.  In general, subdomain contacts in modular proteins are not well-understood.  This research project will mount an integrated genetic and biochemical assault on RNase III structure and function, at the modular level.  These efforts will yield important insights into RNA-binding, RNase III function, and modular protein structure and function in general.\r\n",
