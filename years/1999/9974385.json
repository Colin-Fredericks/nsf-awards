 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mike Zerner of the University of Florida is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the effect of solvation on molecular structures, spectroscopic properties, and chemical reactivities with theoretical methods.  He proposes to examine solvation models of both the reaction field and mixed quantum/classical types.  For the former, he will re-examine cavity size and shape, and their relation to heat of solvation.  For the latter he will study the nature of dispersion interactions between solvent and solute.  Applications cover topics such as aromaticity, electrophilic substitution, electron transfer, and nonlinear optical properties.\r\n\r\nAlthough most electronic structure theories relate directly to molecular systems in the gas phase, much of chemistry occurs in condensed phases.  Properties such as aromaticity are very dependent on the effects of solution, as are the rates and energetics of processes such as electron transfer.  Additionally, non-linear optical properties in condensed phases are sensitive to polarizable media.  To describe environmental effects, specifically solvation, useful tools are needed to integrate smoothly with existing advanced techniques for the electronic structures of isolated systems.",
