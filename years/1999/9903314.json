The project will compare the experience of Tamil speaking Muslim women who migrate to work as domestics with Sinhala speaking Buddhiist women in an otherwise comparable village.  Media representations and political rhetoric criticize women's absence from home as causing social disintegration, and describe many women as victimized in foreign countries, while many women report positive experiences from their work caring for Arabic families in the Middle East in terms of financial remittances to village relatives and self-image as a productive wage-earner.  The researcher will interview a small sample of households about changes in gender roles, kinship structures, class relations and economic strategies, to compare with prior research in a Buddhist village in the same region.  This research will shed new light on this large scale labor migration, assess the foreign experience's impact on the sending community, provide valuable information on this important region of the world, and assist a junior scholar to plan a major research project on this topic.\r\n",
