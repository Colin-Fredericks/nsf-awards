 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) project addresses fabrication and characterization of ultrafine grained (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) and related materials, such as BaTiO3 (BT) and SrTiO3 (ST) as sputtering targets using a reactive process.  These materials in thin film condition are very important dielectric constituents for the next generation computer chips.  These sputtering targets are used in producing thin films.  It is proposed to trigger these reactive processes in pressed powder compacts using a hot wire.  The thermodynamics, kinetic studies as well as reaction mechanism studies will be performed.  The microstructure will be characterized and correlated to the processing parameters.  \r\n      The reactive process is economical, uses inexpensive raw materials, and has low energy requirement.  The reactive process also has possibilities of industrial scaling up.  This is important to the career development potential for this new Principle Investigator in starting up her career. The education component of the work will focus mainly on two activities: modification of an existing material processing course for the senior/graduate students and involvement of undergraduates to the advanced processing research area. It is expected that this POWRE project will provide opportunities for future research with significant industrial interest, allowing this new faculty member to focus on a new set of materials while advancing her expertise in the thin film deposition area.\r\n",
