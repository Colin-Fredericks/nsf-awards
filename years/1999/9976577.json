 "awd_abstract_narration": "9976577\r\nSnider\r\n\r\nFor decades the microelectronics industry has enjoyed growth that is unparalleled in history.  The engine of this growth is the field effect transistor (FET), and while the FET of today is a far cry from that of 1970 it is still an FET.  Transistors in modem integrated circuits are used as current switches not unlike the electromechanical relays used by Konrad Zuse in the 1930s.  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) roadmap calls for continued dependence on FETs until the year 2010, but after that time the path is unclear.  To achieve ever higher integration levels will require an approach that avoids the undesirable effects that appear in very small FETs.  One possible path for the industry is a switch to a paradigm based on nanostractures rather than FETs. In nanostructures, the device performance typically improves as the size decreases.  Operating temperature is perhaps the greatest obstacle to the adoption of nanostructures.  Most nanostructure function only at temperatures near that of liquid helium.  A second obstacle is the need for new circuit architecture, since nanostructures make poor transistors.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to address both of these obstacles.  A novel fabrication technique based on AFM oxidation is proposed, to produce nanostructure devices with an operating temperature in the range of 20 to 77K.  In this process a metal film is patterned by anodic oxidation, controlled by the AFM, and then reacted with the underlying silicon layer to form a silicide.  The silicide undercuts the oxide line from each side, narrowing the line and in effect increasing the resolution of the patterning.  This process will produce nanostructures with narrower tunnel barriers than are possible using conventional AFM oxidation.  Narrower barriers give a lower junction resistance and increased device speed.\r\n\r\nThe new process will be used to fabricate quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) cells.  QCA is an architecture which builds upon the strengths of nanostructures, using them to store charge rather than to switch currents.  In the QCA paradigm information is encoded by the positions of electrons in a cluster of quantum dots forming cell.  The state of a QCA cell is determined by the state of its neighboring cells through the Coulomb interaction, and proper arrangements of cells can implement any logic function.  Previous experiments have demonstrated the operation of a basic QCA cell, a line of cells, and an AND/OR gate.  Application of the new AFM silicide process will make it possible to demonstrate larger arrays of QCA cells operating at higher temperatures.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
