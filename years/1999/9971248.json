 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971248\r\n\r\nAlthough typically appealing to different groups of researchers, the areas of queueing networks and interacting particle systems both deal with large systems of objects, such as customers or particles, which are connected together by some interaction rule.  The techniques that are applicable to the two areas are often related.  Professor Bramson intends to study stability questions and the behavior under diffusive scaling for the first class of models; the use of fluid models is an important tool in such analysis.  The second class includes models such as the voter model, and two-type particle systems with the annihilation and creation of mass. The equilibria and the limiting concentrations are the objects of investigation for such models.\r\n\r\nQueueing networks and interacting particle systems are two subjects within the field of probability theory.  The goal in both areas is to understand the long-term behavior of large systems of objects, such as customers or particles, for which there is randomness in the system.  Here, \"customers\" need not denote just individuals, but also products or some task to be performed, such as in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers.  In queueing theory, one analyzes the efficiency and stability of such systems.  The proposal concentrates on the latter topic, and on the statistical fluctuations that are inherent in such systems.  In interacting particle systems, one studies complex random systems that occur in the context of physics, chemistry and biology, whose components represent, for example, particles, cells, or various organisms.  For instance, one studies models for the outcome of a chemical reaction, or the genetic diversity of a population.  The proposal investigates the nature of the long-term equilibria of such systems.\r\n",
