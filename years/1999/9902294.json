This research investigates the origins and ecological significance of polyploidy in the native wildflower Achillea millefolium.  A combination of laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments will examine (1) the frequency and causes of polyploid formation, (2) the effects of chromosome number on ecological characteristics and reproductive success in different environments, and (3) the role of polyploidy in creating and maintaining ecological and genetic diversity.  A novel aspect of the research is the use of first-generation \"neopolyploids\" to distinguish the effects of ploidy per se from other genetic factors.\r\n\r\nPolyploids are common in nature, and often occupy unique ecological niches.  Most weeds and crop plants are polyploid.  In spite of their importance, the origins of polyploids are poorly known, as are the reasons for their ecological success and economic importance.  This study addresses these issues in a native wildflower, but is also relevant to other organisms.  Recent data from DNA sequencing projects suggest that many animals, including humans, are cryptic polyploids possessing three or four copies of each gene scattered through the genome.  Thus, polyploid research may provide insight into the genetic systems of a wide array of higher organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
