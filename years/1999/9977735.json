 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977735\r\nKumosa\r\nThis project supports the acquisition of the high temperature axial and torsional mechanical strength testing for research involving the disciplines of mechanical engineering, physics, material science, and electrical engineering. The equipment will be used to determine the reliability of composites and compacted materials, identify failure modes, and testing orthopedic implants and characterization of structured composite materials will be studied using the axial and torsional mechanical strength testing system. The axial horsional lost unit to be acquired will include a temperature-controlled sample chamber (-2000F to 10000F), designed such that the grips on the component under test as well as the component will be at temperature. This capability will be used to develop accelerated aging tests, increasing the throughput of components on this system. The capability for axial and torsional stress will enable accurate testing of components, such as high-tension composite insulators, orthopedic implants and various designs using compacted materials where failures under torsional loads are also of importance. The instrument will also be used to support research in the following areas: the analysis of composites, compacted materials, and biomechanical implants under various thermal, mechanical, and environmental conditions, and the evaluation of noninvasive monitoring techniques, such as the use diffracting particles as strain sensor in composites for in-situ measurements of the integrity of components under thermal, mechanical, and/or environmental stresses. The experimental data collected will be used as analytical models that have been developed are refined to enable accurate simulation of the new composite and compacted materials designs. This is an equipment grant supported under the MRI Program.***    \r\n",
