Such environments are ubiquitous, since economic agents are often in the position to increase their information.  Bidders for an oil tract can invest in seismic and geological information before the auction. In courts of law, jurors must learn whether a defendant is innocent or guilty before deliberating. Finally, the buyer of a car may want more information about its quality. To understand these situations, it is important to recog-nize that the agents' information structure is determined endogenously, as part of the optimization problem the agents solve. Then, different mechanisms will induce different information structures, and the mechanism designer will want to adjust the mechanism to influence the information structure achieved at equilibrium. For instance, the car buyer will invest less in information gathering if the contract includes a warranty. Jurors may be more attentive to the evidence if unanimity, rather than simple majority, is required to convict. Finally, bidders in an auction may be less worried about the profitability of an oil tract if their payment is a share of the revenues generated by the tract. It may be misleading to analyze these mechanisms fixing the information structure, which is what most of the mechanism design literature does. This project studies how mechanism should be designed to cope with endogenous information structures. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the project studies situations where the mechanism designer can manipulate the agents' information structure directly, by publicly revealing information, e.g., interim evaluations. Examples are promotions in the workplace, and midterms for college students. Do employees work harder if they have an idea of who among them is more likely to be promoted? Do college students study more because of midterms? These are important questions given how common these arrangements are. The answer adds to our understanding of how contracts are designed to deal with information. \r\n",
