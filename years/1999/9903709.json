 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a sensory suite that is capable of long-term monitoring of groundwater and aquaculture systems, using a newly-developed technology that replaces conventional membrane technology. One of the largest problems facing field biologists and aquaculturists is the inability to prevent \"fish kills\".  Potential causes for these kills include ground water contamination from domestic wastes, industrial effluents, or large rain events, all of which dissolve oxygen (DO), the primary gas necessary for life in aquatic organisms. Given continuous monitoring, biologists could be alerted to low DO concentrations, or factors effecting DO, and thus potentially prevent a kill. However, continuous monitoring by personnel is not practical because of staffing and equipment constraints.  Instruments currently available to measure DO fail in that they utilize a membrane that rapidly fouls and must be replaced to maintain accurate readings.  \r\n         This technology could be used to continuously monitor: (1) aquaculture production, (2) water quality for endangered species, (3) water quality above and below factory effluent points, (4) water quality in remote areas that are inaccessible for daily/weekly/monthly sampling, and (5) compliance with EPA guidelines.  Additionally, fully developed applications of this technology could be used to control/regulate discharge (1) at wastewater treatment facilities, (2) at factories and processing plants, (3) on farms, and (4) at power plant cooling water discharge points.\r\n",
