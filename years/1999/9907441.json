The urgent need to preserve and translate the Alaska Native languages derives from a number of problems in the social and natural sciences, as well as educational, political, and economic problems caused by powerful forces that are shaping events in the Arctic at the turn of the millennium. This project will develop a succinct statement of the most important needs in translation and preservation of the Native Languages and what role computational linguistics can play in addressing these problems. This project will support a workshop involving parties interested in this problem. The workshop is planned for May 19-22, 1999 at the new International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The workshop has been preceded by organizational and steering committee activities. Following the workshop a report will be produced and disseminated. This project is jointly supported with a number of organizations in the State of Alaska. \r\n",
