In his work with Lu, he will attempt to generalize \r\ntheir previous theorem relating the new field of Poisson geometry to the classical 19th century problem of computing intersection multiplicities. \r\nIn particular, he hopes to find a Poisson structure to help compute quantum cohomology of the flag manifold. In his work with Grojnowski, he \r\nwill continue his study of multiplicities of restrictions of representations of real semisimple groups, with the goal of solving certain multiplicity \r\none problems. He will study characteristic cycles for nilpotent orbits and their relation to certain problems in representation theory.\r\n\r\nThe use of symmetry in the study of geometrical problems has been one of the great unifying themes of modern mathematics.  Ideas based \r\non considerations of symmetry have had a profound impact on elementary questions in arithmetic and on physics, especially to quantum \r\nmechanics. There are certain topological constructions which are analogous to the problem of counting points in a finite set. The investigator \r\nplans to apply these constructions to problems motivated by number theory and theoretical physics.\r\n",
