 "awd_abstract_narration": "When moving around in the world, we see what is called 'optic flow' of the visual world, giving information about our direction and speed of movement.  Signals from the neurons (nerve cells) in the retina of the eye are carried by the optic nerve to the brain.  One pathway called the accessory optic system (AOS) carries information about motion over the whole visual field to nerve centers called nuclei in the brainstem.  Within the retina there are many neurons that are directionally sensitive, being excited by a visual stimulus that moves in one direction, and inhibited by motion in the opposite direction.  It is not clear how these excitatory and inhibitory inputs are combined by the neurons in the central nuclei, except that the interactions are more complex than simply linear addition.  This project uses electrophysiological recordings from inside single cells in an unusual preparation of an entirely isolated turtle brain, to study interactions of directionally selective inputs responding to the same part of the visual world.  Pharmacological manipulations are used to clarify the separate functions of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and better understand the membrane properties underlying the sensory integration.\r\n   Results will be critical for understanding the fundamental importance of visual signals in controlling stable eye position, posture, and locomotion in the real world, and the impact will extend beyond visual neuroscience to understanding functional integrative mechanisms at the cellular level in the brain.  The project provides excellent training for a graduate student.\r\n\r\n",
