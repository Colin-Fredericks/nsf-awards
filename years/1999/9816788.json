 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transmembrane channels are involved in many cellular processes, such as transport of metabolites, proteins and transcription factors through biological membranes.  It is evident that the ability of large channels to permeate small ions does not necessarily reflect their ability to allow larger ions or macromolecules to cross the membrane.  However, the same basic electrophysiological techniques, initially developed for studies of ion-selective channels, are routinely applied to all groups of channels.  A new approach was developed that opens the possibility to monitor channel permeability for virtually any molecule.  The method allows measurement, at the single channel level, of the transport of relatively high molecular weight molecules such as metabolites and macromolecules in the presence of small permeant ions.  This is potentially a very general method and should be applicable to measuring the permeation of a wide-range of physiologically important solutes through a variety of different channels.  By using the mitochondrial channel, called VDAC, it is intended to show that while the channels with large pores are poorly selective for small ions, they may show high selectivity for the larger molecules they evolved to transport.  The new approach will be used to measure the partitioning of metabolites into the channel and their mobility within the channel. This is achieved by analyzing the change in average current and current noise produced when these metabolites now through a single channel and thus obstruct the passage of the smaller ions. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that VDAC selects among metabolites based on their 3-dimensional structure, not merely size and charge.  ATP permeates the pore, but a glutamate tetrapeptide with similar size and charge does not.  The nature of this selectivity will be examined by using other molecules whose physical properties resemble those of ATP. In addition, the importance of charge distribution within the pore that favors ATP permeation over other molecules will be verified.  A panel of site-directed mutants will be used.  To explore the possibility that this selectivity is a conserved property, VDAC channels isolated from very different species will be analyzed.  Different VDAC isoforms within the same organism will be examined to determine whether they exhibit different selectivity patterns reflecting their specialized functions.  Furthermore, apocytochrome c permeation will be studied in order to determine whether small proteins might be able to go through VDAC.  If successful, this work will gain needed insight into the transport characteristics of large channels to develop ideas about their metabolite selectivity.\r\n\r\nThe ability of living organisms and individual cells to compartmentalize is critical to life.  This compartmentation allows each region to maintain an environment especially tuned to the function it serves.  Proteins called channels aid in this compartmentation by allowing selected molecules and ions to cross the barriers between the compartments, the membranes.  This project explores the hypothesis that channels that allow the passage of large molecules do so in a highly selective way.  This differs from the current presumption that these larger pathways are nonselective.  The research can be pursued thanks to the development of a new method to both detect and quantitate the passage of larger molecules through the pathways formed by channels.  The interference of the flow of small ions by the larger molecules is measured. If successful, this research will change the way we think about the role of large channels in the lives of cells.\r\n\r\n",
