 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a collaborative effort with Georgia Institute of Technolog.  This grant provides funding for the development and evaluation of new statistical methods to be used to monitor and improve manufacturing processes. These methods are to be applied in situations for which quality depends on several related quality measurements. The research involves both off-line and on-line methods. The off-line methods require the design of experiments and the most informative and efficient analysis of the resulting data. Emphasis is on the robust design of processes and products so that their performance is less sensitive to hard-to-control noise factors, such as environmental conditions during and after production.  Robust design improves product quality, manufacturability, and reliability. The on-line methods use data collected over time to detect changes in the process for which action is required. The use of multivariate outputs results in more reliable decisions about the process. Also, the methods developed will apply in cases for which the usual assumptions, such as multivariate normality, are not valid. Attribute data, for example, will be considered.\r\n      The results of this research will lead to new statistical methods for improving design of products and manufacturing processes. It will also lead to more reliable methods for monitoring the quality of processes over time to detect important process changes. This will make quality improvement activities more effective in the design, development, and  production stages of manufacturing.\r\n",
