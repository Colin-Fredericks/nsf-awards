 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourteenth International Conference on Banach Algebras will\r\nbe held at Pomona College in Claremont, California, from July 25\r\nthrough August 7, 1999.  This series of conferences emphasizes both\r\nBanach algebras and their connections with other areas of analysis.\r\nThe title of this conference is \"Banach Algebras and Operators on\r\nBanach Spaces\".  The formal conference program will involve about\r\nsixty talks on the general theory of Banach algebras, on concrete\r\nBanach algebras, and on related areas of analysis.  Some areas\r\nthat will be emphasized in the talks include automatic continuity,\r\namenability and Banach homology, structure of Banach algebras,\r\nspectral theories and operator theory, group algebras and other\r\nconvolution algebras, and complex analytic methods.\r\n\r\nOne of the great accomplishments of modern mathematics is abstraction.\r\nMuch like the way elementary algebra generalizes arithmetic, abstraction\r\ngives mathematicians the power to solve not only individual problems,\r\nbut entire classes of problems.  One of the most important twentieth-\r\ncentury examples is the field called functional analysis.  Functional\r\nanalysis uses new abstract techniques to treat problems that had been\r\nstudied for more than two hundred years by what we now call classical\r\nanalysis, which is the collection of methods that grew out of the calculus.\r\nFunctional analysis, instead of concentrating on individual functions,\r\nstudies spaces of functions and abstractions of such spaces. Not only\r\ncould new problems and previously intractable old problems be solved by\r\ncombining the new and old methods, but the new structures of functional\r\nanalysis also provided a new language which was needed to express many of\r\nthe results of modern physics and, later, of other areas of science and\r\nof economics.  The spaces considered by functional analysis all have some\r\nsort of operation of addition, but many of the most important spaces have\r\nother operations as well.  In particular, Banach algebras and related\r\nareas involve the very large and important collection of problems and\r\nstructures which have some sort of multiplication as well as the usual\r\naddition.  By the 1960s, Banach  algebras, the subject of the conference, \r\nhad become a recognized field of mathematics.  Since 1974 the regular\r\ninternational conferences on Banach algebras have become an important\r\nway for researchers worldwide to keep abreast of the field, to initiate\r\nand continue research collaborations, and to exchange ideas with researchers\r\nin related areas.\r\n",
