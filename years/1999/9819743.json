The US organizer is Dr. Marleigh Sheaff, Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.  The co-organizer, and director of the school, is Dr. Nizamettin Erduran, Department of Physics at Istanbul University.  This will be the eighth in a series of schools/workshops organized by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).   There will be lecture courses in various state-of-the-art instrumentation techniques in current use in experimental particle physics.  These will be taught by recognized experts in the field.  There will be at least six \"hand-on\" laboratory courses designed to demonstrate the material presented.  The purpose of this activity is twofold.  The first goal is to encourage increased participation by young scientists from developing countries in elementary particle physics experiments by providing them with the information and skills needed to undertake detector development for these experiments.  The intention is to foster possible future initiatives in detector development at the participants' home institutions.  The instrumentation techniques that are presented have many wide-ranging applications such as in medical imaging and in non-destructive evaluation of materials.  The second goal is to encourage future collaborations in elementary particle physics involving physicists from developed and developing countries.  It is expected that approximately one third of the students in the School/Workshop will be from the Turkey and the region around it, another one third will be from other developing countries, and a third from technically advanced countries.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will support four scientists and six graduate students from the United States, and about the same number of junior scientists from the Middle East, Africa and from Nepal to participate in an international school and workshop.  They will benefit from the teaching of advanced experimental techniques and from the opportunities to develop international collaboration in areas of experimental physics, and in other applied fields where these experimental techniques have been useful.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest. \r\n",
