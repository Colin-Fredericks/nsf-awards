This transport is of interest from both fundamental and technological viewpoints. Of particular interest is a current geometry where the electron flow is perpendicular to the layers of the multilayers, versus in-plane current flow. The perpendicular current geometry was pioneered by this research group at the Michigan State University. By controlling magnetic order in the perpendicular geometry, the project will address four research topics: (1) Spin-memory-loss at the interfaces between two non-magnetic metals or within superconductors; (2) Wall resistances and dynamics of individual magnetic domains: Relation of scattering at interfaces to potential steps and interfacial alloying; and (4) Experimental realization of a predicted magnetic analog of the AC Josephson effect. The research involve state of the art instrumentation and training for graduate students and prepares them for a variety of careers in information storage technology, academe or government.\r\n%%%\r\nIn one decade, Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) in metallic magnetic multilayers has moved from a laboratory discovery to practical application in commercial devices such as hard disk drives found in computers. Further progress requires even larger magnetoresistance and even smaller detectors. A candidate for the next generation of detectors is GMR in multilayers measured with current flow perpendicular to the layers, a geometry pioneered by the group at Michigan State University. This geometry promises larger magnetoresistance in smaller samples. But both fundamental and practical issues still need to be resolved.  This proposal addresses several such issues in novel ways. The research program provides undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to carry out research using state of the art instrumentation which will prepare them for careers in research or technology, particularly information storage technology.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
