 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Joseph W. Bruno in the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University.  The seven participants, recruited nationally, will take part in a program entitled \"A Summer Research Program for Underrepresented Minorities.\"   The focus for the recruiting effort will center on the eleven historically black colleges and universities which sent representatives to the Wesleyan Conference on Recruitment of Minority Scientists in October of 1992.  Aside from their involvement in research projects involving organic, inorganic, biological and physical chemistry, participants will attend an orientation program, take part in a biweekly workshop on laboratory safety regulations and  receive training on the use of major research instrumentation.  Activities germane to preparation for graduate school include interactions with Wesleyan minority graduate students and participation in the NSF-sponsored Wesleyan Science Writing Program.  At the end of the summer the undergraduates will get the opportunity to present their research findings by poster and seminar presentations.\r\n",
