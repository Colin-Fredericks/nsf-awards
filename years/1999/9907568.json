The five-day workshop will bring together 60-80 scientists, students, and postdocs from the United States with counterparts from India, the Indian Ocean regions, and Europe.  The objectives are to: 1) conduct the first international assessment of the completeness and quality of observations and preliminary research results from the 1996-1999 Indian Ocean Experiment(INDOEX); 2) depending on assessments and early results, identify potentially important future environmental studies based on INDOEX and other environmental data sets; and 3) develop proposals for joint studies with the new US-India Center for Environmental Research in Delhi. On the Indian side this workshop is co-funded by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.  This workshop is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.           \r\n\r\nScope:  This workshop supports the evaluation of results from INDOEX, a US initiated project of major importance that addresses fundamental issues concerning the environment and climate change.  In addition to scientific relevance, the results are important for policy makers actively seeking practical solutions to regional and global environmental issues.  This activity is consistent with the INT objective to support participation of US post-docs and graduate students in international research.  It will also play an important role in initiating new collaborations with the recently created US-India Center for Environmental Research.          \r\n\r\n",
