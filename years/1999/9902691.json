 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the transport of stratospheric ozone at polar latitudes in the northern hemisphere by collecting and analyzing data from the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR), situated in the Norwegian Arctic.  This site is ideally situated to observe the northern hemisphere polar vortex and vortex edge dynamics, as well as the associated ozone depletion phenomena. The Rayleigh-Mie-Raman lidar system at ALOMAR is capable of measuring stratospheric temperatures. The associated Doppler Wind and Temperature System measures horizontal and vertical wind velocities. The collocated stratospheric differential absorption lidar measures ozone and polar stratospheric clouds. Coordinated measurements using all these instruments will be carried out during the winter of 1999/2OOO in close coordination with the NASA-supported SOLVE (SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment) project, which will provide complementary data from aircraft and balloons.\r\n\r\nThe modeling component of the project will investigate the transport of stratospheric ozone in polar regions using the data obtained through this award and as input for a mesoscale Lagrangian transport model.  Of particular interest is the role of mesoscale dynamical processes, such as atmospheric gravity waves, in the evolution of arctic polar vortex winds and their role in redistributing ozone.\r\n",
