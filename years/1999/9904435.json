 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtubules (MTs) are long, slender polymers made up  of the protein, tubulin, that play critical roles in the life of the cell.  They are the key functional components of two extremely important subcellular structures that are involved in cellular motility phenomena:  mitotic spindles, which are responsible for the orderly movement of chromosomes to the opposite ends of a cell just before the cell divides into two daughter cells; and cell surface appendages known as cilia or flagella, which beat in an orderly wave-like fashion and thereby move the watery environment of the cell across the cell surface, resulting in either whole cell movement (swimming) or water turbulence around the surface of the cell.  These MT-containing structures are complex, and are generally associated with complex MT-containing subcellular structures, termed either centrioles, in the case of the spindles, or basal bodies, in the case of cilia or flagella.   \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on increasing our understanding of basal body formation. Basal bodies are cylindrical organelles that reside at the base of a cilium or flagellum, and are comprised of 9 triplet microtubules held together by a series of proteinaceous spokes, links and plates. They are structurally similar to centrioles and they usually form in close proximity to centrioles in an elaborate assembly process. The details of this basal body assembly and the components present in these organelles have been under investigation at various times through the last century, but the process is still not well understood.  In this project, the unique biological properties of an unconventional model organism, the water fern Marsilea vestita, will be exploited to expand our understanding of basal body formation.  Specifically, Dr. Wolniak will study the role played by two proteins, centrin and Xgrip109, in forming the basal body precursor structure, the blepharoplast, in spermatocytes of M. vestita. In lower plant spermatocytes, basal bodies arise in the absence of any preexisting centrioles, so the synthesis, assembly and maturation processes occur without the background presence of related centriolar structures. The synchronous activation of male gametophytes of M. vestita permits time course studies on blepharoplast formation in large populations of developing spermatocytes or spermatids. In preliminary work, Dr. Wolniak has found that the rate and extent of spermiogenesis appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally, that is, it is dependent on the synthesis of certain new proteins that are translated from mRNAs that were stored in the dry microspore. Centrin is one of the proteins translated from stored mRNA midway through the developmental process, and its abundance increases just as the blepharoplast forms. Immunolocalizations with anticentrin antibody show an intense localization in fixed cells at a discrete spot at the time that the blepharoplasts assemble. Xgrip109 abundance on immunoblots increases in a fashion similar to those observed for centrin. In contrast to centrin and Xgrip109, the tubulins are abundant as stored protein in the dry spore and there is no change in tubulin abundance until late in development. From these preliminary observations, it is hypothesized that some of the newly translated proteins appear to control the rate, organization and extent of assembly of the blepharoplast. Newly assembled structures containing regulatory proteins like centrin and Xgrip109 then serve as cores or templates for the addition of the tubulins and other stored proteins that are already present in the gametophyte. Thus, the newly-made proteins appear to be rate-limiting for spermiogenesis. \r\n\r\nA series of antisense experiments will be performed that are aimed at determining whether centrin translation is necessary for blepharoplast formation. Preliminary experiments show the efficacy of an antisense approach, but reveal that dsRNA and certain sense centrin constructs also slow or block development.  An important part of the work during the period of funding will be directed toward understanding the differences in development that result from each of these treatments. In addition, Dr. Wolniak will study the linkage between cell divisions in the gametophyte, the activation of translation of stored mRNAs and the formation of the blepharoplast. Three ways to block mitosis in this organism have been found, and these will be used to study centrin and Xgrip109 protein accumulation in the one-celled gametophyte over time after imbibition.  Extended time course experiments will be performed to determine whether the accumulated centrin and Xgrip109 have the capacity to aggregate into blepharoplast-like particles in the absence of cytoplasmic partitioning between spermatogenous and sterile cells of the gametophyte.  This work is expected to establish the feasibility of using Marsilea vestita as a model for basal body development.\r\n",
