 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nImplicit modeling approaches to fault detection, which are based on multivariate statistical methods, have attracted great interest in chemical and process engineering.  Principal component analysis (PCA) has been successfully applied to model the normal process behavior.  PCA can significantly reduce the dimension of the model for large-scale systems with correlated process variables.  Unusual events are then detected by referencing the observed process variables against this model.  However, PCA does not specifically address the important issue of fault isolation.  One of the PI's of this proposal has extensive experience with the development and application of PCA techniques.\r\n\r\nAnalytical redundancy methods rely on explicit models of the monitored plant.  Based on the model, consistency (parity) relations are derived which return residuals indicative of faults.  The parity relations may be so designed ('structured') that their residuals follow clear patterns in response to various faults, thus facilitating fault isolation.  While parity relations were developed for linear systems, most results are applicable to a broad class of nonlinear systems as well.  One of the Pi's has played a substantial role in parity equation research and successfully applied this method to car engine diagnosis.\r\n\r\nTo explore the above idea, the PI's submitted a proposal previously.  The proposal was funded at a reduced level, with the stipulation that the feasibility of the approach had to be first demonstrated, with special focus on nonlinear systems, before more substantial funding could be made available.  In the present proposal, we report the results of the first year of investigations which, in our view, proof the viability of the approach.  We also outline our plans for the continuation of the work.  The first-year effort has brought two major results, both documented in several research publications.\r\n\r\nBased on the very encouraging results, we propose to continue the research of structured PCA, along the following lines:\r\n1. Further studies of the polynomial nonlinear modeling approach, including a search technique for the best structured polynomial model set and a study of the non-uniqueness of partial models with insufficient degree.\r\n2. The extension of structured PCA to discrete dynamic system models.\r\n3.  Generalized likelihood ratio testing of PCA residuals utilizing their directional properties.\r\n4.  The generation of structured and directional residual sets, both in the PCA and in the parity relation framework, which are optimal for some information criteria.\r\nThe above activities will be supported with extensive simulation, both on the Tennessee Eastman simulator and on the simulation of a larger vinyl acetate process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
