 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in computing technology are making simulation as important to science today as theory and experiment have been in the past. Unfortunately this success is overwhelming the scientific community by drowning scientists in the data produced. Because of storage, network, and graphics bottlenecks, more data is produced than can be analyzed or visualized. Valuable information is being lost or neglected because of these deficiencies. Additionally, scientists are painfully aware of this technological bottleneck, and it affects how they conduct their science. It slows the rate of data acquisition, and calculations that could generate higher-dimensional data, e.g. vector and tensor, are not being performed. The goal of this project is to address the visualization bottleneck by developing multiresolution software tools that will facilitate understanding of large-scale experimental and simulation datasets. The project will then apply these new techniques to data from physics and biology, thus providing advances in fluid dynamics and neuroscience. We will do this by close interactions with the discipline scientists, including using their feedback to improve initial designs of our tools.\r\n\r\nThe technical approach of the project is based on the fact that the graphics workstations available to most scientists are incapable of visualizing giga- and tera-scale datasets. It is also clear that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate data will outpace our ability to render and visualize it. Therefore we must develop methods for representing, segmenting and compressing these enormous datasets into a form that can be processed on today's graphics computers. Multiresolution representations and algorithms are at the core of the methods and tools to be developed. A multiresolution approach allows visualization techniques to scale to enormous datasets by focusing resources in those regions of the dataset most important to the user. For example, multiresolution modeling and display techniques will allow a user to view a single dataset at a coarse level-of--detail, and easily provide pertinent details only in those regions of greatest interest. During analysis, multiresolution methods can allocate more computational resources in segments of the data with the greatest rates of change or containing specific properties. This project will produce a set of multiresolution software tools for processing and visualizing large-scale N-dimensional (scalar, vector and tensor) volumetric datasets (NDVDs), as well as large-scale triangle meshes. Specifically, tools for segmenting and interpolating NDVDs using level-set methods, extracting semi-regular meshes directly from volume datasets, compressing triangle meshes, and volume rendering NDVDs will be developed. As tools become available they will be deployed to scientists at Caltech's Center for Simulation of Dynamic Response of Materials (sponsored by DOE), and to scientists at the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (UC San Diego).\r\n",
