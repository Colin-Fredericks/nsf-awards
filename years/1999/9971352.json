Is the class of finite algebras\r\npossessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the\r\nclass of finite algebras generating a residually large variety\r\nrecursively enumerable?  Additionally, he will work toward a complete\r\ndetermination of all finitely generated varieties that possess\r\ndefinable principal congruences.  Farley is working productively on a\r\nlarge variety of problems in duality theory and combinatorics of\r\nordered sets.  Most significant is the conjecture that all perfect\r\nsequences of a chain-complete ordered set converge to the same\r\n``core,'' up to isomorphism, and, closely related, the conjecture that\r\nthe fixed-point property is preserved under direct products of\r\n(unrestricted) ordered sets.  Farley and McKenzie will attempt to\r\nprove Birkhoff's cancellation conjecture for exponents of finite\r\nordered sets in the case where the exponent is dismantlable.\r\n     I.  Universal algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with\r\nthe unknown.  The old adage, that if it looks like an orange, smells\r\nlike an orange, and tastes like an orange, then it IS an orange, does\r\nnot apply.  One can have a collection of objects about which all we\r\nknow is that one can add and multiply them like numbers, and that the\r\n``usual'' rules apply --- for instance, x+y always equals y+x --- but\r\nstill not be dealing with numbers.  Given a particular mathematical\r\nsystem, call it A, there will be a whole variety of mathematical\r\nsystems that satisfy the same algebraic rules.  McKenzie will examine\r\nwhat one can say about this variety of systems if one just knows about\r\nA.  II.  The theory of ordered sets is a branch of mathematics that\r\ndeals with, well, order: If one has a collection of objects, and it\r\nmakes sense to ask, ``Is object P bigger than object Q?'' then one has\r\nan ordered set.  For instance, the collection N of natural numbers\r\n(1,2,3,4,...) is an ordered set.  Ordered sets can be added and\r\nmultiplied like numbers --- N*N is the collection of pairs of points\r\n(a,b) where a and b are natural numbers.  A natural question to ask\r\nis: If P and Q are ordered sets with a particular property, does P*Q\r\nhave this property?  Farley will address this question when the\r\nproperty is the \"fixed point property\"; this is a difficult\r\nlong-standing problem.  Farley and McKenzie will also attempt to solve\r\na problem dealing with the exponentiation of ordered sets, a problem\r\nover 50 years old.\r\n***\r\n",
