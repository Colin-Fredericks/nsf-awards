Recent work has shown that the three-dimensional boron network in the cubic hexaboride materials provides what can be described as a robust and electronically inert background that is little perturbed by atomic substitutions for metal atoms in these materials.  In the present research the development of the dense Kondo lattice, the evolution of the Kondo insulator and the heretofore inaccessible ferromagnetism of the dilute free electron gas will be investigated.  The unexpected occurence of the this clean host lattice for experiments in strongly correlated materials gives confidence that other such host lattices can be found.  An important part of this research effort is the search for new materials with similar properties.  This research will involve graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who will be trained in an important area of condensed matter physics and materials science. \r\n%%%\r\nAn important goal of materials research is the design of new materials with specified properties which would be suitable for the advance of current as well as the discovery of new technology.  Towards this end, this research seeks to gain the understanding that will the prediction what properties a given arrangement of certain atoms will have.  The interesting materials contain in general combinations of what we can call active atoms whose properties depend sensitively on the environment they are in, in conjunction with atoms whose properties are much less sensitive.  In particular, many unusual properties and ones useful technologically are found in materials with active atoms that straddle the boundary separating magnetic from non-magnetic behavior.  A class of inter-metallic compounds called hexaborides has been found to provide an unusually clean host lattice for studying the interaction effects between the active atoms and their environments.  The study of these hexaboride systems will suggest directions for further research for the discovery of new and similar materials with equally unusual properties.  This research project is eminently suited for the training of the next generation of condensed matter physicists and materials scientists for employment in forefront areas of technology during the 21st Century.\r\n***\r\n",
