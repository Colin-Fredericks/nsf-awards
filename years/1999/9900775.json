 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for gravitational waves requires detectors that are not overwhelmed by noise sources that can mask gravitational wave signals.  Thermal noise is one of the worst offenders.  The research program proposed by Saulson and his group at Syracuse University is directed toward understanding the sources of thermal noise that effect gravitational wave detectors and to devise methods to reduce the effects of these sources.\r\nThe key to reducing thermal noise generated by interferometer optics and test mass, and their suspension systems, is to design systems that minimize mechanical energy dissipation.  The Syracuse group will develop a means for measuring the transverse vibrations of LIGO optics suspension wires, and will make high sensitivity measurements of mechanical dissipation rates of several materials, including fused silica and sapphire, to determine their relative merits for use as interferometer optics and test masses.  They will also measure energy dissipation in a variety of mirror coating materials that have been proposed for LIGO optics and will explore the possibility of cooling these mirrors to further reduce thermal noise.\r\n",
