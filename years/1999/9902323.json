 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of communication is a central theme in behavioral biology.\r\nHistorically, research has focused on social interactions as the selective\r\nforce for the evolution of communication, however interactions with members\r\nof other species can also be a selective force in the evolution of signals.\r\nThis project proposes to expand the PI's understanding of the evolution of\r\nsignals by investigating the function and the quality of the signals\r\nperformed by three species of Anolis lizards during predator-prey\r\ninteractions under natural conditions.  Possibilities include that they are\r\neither trying to misdirect the predators' attention or trying to deter the\r\npredators' attack.  Particularly interesting is the observation that\r\ndifferences among species in the use of conspicuous signals against\r\npredators may be correlated with differences among species in physiological\r\ncapacity.  These questions will be addressed by combining observations of\r\nthe lizards' responses to predators with laboratory measures of lizards'\r\nphysiological capacity.\r\n\r\n\tA major controversy regarding the evolution of signals, including those\r\nused by the prey during predator-prey interactions, is the nature of the\r\nmessage encoded in the signals.  Is the prey notifying the predator that it\r\nhas been detected, or is it producing more specific information about its\r\nescape abilities?  Surprisingly, no empirical data have addressed this\r\ncontroversy.  The results of this project promise to add to our\r\nunderstanding of the evolution and quality of signals performed during\r\npredator-prey interactions.  Furthermore, because the signals that are used\r\nduring predation episodes are also used socially, these results can also\r\nhelp us to understand the evolution and quality of signals that are used\r\nduring social interactions. \r\n",
