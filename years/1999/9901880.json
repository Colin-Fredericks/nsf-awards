 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim of this SBIR Phase II project from Genex Technologies, Inc. (GTI) is the investigation of the feasibility of building, for the first time, an automatic 3D Face ID system with sophisticated 3D face matching capability using a novel 3D camera.  The key components of the 3D Face ID system include:   (1)A novel 3D camera that is capable of acquiring both 2D and 3D facial images in real-time; (2) Software based on an efficient 3D face identification algorithm; (3) 2D and 3D facial image database; and (4) A user-interface.  The human face is a three-dimensional (3D) geometric object, and each face has its unique 3D surface profile.  No two faces are exactly the same in 3D representation; therefore 3D features and surface profiles on a human face can be used for rapid and accurate face identification (face-ID).  Because of the lack of low-cost 3D imaging devices and effective 3D face-ID algorithms, almost all existing face-ID systems use only 2D gray-scale face images as their input.  The 2D images are inherently vulnerable to changes in the light condition and the face orientation, because they cannot preserve the 3D geometric structure of a face.  This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of current face-ID systems to effectively perform face recognition functions.  As a result, the match-rate for existing face-ID systems in real-world applications is very low (below 90%).  However, with a 3D camera--an electronic 3D imaging device-- that is able to produce a digital 3D profile measurement of the human face in one snap shot, the 3D facial images that are available in GTI's system provide accurate geometric information enabling much more accurate and efficient face identification.\r\n     The commercial market for such a 3D camera as a component of, as well as apart from, automatic face identification systems is sizable, and applications are numerous, including in both military and civilian areas.  Security and ATM machines can use Face-ID to verify the identity of bankcard user, saving millions of dollars in false claims of cardholdership.  Computer access control can use the Face-ID system instead of a password to grant authority for computer usage.   Law enforcement agents can use the Face-ID system to preselect and capture fugitives based on their images.  Military can use the Face-ID system to control  access to restricted areas.  Valuable properties such as cars or boats could use the 3D Face-ID system to identify their owners.  Low cost 3D cameras can also be used for many other applications, such as manufactured parts inspection, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.  The rapid advances in video-conferencing and interactive television further broaden possible applications of 3D imaging technologies.",
