This project will focus on several sites where ideological processes are evident and play a role in different types of language choice. It will examine connections between institutional, state, and popular discourses about language and social difference and more micro-level interactions such as everyday conversation, and patterns of speakers' code-switching and register choices (e.g., between the standard and the local language). In order to collect data to analyze language varieties used in Bergamo (local 'dialects', regional varieties such as 'Lombardo', national 'standards') and to reveal how these are systematically associated with different context-specific registers and topic-specific genres, this study will integrate participant-observation, social network analysis, open-ended interviews, and tape-recording, transcription, and analysis of speech activities across a range of settings.\r\nThis project will yield understandings of how speakers in Bergamo use language as a resource with which to enact, comment upon, and construct their sociocultural landscape. More broadly, it will contribute to the growing literature on language ideology, and to understandings of the ideological dimensions of language use. It will also offer new insights on the complex sociolinguistic processes of code switching, as well as into how these microlevel interactions articulate with macrolevel sociopolitical discourses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
