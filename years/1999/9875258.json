Edison\r\nProposal # 9875258\r\nUniversity of Florida\r\n\r\nThe human brain has over 10 billion neurons, which are connected to produce an extremely complex anatomy. Adding greatly to this complexity are a large number of small and very potent chemicals. The distribution and total number of the neurochemicals is not yet known, and the functions of the major chemicals are only now being discovered. One of the largest groups of nervous system signaling molecules are peptides. The largest group of these peptides-with several hundred different sequences that are found in all animals-are called FMRFamide-like peptides or FLPs. The name \"FMRFamide\" is from the amino acids that make up the peptide. FLPs have a wide range of functions, including such things as modulation of the actions of opiates in mammals, various cardiovascular effects in mollusks and mammals, and both contraction and relaxation of muscle in roundworms.\r\n\r\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular biology, protein chemistry, and computational techniques will be used to study the structures of FLPs under a variety of conditions. These studies are in parallel with colleagues studying the functions of the same peptides. Through the combined efforts more will learned about the structural and functional basis of the large numbers of these nervous system peptides, including how they interact with receptors, how they are produced in the cell, and how groups of related peptides create different signals.\r\n\r\nThe educational plan is to utilize the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory as an educational resource. This will increase the use of this specialized instrumentation and training of scientists in its use. A short course on biological NMR and created a website is available and expansion of this course and website is planned.\r\n",
