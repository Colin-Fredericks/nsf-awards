Arginines L135 and M164, Tyr L164, and Glu M173 will be replaced by residues that are neutral or have an opposite charge, and the effects on spectroscopic properties, the midpoint redox potential of P, and the charge-separation kinetics will be measured.  Computer models will be used to predict the effects of the mutations and molecular-dynamics simulations will be used to study relaxations of the transient states created by electron transfer. The LH1 and LH2 antenna complexes from Rb. sphaeroides will be studied by both experimental and computational approaches. Excited antenna complexes undergo relaxations and loss of electronic coherence on the time scale 30-100 fs. The dynamics of these processes will be examined as functions of temperature by femtosecond pump-probe techniques and computer simulations.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to improve understanding of how photosynthetic organisms capture the energy of sunlight. The work focuses on pigment-protein complexes found in photosynthetic bacteria. Antenna complexes absorb light and transfer energy to reaction centers (RCs), where a series of electron-transfer reactions occur. The kinetics of electron transfer and other properties of the RCs will be measured in mutant bacteria with the aim of clarifying how interactions of the pigments with the protein affect the absorption spectrum and determine the rate, temperature dependence and specificity of electron transfer. Computer simulations will be used to select key amino acid residues for mutation and to relate the experimental results to the protein structures.  Fast relaxations and energy-transfer processes also will be measured in antenna complexes.\r\n\r\n",
