 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information retrieval has been viewed as an individual activity.  This project investigates information retrieval in collaborative situations.  It defines collaborative information retrieval (CIR) as any activity that collectively resolves an information problem taken by members of a work team, and investigates the manifestations of CIR in work settings.  Guided by a work-centered conceptual framework for the evaluation and design of information systems, the study follows three steps: (1) creating a model of CIR through field observations and analyses of information seeking behavior of four work teams; (2) validating and generalizing the model through a survey; and (3) examining technological developments and organizational changes that might enhance CIR.  As the first study of its kind, the project explains how information is acquired, shared and used in work situations.  As a result, (1) issues in knowledge management in organizations are addressed and (2) the development of technologies that support, facilitate, and enhance teamwork is guided.  On the theoretical side, the project extends an existing conceptual framework to include teamwork and thus, (1) creates a new analytical tool that informs other studies about CIR, and (2) enriches other conceptual constructs both in information retrieval and in collaborative work.\r\n\r\n",
