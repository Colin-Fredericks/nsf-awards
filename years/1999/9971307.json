 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to the development of new methodologies \r\nand models in the areas of mathematical control theory, stochastic\r\nanalysis, and financial mathematics for the purpose of solving complex\r\nproblems in financial decision making and financial engineering. It is\r\nexpected that this research will have the greatest impact on application\r\nof mathematics in the areas of optimal portfolio management and asset\r\nallocation, as well as in the area managing of credit risk. A fundamental\r\naspect of the research is the concept of risk sensitive stochastic control\r\ntheory for investment problems with an infinite planning horizon. This\r\nkind of optimization objective is appealing because stationary trading\r\nstrategies are likely to be optimal and thus there is good potential for\r\nbeing able to compute optimal solutions for meaningful, practical\r\nproblems. In addition, several classes of  finite planning horizon\r\nproblems can be reasonably well approximated by problems with an infinite\r\nplanning horizon. A second fundamental aspect of the proposed research is\r\nthe explicit consideration given to statistical estimation issues. Optimal\r\ncontrol methodologies are rarely used in the financial industry, largely\r\nbecause of statistical difficulties associated with the estimation of\r\nconstant drift coefficients in diffusion process models of individual\r\nsecurities. This research will serve to reduce the gap between theory and\r\npractice by developing optimization models that incorporate exogenous\r\nfactors. By explicitly modeling the dependence of the assets on factors,\r\nit will be possible to obtain more realistic models, to better understand\r\nthe statistical estimation difficulties, and to be in a position to apply\r\nadaptive control methods. In addition, the proposed research will advance\r\nour understanding of quantitative aspects of default credit risk,\r\nwhich is a vital element in financial decision making.\r\n\r\nManaging large sums of dollars of notional capital is as complex as\r\nmanaging global communication networks or as managing  global\r\nmanufacturing enterprises. Thus common sense, intuition and experience\r\nalone will typically not suffice to safely and efficiently manage\r\navailable financial instruments. This research is aimed at providing\r\nformal mathematical support for financial management. Although the\r\nresearch will require fundamental advances within the areas of\r\nmathematical control theory, stochastic analysis, and financial\r\nmathematics, it is anticipated that this research will lead to new and\r\npractical tools that eventually become widely used in the financial\r\nindustry in order to enhance its competitiveness and efficiency. This is\r\nparticularly important given the impact the U.S. financial industry has on\r\nthe global economy. The big emphasis will be placed in this research  on\r\nthe development of computer algorithms for solving large-scale problems so\r\nthat the effective use can be made of high-performance computing. \r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n",
