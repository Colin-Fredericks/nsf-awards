The HPLC will provide additional quantitative analytical capacity at the Center for research on endocrine disruption in health, disease and nutrition and nephrology due to environmentally active chemicals and their metabolites.  Specific studies will include analysis of production and synthesis of phytochemicals in soy and soy foods; estrogenic and antiestroegenic activity of flavonoids in normal and neoplastic human breast epithelial cells; metabolic activation of environmental hormones, mechanisms of endocrine disruption through molecular interactions with the human estrogen receptor and activation of estrogenic signaling; examination of the soy flavonoid genistein on reproductive health and hormonal status of pregnant primates and subsequent developmental effects on exposed offspring; short and long term evaluation of health benefits of soy rich diets in Type II diabetics.  The HPLC will also have an impact on the research opportunities on the undergraduate/graduate fasttrack program for identification and support of promising future minority scientists.\r\n",
