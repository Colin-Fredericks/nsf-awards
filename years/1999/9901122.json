 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for partial support of a conference on Phospholipase D (PLD), sponsored  by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), to be held in Vermont August 14-19,1999.  The core of speakers were selected on the basis of their \r\nongoing contributions to the knowledge of the genetics, structure, regulation and function of PLD.   One hour of each session will be reserved for brief presentations by post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. This conference will bring together participants from different disciplines who share a common interest in PLD.  No previous meeting has been devoted exclusively to PLD, and this conference will serve as a forum to assess the field.  With the recent cloning of multiple PLD isoforms and  the availability of new reagents and techniques, major advances in this area should occur.  Thus, the primary purpose of this meeting is to bring together a diverse group of investigators with various scientific backgrounds to share ideas, perspectives and techniques which will advance the field.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
