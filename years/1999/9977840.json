The conference builds on the success of the First Tennessee Conference on Biomedical Engineering (1998) with the goals being 1- to foster collaborative efforts among industrial, academic, and clinical institutions involved in biomedical engineering, and 2- to increase the awareness of biomedical engineering activities in the Tennessee Valley.\r\n\r\nThe meeting includes a session on the regional development of a biotechnology infrastructure and another on the Impact of High Technology on Health Care Delivery.  Also, other sessions are scheduled to provide undergraduate and graduate students with an overview of professional alternatives for biomedical engineers.\r\n\r\nInformation about the meeting has been disseminated by a printed conference announcement and a WEB page at URL <http://www.bme.vanderbilt.edu/tnbme2/>.  Results from the meeting will contribute to research program planning and the assessment of new technologies in health care.  Conference proceedings, including abstracts for poster sessions, are to be published.\r\n",
