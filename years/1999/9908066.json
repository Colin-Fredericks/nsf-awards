The workshop brings together a select group of 120 of the nation's outstanding engineering educators. Participants are women or minority engineering educators who essentially have been tenure track positions for less than five years, or are in the final phases of their Ph.D. program and actively pursuing tenure track academic positions. The participants are usually employed in teaching and /or research positions and are actively developing their own unique research programs in civil, mechanical, bioengineering and environmental engineering disciplines. The major goals of the workshop are to foster technical and intellectual exchange among Ph.D level underrepresented and minority engineers who work in these areas; to instill in its participants, the sense of a technical community in which they can thrive and to which they can contribute; and to increase participant awareness of research and funding opportunities. The workshop emphasizes an integration of research and education. A panel of university deans discusses perspectives on reasonable career expectations and demands, and includes an indepth discussion of issues related to tenure, teaching, research, publications, funding, outreach and a rewarding personal life along the career path of an engineering educator. All participants give a brief summary of their current research interest, thus increasing fellow participants' awareness of the diversity of related opportunities for involvement in civil, mechanical and bio-environmental engineering research areas. The workshop proceedings include research interest statements from each participant, the outcome assessments, and workshop recommendations. \r\n",
