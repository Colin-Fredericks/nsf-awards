 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a major growth and differentiation regulatory mechanism.  The Drosophila protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Corkscrew (Csw) is structurally complex and has been shown to play an essential role in the transduction of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) initiated signals.  Unlike other members of the RTK signaling cassette (e.g., Ras, MAPK) whose mechanisms of action are seemingly invariant, the molecular mechanism of Csw function differs depending upon the RTK under consideration.  In a screen for Csw binding proteins, DMRanBP7, a member of the importinB superfamily of nuclear import proteins, was found to interact with Csw.  The DmRanBP7 protein localizes in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus, and the nuclear staining pattern resembles that of activated MAPK.  Stimulation of cells promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of DmRanBP7 and, significantly, its association with MAPK.  Embryos carrying overlapping deficiencies, that delete DmRanBP7, exhibit dramatically reduced nuclear MAPK in tissues whose development is dependent upon EGF and FGF RTK signaling.  Significantly, MAPK nuclear staining can be rescued in these embryos when a wild type copy of DmRanBP7 is the nuclear import receptor that transports activated MAPK from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.  II.   The interaction between Csw and DmRanBP7 constitutes part of a mechanism whereby the import process can be regulated at the level of the activated receptor.  The experiments in Objective 1 will reveal the molecular mechanism by which nuclear import of MAPK is regulated at the level of the activated receptor.  Specifically the residues/domains required for the Csw:DmRanBP7 and DmRanBP7:MAPK interactions to occur will be identified and their significance determined by genetic and biochemical means.  The experiments in Objective 2 detail the developmental consequences of mutations in the DmRanBP7 gene.  The experiments in Objective 3 and 4 will explore interactions between DmRanBP7 mediates the nuclear import of other MAPK family members.  Specifically, these studies will resolve the molecular mechanism linking MAPK activation to its nuclear import, and more broadly, will contribute to an understanding of cellular growth processes in both normal and aberrant states.",
