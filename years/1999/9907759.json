These groups have distinctly different perspectives regarding science education and the implementation of systemic change.  The primary goal of this project is to improve communication and understanding between the aforementioned groups.  The specific objectives are to: 1. Develop a program to involve in-service and undergraduate pre-service teachers in meaningful earth systems research, which will improve their knowledge and understanding of scientific principles and practices; 2. Improve scientists understanding of the culture of K-12 education and appropriate pedagogy and classroom practices, which will enhance student learning at the University; 3. Employ relevant evaluation and assessment tools to improve the program, refine objectives and document the integration of the research and teaching process; 4. Disseminate information and data obtained from this project.  To accomplish these objectives, the primary activity of the proposed work will be to develop an eight-week earth systems research/education experience, which will become part of both the undergraduate and graduate secondary science education programs at UNL.  This experience will help develop \"scientific habits of the mind,\" \"reasoning from evidence\" and good \"scientific practice.\"  As a result, teachers will be more comfortable with the methods and processes of scientific inquiry so that they, in turn, can engage their students in investigating their environment.  Participating scientists will be introduced to the National Science Education Standards and related pedagogy.  Improving the scientists' knowledge of inquiry-based learning will provide new opportunities for students to apply scientific principles and practices.  Through the use of World-Wide-Web technology and scholarly publications, the experiences and results relate to this project will be shared with others.  A conceptual model will be developed for building bridges and linkages between science departments and K-12 teacher preparation programs.  Initially the model will be implemented at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln but can be refined for use in other teacher preparation programs.\r\n",
