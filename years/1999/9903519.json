It is a well-known fact that the electro-optical performance of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC) critically depends on the morphology and dispersion of liquid crystal domains.  The present proposal seeks basic understanding of the electro-optical performance of polymer dispersed liquid crystals via controlling the morphology of dispersed LX domains.  Emphasis has been placed on determination of the role of thermodynamic phase diagrams of LC/polymer mixtures on the final morphology including the LC dispersion and the emerging domain size.  Competition between the dynamics of phase separation and nematic ordering will be investigated as most polymer systems hardly attain an equilibrium state, particularly in the polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS).  This proposal covers the experimental and theoretical elucidation of (i) dynamics of phase transitions and critical phenomena in liquid crystals and side-chain liquid crystalline (or rigid-rod) polymers, (ii) effects of chain rigidity on dynamics of phase separation in binary nematics containing side-chain and main-chain liquid crystalline polymers, (iii) competition between the kinetics of mesophase ordering and dynamics of phase separation in smectic LC/polymer blends driven by either thermal quenching or chemical reactions and (iv) phase diagrams and phase separation dynamics of nanocomposites containing rigid rod polymers.  To demonstrate how the thermodynamic phase diagrams can guide the kinetic pathway for the emergence of LC domains, a kinetic model for mesophase ordering and phase separation in liquid crystal/polymer mixtures has been developed based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation (TGDL - Model C) involving coupling between the concentration and orientational order (liquid crystal ordering) parameters.  It is proposed to incorporate the Flory-Huggins (FH) theory for isotropic mixing and Maier-Saupe (MS) free energy functional for nematic ordering (or Maier-Saupe-McMillan (MSM) theory for smectic ordering) into the TDGL equation. The physical significance of all parameters pertaining  to the coupled TDGL - Model C equations will be clarified and their predictive capabilities will be demonstrated.  The dynamics of pattern formation will be analyzed in comparison with recent experimental observations.  Recognizing the possible control of domain morphology and improved understanding of mesogenic interactions, the proposed study will be extended to nano-composites.  If successful, the proposed theory would alleviate some of the problems such as the trial and error approach that leads to irreproducibility of the desired domain morphology and low yields in fabrication of PDLC films.\r\n\r\nDuring this decade we have witnessed an immense growth in liquid crystal based optical devices such as flat panel displays.  The demand for advanced organic and polymeric electro-optical materials is expected to increase in the new millenium.  This area of flat panel displays has been dominated by Far East countries, primarily Japan.  It is important that the United States maintains its competitive edge through the pioneering basic research in this ever-growing and promising technology.  The proposed experimental and theoretical works on liquid crystal/polymeric composites will contribute to the development of new optical devices crucial for US industries through basic scientific understanding.  Another important point is that all simulation programs have been written in Visual C++ to display the emergence of LC domain morphology in live-mode with the aid of an LCD projector.  Such interactive programs are useful for classroom teaching and thus should be highly beneficial in the training of future scientists and engineers in the US.  This new methodology of teaching is in line with the goal of the University of Akron in attaining Carnegie Teaching Academy status.\r\n",
