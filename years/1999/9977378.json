 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh will acquire a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer, a component of an In-Line Analytical and Automated Purification Instrumentation Facility.  This will allow the faculty to coordinate combinatorial synthesis and method development with the strict purification and routine high level NMR analysis that is important for quality control in organic chemistry.  Specific research topics include the preparation of smart materials from crystalline colloidal arrays polymerized in acrylamide hydrogels; development of new synthetic routes to natural products; mechanistic organic chemistry; discovery and optimization of biologically active small organic molecules; development and use of micro-reactors for solid phase organic synthesis; use of combinatorial synthesis strategies for development of polymetallic catalysts; development of artificial receptors for very selective extractions; new approaches to chemical product isolation and purification that exploit differences in solubilities between isomers; solid phase parallel synthesis of libraries of phosphatase inhibitors; fluorous phase parallel synthesis of libraries of phosphatase inhibitors; synthesis of libraries of alkene peptide isosteres; and synthesis and evaluation of new spacers for solid phase combinatorial chemistry.  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
