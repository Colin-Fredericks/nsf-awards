 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed work concerns the continued operation of the Polar Experiment Network for Upper-atmosphere Investigations (PENGUIn) in Antarctica.  The network consists of six automatic geophysical observatories located in the antarctic interior, that make measurements of ionospheric and magnetospheric processes that result from the effects of the sun.  They are located along two meridional lines approximately 1.6 hours apart in magnetic local time.  Although data is collected year-round, the data is retrieved by visiting each station during the austral summer season.  The British Antarctic Survey and the Australian Antarctic Program operate several similar observatories and cooperate in the data management and analysis.\r\n\t\r\nThe instruments in each observatory include optical and radio wave imagers, magnetometers, and wide-band and narrow-band radio receivers.  The network supports an active research program in the coupling of the solar wind to ionospheric and magnetospheric processes, emphasizing polar cap dynamics, substorm phenomena, and space weather.  Nine institutions are directly involved in acquiring the data, carrying out the proposed research, and making the data available for further use by other scientists.\r\n",
