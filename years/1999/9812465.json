 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812465  Aschheim  In this project analytical and experimental studies to confirm the  basic concepts and to explore the viability of various potential  mechanisms and the use of ordinary and castellated steel beams.   The analytical studies will test current hypotheses for stress  distributions and sizing criteria, and will explore various  attainable mechanisms under cyclic lateral loading with and without  gravity loads using inelastic finite element analyses.  These  studies will also help in defining test specimens and their  expected behavior.  Experimental studies will establish that shear  yielding can protect the beam-column connection from overstress,  and will investigate the deformability of the beams as limited by  material properties and stability.  Ordinary and castellated beams  will be tested having circular and hexagonal openings in the web.   Test setups will resemble those used in the SAC program.    Results from this research will establish the viability of the  proposed shear-yielding moment-resistant frame system, and will  provide an initial basis for establishing design criteria.  Test  results from simple beams suggest that the proposed steel frame  system will be cost competitive and possess extraordinary  ductility.  This additional performance enhancement of the lateral-  load resisting-system permits story heights to be reduced by 10 to  20%, thereby achieving further economy in material and construction  costs.    This is a project under the first round (FY'98) competition of  joint CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-30 \"US-Japan Cooperative Research  In Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation\".  ***",
