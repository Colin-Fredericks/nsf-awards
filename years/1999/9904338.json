 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is made to Dr. Ziling (Ben) Xue of the Chemistry Department of the University of Tennesseee, Knoxville, to study reactions of silanes with coordinated amides, alkyls, alkylidenes and alkylidynes in inorganic and organometallic compounds so as (i) to elucidate the nature of the reactions and the mechanistic pathways in the preparation of metal silicides, (ii) to synthesize new transition-metal silicon derivatives with these ligands, and (iii) to develop novel chemical vapor deposition processes to fabricate metal silicides.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of chemical vapor deposition processes, metal clusters that possess the structural features of metal silicides will be prepared to gain insights that will lead to better designs of molecular routes to existing and new silicide-based solid-state materials. These materials are important components in very-large-scale-integration devices, and in high-temperature and infrared detector systems. Students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in synthetic chemistry and materials science in an environment of expertise and state-of-the-art facilities that will foster and enhance collaboration between the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",
