 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the problem of developing the kind of product design education required for the future well-being of our society and environment. Based on our previous work across school boundaries, we believe the challenge is to integrate three kinds of expertise as equal components of product design education: the technical, the social/cultural, and the aesthetic. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project is completing the development of the RPI Product Design and Innovation Program (PDI), which awards a dual degree in Engineering Science (ES), and Science, Technology, and Society (STS).  At the heart of PDI is the design studio that students take every semester.  The design studio integrates the ES and STS curricula as well as the required elements of art and architectural design. The project aims, specifically, to develop these studios through a series of three week-long, summer sessions for fifteen faculty members. Each summer the faculty will conduct the necessary research on learning and teaching, and then design the two studios for the following academic year as well as redesign the two studios for the previous academic year. \r\n\r\nWe are in the pilot year now, and this series of summer sessions will be used to develop all eight studios. The project is reaching out to other institutions by inviting eight professional designers to be in residence in our studios for brief periods during the three full academic years of the project. This will help to ensure that the resulting inter-school, multidisciplinary product design pedagogy will be shared with numerous colleagues across the nation. \r\n\r\nThe audience of this project is the students who are taking PDI, the faculty who are teaching its studios, and the faculty and students who will eventually participate in similar studios at their institutions, but also, indirectly, all the people who will be affected by the new design pedagogy. \r\n\r\nA number of sources and academic programs have been influential in shaping this project.  Some of these are:  \r\n(1) The ABET 2000 standards\r\n(2) Louis Bucciarelli, \"Designing Engineers,\" (MIT Press, 1994)\r\n(3) Clive Dym, \"Engineering Design,\" (Cambridge University Press, 1994)\r\n(4) The engineering design program at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, particularly two courses: Industrial Design Analysis, and Contextual Nature of Products\r\n(5)  The \"Gemstone\" Program at the University of Maryland, especially the course called Introduction to Engineering Design,\r\n(6)  A set of 3 courses at MIT, particularly Product Development in Manufacturing Firms, and the Integrated Studies Program\r\n(7)  The Industrial Design Program in the College of Architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology\r\n(8)  The Interactive Qualifying Project and the Major Qualifying Project (a capstone activity) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, required of all students \r\n",
