 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mountain States Alliance for Minority Graduate Education (MGE@MSA) addresses the extremely low graduation rate of minority Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (SEM) students by increasing by 100% over five years, its annual total underrepresented SEM graduate student enrollment (from 696 to 1,392): increasing the annual M.S. degrees earned by these students by 75% over five years; and increasing by 100% over 10 years the annual number of SEM doctorates awarded to these students.\r\n\r\nOur graduate preparation and admissions sub-component will increase the number of students recruited, facilitate the graduate application process, reduce expenses, and provide personal counseling. Once admitted, students will receive a program of activities that will significantly increase their retention and graduation rates . Activities include institutes and networks that utilize nationally-known experts to dramatically increase the number of excellent mentors and match minority graduate students with them. Other programs will help graduate students to progress efficiently and expeditiously toward degree completion and help them achieve postdoctoral, particularly faculty, career paths. MGE@MSA operates in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and West Texas and makes use of and coordinates established programs many of which are already institutionalized and do not require additional resources, but rather, more students.\r\n",
