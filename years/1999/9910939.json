 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for a conference titled \"Environmental Technology for Oil Pollution\" to be held in Jurata, Poland from August 29 through September 3, 1999.  The conference is being organized by J. D. Miller, University of Utah, and J. Hupka, Technical Unviersity of Gdansk, Poland.  It will be a sequel to the successful International Conference on \"Analysis and Utilization of Oily Wastes\", AUZO'96 held in September 1996 in Gdansk.  The conference has multiple objectives.  The first is to convene a truly multidisciplinary group of top researchers from academia, industry and government interested in environmental technology for the prevention and remediation of oil pollution.  The latest research and development findings pertaining to environmental contamination with oily phases will be considered.  The second objective is to provide a broad-based forum for these researchers to aid in cross-fertilization of current findings and ideas.  This grant will support transportation, lodging and registration costs of invited speakers from the United States.",
