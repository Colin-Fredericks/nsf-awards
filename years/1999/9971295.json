In collaboration with Musili and Seshadri, the P.I. made a major break-through in the area of the Geometry of the flag varieties by developing - what is now well-known as - the STANDARD MONOMIAL THEORY.  This theory is a generalization of the classical HODGE-YOUNG THEORY developed in the 1950's.  This theory has led to an astounding number of geometric, representation-theoretic and combinatorial consequences.  Using her work on Standard Monomial Theory, the P.I. has solved many important problems on Schubert varieties - geometric and representation-theoretic. Recently, the P.I. has successfully applied her results to the study of certain algebraic varieties - certain toric varieties, ladder determinantal varieties and quiver varieties.\r\n\r\nHomogeneous spaces are fundamental objects in Geometry.  Flag varieties constitute an important class of homogeneous spaces.  Because of their rich geometry and combinatorics, flag varieties form interesting and important objects of study in the areas of Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic Groups, Representation Theory & Combinatorics.  The Schubert varieties in the flag varieties provide a powerful machinery for the study of flag varieties.\r\n\r\n",
