 "awd_abstract_narration": "pThe New Studio format for teaching introductory physics to large undergraduate classes retains the lecture format and combines traditional recitation and laboratory instruction creating an environment in which many interactive learning strategies are implemented. This New Studio, where students are taught two hours twice a week has 30 students working in groups of three at tables equipped with modern instructional technology and apparatus. The group setting allows for peer instruction and development of group skills.  Instructional materials that are centered on group work, microcomputer based technology tools and problem solving are adapted and implemented in the New Studio setting.  The daily sequence of the course includes the lecture to instruct economically large sections of students, but is strengthened by non-traditional classroom interactive strategies such as the use of  ClassTalk and concept questions. The lecture, supported by the New Studio, engages students with simple experiments/demonstrations coordinated with the previous night's problem set.  After the students explore the three to four concepts using these demonstrations,  they reconsider the problem set with the guidance of their instructors and their peers.  The New Studio concept is motivated by our departmental assessment of more traditional physics instruction and is based on adapting and implementing several of the interactive instructional materials and techniques demonstrated as effective in recent physics education research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
