 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNorth Central Texas College (NCTC), Grayson County College (GCC), and the University of North Texas (UNT), and Collin County Community College (CCCC) are implementing the Advancing Careers in Technology and Science (ACTS) Project. In addition, area tech-prep consortia serving over 40 high school districts are partners. These institutions represent a combined student body of over 80,000 students.  ACTS emphasizes the changing role of the 20th century skilled \"blue-collared\" technician to reflect the vital new role that the high-tech 21st century technician (identified as \"gold-collared\") is playing in influencing educational requirements in mathematics and science. Thus, the primary goals of ACTS are: 1) to initiate community based campaigns that promote a new mind-set that recognizes the value of 21st Century high-tech technicians and 2) to revitalize mathematics and science curriculum by interlocking practical applications of technologies in secondary and post-secondary education. Increasing both students' interest and success in technology and science education and careers are the intended outcomes. Processes, curriculum, and program materials are being disseminated through state presentations, regional workshops, and interfaces with national partners.\r\n\r\nUnique practices of the ACTS Project that maximize its effectiveness include:\r\n\r\n1) A Vertical marketing initiative is promoting the new era of \"gold-collared\" technicians. Designed by and for all partners including secondary schools, community colleges, universities and industry partners, this is expanding student awareness and opportunities.\r\n\r\n2) Multi-level curriculum design teams composed of high school teachers, faculty from community colleges and universities, and representatives from various industries are important in reducing duplication of subject materials and in developing tech-prep programs with true multi-exit career paths.\r\n\r\n3) Non-traditional faculty/teacher exchanges provide the vital connection for tech-prep programs and college courses integration into the high school level.  One week mini-exchanges between secondary teachers and post-secondary faculty and between faculty at different institutions promote understanding.  Teachers see more clearly what their students must be prepared to do.  \r\n\r\n4)  Non-traditional faculty externships with faculty not only working in industry, but also teaching in corporate training environments, exposes the externs to current advances in the industry and different curriculum delivery and instructional methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
