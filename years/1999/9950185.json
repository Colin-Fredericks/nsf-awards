 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project bridges the existing gap between class room theory and practical measurement techniques through adaptation of graduate undergraduate laboratory experience in environmental engineering within a senior level laboratory course. The experiments are structured to let the students participate in common field and laboratory measurements that are used in environmental engineering to design monitoring programs and treatment systems in air, water, wastewater, hazardous waste and ecology. The students are directly involved in evaluating data reliability and assessing QA/QC issues as a part of performing the experiments. They make decisions on the use of their data in classroom projects simulating assessment or the development of design parameters for treatment systems.\r\n\r\nThe standard graduate-level methodologies for field assessment methodologies for environmental science published jointly by the AHPA, AWWA, and WEF are the basis for this project.   \"Standards Methods\" graduate courses based on these standards and taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology (developed by the PI) and Clemson University are models for the materials which will be adapted to undergraduate education and implemented along with new air pollution and ecological field analyses.  A series of experimental modules represent the range of sub disciplines within Environmental Engineering such that the students have an exposure to the laboratory and field techniques. They use state-of-the-art methodologies representative of professional practice in addition to the research tools they would encounter if they pursue advanced degrees. The combined input of six professors ensures a broad base technical knowledge in the overall design of the laboratory and field experience. The equipment associated with this project ensures the ability to provide this enhanced educational experience on a continuing basis with dedicated equipment and provides an educational experience not previously available except on an ad-hoc and unreliable basis.\r\n\r\nA broader underlying objective of the project is the preparation of a course man",
