It is part of a coordinated effort between U. S. and Canadian workers to extract the maximum amount of data from important and remote sections that can later be synthesized to produce a comprehensive story of the shelf margin history from Later Ordovician-early Devonian time.  The data collection in this project will address three specific problems:\r\n\r\n1. Biostratigraphic tool development-The investigator has been working towards developing a biostratigraphic scheme for Ordovician-Silurian radiolarians, but lacks independent age control on Late Silurian sections.  The Cape Phillips Fm. has the best preserved Silurian radiolarians in the world, it is age is well constrained by graptolites, and it has the best possibility of providing the age control needed.  \r\n2. Extinction/diversification events- Radiolarian response will be examined across two mid Silurian graptolite extinctions and subsequent diversifications.  Total organic Carbon, carbon isotope analysis of whole-rock inorganic and organic carbon, and elemental analysis of the non-carbonate fraction will be conducted across the extinction's to look for related geochemical signatures.\r\n3. Siliceous spicules in paleoecology-The percentage of lithistid to hexactinellid spicules has previously been observed to vary with sea level rise in Late Ordovician sections.  Spicules will be examined in conjunction with the physical stratigraphy in order to test their sensitivity to local sea-level fluctuation.  These data will be tied into changes observed in the plankton community and the basin history.\r\n\r\n",
