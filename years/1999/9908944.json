 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the U.S. Weather Research Program, the Principal Investigators will investigate the physical controls of precipitation in hurricanes.  The main objective of this research is, through numerical simulations using a nested-grid, high-resolution atmospheric mesoscale model, to examine the physical  processes governing the structure and distribution of cumulus convection and precipitation associated with tropical cyclones.  Hurricane prediction models must accurately simulate these features in order to improve intensity and track forecasts as well as the rainfall forecast at landfall.  The research will address the following specific scientific questions:\r\n\r\nWhat are the fundamental physical processes that determine the precipitation distribution and rain rate within a hurricane?\r\n\r\nWhat are the sensitivities of simulated moist convective processes to model resolution, physical parameterization, and model initialization?\r\n\r\nHow are storm-scale variabilities in the precipitation and convective heating distributions related to various aspects of hurricane structure, storm-environmental interactions and, ultimately, hurricane track and intensity forecasts?\r\n\r\nThe project will produce comprehensive data sets of the three-dimensional precipitation structure and distribution of Hurricanes Bonnie and Georges.  It will also adapt a high-resolution nested-grid modeling system (the PSU/NCAR MM5 with an initialization specifically developed for hurricane simulations) that can be used to address issues related to both hurricane research and operational forecasting.\r\n",
