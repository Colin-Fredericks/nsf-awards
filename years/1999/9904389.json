 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of scale in socioeconomic processes has become prominent in the geographic literature, following on the seminal work of Lefebvre. While new theoretical research is changing how we conceptualize the role of scale in the world economy, this study will extend and test these concepts  by emphasizing empirical aspects.  Specifically, the project will focus on the changing scale of economic activities and on the formation and disintegration of economic regions over the past fifty years in the United States. Research questions to be addressed under this research planning grant (MRPG) include the following: Is the scale of economic processes that groups the fates of individual areas (county-level units) together into a region constant over time?  Are there times when economic activities are linked over a wide geographical scale (multi-county or even multi-state regions) and thereby creating patterns of fairly even growth or decline over a large portion of the US? Alternatively, are forces in the US producing a fragmented landscape of uneven growth and decline, with small adjoining areas often moving in different directions in terms of economic change? \r\n\r\nFollowing on a study by Smith and Dennis (1987) on the coalescence and eventual fragmentation of the Northeastern Manufacturing Core, the proposed research will reevaluate the results of their study utilizing new techniques in exploratory spatial data analysis that provide a finer spatial resolution to examine growth, decline, and the scale associated with change. Previous work studied these issues at a scale too large to capture the heterogeneity of the changes taking place in the region (Smith and Dennis,1987), or used relatively simple statistical measures (Shelton, 1995). Furthermore, the continued decline in manufacturing suggests that the analysis of regional economic change should also include the role of services in defining economic regions. Analyses using this alternative approach can offer new insights on scale that might be useful for a larger study on the determinants of regional growth and decline in the US as a whole, and on the scale of these processes. Additionally, this research will inform discussion among policymakers on the appropriate scale for implementing regional policies for economic growth and development.\r\n",
