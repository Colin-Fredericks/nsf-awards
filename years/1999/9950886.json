 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Studio-Based Modern Physics Project is a project to adapt and implement a wealth of existing materials, many developed at various universities with National Science Foundation support.  A set of stylistically coherent and pedagogically consistent modules is produced for use in the teaching of the standard Modern Physics course for scientists and engineers which typically follows the introductory physics sequence.  Specifically, these modules integrate modern technologies into the teaching of the basic concepts of Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics at an introductory level.  This material is envisioned for use as a supplement to any of the standard Modern Physics textbooks.  The resources to be adapted include simulation software [including \"RelLab\",  \"Spacetime\", \"Photoelectric Tutor\",  Java \"physlets\" created by W. Christian [including \" Doppler\", \"Minkowsi\", and \"QM Time\", desktop laboratories developed by the Visual Quantum Mechanics group at Kansas State University,  and Maple worksheets by M. Maloney [including \" compton\", \"schro\", and \"orbital\".  These modules are developed  for use in the classroom \"studio\" environment, implementing learning strategies and classroom practices developed and tested under NSF sponsorship and shown to be successful at the introductory physics level at fostering conceptual understanding(e.g.  Real-Time Physics [Sokoloff,et.al], Tutorials in Introductory Physics [McDermott]).  A series of evaluative instruments is created in order to test for success in realizing specific pedagogical objectives compared with the traditional, lecture based, course.  Class testing and evaluation of materials is conducted over a span of several quarters.  The effectiveness of student centered, guided exploration methods in application to abstract subject material and greater mathematical sophistication is probed.   A website summarizing project activities and allowing free download of all material developed is created and maintained.",
