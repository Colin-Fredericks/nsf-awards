 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis grant provides funding for the development of a new procedure for design decision making. Currently, design engineers make tradeoff decisions using a wide variety of procedures. Many of these procedures are loosely structured, and rely heavily on one or two individual's expert opinion. These procedures have worked reasonably well in the past, but have become inadequate as the design process has become more complex. This project will develop a set of axioms or procedures that will address issues raised in team design projects, tradeoffs under uncertainty, and consideration of \"externalities\" such as environmental impacts. Specifically, procedures will be developed for fully employing the information contained in a utility function during two critical stages: synthesis to create alternatives, and analysis to develop each alternative to its fullest potential. Focus areas will be the independence conditions,  attribute definition, the  functional multi-attribute form, and biases in assessing uncertainties and preferences.\r\n\tIf successful, this project will help transform design decision analysis from an art to a science. The benefits will be realized by a broad range of design engineers, rather than by only specialists in decision analysis. During the design process, effort will be focussed where the potential payoff is greatest. Product design and development will take less time, since effort will be directed at synthesis and analytic tasks which contribute most to overall product utility. Nonlinear preferences and willingness to make tradeoffs will be modeled precisely, and the effect of uncertainty will be included in a rational, consistent manner. Customers will then be presented with products that better meet their conflicting needs for high performance, high quality, low cost, and low environmental impact.\r\n",
