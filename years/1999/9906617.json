 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Park Service and other conservation-oriented organizations historically have tried to maintain park land and wilderness areas in their natural conditions, but the invasion of exotic species often has altered indigenous plant communities.  Nitrogen-fixing plants alter biogeochemical processes and facilitate future exotic invasions.  This doctoral dissertation research project addresses spatial and resource competitive effects of an exotic species, yellow sweet clover (Melitotus officinalis), in montane grasslands in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Preliminary analyses show that M. officinalis invasion spreads into native communities and induces an altered species composition from lowered nutrient availability and soil microclimate changes.  Continued research will focus on the hypotheses that native species will benefit from prescribed burning and nitrogen manipulations while M. officinalis spread and density will decrease.  Research methods to be used in this project include sampling soil and vegetation in replicate disturbed sites of invaded and non-invaded patches.  Preliminary results show that M. officinalis expanded past original mapped boundaries throughout the season, and species composition is different between patches.  Soil analysis shows lower nitrogen availability, net mineralization, and soil moisture in patches occupied by M. officinalis.  Historical aerial photographs, global positioning systems, and geographic information systems will be used to map exotic invasion.  Field methods during the latter stages of the project will incorporate prescribed burning in several sites and nitrogen manipulations along patch edges.  This project will provide new insights into the processes of biological invasions and altered chemical processes.  In addition to generating fundamental knowledge about these biogeographic and biogeochemical processes, this project will provide practical information for land managers, especially as it relates to the role that prescribed fires and nitrogen manipulations may play in the preservation of natural vegetation communities.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
