 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977216\r\nVigdor\r\n\tThis project is aimed at building a detector that will enable a qualitative advance in understanding of the internal structure of protons.  The detector proposed is an Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) to be added to the major STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC) detector system currently being assembled at the new Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility.  RHIC and STAR were originally designed to search for new phases of strongly interacting matter in collisions of very energetic heavy nuclei.  The EEMC would critically enhance their capabilities as a platform for a complementary class of experiments, utilizing high-energy colliding beams of spin-polarized protons.  It would do so by providing detection of high energy gamma rays, electrons, positrons and neutral pions in a kinematic regime of optimal sensitivity to unmeasured contributions to the proton's intrinsic spin.\r\n\tThe flagship EEMC experiment would map out the net gluon spin contribution, a key to dis-entangling the supplementary contributions from quark and antiquark spins and from the orbital motion of quarks and gluons.  The enhanced STAR detector would allow the world's best measurement of the integral gluon spin contribution, by detecting gamma rays from hard polarized proton collisions in coincidence with \"jets\" of hadrons - products when a polarized quark in one proton beam strikes a polarized gluon in the order.\r\n\tThe EEMC is also crucial for separating antiquark from quark polarizations via the production of weak W+ bosons, with the goal of elucidating the physical origin of the quark-antiquark sea inside a proton.  The antiquark polarizations will provide important new information, while the quark polarizations can be compared to results from electron or muon beams, to provide an essential calibration of the entire RHIC spin program.  Other important physics questions whose investigation is considerably enhanced by the EEMC include the following:  Do the quarks and antiquarks inside a hyperon carry as small a fraction of the overall spin as appears to be the case for a proton?  Can parity violation in hard quark collisions reveal new interactions of ultra-short range, beyond those included in the Standard Model of particle physics?  How is the gluon abundance at small momentum fractions modified by the environment when a nucleon is embedded in a heavy nucleus?\r\n",
