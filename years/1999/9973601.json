 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973601\r\nBurg\r\nApproximately eight million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States to treat individuals who have lost tissue or organs through a variety of disease processes and injuries.  Tissue or organ loss is typically treated by transplantation from one individual to another, by surgical reconstruction, or by the use of mechanical devices.  Unfortunately, these treatments may allow temporary repair only and may introduce further complications.  Tissue engineering is the development of biological replacements, in which cells can be taken from the patient, expanded in culture, cultivated, combined with an absorbable polymer matrix, and implanted in the patient.  Once implanted, the polymer gradually disappears as, in parallel, the tissue develops and gains form and function.  Because the implanted cells are derived from the patient, the need for immunosuppression is eliminated, as are problems associated with traditional organ donation procedures.  This research, with support from a POWRE award, will focus on novel methods of creating absorbable scaffolds to enhance vascularization potential and a novel, non-invasive method of assessing these sensitive constructs.  The development of vasculature is critical to the progression of tissue engineering; since, currently the major impedance to developing viable, three-dimensional tissue is the challenge of providing a vascular support network.  The study will address the precision patterning of absorbable scaffolds and the optimization of scaffold morphology, cell-scaffold interaction, and cellular distribution throughout the scaffold. The NSF POWRE funding is vital to establishing a record of independent research during the PI's transition from postdoctoral fellow to faculty. \r\n\r\n",
