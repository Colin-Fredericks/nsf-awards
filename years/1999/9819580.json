These teachers then give staff development workshops to introduce computer-based visualization to peers in their districts and local regions.  The project integrates a number of approaches previously supported by the National Science Foundation, including image processing, simulation and modeling, GIS, and molecular modeling.  The core teachers conduct short workshops (1-1/2 to 2 days each) for follow-on teachers in which they introduce one or more of these tools within the context of math and science courses.  The core teachers will conduct a total of 250 such workshops.\r\n\r\nThe project provides extended electronic support for the local workshops, helping teachers to use various types of computer-based visualization tools with students to explore and discover math and science.  The project is designed for middle and high school math and science teachers in Virginia and the local region.  It aims to develop teachers' skills in using computer-based tools in order to help them and their students explore a rich array of content in their courses.\r\n\r\nCost sharing is 9% of the budget.\r\n\r\n",
