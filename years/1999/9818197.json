Functional imaging is the use of imaging modalities to visualize and/or quantify dynamic or physiologic activity within living organs.  One important application of functional imaging is the detection of vascular contrast agents as indicators for estimating perfusion in both conducting vessels and capillary exchange regions of an organ.  A variety of imaging modalities are applicable, and while based on different imaging physics, the estimation of perfusion from the dynamic contrast images has a similar theoretical basis regarding the manner in which vascular transport affects the signal resulting from the passage of contrast agent through the vasculature.  The accuracy and precision of methods used to estimate these perfusion parameters depend on the applicability of this theory to the actual transport of the contrast agent to and through organ regions.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to evaluate the impact of deviations from common model assumptions on parameter stimation methods in models of indicator transport through both vascular tress and capillary networks.  This information will then be used to improve and/or justify parameter estimation methods, and to simultaneously determine the kinematics of flow through organ vasculature.  Analytic and numerical methods will be used to model the effects of velocity profiles developed in various vascular tree-like models for the purpose of developing a general approach for reliably estimating transit times within conducting vessels of organs using inlet-outlet image data. Similarly, a computer-simulation model of a capillary network will be developed and analyzed for the purpose of developing an approach for reliably estimating capillary perfusion using inlet-residue image data. Finally, experiments will be carried out to determine the kinematics of flow in the pulmonary arterial tree and to evaluate certain assumptions of the parameter estimation methods in a real organ.\r\n\r\n",
