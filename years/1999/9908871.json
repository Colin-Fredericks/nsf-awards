He will track the plutonium tracer signal emanating from the former nuclear test site of Chernaya Bay, on the south coastline of Novaya Zemlya, into the Arctic Ocean.  The large (11 TBq) inventory of plutonium in Chernaya Bay, derived from underwater nuclear tests in the 1950s, is characterized by low 240Pu /239Pu  ratios of 0.03 which provide an easily measured contrast (using ICP-MS techniques) to values of 0.18, typical of atmospheric fallout.  Surficial sediments in the Makarov and Eurasian Basins have low 240Pu /239Pu ratios (0.09-0.16) and it is hypothesized that a significant component of this plutonium is the result of long-range transport from Chernaya Bay.  The Principal Investigator will evaluate the north transport of Chernaya Bay plutonium by following the low 240Pu /239Pu  ratio signal in sediment box-core samples collected on transects across the pathway of the plutonium plume west of Novaya Zemlya and in the Saint Anna Trough. The sediment samples will be analyzed for a complete suite of radionuclides (210lead, 137cesium, 241americum, 239 plutonium, 240plutonium) to establish sedimentation and mixing rates at each location and in order to evaluate the plutonium fluxes and inventories.  These results will be supported by hydrodynamic modeling of radionuclide propagation, both in dissolved and particulate phases, along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya and into the Eurasian Basin.  The initial radionuclide measurements will be conducted on archived sediment samples stored at the Byrd Polar Research Center.  Additional samples will be collected on transects across the elaborated plume pathway during the second year.  The results of this study will provide a basis for assessing the impact of potential radionuclide releases from a new radioactive waste storage facility to be constructed on the south coast of Novaya Zemlya.  These results will help in predicting the magnitude of inorganic and organic particle-reactive contaminant transport through the Arctic Ocean from a wide range of urban and industrial sources located on the arctic continental shelf.",
