SSW is a relatively cold and fresh water mass with a significant component from the St. Lawrence River, and is commonly identifiable with T-S analyses of hydrographic data and in satellite images of sea surface temperature.  One such flux episode was observed March 1997 in satellite imagery and from shipboard hydrographic sampling on Georges Bank.  Qualitative at-sea analyses of ichthyoplankton sampled on the March cruise revealed a remarkably tight association between abundances of gadid eggs and the distribution of SSW suggesting, along with other lines of evidence, that most of those eggs were spawned on the Scotian Shelf and were advected with the SSW water mass to Georges Bank.  The fundamental question thus arises: to what extent are cod on Georges Bank imported to the Bank as early development stages by advection from Canadian waters to the east?  The goal of this research is to answer this question.  The  approach will be two tiered: (1) performing retrospective elemental analyses of otoliths from archived larval cod samples, as well as of ichthyoplankton samples to be collected in 1998 and 1999 as part of the continuing Georges Bank GLOBEC project, analyzing them for Sr/Ca ratios, using an X-ray electron microprobe, and elemental \"fingerprints\", using UV lazer ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS); and (2) assessing the genetic identity of the larvae relative to larval and adult populations from Georges Bank and from the Scotian Shelf using nuclear DNA microsatellite techniques. \r\n",
