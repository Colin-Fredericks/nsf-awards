The CRA-W was established in 1991 with the goal of taking positive action to increase the number and success of women in Computer Science and Engineering Research, where they are currently significantly underrepresented.  CRA-W has initiated a broad range of projects, from the high-school level, through the undergraduate and graduate levels, developed workshops for new faculty, moderates the \"systers-academia\" electronic mailing list and edits a regular column in the Computing Research News.  In addition, CRA-W provides a forum for addressing problems that fall disproportionately within women's domains and seeks to have a positive impact for other underrepresented groups within Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E).\r\n\r\nNew projects under consideration include hosting a meeting of committees from professional organizations that address underrepresention of women, establishing a web-based undergraduate research showcase, expanding their faculty mentoring workshops, maintaining a web-based resume service for women with Ph.D. degrees in CS&E fields, and developing a leadership workshop for women who could potentially move into leadership positions either on their campuses or at the national level.\r\n\r\nMost CRA-W projects are funded individually.  However, this award provides funds to support the basic activities of the committee including travel support for one steering committee and one full committee meeting each year and a minimal amount of staff support.\r\n",
