 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freire\r\n \r\nProteins are highly cooperative structures in which interactions or perturbations occurring at specific locations are often propagated to distal places within the molecule. The mechanisms by which these processes occur are still not understood. The problem is compounded by the experimental realization, mainly from NMR-detected hydrogen exchange experiments, that even under native conditions proteins must be considered as statistical ensembles. The long range goal of this project is to investigate the structural distribution of cooperative interactions in proteins, how this distribution is modulated by ligand binding or interactions with other molecules, and how signals or perturbations localized in specific regions of the protein molecule are transduced to other regions. The experimental work will be performed with the wild type and site-specific mutants of the SH3 domain, a protein motif involved in the regulation of signal-transduction pathways whose crystallographic and NMR structures are known at high resolution. The approach to be used involves a combination of experimental thermodynamic and NMR studies, statistical thermodynamic analysis and structure-based thermodynamic computations.\r\n\r\nThe success of this project is not only of scientific interest. It has important practical implications and is expected to benefit protein design strategies aimed at developing mutant proteins with improved functionality, cooperativity and stability under specific chemical or physical environments. \r\n",
