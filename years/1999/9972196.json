The III-VI semiconductors are known for their remarkable nonlinear optical properties. Preliminary magnetic measurements on GaMnSe and GaMnS crystals have revealed behavior strikingly different from that observed previously in the heavily studied II-VI and III-V DMS materials.  Two key features that make the III-VI DMS unique is their two-dimensional layered structure (held together by van der Waals bonding between layers) and the potential for direct bonding of neighboring transition metal ions.  The goal of this research program is to provide key information for unraveling some of the observed novel magnetic effects and to initiate an investigation of other transition metal ions in the III-VI semiconductor hosts.  The research involves undergraduate students as well as a local high school teacher and will impact both the quality of technically trained undergraduates and the motivation of students at the high school level to enter scientific or technical fields.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis project deals with a new class of materials with potential photoelectronic applications.  Undergraduate students and a local high school teacher will help make measurements using the state-of-the-art facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. They will learn a number of important experimental techniques while investigating a new and potentially important class of magnetic semiconductors.\r\n***  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
