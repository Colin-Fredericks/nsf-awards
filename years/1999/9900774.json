 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of panethnicity--solidarity among culturally and linguistically diverse national origin groups--is perhaps the most notable ethnic phenomenon to occur in the U.S. over the past 30 years. Currently, however, there are no theories that directly and systematically address when and why panethnicity occurs. This doctoral dissertation project extends competition theory and cultural division of labor theory to make new predictions about when panethnic behavior will increase among Asian Americans from 1965 to 1995. Data for two dependent variables will be collected: (1) the formation of ethnic (based on national origin ties such as Chinese or Korean) and panethnic (based on ties to the broader group, Asian American) organizations from Encyclopedia of Associations; (2) the occurrence of ethnic and panethnic collective action events from five large, national newspapers. The proposed data sets will enable empirical testing of theoretical predictions about the structural conditions under which solidarity (organizations) and mobilization (collective action) will emerge, resulting in movement toward the construction of a general theory of panethnicity. In addition, more accurate measures of real and perceived competition and new methods for measuring ethnic stratification will be utilized in the event history and pooled time series analyses.",
