 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to organize the Workshop on Sustainability in Energy Systems in Atlanta, which would have multifaceted objectives.  The objective of the workshop is to heighten the awareness of the need to foster and encourage scientific and technological research to support a sustainable society.  This workshop is intended to explore the relationship between current university-based educational and research programs in energy technologies and the visions set forth by both public and private sector energy organizations on energy needs,  the sources and amounts of energy, and of the future.\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop preparation, the investigators and the advisory board will develop a generic scenario, synthesized from several leading reports on future energy resources and needs, for distribution to the workshop participants.  The participants will represent interest from the energy research community as well as the energy industry.  The participants will be asked to develop and present papers reflecting on the scenario from their particular areas of expertise.  These reflections will include consideration of the critical issues and bottlenecks associated with developing and delivering the diverse energy sources envisioned in the scenarios, including consideration of the technological aspects, the educational/workforce needs, and issues associated with the markets of these energy sources. \r\n.\r\n\r\nThe workshop participants will be selected to represent the major elements of the U.S. energy R&D portfolio (energy end-use efficiency, and nuclear energy, fossil fuel, and renewable energy technologies), and the market-related issues in the energy industry.  With  respect to energy end-use efficiency, the workshop will include consideration  of buildings, industry and transportation.\r\n",
