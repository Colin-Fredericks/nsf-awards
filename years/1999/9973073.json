If they are reactive, then these \"anti-fossil\" antibodies will be tested for cross-reactivity to modern proteins to identify the source proteins in the fossil extracts. These studies will be supplemented with other analytical tests of the fossil specimens, so that more than one line of evidence can be used to support the hypothesis that these molecules arise from the fossils (ie, are endogenous) and not from recent, outside contamination.  Finally, if it appears that endogenous biomolecules do persist within fossil tissues, the depositional setting and sediments will be analyzed to seek to identify a correlation between depositional environments and preservation.\r\n",
