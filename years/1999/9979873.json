Lee\r\nInstitution:\t\tPurdue University\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research is to develop a framework for using plant data for the development of a reduced-order nonlinear multistep prediction model, capable of predicting a long-term behavior of relevant variables on the basis of incoming measurements, in the presence of both deterministic and stochastic input changes.  Such a model is an essential component of the envisioned computer-based system that performs the integrated function of process monitoring, soft sensing, and predictive control.  The PI will draw upon the subspace identification paradigm that enables the engineer to build a state-space prediction model directly from input-output data. The proposed research will address the following topics: (1) extension of linear subspace identification to nonlinear stochastic systems, involving the development of a nonlinear projection method for the construction of state-space models, (2) a comparative evaluation of the nonlinear projection-based method against other competing options including the direct time-series based design and the internally recurrent neural network based design, (3) development of a robust model predictive control method for piecewise-linear state-space models, (5) development of  a software package for the integrated control scheme, and (6) testing of the developed methods on distillation columns and reactors.  The development of a model-based estimator and controller is of great industrial importance, particularly for a process in which control variables are complex functions of process variables such as temperature and composition.\r\n",
