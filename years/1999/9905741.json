 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the influence of Spanish to English interpretation of defendants' testimony and of juror language dominance on the judicial processing of Hispanic defendants. Specific factors to be evaluated include the influence of the defendant's language of testimony, defendant's ethnicity, and jurors' ethnicity and language dominance on judicial processing of criminal defendants. The research will fill a void in our understanding of several issues. First, little is known about the disposition of cases involving Hispanic defendants. The national Hispanic population (10.95%) is growing so rapidly that it is projected to surpass the black non-Hispanic population (12.14%) within the next 6 years (U.S. Bureau of Census, 1996). Second, in multilingual environments, trials are conducted with courtroom interpretation of testimony with increasing frequency.  As the monolingual Spanish-speaking population has increased, Spanish-English interpretation is critical to the processing of many Hispanic defendants. Almost no data are available to evaluate the impact of interpreted testimony on trial outcomes where juries have deliberated. Third, the project focuses on the influence of interpretation on jurors' decision-making in a context in which the population is predominantly Hispanic and where many jurors are themselves bilingual. To study these variables, an experiment high in mundane realism is being conducted. Six versions of a burglary trial are shown to participants via videotape. Three thousand jury-eligible community residents will serve as mock jurors. After seeing and hearing the evidence, jurors deliberate to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. If they find him guilty, they will make a recommendation for a sentence. The data will be analyzed at the jury and juror levels, using multivariate statistical techniques that will enable the researcher to assess the attributions jurors have of the defendant and the case disposition patterns. The results will contribute to a better understanding of how Hispanic defendants are treated in the criminal justice system, the influence of courtroom interpretation, and the effects of jurors' language dominance on their decision--making and jury verdicts. They will also inform policy makers about the bilingual courtroom.\r\n",
