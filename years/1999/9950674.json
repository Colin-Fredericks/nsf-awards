 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guidelines at our institution require students to complete 12 credit hours in writing-intensive courses.  The original intent was to incorporate writing-intensive status into lower division courses.  Instead, it has been applied to upper division lecture courses where student populations require less instructor work, defeating the purpose of the writing-intensive guidelines.  Since we have noticed deficiencies in writing skills, defined as writing, reading, comprehension, and critical thinking, in our graduates in chemistry, we are implementing a curriculum reform that corrects this deficiency.  The Molecular Science project has developed software, Calibrated Peer Review (CPR), that improves student writing skills without increasing instructor workloads.  Our adoption of this program begins the writing education of science majors early in their careers by allowing instructors the option to offer writing-intensive courses at the freshman and sophomore level.  More importantly, adaptation of CPR to the laboratory courses removes the \"fill-in-the-blank\" approach to teaching large sections of chemistry laboratories.  Such an approach provides students with skills in data manipulation and technical writing at all levels of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIncorporation of CPR into the chemistry curriculum is occurring in stages.  The first two stages require pilot studies in chemistry courses and laboratories and assessment of the results.  The third phase incorporates CPR into the entire chemistry curriculum.  Subsequent phases integrate CPR into the entire science curriculum, including laboratories, at our institution and at area schools.\r\n\r\nImplementation of this plan is expected to produce students with greatly improved science writing skills.  Undergraduate students should gain an understanding of how to write technical reports, think about data critically, and integrate the data into the preparation of a justified set of conclusions.  The ease with which this can be done by using CPR should free students to take interest in the science behind the experiments.",
