 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and Organizational Change Program, this research focuses on a long-standing theoretical debate in the field of management around whether large-scale organizational change should be managed incrementally through successive stages or discontinuously in a single transformation. There have been few systematic empirical investigations of this issue. The proposed project will investigate this issue within a group of hospital systems (i.e., two or more hospitals under common ownership) that are each undergoing a major transition in organizational design, specifically, from functional to product-line structures for certain services. The central hypothesis is that an incremental transition process is associated with greater transition success than is a discontinuous transition approach.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has the potential to have a substantial impact on the state of knowledge regarding organizational, filling a void in the literature concerning the relative risks and benefits associated with incremental versus discontinuous transition change. This insight is of increasing importance as organizations cope with major change.\r\n\r\nThe partner organization is the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), a consortium of 16 hospital systems established to support research on managerial and clinical issues pertaining to hospital systems. In a pilot study of the hospital systems, the research team identified approximately 75 product lines that are slated for implementation within the next two years, as the hospital systems use redefined product lines as a strategy for reducing service overlap and promoting customer service among their hospitals. The timing of the implementation of these product lines provides the research team with the opportunity to study the transitions in organizational design prospectively from a baseline period to the full implementation of the product line.\r\n\r\nThe project will comprise statistical and case study componentswith the primary unit of analysis being the product line. For the statistical component of the study, each product line will be followed prospectively over a threeyear period to assess transition approach relative to several indicators of transition success. Transition approach will be operationalized in accordance with a well-developed conceptual framework that the project's principal investigator previously developed for classifying organizational structures along a functional-product-line continuum. The research team will examine several types of transition approach based on whether and which intermediate structures are used for managing the transition from functional to product-line structure. The indicators of transition success will include employee readiness for change, employee satisfaction, and degree to which the expected benefits from the transition have been realized. For the case study component the research team will select six product lines as cases for in-depth investigation. Of the six cases, three will be product lines that are slated to be implemented incrementally and three will be product lines that are slated to be implemented discontinuously. \r\n\r\nThis results of this study will carry implications for health care change management, for the issue of whether large-scale change is better managed incrementally or discontinuously, and for insights into the large-scale change process more generally.\r\n",
