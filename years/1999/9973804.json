 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goals of these experiments are to describe the basic biology of Finnegan, a novel gene descended from Adh in the repleta group of Drosophila, to find other examples of new genes descended from Adh in Drosophila.  These data will provide the first insight into general patterns and processes in the evolution of new function and provide the raw material for further experiments on evolution of novel function.\r\n\r\nDespite its obvious importance in evolution, the origin and elaboration of evolutionary novelty at the genetic level is only poorly understood.  Our lack of insight into this key problem can be attributed to at least three gaps.  First there are few known examples of genes having a recently evolved function, yet it is such cases where we should have the best chance of understanding the mechanisms responsible for the origins and early stages of functional divergence of new genes.  Second, it is often difficult to imagine how the selective pressures driving molecular evolutionary novelty, might be inferred since many examples involve ancient reorganization (e.g., exon shuffling) of basic cell function genes.  Finally, since there has been no concerted effort to search for genes with recently evolved function there is no way to understand how common such events are, no knowledge of their phylogenetic distribution, no understanding of their correlations with ecological factors, and no understanding of the general principles determining the evolutionary paths open to particular genes or types of genes.\r\n",
