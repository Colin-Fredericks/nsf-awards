 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the CASES-99 program (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study-1999), the PI, in collaboration with Dr. Jielun Sun of the University of Colorado, will employ hot film anemometers to measure the contribution of the smallest resolvable turbulent eddies to the vertical fluxes of heat and momentum. In stable, nocturnal conditions which are the focus of the CASES program, turbulent eddies near the ground are so small as to be undetectable by traditional observing means, such as sonic anemometers. In addition to evaluating the importance of the small and previously unobserved eddies, the investigators will study the relative importance of radiative and sensible heat fluxes in the energy balance of the boundary layer and determine the extent to which the Monin-Obukov similarity theory, developed for convective boundary layers, may have application in the stable boundary layer. The phenomenon of turbulence intermittency will also be studied, using data from an instrumented tower, lidars, radar wind profilers, and aircraft.",
