The participation in this conference will strengthen the collaborations that nucleated during ICEE 97(Chicago) and ICEE 98 (Rio de Janeiro) and accompanying international workshops.  Consistent with the commitment made last year by Taiwan, Brazil and the Czech Republic, this team will constitute the U.S. delegation to ICEE 99 and the follow on International Workshop.  A secondary purpose of this proposal is to support dissemination of the curriculum reform philosophy beyond the U.S. by targeted participation in ICEE 99.  This will be accomplished through key presentations, the conducting of workshops, and participation in symposia and panel discussions.  The availability of a travel grant from the NSF will enable the participation of faculty members from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
