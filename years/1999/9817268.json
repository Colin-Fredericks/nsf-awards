 "awd_abstract_narration": "An emerging concept in plant developmental biology is that the genetic\r\ncontrol of patterned cell division is the key to understanding plant\r\ndevelopment.  Plants depend on controlled cell divisions in order to make\r\nnew organs throughout their life cycle.  Organ development in flowering\r\nplants results almost entirely from the patterned control of the number,\r\nplace and plane of cell division, in conjunction with regulated and\r\ncoordinated cellular expansion.  The establishment of patterned control\r\noccurs during several major phases of plant development, namely during\r\nembryogenesis, shoot and root development, and during inflorescence and\r\nfloral morphogenesis.  A novel homeobox gene, ATML1, in Arabidopsis\r\nthaliana is expressed very early in plant development, being first detected\r\nin the zygote, then segregated to the apical cell and later to the early\r\nprotoderm during asymmetric cell division.  An atml1 mutant exhibits an\r\nembryo-defective phenotype, with a loss of cellular patterning.  Based on\r\nits pattern of expression and its mutant phenotype, the ATML1 gene and its\r\nprotein product are likely to play a critical role in early embryogenesis,\r\nspecifically contributing to the control of pattern formation during\r\nembryogenesis and possibly later during shoot development. \r\nThis project seeks to determine the function of ATML1 in embryogenesis and\r\nSAM organization/function by characterizing the genetics and phenotype of\r\nan atml1 mutant.  The specific objectives are to use a combination of\r\nclassical and molecular genetic approaches to study the effect of the T-DNA\r\ninsertion in the atml1 mutant line. This research will provide critical\r\ninformation for our understanding of the basis of cell division and early\r\npattern formation during embryogenesis, and the specification of the\r\nidentity of an L1 cell layer in the SAM.  Localization of the ATML1 gene\r\nproducts should also provide insight into current hypotheses concerning\r\nprotein trafficking and lineage versus positional information in the\r\ndetermination of pattern in plants.\r\n",
