Thus, it is critical to know how to restore agricultural land to tallgrass prairie. A major part of any restoration project in tallgrass prairie will be understanding the roles of granivory and herbivory, especially by small mammals since much of the restored tallgrass prairie will not by grazed by large native ungulates. This project proposes to continue a study that is examining the effects of small mammal alteration of replicated tallgrass restoration. In addition, support is requested to take advantage of new opportunity presented by rodent suppression of legumes in rodent-accessible exclosures in southwestern Wisconsin using a series of experiments. These experiments use restoration techniques to test fundamental predictions from theories of animal foraging and plant competition. This work will contribute insight into the interactions of plants and animals that can only be garnered from an experimental approach, preferably carried out in synthetic assemblages rather than irreplaceable tallgrass prairie remnants. \r\n",
