 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will fabricate a prototype PVDF strain sensor, which can be mounted on structures and embedded into composites. The Phase I project demonstrated that a polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) film satisfactorily qualifies as a new sensor material. It was also determined that the sensor is very easy to fabricate and that the sensor output is highly repeatable and linear even at very high strains. Phase I research also found that two temperature related effects of PVDF film, pyroelectric effect and piezoelectric coefficients temperature dependence, can be corrected. Based on these results it was concluded that the material is strain sensitive and can be utilized to produce the strain sensing devices.  In Phase II, data telemetry and data acquisition and processing subsystems will be integrated with the sensor. The prototype of the wireless PVDF sensor system will be tested and evaluated in laboratory, by which numerous specialized sensors, such as accelerometer, displacement gauge, fatigue life counter, etc., can be designed and fabricated for commercial applications. The tasks of study include: (1) Sensor design to study sensing element encasement for protection, sensor dimension for end application, elimination of temperature effect, IC based onboard signal amplification, frequency response characterization, and power requirements, (2) Durability of sensor under different environment conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and cyclic fatigue loading, (3) Data telemetry system including single and multi-channel wireless data transfer as well as scaling up of transmission range to over a mile, (4) Multi-channel data acquisition and processing including interfacing hardware into a system that is commercially viable and developing the software for storage and visualization, and (4) Field tests, application and evaluation of the wireless PVDF sensor system for infrastructure monitoring.\r\n     Over one third (230,000) of all highway bridges existing in US are either structurally deficient or obsolete. About $5 billion is spent annually on the bridge rehabilitation nationwide. Monitoring infrastructures is important in determining precisely their health conditions and estimating their remaining life. The condition monitoring system can also be used as a warning system in emergency response to earthquake and other nature disaster events. Therefore, the commercial application of the wireless PVDF strain sensors for infrastructure monitoring is broad. The end users include governments at all levels, private companies and industries, building owners and infrastructure manages, and emergency response agencies for earthquakes and other natural disasters.\r\n",
