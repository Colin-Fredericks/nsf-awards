In past work, these scientists have demonstrated the use of neural networks in biochemical process control, neural and fuzzy architectures in position control of servo systems, and intelligent identification of robotic manipulators.  The results imply that the use of soft computing techniques lead to a more efficient design. The two scientists propose to focus on the soft-computing based approaches as methods for designing intelligent identifiers and controllers and on chip implementation of devised strategies.  Neuro-fuzzy controllers will be implemented in VLSI chips using MOSIS 2micrometer process.  The aim of the research is to investigate the real-time and on-chip implementability of computationally intelligent architectures from the point of view of identification and control of mechatronic systems.   Two objectives are identified: to consider different structures of intelligent identifiers and controllers, and to implement the control strategies to be developed, using dedicated VLSI chips, which can be analog or digital.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Turkish and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience.  The research issues are quite relevant and the ideas and techniques that are proposed for addressing them are quite interesting.  The project addresses interesting combinations of technology with possible advances of technology.  The project draws from the previous accomplishments and contributions of the two teams in the areas of soft computing, VLSI design, and mechatronics. The two teams have the potential to contribute to this area, with significant impact on the industrial application of on-chip architectures for advanced applications in mechatronics.   It is planned to involve graduate students on both sides in this international collaboration.  The proposal meets INT objectives for supporting international collaboration when there is a potential for mutual benefits.  This project is supported",
