The project provides supplemental travel funds to participants to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium to be held March 8-12 in Austin, TX.   This is an international conference held annually in the United States,   It is one of the few dedicated solely to issues of undergraduate computing education.   The conference attracts over 900 educators, primarily from the United States and Canada, with a growing worldwide participation. \r\n\r\nThe showcase participants are from the CCLI award winners from the 1999 and 2000 set of proposals.   This will allow for presentation of formative evaluation results from both A&I and EMD type projects so that conference attendees will be able to see different developmental stages of such projects.  The showcase will benefit both the CCLI grantees as well as the conference attendees by allowing an early and informal forum for evaluation, dissemination and feedback.  This allows for a much broader dissemination of information about CCLI-funded projects than might otherwise be possible.    The anticipated outcomes of the showcase event are a better informed computer science education community and increased interest in submitting proposals to the CCLI program.",
