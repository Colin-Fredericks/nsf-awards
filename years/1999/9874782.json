The EPSCoR Strategic Plan is the cornerstone of the Commonwealth's overall plan to strengthen scientific research and is one of the key strategies being utilized to enhance Puerto Rico's economic competitiveness.  EPSCoR support of research thrust areas will strengthen Puerto Rico's scientific research environment by:  1) expanding the number of scientists and raising the quality of competitive research in areas that are key to Commonwealth's economic advancement; 2) elevating the level and number of human resources needed to sustain strong R&D activity; and 3) promoting new economic development through an alliance of academia, government and industry in Puerto Rico, as well as with mainland entities.  Puerto Rico will employ a multifaceted approach to achieve its EPSCoR goals, attain national Research and Development standards, and meet local Science and Technology requisites for economic stimulation. Infrastructure enhancement activities will include:  1) strengthening academic basic research and new researchers in the scientific community; 2) fostering levels of national competitiveness in the selected research thrust areas; 3) obtaining major research instrumentation; 4) developing human resources,",
