 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bertram\r\n9981822\r\n     The investigator uses mathematical models to study dynamical\r\nand biophysical mechanisms for the multiple modes of bursting\r\nobserved in pancreatic Beta-cells.  In pancreatic islets,\r\nBeta-cells burst with a period of 10-30 seconds, while isolated\r\nBeta-cells burst with periods of either 2-5 seconds or 1-2\r\nminutes.  The primary goal of this project is to answer the\r\nfollowing questions: (1) How does a single oscillator (the\r\nBeta-cell) produce such a wide range of bursting behaviors?  (2)\r\nWhat biophysical mechanisms drive the different modes of\r\nbursting?  (3) Why does the bursting behavior differ between\r\nisolated cells and intact islets?  To address these questions the\r\ninvestigator  develops a family of mathematical models that\r\nemploy several slow variables.  He studies how well these models\r\nreproduce key electrophysiological and calcium imaging data from\r\nisolated Beta-cells, cell clusters, and intact islets.\r\n     Pancreatic Beta-cells are the only cells in the human body\r\nthat secrete insulin, a hormone required by other cells to\r\nprocess sugars in the blood.  If Beta-cells function improperly\r\nthen late-onset diabetes occurs, the most common form of\r\ndiabetes.  Insulin is secreted from Beta-cells when the cells\r\ngenerate electrical impulses, so understanding the electrical\r\nactivity of Beta-cells is crucial to understanding insulin\r\nsecretion.  For many years mathematical models have provided\r\ninsight into the complex electrical behavior of Beta-cells.  In\r\nthe current project, the investigator develops improved\r\nmathematical models to understand how Beta-cells produce patterns\r\nof electrical impulses that are key to normal insulin secretion.\r\nOnly when these normal patterns are understood can abnormal\r\nelectrical activity, and abnormal insulin secretion resulting in\r\ndiabetes, be understood.\r\n",
