 "awd_abstract_narration": "9903866\r\nDunn\r\nFor over 30 years the Navy has operated the South Florida Test Facility (SFTF) in south Florida.  Located at the closest position to the Gulf Stream along the US coast, the site is unique in its access to both shallow and deep water very near to a land.  More recently, Florida Atlantic University gained a shore side engineering laboratory at the south end of the SFTF underwater range.  With an emphasis on ocean sensors, acoustics and marine vehicles, the department has a natural synergy with NSWC-CD facility.  These factors, the natural congruency of their interests, and the inclusion of strongly interested parties from the University of Miami (UM-RASMAS), the University of South Florida's Department of Marine Science, NOAA-AOML in Miami, and Harbor Branch brought a consortium together in early 1997.  Included in this consortium are contributions of staff, equipment, operating support, and facilities.  In particular, the facilities include the SFTF underwater test range as well as the land campus resources of NSU, FAU, and NSRDC-CD.  The potential that this partnership created resulted in special funding being provided through ONR to support specific enhancements to the SFTF off-shore range instrumentation and to support a series of demonstration scientific and technology development programs designed to take advantage of the features of the area.  In essence this was a program to examine the efficacy of the SFOMC concept and how this range can be used by the interested academic community.\r\n\r\nThe program herein seeks to strengthen this unique effort through a workshop to discuss the benefits, challenges, thrusts, and potential results of this collaborative endeavor.  The focus of the workshop will be on the technological and scientific issues that SFOMC is suited to address as well as the manner in which SFOMC should best be organized and operated in order to realize its full potential.  In addition, it will be the purpose of the workshop to generalize the findings of the workshop where appropriate so as to derive lessons that can have value for potential similar efforts.  The result of the workshop will e a widely distributed report based on findings generated during the workshop by the participants.\r\n\r\n",
