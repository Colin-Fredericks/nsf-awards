 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of organic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is important if these devices are to attain their potential for display engineering.  Improvements in contacts and bulk transport are required.  The flexibility to modify contacts in a controlled fashion will be important for incorporating new polymeric transparent electrodes or stable high work function metals into organic devices.  The most critical remaining problems in organic devices, and particularly in light-emitting diode technology, are related to charge injection and transport physics.  Stability is thought to be the primary limitation in device operating lifetime.  The variety of device applications rely on a deep understanding of  I-V characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes, and  increased understanding  may guide the systematic manipulation of materials.  Current-voltage characteristics will be measured in both emission-limited and space charge limited injection regimes.  In the high field regime electroluminescence, photoluminescence, Raman and current-voltage characteristics will be measured.  A theoretical study of I-V characteristics of emission limited contacts will be carried out.  The high-field stability of polarons and the field dependence of mobility in disordered electronic polymers will be investigated.  This project may be relevant to the development of dipolar interlayers to reduce operating voltages of organic devices and permit stable metals to be used as contacts.",
