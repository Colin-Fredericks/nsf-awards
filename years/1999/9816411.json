Biochemical and genetic analyses of the bacterial and eukaryotic systems have shown that many proteins cross these membranes via an evolutionarily conserved pore. The mechanisms and energetics seem to be distinct and much has to be learned about the roles of the components involved in this process. Sequence comparisons suggest that organisms of the third domain of life, the archaea, contain a combination of homologs of the bacterial and eukaryotic protein translocation components, suggesting that some aspects of protein translocation through the cytoplasmic membrane of these organisms are unique. However, protein translocation studies in archaea, have been limited to sequence comparisons. This research is aimed at studying an archaeal protein translocation system. The specific aims of the project are: 1. To clone and sequence archaeal homologs of known protein translocation components, and provide necessary tools to study and validate the experimental system; and 2. To use a biochemical approach and reverse genetics to purify proteins associated with the archaeal translocon. In addition to identifying H. volcanii homologs of the known bacterial and eukaryotic protein translocation machinery, this research may lead to the isolation of archaea-specific components, or components that have not been previously identified in bacteria and eukaryotes. Gaining insights into archaeal protein translocation may help us to obtain a better understanding of this conserved process all domains of life, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.\r\n\r\nThe ability to transport proteins across hydrophobic membranes is fundamental to the growth and survival of all cells. For example, in eukaryotes, secreted antibodies are essential for the defense against pathogens. On the other hand, many prokaryotes secrete toxins, which are central features of their pathogenicity. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which proteins traverse the membranes may allow us to modulate the secretion of pathogenic compounds as well as optimize defense mechanisms against them. Prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes also secrete enzymes to scavenge extracellular molecules. Many of these proteins have useful biotechnology applications. Understanding protein export mechanisms will help in the overexpression of recombinant secreted proteins. The archaea, which, along with bacteria and eukaryotes comprise one of the three domains of life, represent a relatively unexplored area in our study of protein translocation. An exploration of the biology of protein translocation in these organisms will not only shed light on novel processes by which proteins traverse hydrophobic archaeal membranes, but will also provide new insights into the mechanisms of previously identified bacterial and eukaryotic protein translocation systems.\r\n \r\n",
