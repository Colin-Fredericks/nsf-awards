 "awd_abstract_narration": "Girls and women in our society are lost to the fields of science and mathematics that they grow through adolescence, and deprived of these opportunities for creativity, fulfillment, and income. Serious inequities result. The situation is unusually negative for Latina students, especially those born in this country. This collaboration between the School of the Americas, a bilingual Detroit public school, and Eastern Michigan University brings both academics research and school-systems resources to bear on the problem.\r\n\r\nThis project will answer the question: Can poor girls in a bilingual school develop and retain positive attitudes toward science and mathematics through combining transactional  writing and storytelling by positive role models? The students are in critical levels, grades six through eight.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on successful work whose results will transfer to this setting a bilingual public school in a poor neighborhood. The previous study is \"Empowering  Women and Girls to Win at Mathematics.\" Transactional writing and role-model-relevant story-telling programs offer promising and ingenious methodologies for drawing female students into continuing involvement with mathematics. The rigorous research design includes experimental and control groups and pre- and post-testing, and will give a clear answer to the important question we are addressing.\r\n",
