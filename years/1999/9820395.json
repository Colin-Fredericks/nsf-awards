Fofana                      \r\n\r\n\r\nThis REU Site focuses on industrial projects in manufacturing engineering.  The site is for three years and each year a different group of nine talented junior/senior undergraduate students will carry out research on the Worcester Polytechnic Institute campus and local industrial sites for a nine-week summer internship period.  The faculty and industrial mentorship teams assembled for each project group will include three interns who will carry out ongoing research in the focus area.  Each research topic is short, self-contained and considers cutting-edge problems that will challenge each group.  Each topic has been carefully selected so that a positive, successful experience will encourage a student in selecting a career in manufacturing engineering.  The common theme of manufacturing engineering provides considerable interaction between the three project groups.  All interns will have access to several WPI state-of-the-art mechanical engineering laboratories and computational facilities and local industrial sites.  Recruitment of summer interns will be from the following four groups: 1) WPI programs; 2) minority institutions; 3) women, and 4) undergraduates from four year schools that have a small or nonexistent research base.  Selection of the interns will be based upon their career objectives, academic qualifications and past work experiences.  Each student will be contacted by the faculty and industrial mentors prior to the summer internship so that they have a clear understanding of the project and what role they will play in the project group.  Each project group will present their findings at the interim and the internship will conclude with a presentation session.  A final group report will be required at the end of the internship.  Students will be encouraged to present their findings at a conference and possibly publish a journal paper.\r\n\r\nThis summer research experience will provide students with a glimpse of the way that manufacturing engineering is used in the real world through the utilization of CAD/CAM, finite element analysis, axiomatic theory, hardware development, etc.  Furthermore, this experience will provide an opportunity for participants to apply theoretical topics traditionally found in undergraduate programs to industrial and research applications.\r\n",
