 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe principal investigators will study various issues involving stochastic differential equations (hereafter SDEs).  These include numerical approximations of expectations of both functions and functionals of solutions of SDEs, whether they be diffusions or more generally Markov processes with jumps.  Models inspired by Stochastic Finance theory will receive  attention; one example is forward-backward SDEs, where a general weak existence and uniqueness theorem is sought.  Further a special emphasis is devoted to filtering theory where a new Monte Carlo approach is developed, and also a martingale problem approach will be tried to treat the infinite dimensional case.  Stochastic partial differential equations will be studied via a new method of viscosity solutions, hopefully yielding existence, uniqueness and stability results in the fully nonlinear case.  Quasi-linear backward SDEs will be studied with an eye to applications in Stochastic Finance theory; in addition several problems in Finance theory will be treated directly, including complete markets with jumps and competitive price equilibria in incomplete markets.\r\n\tThe principal investigators of this project study stochastic differential  equations.  A differential equation models phenomena that vary with time,  dealing with rates of change.  A stochastic differential equation includes the  possibility that the change comes from random forces.  Examples of  applications can be found in modeling radio and x-ray transmissions, and  cellular telephone signals, where the randomness comes from static noise;  biological examples where growth of viruses and plants have a random  component; and also in banking and finance where interest rate models,  commodity prices, and securities prices are modeled with random components.   The stochastic differential equations are complicated and sophisticated and  cannot be solved with explicit solutions: the desired quantities need to be  approximated by using a high speed computer.  Efficient algorithms are needed  and these methods are not yet well understood; by consequence the practitioner  has a choice to use models that are too simple but with methods that work, or  models that better approximate the true state of nature but for which methods  work poorly, if at all.  We propose to remedy this situation to a large extent  by developing algorithms that work for the better models, and in addition we  propose to quantify to what extent the models are effective.",
