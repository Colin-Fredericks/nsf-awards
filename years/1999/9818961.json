Each unit is expected to take between one and three weeks of classroom time.  The units are designed so they can be used as supplementary units for a traditional or a reform-based core curriculum.  This design is based on the belief that all students will benefit from a better understanding of mathematics that is important in the workplace.  The inclusion of a focus on reform-based curricula is a recognition of the need for continued renewal of context/applications based approaches to teaching and learning mathematics.  A system is being set in place to provide for the continual renewal of this curriculum theme through the development, review, and field testing of new units.  The initial set of 35 units is being produced in print and electronic format by the COMAP author team, who along with a distinguished advisory board sets formats for submission of continuing units from the field.\r\n\r\n",
