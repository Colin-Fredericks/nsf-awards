 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award examines the molecular basis of neuronal diversity. The nervous system contains tremendous numbers of specialized  neurons that communicate with one another at distinct points of contact called synapses. Synaptic function underlies learning and memory and dysfunction of the synapse underlies many neurological disorders. As a neuron develops, it must express the molecules needed for synaptic communication. Amongst these molecules are the neurotransmitter receptors that receive the signal transmitted at the synapse. One important class of neurotransmitter receptors are those that bind to the neurotransmitter glutamate. If these receptors are improperly expressed, the function of the nervous system is disrupted.\r\n\r\nThe experiments supported by this NSF award will identify genes required for the expression of the NMDA subtypes of glutamate receptors. An experimental strategy that utilizes the tools of molecular biology and genetics  will be used to discover genes that regulate the expression of these receptors in the simple model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The NMDA receptors are most recognized as being involved in simple forms of associative learning and also play important roles in many neurological disorders.\r\n\r\nThis proposal integrates research into the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal function with the early training of undergraduates in the practice and theory of scientific inquiry. The studies will provide a detailed molecular-based understanding of the gene products required for the expression, assembly and localization of NMDA receptors in C. elegans. The strategy takes advantage of the powerful genetic techniques that enable rapid identification of gene products in this model organism. Almost all gene products required for synaptic function are conserved between simple organisms and humans. Therefore, the results of this research can be applicable to the study of the human nervous system.\r\n",
