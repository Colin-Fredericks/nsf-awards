Technical\r\n\r\nProtein folding, assembly and conformational change are coupled to\r\noperator recognition by the Cro repressor of bacteriophage lambda.  Cro\r\nis among the simplest and most studied DNA binding proteins.  A dimer of\r\n66 residue subunits is the functional repressor.  Recent work from the\r\nPI's laboratory indicates that the relevant free species is not a dimer,\r\nbut a folded monomer.  Protein assembly is therefore an integral step in\r\noperator binding.  Dimer interface residues undergo substantial\r\nrearrangement in formation of either the monomer or the Cro-operator\r\ncomplex.  The overall goal of this proposal is to quantify the\r\ncontributions of linked folding, assembly and conformational processes\r\nto operator binding. The Cro monomer predominates at the nanomolar\r\nconcentrations relevant for the DNA binding reaction, but becomes a\r\nminority species at the micromolar to millimolar concentrations that are\r\nconvenient for spectroscopy.  Thermodynamic and mutant studies have lead to\r\nthe hypothesis that it resembles an engineered Cro variant in which\r\ndimerization has been blocked by an insertion.  If this hypothesis is\r\ncorrect, the natural assembly mechanism of the Cro dimer involves the\r\nexchange of equivalent intramolecular contacts for intermolecular\r\ncontacts, a \"domain swap\".  Recent data on single-chain dimers\r\nexpressed from fused tandem Cro genes suggests that dimer assembly is a\r\nlimiting step in the formation of Cro-operator complexes. Objective 1 is to\r\ncharacterize the monomeric Cro species.  a) Assays for the monomeric\r\nspecies will be developed. Monomeric variants will be identified in genetic\r\nand affinity chromatography screens of combinatorial protein expression\r\nlibraries.  Dimer dissociation will be monitored by fluorescence and\r\nsedimentation equilibrium.  b) Protein sequences and solution conditions\r\nwill be identified to populate the native monomer at equilibrium and as\r\nkinetic intermediates.  c) The structure and dynamics of the monomeric\r\nspecies will be characterized by spectroscopy.  The thermodynamic and\r\ngenetic stability profiles of the Cro monomer and engineered monomers will\r\nbe compared.  Objective 2 is to determine the mechanism of assembly of Cro\r\ndimers.  Stopped-flow fluorescence and circular dichroism will be used to\r\nstudy protein folding and assembly reactions.  The kinetics of DNA binding\r\nwill be determined by spectroscopic and electrophoretic mobility shift\r\nassays. Objective 3 is to determine the energetic consequences of linkage.\r\nIsothermal titration calorimetry will be used to compare the energetics of\r\nDNA recognition by engineered monomers, covalent dimers and wild type Cro\r\nproteins.  The contributions of linked folding and assembly equilibria and\r\nsystematic variations in the physical linkage between subunits will be\r\nassessed.\r\n\r\n2. General\r\n\r\nProteins assemble at specific sites on DNA to initiate the readout of\r\ngenetic information.  To complete the expression of genetic information,\r\npolypeptide chains must fold and assemble into functional proteins.\r\nMechanistic and thermodynamic descriptions of these fundamental\r\nprocesses will advance our understanding of living systems.  This\r\nproposal describes studies of linked folding, assembly and DNA\r\nrecognition processes in a simple model system.  At low concentrations,\r\nthe Cro repressor of bacteriophage lambda exists as isolated inactive\r\nsubunits.  The unfavorable assembly of pairs of subunits to form the\r\nfunctional dimer limits operator DNA binding.  The coupling of protein\r\nfolding and assembly to DNA binding appears to be a key factor in the\r\nregulation of viral development.  Three objectives are proposed: a) to\r\ncharacterize the folded monomeric intermediate, b) to determine the\r\nmechanism of dimer assembly and c) to compare the energetics of DNA\r\nrecognition by wild type Cro and artificially engineered variants that\r\nare fixed in either the monomeric or dimeric states.  Techniques to be\r\nused include directed and combinatorial mutagenesis, production and\r\ncharacterization of recombinant protein variants, fluorescence, circular\r\ndichroism and NMR spectroscopy, rapid mixing techniques for kinetic\r\nanalysis and isothermal titration calorimetry.\r\n\r\n",
