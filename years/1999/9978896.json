 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UC Berkeley Excellence and Diversity in Graduate Education in Science, Engineering and Mathematics Coalition (The Berkeley Edge) requests a grant of $500,000 per year for five years from the National Science Foundation. The Berkeley Edge's goal is to double the numbers of minority students who earn doctoral degrees in science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) and to prepare underrepresented minorities to advance into the highest ranks of the scientific profession, including the professoriate. The Berkeley Edge includes the graduate minority support programs in Engineering, Chemistry, the Physical Sciences, and the Biological Sciences, with close coordination with Berkeley's SEM minority support programs at the undergraduate level. Berkeley will institute new programs in the SEM disciplines, disseminate best practices and approaches consistently across the SEM departments and colleges, formalize and institutionalize discipline-based graduate minority support programs, and link efforts at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The MGE award will enable Berkeley, the largest producer of Ph.D. recipients in SEM, to initiate a meaningful collaboration with HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions that are the largest producers of minority BA/BS recipients in SEM.",
