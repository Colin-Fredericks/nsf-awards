The project is aimed primarily at those teachers who are new to teaching chemistry.  The materials will focus on those content and pedagogy topics likely to provide them with very deep understanding of chemistry and related science and mathematics content in the curricula they currently teach.  Assessment of teacher knowledge serves as the core of these materials and will be delivered using the World Wide Web.  Immediately upon submission of responses, teachers will receive feedback -- detailed, computer-calculated tutoring in the case of computer-graded responses, and model answers or keys for responses that are to be 'hand' graded. The materials will be made available widely throughout the US through traditional licensing arrangements to non-partner schools.  A low cost service for delivering the materials to teachers enrolled in academic programs throughout the US will be established.  All of the materials will be publicly available over the WWW. There are over 30 participating institutions.  The project is expected to serve at least 270 teachers, each receiving 18 credit hours( over 270 hours) towards a masters degree.  The project is expected to run through 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
