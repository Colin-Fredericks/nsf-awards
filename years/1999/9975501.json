 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural systems consisting of reinforced concrete columns with steel beams (so-called RCS systems) have been shown to be cost-effective comparing to traditional steel or reinforced concrete construction.  However, the lack of behavioral information and design criteria for RCS systems has hindered their use in high seismic regions.  \r\n\r\nThis project will synthesize the latest research information about RCS and to prepare design criteria and guidelines that will enable practicing engineers to design RCS systems that will reliably survive large earthquakes.  Work is needed to careful study and analyze the latest Japanese research so as to quantify the underlying mechanics and behavior of RCS systems.  Questions such as whether component testing and analyses sufficiently demonstrate the reliability of RCS frames for high seismic regions, etc will be addressed.  \r\n\r\nSpecific tasks to be undertaken in this project are:\r\n\r\nAssemble, review and study available data from the US-Japan Projects on RCS connections and systems, and synthesize these into seismic design criteria for composite RCS frames.  The design criteria will consider two formats-one that follows procedures used in current codes and standards in the US, and a second that explores performance-based approaches following related initiatives within the earthquake engineering community.\r\n\r\nAssess the potential objectives, merits and limitations of large-scale frame testing of RCS systems using pseudo-dynamic and shake table methods.  This would include a review of prior US-Japan projects where large-scale frames were tested and assessment of how large-scale frame tests may answer unresolved issues for RCS frame structures.\r\n\r\nSubject to the findings of objective (2), develop a detailed planning document for one or more large-scale frame tests that could be conducted in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
