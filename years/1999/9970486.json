The goal is to determine  the structure of the von Neumann algebras that reflect the properties of (quantum) non commutative probability, and to relate this structure to the representation theory of Lie groups  and their discrete subgroups.  An invariant for such von Neumann algebras,  which will be investigated in this project, comes from the  analysis of the  structure of convex sets, consisting of noncommutative moments associated with these von Neumann algebras.  This approach is related to Voiculescu's free entropy, where the (renormalized) asymptotic measure of such sets plays an essential role.\r\n\r\n The operator algebras  studied in this project are  related to the  atom model introduced by Wigner.  His  approach, while  philosophically relying on Heisenberg's Uncertaneity Principle, was based on the theory of  random matrices. The random matrices  have also numerous other applications in prediction theory or atmospheric science.   A surprising, recent, discovery, by Voiculescu, shows that the random matrices are, the asymptotic generators for the von Neumann algebras associated to quantum probability.\r\n The aim of this project is to develop  a conceptual relation between the random matrices in  von Neumann algebras and the  quantization theory.  Such a development would probably explain the complementarity between the two theories (random matrices versus infinite matrices) and hence would hopefully give new tools to solve a number of long-standing problems   in these areas.\r\n",
