As part of this Divisional activity, a  workshop on future Marine Geology and Geophysics research was held in late 1996 to identify critical research questions in the next millennium. That workshop recommended a series of smaller meetings to be focused on infrastructure needs and requirements with which to address the identified research priorities. This award requests support to hold a workshop on marine seismic reflection needs for the U.S. marine geoscience community, a critically important capability in understanding the geology of the seafloor.\r\n\r\nPrimary objectives of the workshop are: (1) to identify the seismic reflection requirements of future programs, (2) to identify the technologies that will be required to meet these requirements, (3) to identify required improvements in data quality, archiving and access, and (4) to examine methods of support and infrastructure maintenance. Publication of the workshop proceedings and initial recommendations will be initially web based to allow additional community input. A hard copy publication is planned after assimilation of this community reaction. \r\n***\r\n",
