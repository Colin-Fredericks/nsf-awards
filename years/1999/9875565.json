The research program proposes experiments in three critical and related areas of the physics of  superconductors: the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, the suppression of  superconductivity in two-dimensions, and the interactions of an unconventional superconductor with local perturbations. It is the high-resolution tunneling microscopy, together with the imaging and atomic manipulation capabilities of our state-of-the-art scanning tunneling microscope (STM), that make the proposed research possible.  With this tool, we can make significant contributions to research in superconductivity and, moreover, we are in a position to address a wide range of problems in condensed matter physics.  The educational component of this program involves the development of a new course to provide theoretical and practical knowledge of STM and related instruments to advanced undergraduates  and beginning graduate students in a wide range of disciplines, from physics to biology. \r\n%%%\r\nUsing the newly developed scanning probe microscopes, it is now possible to image, manipulate, and probe properties of a variety of materials, from semiconductors to biological samples on very short length scales.  Using these techniques experiments will be performed in three critical areas of the physics of superconductors.  This research program is complemented by the development of a new course in scanning probe microscopy, which will introduce state-of-the-art techniques to graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of disciplines in the physical and biological sciences. \r\n***\r\n",
