This facility will make available specialized equipment and technical support resources to allow faculty imaging capabilities in analysis of research data and the potential to develop visually-based course materials for undergraduate and graduate education.  The networked nature of this distributed facility will allow sharing of resources and the rapid exchange of image rich information.  Initially users will include researchers and educators from the Medical School in San Juan and the Rio Piedras and Mayaguez campuses of the University of Puerto Rico, with subsequent attention to the needs of researchers associated with the NAIC Arecibo Observatory and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry.  A Visualization Resource Development Center, a Scientific Visualization Center and an Image Processing Center will be located at the Mayaguez campus and a Scientific Visualization Center will be placed at the Rio Piedras campus.  This infrastructure will allow researchers in Puerto Rico from many different subject areas to take full advantage of the rich opportunities provided by high performance computing and Internet II connectivity.  Important collaborations with mainland researchers may also become feasible.\r\n",
