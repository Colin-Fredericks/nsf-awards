To achieve a high sensitivity to electric field, the microscope will use a nano-electronic device, the Single Electron Transistor (SET), as its sensor.  In operation, the SET sensor will be cooled to the 4.2 to 10 K range while the samples will be in air at room temperature.  The hot and cold parts of the system will be thermally isolated from each other by vacuum and a thin transparent window.  After it is constructed, the microscope will be used to image the fields produced by voltages on wires in multi-chip modules and computer chips that will be provided by our industrial collaborators (Neocera, Inc).    We will evaluate the performance of the system and its potential for application to failure analysis detection of open circuit faults in semiconductor circuits.  For real chips mounted on standard carriers, our overall goal for the project will be to achieve a spatial resolution in the 50 um range while looking from a distance of 300 um, more than sufficient for present needs for diagnosing opens in multi-chip modules.\r\n%%% \r\nThis GOALI proposal involves a close collaboration between the University of Maryland and a small high-tech company (Neocera, Inc.) and with other potential industrial customers.  While students are developing the electric field microscope, they will not only undertake state-of-the-art research on nano-electronics but will also get exposed to modern manufacturing techniques in the computer industry. To keep the project on track, the students will work closely with the companies involved and will meet regularly with industrial physicists and engineers in an industrial environment. During the project, the students will also have the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs, company presidents, and potential customers, from very large to very small companies.  In addition to providing students with a technical mastery of key technology and science, the project will also offer a breadth of experience that will prepare them for industrial research positions or an entrepreneurial role.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
