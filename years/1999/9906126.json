 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the role played by scholastic theories of matter, particularly those emanating from alchemy, in the formation of early modern atomism. Since the seventeenth century marks the period when corpuscular matter-theories first acquired a detailed experimental component, and since much of the evidence was drawn from existing chemical theory and practice, there is a compelling need for scholarship to address the particular debt of early modern atomism to alchemy. From the late Middle Ages, alchemists had been professing a theory that metals and minerals were composed of \"minimal parts\" or corpuscles at the microlevel. This alchemical theory was itself partially dependent on Aristotelian concepts of matter which it passed on, in modified form, to central figures in the formulation of the seventeenth-century \"mechanical philosophy,\" such as Robert Boyle. As the P.I. has elsewhere argued, Boyle's corpuscular theory of matter was heavily influenced by the work of Daniel Sennert, a professor of medicine at the University of Wittenberg. Sennert, in turn, was an important intermediary in the transmission of late medieval alchemical corpuscularism, as found in the thirteenth-century Summa perfectionis of \"Geber.\" The current project will therefore consist of a thorough analysis of Sennert's corpuscular theory and its sources. This will include a short visit (three weeks are projected) to Germany, in order to determine if any manuscript or archival materials of Sennert's remain there. The bulk of the project, however, will consist of a close reading of Sennert's extensive works - in their various editions. Since Sennert adopted atomism only after publishing several works, and made important modifications to his matter theory in successive editions, it is imperative to gather microfilms of as many versions of his works as possible - a task already begun several years ago by the applicant. This research will result in a new understanding of the forces that led early seventeenth-century thinkers such as Sennert suddenly to abandon the hallowed peripatetic notion that matter was a continuum in favor of atomism. Since Sennert and his generation provided the direct foundation upon which the \"mechanical philosophers\" would build, an explanation of his voile face would cast important new light on the origins of modern science.",
