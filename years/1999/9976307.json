 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and Organizational Change Program, this research focuses on organizational learning using an evolutionary model to provide managers with a set of rules or guidelines that will permit their companies and organizations to evolve more rapidly in desirable directions.  These rules might deal with the appropriate number of business units, promotion policies, or team-based decision making, among other organizational characteristics, and apply in a range of organizations from business to schools and universities.\r\n\r\nThe researchers see a useful analogy between genes and decision rules.  A decision rule produces a continuing stream of decisions that direct activity and in some sense determine the identity of an organization. This work involves understanding how abstract evolutionary mechanisms are (or can be) actually embodied in organizations and shaped by managers\r\n\r\nThe researchers will perform evolutionary audits to collect data on the evolutionary potential of several partner companies and a local school  The evolutionary audits will aid in the development of a computer simulation model of organizational evolution. The data collected and the model built will form a foundation for in-depth explorations of how managers can create an organization that will evolve quickly in the direction they desire. Partners including Price Waterhouse Coopers, Arthur Andersen, Pugh Roberts Associates, Eastman Chemicals, General Motors and  in Providence, Rhode Island. \r\n\r\nThe results of this study would provide a set of guidelines that will permit organizations to evolve more rapidly in desirable directions.\r\n",
