The researchers intend to employ variable and constant irradiance regimes in lab states under nutrient limiting conditions and within a vertically mixing water column.  They will also draw upon an array of remote sensing technology and extrapolate findings to build a data set useful in primary productivity modeling.  The U.S.-Czech team's complementary expertise in phytoplankton physiology and productivity modeling benefits from the Czech partner's parallel collaboration with colleague, Richard Geider of the Marine Biological Association of the U.K. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, results should show susceptibility of primary productivity to photoinhibition and the relationship between variable fluorescence parameters and overall rates of photosynthesis and growth. The consolidated database would be useful to a variety of ecologists and algal physiologists who have interest in ocean monitoring. If successful, this should improve parameterization of key biological variables in phytoplankton productivity models thereby making global models more reliable for interpreting satellite observed chlorophyll fields in world oceans. \r\n\r\nThis international project in biological oceanography fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. \r\n",
