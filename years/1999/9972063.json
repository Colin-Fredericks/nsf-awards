 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the dynamics associated with change\r\nof configurations in filaments.  The theory of elastic filaments\r\nis used as a paradigm to describe the different types of\r\ninstabilities, the self-organization of filamentary structures\r\nand the propagation of waves.  The investigator considers\r\ngeneralization of the Kirchhoff model to include the effect of\r\ngrowth (as found in many biological process), general\r\ncross-sections (with application to the dynamics of ribbons) and\r\nviscous effects and perform a dynamical systems and bifurcation\r\nanalysis of the equilibrium configurations.  This analysis is\r\ncompleted by the derivation and analysis of amplitude equations\r\nfor the behavior of the solution close to the instability.  This\r\nproject relies on the effective combination of different methods\r\nsuch as perturbation theory, dynamical system analysis, amplitude\r\nequations for partial differential equations, and numerical\r\nanalysis.\r\n     Filamentary structures can be observed in nature at all\r\nscales from the microscopic chains of molecules, DNA and\r\npolymers, to the macroscopic braided magnetic flux tubes in solar\r\nflares.  One of the central problems in filaments is to\r\nunderstand the possible changes of configurations and the\r\ndynamics involved in the changes.  Remarkably, despite their\r\ndifferent length scales and microscopic structures, unstable\r\nfilaments seem to follow universal configurational changes such\r\nas writhing, coiling, super-coiling, and looping.  The purpose of\r\nthis project is to study the dynamics associated with the change\r\nof configurations in filaments.  This will provide a better\r\nunderstanding of universal changes and self-organization of\r\nfilaments, with applications to DNA configurations, structure of\r\npolymers, evolution of biological fibers, and cable kinking.",
