 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970291\r\nSchuttler\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research on the development of a controlled, numerical perturbative approach  for solving Hubbard-type strongly correlated electron models in the near-filled band regime, relevant to the cuprate superconductors.  The perturbative expansion approach exploits the recently discovered strong suppression of the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion, due to screening by charge fluctuations in near-half-filled large-U Hubbard systems, in order to generate accurate, controlled high-order approximations to the exact solution of the model.\r\n\r\nThe iterative solution of the self-consistent perturbative equations requires the numerical evaluation of high-order self-energy and polarization insertion Feynman diagrams on large space-time lattices.  This is accomplished by means of high-dimensional Monte Carlo summation techniques which are efficiently implemented on massively parallel high performance computers.  The validity of the approach is established by inclusion of next-higher-order corrections and by comparison to exact Monte Carlo results for small finite-dimensional, as well as zero-and infinite-dimensional model systems.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                             The primary application of this approach is a detailed microscopic investigation of possible incipient charge and spin instabilities, possible competing d- and s-wave pairing instabilities and their underlying pairing mechanism, pseudo-gap formation, and possible cross-over between Fermi-and non-Fermi-liquid behavior, in two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D Hubbard and extended Hubbard model systems.  Model results for the dynamical single-particle, charge and spin correlations are compared to angle-resolved photo-emission, optical and DC conductivity, electron energy loss, inelastic x-ray scattering, and inelastic neutron scattering data obtained in the cuprate materials.  Important extensions of this work will include local field, multi-band and electron-phonon effects and will address questions such as the isotope effect, polaronic instabilities, and superconductivity-related phonon anomalies within a unified microscopic treatment.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will shed light on questions of fundamental importance in the micrscopic theory of the cuprate superconductors. The numerical perturbative expansion approach developed therein has considerable potential for wider applications in the general area of correlated electron physics.\r\n***\r\n",
