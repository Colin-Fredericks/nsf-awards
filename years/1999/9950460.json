 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the national standards now in place, good elementary school science teachers not only need to have a firm grasp of the science content they teach, but they also must be able to lead their students in scientific inquiry. This latter requirement proceeds directly from the belief that children learn science best when it is inquiry-based. Unfortunately, prospective teachers apparently do not learn the analytical skills needed for inquiry-based science simply by having the process modeled to them in their own course work. They need explicit instruction in these analysis skills in order to carry out their own scientific explorations.\r\n\r\nThis project is utilizing methods derived from research in science education and cognitive psychology to develop units in scientific analysis for prospective elementary school teachers. Students learn integrated process skills such as identifying and controlling variables, designing experiments, and problem solving, and the metacognitive skills related to these endeavors. Students successfully completing these units are expected to have the skills needed to engage in scientific inquiry and the ability to lead others in inquiry as well. The written and recorded materials being developed are general and extensive enough to allow faculty at other institutions to sequence these units within or after their already existing content courses, or they may combine these units with an interdisciplinary science course that is being made available as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
