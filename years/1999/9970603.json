 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cohomological varieties for finite groups over fields of\r\ncharacteristic dividing the order of the groups reflect many important\r\ncohomological and topological properties of the groups.  But these\r\ncohomological varieties are not naturally realized in contrast to the\r\ncohomological varieties of restricted Lie algebras, which are realized as the nilpotent cones of the Lie algebras up to finite maps.  The proposed research will construct a realization of the cohomological varieties for finite groups of Lie type in terms of the cohomological varieties of the corresponding Lie algebras.  Using the actions of algebraic groups on the cohomological varieties of restricted Lie algebras, the support varieties of modules for finite groups can be computed.  An important task is to establish the relation between finite groups and restricted Lie algebras. Other areas of research includes studying relations among representation theories of algebraic groups, Lie algebras, finite groups, and quantum groups from the aspects of cohomology theory. \r\n\r\n\r\nGroups, Lie algebras, and quantum groups are mathematical objects that\r\narise from geometry and physics as symmetries, fields, and operators. They have broad connections to other areas of mathematics and other disciplines outside mathematics.  The investigator's special interest is to meld the representation and cohomological theories of these objects and to study their inter-relations.\r\n",
