Archived sounds will be digitized at 96 kHz and 24 bits and stored in standard DVD format. This facilitates cloning, backup, and distribution in a form accessible by all users. Digital storage will result in a 5-fold increase in the rate of archiving new materials and a 70-fold improvement in the rate that remote users can retrieve archived sounds and data. \r\n\r\nCornell University is a major center for bioacoustics training and research, and its Library of Natural Sounds hosts the world's largest collection of animal sounds.  This collection is already used for basic research, generation of acoustical censusing guides for conservation and management programs, K-12 and university courses, public information efforts, and media productions by public television and radio, National Geographic Society, and a variety of commercial firms.  Digitization of the collection will significantly enhance all current applications and enable several new approaches (e.g. broad comparative studies) that have been impossible given magnetic tape storage formats. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
