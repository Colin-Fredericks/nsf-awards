The MHD energy bypass engine design concept is an unique magntchydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass augmented air-breathing ejector ramjet engine.  This research project will include a higher order analysis focused on the critical elements of the engine design concept.  The simulation will model the plasma and the magnetic field interaction of both MHD generator and the MHD accelerator.  To optimize the performance of the engine and stabilize the interaction between the magnetic field, boundary layer, and the plasma in the MHD channels, a learning neural network control system will be defined and incorporated into the computer code to analyze the engine cycle and determine the performance of the engine.  Textron Systems have design codes used to design MHD systems similar to the proposed MHD ejector ramjet engine.  Princeton is developing MHD accelerator codes as part of their current hypersonic windtunnel formulation and evaluation program.\r\n\r\nThis project will fund the first stage of what is hoped to become a multi-year effort by a cross-disciplinary team to address control, MHD and design issues, both in simulation and in new experiments.\r\n***\r\n",
