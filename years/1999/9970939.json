Such networks are assembled, reshaped and taken apart as components move in and out of communication range.  This project develops  software engineering methods and an associated software infrastructure to facilitate rapid construction of dependable mobile applications executing over ad hoc networks.  Several mobile applications are developed for demonstration and evaluation purposes.  They will involve collaborative exploration of unknown environments, cooperative behaviors in a competitive setting, and group learning activities.  Formal techniques are employed for reasoning about mobile computations and in the verification of algorithms needed to solve problems that are fundamental to mobile computing.  The research seeks to identify novel coordination constructs that support transient interactions among mobile components, have cleanly defined semantics, have efficient implementations, and simplify programming.  The choice of constructs will be driven by the need to build self-adaptive components able to function correctly in open systems under a minimalist set of operating assumptions.  Ease of programming is achieved by making component interactions transparent to the programming effort, i.e., implicit in the definition of the coordination constructs.\r\n",
