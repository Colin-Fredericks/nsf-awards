 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972944\r\nParsons\r\n\r\nThe Engage program is a successful and exciting new approach to first year engineering studies at the University of Tennessee.  This National Science Foundation project will a) fund transition costs to scale the program up from pilot courses to the total engineering freshman class, b) add educational enhancements and enrichment programs to the plan, c) allow the expansion of the process to the upper years of the undergraduate curriculum, and d) effectively disseminate the process of these reforms to other universities and junior college feeder programs.\r\n\r\nThis initiative is a comprehensive approach to the educational needs of entering freshmen, from personal development and socialization to a new first year curriculum that builds on the educational lessons learned in the last eight years by the NSF Coalitions.  The program establishes an environment of collaborative learning with faculty as mentors, it integrates the subject matter of the freshman year and teaches problem solving by application, and it also addresses the increased retention of engineering students with an emphasis on under-represented groups.  Faculty approval has already been obtained and the College of Engineering is in the process of implementing these changes.\r\n\r\nThe Engage program was developed with input from a survey of faculty in all departments, comments from the College Board of Advisors, comments from an appointed Faculty Advisory Committee, and information gathered during visits to other institutions with innovative first-year engineering programs.  The development team's central thrust was to continue to teach essential skills while finding techniques to address problem solving ability and design methodology along with additional soft skills such as teamwork and communication skills.  The resulting program integrates five Basic Engineering courses (with a total of 13 credit hours) into two team-taught six-hour courses. \r\n\r\nAmong the unique aspects of the Engage program is the concept of the Engineering Freshman\r\nVillage.  The village will include classrooms, computer classrooms and a computer lab, a free-access hands-on lab space, a team design-project work area, a separate study area, faculty offices,\r\nand student-assistant offices, all housed in a single building.  Engage has successfully completed a pilot program with 60 students and the results were overwhelmingly positive.\r\n",
