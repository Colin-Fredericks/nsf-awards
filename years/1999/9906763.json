 "awd_abstract_narration": "In general, geographic research on collective action and formal analytical frameworks for social movement analysis remain divorced.  As a result, it is unclear how relations across space and place-based social phenomena are related to the way in which social actors engage in collective action and attempt to sustain it over time.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that research on social movements as a type of collective action lacks critical synthesis, because geographers infrequently use network theory as an analytical framework while sociologists and political scientists rarely address geographic issues.  This doctoral dissertation research project focuses on an analysis of space and place as factors mediating the sustainability and mobilization of social movement organizations (SMOs), which are \"networks of networks\" seeking to attain common social goals.  Through a case study of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a long-standing SMO within the human rights movement in Argentina, the doctoral candidate will specify the relationship between change in the organizational structure of SMOs and their sustainability and mobilization over time, with special attention given to how networks are structured across space.  The project also will specify the extent to which place-based collective rituals mediate the internal dynamics of SMOs and affect their sustainability.  The project depends on archival research and ethnographic methods to obtain detailed data.  The research will contribute to the geographic literature on space and society and to contemporary research on collective action by specifying how spatial and place-based relations mediate the outcomes of mobilization strategies of social movements and the sustainability of collective action.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
