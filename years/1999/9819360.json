The SSSC is charged with monitoring the health of the field of materials research in the United States and with addressing broad and specific issues that affect that field. They have identified a number of areas for consideration and action in the next three-year period of performance. The Committee will continue to follow up the about-to-be published report, Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: Basic Research for Tomorrow 's Technology through issuing of the proceedings of the 1999 SSSC Forum, which will feature the report as its centerpiece. The SSSC will also pursue technical and policy assessments in the following areas: small-scale devices, composite materials, changes in the R&D landscape, facilities issues, high-Tc superconductivity and its implications, nonequilibrium physics, molecular architecture, performance of materials in extreme environments, and the role of computation in understanding materials. This project is co-funded with the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\r\n%%%\r\nThe Solid State Sciences Committee is a continuing committee of the National Research Council. Its members are leading researchers in condensed-matter and materials physics from university, industry, and government laboratories. The SSSC identifies issues of importance to the materials research community and formulates studies of these issues, which are carried out by panels of experts nominated by the Committee. These studies have various objectives, including: educating the public regarding new scientific developments and technological applications in this field, providing advice to federal agencies regarding research priorities, and creating a forum for discussion of issues among representatives of the university, industry and government research communities.\r\n***\r\n",
