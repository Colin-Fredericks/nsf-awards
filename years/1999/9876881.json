Under\r\n(a) I would like to know when the Dirichlet Problem has a solution\r\nfor certain parabolic and elliptic PDE's with drag term. Given that\r\nthe Dirichlet problem for these  PDE's has a solution, I would like \r\nto know when the corresponding measures possess basic properties such \r\nas a doubling property. As for (b), I would like to construct more \r\nexamples of  domains which are quasiconformal to a sphere and for \r\nwhich harmonic measure and n - 1 dimensional Hausdorff measure on \r\nthe boundary are equal. Finally under (c) I would like to know if \r\nthe techniques used to prove reverse Holder inequalities for solutions \r\nto systems modeled on for the parabolic p Laplacian can be used on\r\nother PDE's such as the Navier Stokes equation. \r\n\r\nMany physical problems can be described in the language of\r\npartial differential equations (PDE's). Well known examples of such\r\nequations arising in the 19 th century are Laplace's equation,\r\nthe heat equation, the wave equation, Maxwell's equations, and\r\nthe Navier- Stokes' equation. Without question knowledge derived\r\nfrom a theoretical study of these equations led to many fundamental \r\ntechnological advances during the 19 th and 20 th centuries.\r\nThree questions often asked by those who study PDE's is (a) does \r\nthere exist a solution, (b) is it unique and (c) does it possess \r\nnice properites or is it regular?  As for (a) and (b) one is often \r\nconcerned with so called  boundary values or boundary conditions for \r\na solution in the domain of existence. So called overdetermined boundary\r\nvalue problems have no solution whereas such classical problems\r\nas the Dirichlet and Neumann problems have solutions if the\r\nboundary of the given domain  and the boundary conditions are \r\nsufficiently nice (smooth). My work is concerned with how much\r\none can relax these assumptions and still get meaningful theorems. \r\nFor example, during the last quarter century,  many classical\r\ntheorems for the Laplacian in smooth domains have been shown to \r\nhold in a class of rough domains called Lipschitz or sawtooth\r\ndomains.  My coauthors and I have obtained the analogue of \r\nLipschitz domains for the heat equation.  Another avenue of \r\ninvestigation has been to consider questions (a)-(c) in a half \r\nspace for rough parabolic PDE's.  My work  provides a model for \r\ncertain free boundary problems such as ice melting (the Stefan problem). \r\n\r\n\r\n",
