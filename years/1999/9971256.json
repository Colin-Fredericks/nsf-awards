It broadly examines exploiting prediction and speculation, heretofore limited to processor cores, in processors, memory, and the interactions between them.  A driving focus of the work is multicast snooping, a new cache coherence approach that uses prediction to both increase effective bandwidth over a classical symmetric multiprocessor and reduce latency over a traditional directory-based system.  Multicast snooping uses prediction to \"guess\" which processors have copies of a block and multicast address transactions\r\nto those processors.  A novel network organization combines simultaneous multicasts to disjoint multicast sets while still providing ordering guarantees.  A simplified directory verifies the prediction and takes\r\ncorrective action when incorrect.  Refining multicast snooping provides research challenges in areas such as hardware and software mask prediction, network implementation, forward progress, high availability, and a\r\ntheoretical foundation for protocol and network behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe application of prediction and speculation to multiprocessor systems also exposes research opportunities applicable to multiprocessors more generally, including upgrade speculation, false sharing speculation, lock\r\nsuperposition, and speculation implementation issues.  Hardware only, as well as hardware/software solutions strategies are being explored.  The research plan encompasses design (refinement of existing ideas and development of new ones), evaluation (pruning the design space and comparing with existing alternatives), validation (ensuring designs work, including a new application of Lamport's logical clocks), demonstration (transferring technology to industry), and infrastructure development (tool adaptation and construction).\r\n\r\n",
