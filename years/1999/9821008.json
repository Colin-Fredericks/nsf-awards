 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a new bi-level math model for geometric tolerances, that is, the range of variation in size and shape that can be permitted for a part to be acceptable when in use.  At the local level, the new model would represent each tolerance zone for a plane or an axis (line) as a multidimensional region or map, and it would include the computational techniques that relate interdependencies between these regions and subregions within them.  The mathematical model to be developed will include formulations for variations in size, form, orientation, position, and runout, and combinations of these, which can be modeled using points, lines, and planes.  The primary method for the research is to use traditional mathematics for representing planes, lines, and points in a tolerance zone.  At the global level, the proposed model interrelates all frames of reference on a part or an assembly.  It will include a symbolic algebra that relates the degrees of freedom and constraints for a feature, such as a hole, to reference frames used when specifying dimensions and tolerances.  In order to validate the integrated bi-level mathematical model and to demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness, a set of prototype software modules will be designed and implemented.\r\n     If successful, the results of this research will impact the state-of-the-art for geometric tolerances and the productivity of designers who use the results.  At the local level, the model will treat dimensional and geometric tolerances in three dimensions and in a manner consistent with the standard on tolerances that is universally accepted by practitioners, whereas existing models for tolerances are only partially satisfactory in being consistent with the standard.  At the global level it is projected that the new model will provide a unique bridge between mathematical characterizations of features (planes, lines, and points) and existing parametric computer-aided design models and statistical tolerance software packages.  It is projected that successful completion of the project will provide the designer with a tool for making better decisions about allocating geometric tolerances.  The completed model also should permit designers to identify trade-offs and to optimize the allocation of tolerances.  The impact should be a shorter design time, fewer iterations in the prototype phase of design, and hence lower cost.\r\n",
