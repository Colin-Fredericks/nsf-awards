 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9975207\r\nMortensen\r\n\r\nThe creation and publication of job creation and job destruction statistics (See Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) and Davis and Haltiwanger (1998).) has stimulated new interest in the different labor force dynamics of employing establishments, the differentials in wages paid by these establishments, and the role played by each in the process by which workers are allocated across productive activity. A set of theoretical tools that have been fruitful for the purpose of interpreting these data, models developed by Pissarides (1990), Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), and Bertola and Caballero (1994), and Burdett and Mortensen (1998) among others, come in a box sometimes labeled the \"matching approach\" to labor market analysis. As explicit equilibrium theories of labor market activity, versions of these models, calibrated to be consistent with the stylized facts about jobs and workers, have also been used to study the effects of labor market policies. (For example, see Millard and Mortensen (1997) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1998).) However, the credibility of the approach, both as a tool for the interpretation of job and worker raw data and as a guide to policy making, is limited by the lack of empirical validation for the specific functional forms and parameters values used.\r\nRecently, matched employer employee panel data sets have become available in several different countries. (See Abowd and Kramarz (1998) for descriptions of the data sets and for reviews of research based on them.) These data permit the observation of worker flows into, out of, and among employing establishments and the wages paid to individual workers with known qualifications. The richness of information available in these data sources suggests that they may be able to provide the empirical basis needed for matching theories of worker and job reallocation. The construction of an equilibrium framework designed to address these data and the development of estimation strategies using the data is the purpose of this proposal.\r\nThe representation of an establishment's labor force as a stochastic process with laws of evolution determined by the search, recruiting, quit, and layoff decisions of individual workers and employers is an intended innovation of the research proposed. This representation will permit the derivation of statistical relationships between employer characteristics, productivity say, and job and worker flows like those found in cross section data, on the one hand, and will provide a strategy for estimating the deep structural parameters underlying these correlations, on the other. The panel nature of matched employer-worker data will also facilitate estimation of a matching function representation of the process by which workers and jobs meet to form matches. The goal is to construct a rich family of empirical labor market equilibrium models of the process that induces worker flows among firms and between the employment states that will add to our understanding of job creation and destruction, unemployment, and wage differentials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n",
