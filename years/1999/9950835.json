 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Science is revising its core curriculum for majors to reduce the number of required core courses that are presently content-intensive to 4 courses that stress inquiry- and problem-based learning with a focus on acquiring important scientific skills. The laboratories of each core course impart computer skills important in scientific research, experimental design, and communication skills. The model for this adaptation is the NSF CETP (Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation) program, and more specifically, the Guidelines for Reform for the 4th Annual Meeting (1998) of the Collaboratives from which suggestions for course revision have been taken.  The lecture component of these courses stress active learning and involve rapid, interactive assessment by means of digital keypads at each student's seat in the lecture hall. To implement this radical change in the way courses are being taught, CSUF faculty and community college faculty from campuses serving the majority of CSUF transfer students have formed \"teaching collaboratives.\" These teaching collaboratives are linked to each of the 4 core courses and are responsible for developing, teaching, assessing, and maintaining a core course. The collaborative training imparts pedagogical and computer skills necessary to teach these core courses in a manner that deviates from the way many faculty presently teach.  PIs are collaborating with a major textbook publisher to develop materials for the courses that incorporate faculty development appropriate for teaching courses in a non-traditional way. The 4 courses are being phased in over 2 years, with each course offered initially to a group of 50 students and expanded to accommodate a typical class of 150-200 students. Together with internal and external facilitators, appropriate assessment tools are being developed to evaluate outcomes at several levels. The expected outcomes are students who retain basic concepts for success in upper division courses, a lower attrition rate, and the spread of improved teaching skills among other faculty, graduate students, and students interested in teaching careers. CSUF is a comprehensive, urban, commuter campus and the plans to implement and adapt approaches recognized to be better modes for teaching science may serve as a model for many similar institutions that educate large numbers of students.  \r\n",
