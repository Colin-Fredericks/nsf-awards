Past survey databases, such as the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) and the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) surveys, have been invaluable for selecting samples for future investigation.  Current and future databases will also provide a unique opportunity to address important scientific problems without requiring scarce resources such as large telescope time. The independent researcher who is willing to spend the time and effort to understand the database, and the process of accessing it, can carry out \"observing runs\" at the computer, mining the database for most or all of the data needed to carry out the project. \r\n\r\nOne result from the activities of the project will be to understand the best ways to access databases for efficient and accurate retrieval of data.  There will also be scientific results from research projects on magnetic activity in M dwarf stars and the galactic structure and star formation history of the solar neighborhood.  These research activities will be a testbed for database mining.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
