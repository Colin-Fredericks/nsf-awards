The co-organizers are Professor David Shaw of the State University of New York (SUNY) in Buffalo and Dr. Keiji Terazawa of the Science and Technology Agency in Japan.  The seminar will focus on significant advances that have been made in this area during this decade as well as topics of current interest in the field.  The four technical areas to be discussed include:  1) tape, cables and coils;  2) bulk synthesis, structure and applications;  3) vortex structure, critical current, and AC loss; and  4) thin films, new materials and characterization.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the seminar are to bring together specialists from both countries to  \r\n1) exchange information on recent advances in the development of high temperature superconductivity (HTS);  2) visit each other's R&D laboratories to gain an understanding of the level of equipment and personnel support in HTS; and  3) identify the problem areas that are particularly suited for international cooperative programs to further the progress of HTS.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger scientists and graduate students.  Proceedings of the meeting are expected to be made available, by the organizers, in a published seminar report. \r\n***\r\n",
