 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed toward the study of humic acid halogenation and related reactions.  Specifically, a new synthesis of cyclopentadienones was discovered and a new route to hydroxyfulvenes was developed.  Further investigation of this chemistry is planned, as are additional studies of the halogenation reactions of phenols and humic acid models.  The latter studies have implications in gaining a better understanding of drinking water contamination.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor Victor L. Heasley of Point Loma Nazarene College.  Professor Heasley is investigating the chemistry of certain ground water components with chlorinating agents so to better understand the nature of drinking water contamination.  Another aspect of Heasley's work is in offering undergraduate students of chemistry an exposure to research on an important and timely topic.\r\n",
