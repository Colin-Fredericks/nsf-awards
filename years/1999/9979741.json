 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, composed of 13 graduate students from San Diego area universities and 3 from Illisaguik College and the College of Barrow Alaska, is expanding the San Diego County PISCES Project; an ongoing, district-based, community-supported elementary science improvement program for grades K-6 in eight participating school districts.\r\n\r\nThe project is providing instruction to 16 fellows and at least 48 teachers annually in appropriate and effective learning processes for science education, facilitating science content knowledge transfer to cooperating teachers and enriched science curriculum development, and utilizing educational technology to leverage project impact.  Educational features include both summer and school-year on-site workshops and seminars for the fellows and their cooperating teachers, and extensive use of the San Diego County Office of Education's educational technology resources.  The project is developing improved communication and teaching skills for the fellows, providing enriched learning for K-6 students, offering professional development opportunities for K-6 teachers funded by the cooperating districts and private funds, and strengthening partnerships among science education stakeholders in San Diego.  The professional development instruction of the participating teachers is being co-funded by private sources through the San Diego Science Alliance and the participating school districts.\r\n\r\nA bonus result of this project came from Dr. Walter Oechel's NSF Polar Programs environmental research program in Arctic Alaska and chaparral research in California, which is providing exchanges of Science Corps fellows and internet video and data links for use in this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
