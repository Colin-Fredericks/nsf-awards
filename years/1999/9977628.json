 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. James Hoffman and his colleagues will purchase a 128 channel Event Related Potential (ERP) recording system from Electrical Geodesics Inc. The 128 channels provide a sufficient sampling density to accurately characterize voltage fields on the scalp. ERPs provide high temporal resolution in measuring the electrical activity of the brain, much higher than alternative methods such as PET or fMRI and the dense measuring field of the requested instrumentation will help to bring spatial resolution to a high standard. This system will be used by a number of researchers to pursue a variety of linguistic and cognitive studies. Three main lines of experiments will be pursued. The first is designed to illuminate the nature of spatial organization in children with William's syndrome, a rare genetic defect which results in profound spatial deficits together with spared language ability. This unique cognitive profile is of great interest because it offers the possibility of understanding the brain mechanisms underlying breakdown and sparing in the development of different knowledge systems. ERPs recorded in conjunction with behavioral measures will help determine whether the spatial deficits in Williams syndrome are due to early attentional processes or deficits in working memory that are specific to spatial location. Related experiments will explore the interaction of deficits in spatial representation with relatively spared comprehension of spatial language. The second line of experiments will provide information on the brain mechanisms responsible for different aspects of language comprehension in normal adults, in particular, the brain's ability to extract phonological features and combine them into well-formed syllables. A third line of experiments will examine the nature of numerical representations in the brain, including the representation of magnitudes and their mapping to symbolic representations among normal adults and children. In each of these cases, ERP methodology will allow better understanding of the localization and time course of brain processes underlying cognitive abilities and thus advance current theories of cognition. The researchers will also use the system to train undergraduate and graduate students and will make the instrumentation available to a wide range of researchers.",
