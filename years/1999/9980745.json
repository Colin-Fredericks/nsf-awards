 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: \"XYZ\" on a Chip project is to investigate biochemical assays on a microscale.  Funds are awarded to support a collaborative project between Notre Dame University and Caliper Technologies to develop chips for rapid, well controlled, low-reagent biochemical assays on nanoliter-sized samples. Applications of such chips include rapid combinatorial screening of pharmaceuticals, measurements of temperature and concentration-dependent reaction kinetics, and genetic typing and screening. These applications are executed by moving liquid samples through micro-etched channels through electro-osmosis. While fluid flow controls such as sample dilution, heating/cooling, stream mixing, and partitioning have been demonstrated successfully, there are several issues that limit the throughput and prevent the full realization of a multi-function, integrated, computer controlled, networked biochemical laboratory on a chip. Specific issues which need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of the laboratory on a chip are: dispersion reduction through channel profiling, dispersion enhancement through channel patterning and profiling, enhanced heat transfer, and solute sampling via encapsulation. All designs will be tested on actual fabricated chips in collaboration with Caliper Technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
