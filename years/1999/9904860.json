Its plan is to help with the selection of those teachers, help prepare them for research in the polar regions, work with them on transfer to the classroom activities, prepare the scientists to work with the teachers in both the research and education setting, and oversee and manage an extensive website for communication between teachers.  To increase the effectiveness of communication from the ice in near-real or real-time the program will leverage the use of technology (Internet and CU-See Me).  This electronic networking along with that at national meetings is designed to sustain the growing network of teachers, researchers, curriculum developers, administrators, and students that constitute the Polar Learning Community.  Teachers who participate in a research experience in either polar region are expected to close mentor three of their peers in the use of the research paradigm in their classroom and use the NSF supported polar curriculum (Project GLACIER).  Mentoring is for a minimum of 127 hours for each of three teachers and is required upon completion of the polar research experience. Accountability is maintained through a journal shared with the senior personnel of the project and project evaluator.  Transfer to the classroom activities begins with a workshop session before going to the ice and in extensive follow-up workshops upon return from the ice.  In addition to the TEA teachers, TEA associates will participate in the program's activities as well.\r\n",
