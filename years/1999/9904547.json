 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular microscopy can provide unique information about biological structure from the molecular to the cellular level. These structures will yield significant insight into biological function. One of the principal bottlenecks to this technique is that enormous number of images must be acquired for the structural analysis. Currently, the field is constrained by manual data acquisition methods that are slow, labor-intensive and result in a very low percentage of suitable images.  Macromolecular structure analysis using electron microscopy requires the acquisition of large numbers of good quality images at high magnification. Because of the effects of radiation damage of biological specimens, the quality of high magnification micrographs can not be judged prior to making the decision to acquire the high magnification image. The decision to acquire an image must be made based on the appearance of the specimen at low magnification. A good microscopist has the ability to link features in the low magnification image to the quality of the high magnification image. However, it is difficult for microscopists to maintain precision in their judgements between sessions at the microscope. Also, since this is empirical knowledge it is difficult to transfer this knowledge to new or inexperienced operators of the instrument. Finally, since there are substantial delays between acquiring the high magnification image and evaluating the quality, it is difficult to systematize the evaluation and improve the decision making process. \r\n\r\nAn intelligent microscope that integrates instrument control, feature recognition algorithms and machine learning techniques would vastly improve both the quality and quantity of data collected and has the potential to revolutionize the field.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a system which is capable of performing the same task as an expert microscopist in linking the scales, i.e. identifying relevant features in a low magnification field of view and learning to refine this choice based on assessment of the subsequently acquired high magnification image.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop, test, and implement an intelligent software system for the acquisition of images from a transmission electron microscope. This system will provide state-of-the-art quantitative image acquisition and analysis capabilities for the molecular microcopy community.  Issues such as quantifying and modeling the quality of the image at high magnification and representation and modeling at low magnification  the features that result in an acceptable quality image at high magnification will be addressed. The system will initially be tested in the development of structural models for the motor proteins, in particular muscle filaments and microtubules. Once the system has been implemented successfully it will be made generally available to the biological community.\r\n",
