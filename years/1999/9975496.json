Expert biologists, information scientists and managers, computer scientists, Internet specialists, and GIS programmers will be invited to evaluate the latest technological developments and determine how to make multi-jurisdictional Conservation Data Center data available to researchers and other users through hyperlinks to a main Web page. The result will be an implementation plan for a dynamic, distributed data set that would form the basis for Phases II and III of this project. Phase II is expected to consist of development and curation components in a prototype, multi-state and provincial, distributed data system. Phase III envisions the full rollout of a validated, distributed data system for the entire Network of Conservation Data Centers. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to define the need and set the framework for an integrated database for the Conservation Data Center Network. Specific objectives include: identification of the priority issues driving the need for an integrated database system using distributed Web technology, evaluation of distributed database models in the context of the current and future needs for conservation, the design of a framework for a prototype integrated information system, and development of a strategic action plan and targets for implementation. The proposed five-day workshop will be held in November 1999 in Tucson, Arizona and will include experts in conservation biology, information management, computer information science, Internet design, and GIS. The format will consist of presentations by invited speakers with opportunities for questions and general discussion, panel discussions, round table discussions, and breakout sessions. Invited and contributed papers and summaries of the discussion will be compiled into a proceedings that will be published electronically via the Web.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
