 "awd_abstract_narration": "9819471\r\nMagid\r\nThe main purpose of the Instrumentation Workshop is to discuss scientific community needs for instrumentation at the new Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) that is under construction at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  Topics to be covered include:  Update on the current status and expected performance of the Spallation Neutron Source; priorities for the initial suite of ten instruments to be built at the high-power target station as part of the SNS reference design; and the science case for a second target/instrument suite optimized for long wavelength neutrons.  A secondary purpose is to hold the first meeting of Oak Ridge Neutron Users.  This will include current and potential users of both the SNS and the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR).  Topics to be covered include:  Approval of By-Laws for the Users Group; discussion of user policies and concerns for SNS and HFIR; and presentations describing upgrades to the neutron scattering facilities at HFIR currently underway.  This part is being supported by ORNL.  Anyone with an interest in the use of neutron scattering to study the structure and dynamics of materials will be encouraged to attend.  Funds will be made available to help defray the costs of attending the workshop for some participants who could not otherwise attend.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis is an important workshop for the future of materials research.  It is timely because construction of the Spallation Neutron Source has now been authorized and funds appropriated in the FY 1999 budget of DOE.  The NSF scientific community is expected to be among the many users of this facility when it is completed.\r\n\r\n",
