 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the tenure of the previous award, molecular characterization of recombination events at and around bz has revealed the following:  (1) Recombination within bz is very high, 100 times higher than in the average DNA segment in maize.  (2) In the immediate proximal side of bz, consisting mostly of repetitive DNA, it is at least 50-fold lower.  (3) Recombination within the bz gene is uniform and does not show polarity as it does in yeast.  (4) Insertions and clustered single bp heterologies suppress recombination and have the effect of making recombination nonuniform across the gene.  (5) Intragenic sequence polymorphisms affect resolution of the recombination intermediates, leading to an almost exclusive recovery of parentally marked IGRs.  (6) Gene conversion, thought to be rarer in plants than in yeast, appears to occur frequently in nonpolymorphic heterozygotes.  (7) Meiotic recombination exhibits high fidelity and is not mutagenic.  The analysis of meiotic recombination in maize will be continued by combining the power of the genetics of the bz locus with that of modern molecular techniques.  Specific aims are as follows:\r\n(1) Examine the effect of single bp polymorphisms on the distribution of recombination junctions in the absence of insertion heterozygosity.\r\n(2) Extend the analysis of recombination at bz to the 5' upstream region.\r\n(3) Analyze gene conversion tracts in the presence and absence of heterologies.\r\n(4) Test whether all \"intergenic\" recombination between bz and the closely proximal marker tac2094 occurs in genes.\r\n\r\nHomologous meiotic recombination is essential to sexually reproducing organisms:  it creates novel genotypes and ensures proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division.  From a practical standpoint, it allows plant geneticists to construct genetic maps that have multiple applications, from marker-assisted selection of desirable genotypes to the map-based cloning of valuable genes.  Yet in spite of its importance, our knowledge of the process in higher plants remains rudimentary.  The bronze locus of maize, a uniquely advantageous system, will be used to elucidate the process of meiotic recombination in plants.  \r\n",
