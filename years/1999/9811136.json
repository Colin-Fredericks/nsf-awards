We  will  apply  these  new  methods  specifically  to  clusters   and  lineations of undersea volcanoes near the spreading  ridges.  Such individual volcanoes provide a sampling of the flow and  melting  of the mantle beneath ridge systems that is broader  than  the  focused, often homogenized sampling presented  by  the  spreading ridge axis. The 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating  method   is  superior  to  others  because  of  the   common  occurrence  of  K in ocean floor volcanic rocks,  analytical  methods  are  well-tested  and  described,  and  in  optimum  circumstances   measurements  can  be  made  to   analytical  uncertainties  of  <1%. We will address several  first-order  questions  about crustal accretion processes near  spreading  ridges   by  determining  the  age  relations  of  a   large  collection of volcano chains and clusters in the  Rano  Rahi  field, East Pacific Rise, collected by the MOAI program from  the  \"superfast\" spreading ridge section (15-19#161#S).  Our  principal goals are: (1) to determine whether the near-ridge  volcanoes  present  predominantly  a  spatial  or   temporal  recording  of  off-ridge, shallow  mantle  melting,  (2)  to  define  the  width of the accretionary zone,  and  determine  whether   this  has  a  predominantly  2-  or  3-dimensional  geometry,  and (3) to assess whether localized  sources  for  melting that produce seamounts persist for long periods.",
