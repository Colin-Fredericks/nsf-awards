 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nCAREER: Robust On-Line Location and Routing for Urban Service Systems\r\nElise Miller-Hooks\r\nProposal No. 9875305\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the development of the conceptual framework and\r\nalgorithmic steps for real-time location and routing decisions in dynamically\r\nchanging environments for urban service operations, including emergency\r\nresponse services, vehicles carrying hazardous materials, and response teams to\r\nincidents involving hazardous materials.  Response time and the associated\r\nlevel of service of many of these urban service operations, such as ambulance,\r\npolice, fire and emergency repair, depend on travel times experienced on the\r\nroadways and the relative location of the call for service to that of the\r\nresponse vehicle.  Thus, optimal location and routing decisions are vital to\r\nthe performance of many emergency service operations.  Real-time information\r\ncan be used to make improved tactical and operational location and routing\r\ndecisions for emergency services and other urban operations, including the\r\ntransport of hazardous materials.  However, it is critical that procedures that\r\ndynamically respond to current conditions on the state of the network consider\r\nthe time-varying and uncertain nature of future travel conditions in order to\r\ngenerate robust solutions; i.e. solutions that will remain optimal, or nearly\r\noptimal, despite variations in travel conditions and that can be applied to a\r\nvariety of situations.  The inherent stochastic and dynamic characteristics of\r\nfuture travel conditions, including the probability of arc or node failures, as\r\nwell as the spatial and temporal correlation in travel conditions and the\r\npossibility of multiple conflicting objectives, are considered in this work. \r\nAccompanying this research effort is an integrated educational initiative to\r\nprovide students with fundamental knowledge and skills drawn from multiple\r\ndisciplines to allow them to solve a broad range of difficult problems, to\r\nintegrate research and teaching through inclusion of real-world problems in\r\ncoursework, to impart an interest in transportation graduate studies and\r\npromote retention of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering, and\r\nto develop skills in using non-lecture based pedagogical techniques for\r\nimproved comprehension of fundamental engineering concepts.\r\n",
