The co-organizers are Professors Robert Gordon at the University of Illinois, Chicago and Yuichi Fujimura at Tokohu University in Sendai, Japan.  The field of quantum mechanical control of atomic and molecular motion is at the forefront of atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical physics.  The field may be broadly defined as the utilization of the quantum mechanical properties of matter to control the motion of electrons and nuclei.  Included within this definition are the control of chemical reactions, control of the motion of charge carriers in solids, alignment of molecules in gases, liquids, and thin films, and trapping and manipulation of the center of mass motion of atoms and molecules.  Major experimental breakthroughs have occurred during the past three years, however, the field is still in its infancy.\r\n\r\nThe seminar will focus on the current state of knowledge in the coherent control of electronic and nuclear motion in gases, liquids, solids, and their interfaces.  The major topics to be discussed are:  1) theory of coherent phase control;  2) experimental studies of coherent phase control;  3) theory of optimal control;  4) experiments in pulse shaping and wave packet control;  5) control of reaction dynamics in condensed phases; and \r\n6) control of photoinduced reactions on surfaces and interfaces.  This important area of research has many opportunities for major scientific breakthroughs.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar, a published volume of contributed papers will be made available for dissemination.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
