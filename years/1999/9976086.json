 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students with disabilities who study science face a variety of barriers in accessing laboratory activities.  The Center for Rehabilitation Technology (CRT)  is proposing a dissemination project to train special education teachers and science teachers about modifying laboratory experiments for students with disabilities.  CRT is completing an NSF project, Developing Accessible Laboratory Experiments (HRD-9700150), that is developing a reference guide and instructional materials that can be used to train teachers on the use of adapted lab equipment.  The project is using several strategies for making science experiments accessible, including:\r\n\r\n Interfacing computer access technologies with computer-based laboratory equipment;\r\n\r\n Interfacing computer access technologies with computer simulations of experiments; and\r\n\r\n Adapting traditional laboratory equipment for use by people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe project has been presented at five conferences to date, but the presentations provided a project overview rather than detailed, hands-on instruction.\r\n\r\nThe project is expanding the resource guide created under HRD-9700160.  Under the previous project, CRT is creating a resource guide on the Internet.  Those efforts have been funded, in part, by grants from the NEC Foundation and Toyota Foundation.  We are in the process of teaming with EASI to be their primary Internet link for information on laboratory accessibility.  We would like to include additional illustrations, audio, and video demonstrations (captioned and with audio description) on this site.  Educators will be able to read through the experiment descriptions, then see a video explanation of how the equipment was set up and conducted.  These video clips will also be made available to other NSF projects for use in their outreach activities to educators.\r\n\r\nThe project is creating an interactive CD version of the resource guide.   Although more schools are becoming connected to the Internet, not all teachers currently have access.  We would like to create an interactive CD version of the resource guide that would include the audio, video, and illustrations described above.  Other NSF laboratory access projects will be invited to contribute materials to the CD.  One thousand copies of the CD will be distributed for free, with additional copies available at cost.  Publishers of the science materials that we tested will be contacted to help with the dissemination of these materials.  Vernier Software has already agreed to include information about the resource guide in the materials that they send to their customers.\r\n\r\nThe project is conducting instructional workshops.  Project staff will conduct workshops at ten national conferences that are attended by special education or science teachers (e.g., National Science Teachers Association, Closing the Gap).  Two workshops will be developed, one on using modified laboratory equipment and one on using computer-controlled labs.  A \"train-the trainer\" approach will be used, so that teachers will be able to train their co-workers on how to make accommodations in the science classroom.  We expect about 25 teachers per workshop, for a total of 250-500 teachers.\r\n\r\n",
