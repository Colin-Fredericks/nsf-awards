The research focuses on two goals: (1) new algorithms (genetic algorithms) for structural energetics of materials and (2) novel composite carbon nanotube structures which exploit interactions with other materials to create new physical systems.  The education thrust will involve a number of activities at various levels.  These include active research pages on the internet (with integrated public feedback and discussion) and support of a virtual children's museum.\r\n%%%\r\n This is a CAREER grant which integrates theoretical research in materials and condensed matter physics with a variety of  education activities.
