 "awd_abstract_narration": "For those plants that produce or retain leaves during the winter, the potential hazards of being exposed to high levels of sunlight are increased.  The green pigment chlorophyll is responsible for absorbing light energy and passing it on for use in photosynthesis.  The biochemical reactions of photosynthesis cannot proceed or proceed more slowly at the low temperatures prevalent during winter.  Absorbed light energy that cannot be utilized through photosynthesis can potentiate dangerous and damaging reactions in the leaves.  However, leaves possess photoprotective mechanisms to counteract this damaging potential, most notably the harmless dissipation of excess light energy as heat through a process that is facilitated by the carotenoids zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin.  Under nonstressful environmental conditions these carotenoids are present and active in large quantities only when high light is present (e.g. at midday).  During the winter, however, the PIs have found that zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin can be retained and continually engaged for the photoprotective process even during the night.  The main objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of particular proteins to which those carotenoids are bound are involved in the sustained activation of this photoprotective process.  The PI's will furthermore evaluate whether plant species with different lifeforms employ different modifications of this mechanism.  For plant species that keep growing and maintain an active photosynthetic apparatus during the winter, zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin become disengaged and disappear rapidly on warm days.  For plant species that cease growth and downsize their photosynthetic apparatus during the winter compared to the summer, zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin are retained and remain engaged for days upon transition to warmer conditions.  The PIs will test the hypothesis that differences in the phosphorylation patterns of the pigment-binding proteins accompany these differences in the employment of the photoprotective process between species exhibiting these very different patterns of acclimation to winter stress.\r\n        This study is not only important to understanding how plants are able to retain functional leaves during the harsh conditions of winter (with the obvious implications for winter-hardy crop species such as winter cereals, spinach, etc.), but should also serve as a guide in understanding the mechanism of sustained photoprotection involving the carotenoids zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin that occurs in the leaves of plants facing many other stresses, including drought stress, insufficient availability of nutrients, excessive levels of salinity or heavy metals, etc.\r\n",
