 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a comprehensive national dissemination effort to educate SMET faculty about a robust, powerful, and accessible instructional approach that has been successfully beta-tested across a wide variety of colleges and universities.  This approach is the Peer-Led Team-Learning model.  It is called the Workshop Model because its key feature is collaborative student groups working in close harmony with the course faculty.   In the Workshop Model, collaborative student groups provide a unique leadership role for undergraduate students that complements the lecture component of courses.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, an 11-member team of faculty drawn from seven institutions have devised a coordinated plan to disseminate the Workshop Model over a three year period to a broad variety of institutions and faculty in five disciplines -- biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, and physics.  The participating institutions are the CUNY City College, the University of Miami (FL), Prince Georges Community College, the University of Rochester, St. Xavier University, the University of Montana, and Portland State University (OR).  \r\n\r\nThis national dissemination project is based on a variety of outreach activities, of varying intensity and commitment, conducted in part on the campuses of the participating institutions, ranging from 1-hour presentations at regional and national meetings to 3-day workshops, with substantial follow-up support.   In support of faculty adopting the Workshop approach, there is a Web page with  substantial resources.  \r\n\r\nThe project includes a set of activities to promote scholarship about the Workshop Model and is designed to create an expanding leadership of faculty to ensure continued dissemination beyond the life of the project.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
