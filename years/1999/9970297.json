 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is devoted to two related topics, namely nonlinear hyperbolic\r\nequations and partial differential equations with nonsmooth coefficients.\r\nThe hyperbolic equations we consider are either semilinear (such as\r\nthe critical Wave-Maps and Yang Mills equations), for which one hopes to\r\nobtain\r\nboth local and global results, or nonlinear, for which the aim  is to\r\nimprove\r\nthe local theory. The problems related to partial differential equations\r\nwith nonsmooth coefficients are mostly inspired by nonlinear pde's; this\r\nincludes various Strichartz and Carleman type estimates, as well as\r\nhyperbolic\r\nboundary value problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equations of interest for this project can be loosely described as\r\nmodels for wave-like phenomena, such as generalized relativity and\r\nnonlinear ellasticity. While many physical models are genuinely nonlinear, \r\ntheir mathematical analysis\r\nis extremely difficult, often beyond the current mathemathical theory;\r\nthus,\r\nin most cases we contend ourselves with simplified models which are linear\r\nor only mildly nonlinear. The proposed work is part of a larger program\r\nwhose aim is to understand such fully nonlinear equations. The strategy is\r\nto study a sequence of increasingly difficult model problems which get\r\ncloser and\r\ncloser to the relevant physical model, so that at each step some new\r\nnonlinear feature is understood.\r\n",
