Roderick, Center for Conservation Research and Training, University of Hawaii, to pursue with Dr.Yoo-Han Song, Department of Agricultural Biology, Geong-Sang University, Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research to determine the source of immigrant species of rice planthoppers (Homoptera: Delphacidae) to Korea.  These species do not over-winter in temperate areas such as middle China, Korea, and Japan but are found throught the year in tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia.  The collaborators will use their respective areas of expertise in molecular population genetics (Dr. Roderick) and in GIS analysis (Dr. Song) to test hypotheses of the origin of these insect pests.\r\n\r\nBased on prevailing wind patterns at the time of immigration, the sources of immigrant rice pests have been hypothesized to be a region of Southern China and northern Vietnam and that populations further south do not contribute to the yearly pool of migrants.  These hypotheses, however, have never been tested.  The collaborators propose to address these hypotheses using new molecular genetic tools coupled with an analysis using a geographical information system (GIS).  In particular, they will determine the origins of the Korean immigrations of rice planthoppers (Homoptera: Delphacidae) as well as test whether southern, more tropical populations (south of the Red River Delta in Vietnam) are distinct from populations found to the north.  They also will examine the relative roles of geographic barriers and wind direction and speed in determining patterns of migration.  This research will provide insight into the factors that lead to genetic differentiation among populations as well as provide information for management of rice pests.  The collaborators are highly regarded scientists in their respective fields of research.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
