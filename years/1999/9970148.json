 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal continues investigations into groups of rational points of simple algebraic groups over number fields and of their S-arithmetic subgroups. One of the goals of the project is to prove the centrality of the congruence kernel for new classes of groups.  In conjunction with the previous results of G.Prasad and A.Rapinchuk describing the metaplectic kernel, this will provide a definitive answer to the congruence subgroup problem for these groups. The PI will also study the rigidity property for finite dimensional representations of finitely generated groups in order to prove that discrete Kazhdan groups have finite representation type. \r\n\r\nThis research lies in the  meeting ground between algebra and number theory.  Questions related to the normal subgroup structure of linear groups have historical roots in the previous century (Jordan, Klein), and have been an area of active research in this century.  In the last 10-15 years tools have been developed to study a central problem about arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups. This problem, known as the congruence subgroup problem, is connected with other fundamental problems in number theory for which new applications are being discovered  in such areas as data transmission, data processing, and communication systems.\r\n",
