 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proper cell division is critical for life and the timing of division must be carefully regulated such that each new cell has everything it needs for independent growth.  The site of the new division must also be carefully regulated so that no important cell components are damaged or left behind during the division process.  Much has been learned about how cells divide from studies of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In particular, studies in yeast have shown that a group of proteins called the septins act as a scaffold to organize the division site.  Septins will be investigated in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans that use both budding and nonbudding divisions in order to learn more about the role of septins during both kinds of cell division.  Because fungal cells divide by synthesis of new cell wall material to form crosswalls, this research should tell us more about the steps needed to assemble fungal cell walls in a specific area of the cell.  The goals of this research are: 1) to clone all septin genes from A. nidulans; 2) to localize septin gene products at the light microscope and ultrastructural levels, and 3) to characterize and alter septin gene expression during vegetative and reproductive development.",
