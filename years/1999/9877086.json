 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Light at the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue fundamental studies in quantum chemical dynamics.  He will continue the development of the discrete variable representation used in theoretical spectroscopy.  He will also focus on  accurate hybrid quantum/classical descriptions for larger systems where full quantum calculations are not possible.  Applications include the interaction and dynamics of water clusters, and Eley-Rideal reactions of hydrogen on diamond surfaces.\r\n\r\nTheoretical chemistry attempts to understand and predict the behavior of real systems, both microscopic and macroscopic, based on knowledge of the fundamental interactions at the atomic and molecular level.  The fundamental processes of interest include catalytic reactions in the gas phase and at surfaces, absorption and emission of radiation, and photodissociation.  Theoretical and algorithmic advances are required in order to assess quantum effects in inelastic and reactive scattering processes in systems larger than a few atoms.  Quantitative understanding of such processes can lead, for example, to control of combustion and synthesis of novel materials.",
