 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Neurospora Genome Project at UNM: Expressed Sequence Analyses\r\n\r\nNeurospora crassa has been an important research organism for the\r\npast half century, and the field of biochemical genetics was initiated\r\nusing Neurospora. Over one thousand genes have been identified by mutation\r\nand mapped, making N. crassa the best-studied filamentous fungus. Now, with\r\nthe identification and characterization of large numbers of expressed\r\ngenes, the goal of connecting the genes of Neurospora to their biochemical\r\nfunctions is becoming reality.\r\nThe Neurospora Genome Project (NGP) at UNM involves the new science\r\nof functional genomics (analysis of the complete set of genes of an\r\norganism). The long-term goal of the NGP is the characterization of the\r\nmajority of the genes of Neurospora and the association of those genes with\r\nbiological function. In previous analyses, the NGP showed that the majority\r\nof the genes being studied are novel (not yet identified in any other\r\norganism). It is predicted that the project will provide novel information\r\nin the areas of genetics, metabolism, biochemistry, and evolution. Based on\r\nthe history of development of new technologies, the research will likely\r\nlead to industrial applications, as well as advances in pharmaceutical,\r\nenvironmental and basic research.\r\n The genetic complement of N. crassa will be investigated using an\r\nexpressed sequence tag (EST) approach, whereby partial complementary DNA\r\n(cDNA) sequences are obtained and used to identify distinct genes and in\r\nmany cases predict their function (when a homologous gene has been\r\ncharacterized). The genetic complement of N. crassa will be investigated in\r\nthe context of how its expression relates to the developmental decisions\r\nmade by the organism. ESTs from four cDNA libraries, corresponding to the\r\ngenes expressed in germinating conidial, advanced-growth mycelial,\r\nunfertilized sexual and perithecial (sexual) tissues will be analyzed.\r\nAlso, a concerted in silico analysis will be directed to the\r\ncharacterization of those cDNAs apparently lacking homologs in other\r\norganisms.\r\n Transcriptional profiling, or cDNA microarray analysis, will be\r\nused to determine the relative levels of expression of thousands of genes\r\nsimultaneously, and the role these changes play in development will be\r\nexamined. The microarray analysis will focus on changing patterns of gene\r\nexpression as the organism switches from vegetative growth to formation of\r\nthe female sexual structure, and then progresses through sexual development\r\nto form the sexual progeny. The genes controlled by the products of the\r\nmating type loci and the white collar genes, all thought to be\r\ntranscriptional regulators, will also be determined.\r\n The Neurospora Genome Project includes an important educational\r\ncomponent. As an integrated part of the research, undergraduates and\r\ngraduate students are trained in molecular genetics and computational\r\nbiology (functional genomics). The students benefit greatly by working\r\ntogether toward a common goal, and the program had the additional advantage\r\nof exposing each student to diverse concepts and techniques. The students\r\nare involved in problem-solving and decision-making at all levels.  In collaboration with the Albuquerque High Performance Computing Center (AHPCC) at UNM, the NGP will continue to provide open access to a server for web-based BLAST and FASTA searches of the NGP EST database and specialized databases containing all published Neurospora nucleotide and\r\nprotein sequences. In addition, all of the Neurospora ESTs with significant\r\nidentity to genes that have been sequenced in other organisms will be\r\nclassified by function; updates of this proteome analysis can be accessed\r\nfrom the NGP web page [http://biology.unm.edu/~ngp/home.html].\r\n The abundance of genes already identified by mutation and mapped in\r\nN. crassa will facilitate the association of sequenced cDNAs with genes of\r\nknown function. The correlation of the genetic and physical maps will\r\nbecome ever more refined, simplifying the association. The enormous amount\r\nof effort devoted to the genetic characterization of Neurospora over the\r\nlast sixty years will yield enormous dividends, in the form of identified\r\ngenes, rational and rapid development of testable hypotheses, and\r\nstimulation of many areas of fungal research.\r\n\r\n",
