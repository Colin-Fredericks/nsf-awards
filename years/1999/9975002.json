 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cyanobacterium Anabaena grows on a source of fixed nitrogen as\r\nfilaments of seemingly indistinguishable cells, but when nitrogen is\r\nremoved from the medium, differentiated cells, heterocysts, appear within\r\none or two generation times at nearly regular intervals. This simple\r\npattern provides the opportunity for a deep understanding of pattern\r\nformation in a multicellular organism. Evidence has accumulated that\r\nfavors a model in which pattern evolves in two stages: (a) nonrandom\r\ninitiation in groups of cells already predisposed to differentiate,\r\nleading to a crude initial pattern, and (b) resolution of differentiating\r\ngroups by the action of a diffusible inhibitor, leading to a pattern of\r\nisolated heterocysts. The position of a cell in its cell cycle may be a\r\nfactor that determines the ability of the cell to differentiate.\r\n\r\n     One way to test this idea is to perturb DNA replication and note how\r\nheterocyst differentiation and spacing of heterocysts are affected. To\r\nthis end, three genes (dmnA, dmnB, and dmnC) from Anabaena, encoding\r\npreviously uncharacterized DNA modification enzymes, have been cloned.\r\nAttempts to mutate dmnA indicate that the gene is essential for viability,\r\nbut even partial inactivation alters the heterocyst spacing pattern.\r\nMutation of dmnB yields a strain that is blocked in heterocyst\r\ndifferentiation at a very early stage.\r\n\r\n     In order to examine the connection between DNA modification and\r\npatterned heterocyst differentiation, two of the genes, dmnA and dmnB will\r\nbe conditionally expressed in Anabaena and the resulting mutants\r\ncharacterized by genetic and biochemical means. Suppressor mutations of a\r\ndmnB- mutant that enable the mutant to grow on N2 will be sought, hoping\r\nto gain insight into the  mechanism by which failure to modify DNA leads\r\nto blockage of differentiation. Experiments also are aimed at testing\r\ndirectly the connection between cell cycle and competence of a cell to\r\ndifferentiate by monitoring cell division and differentiation in\r\nindividual cells within filaments.\r\n\r\n",
