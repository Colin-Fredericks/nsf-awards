 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation Drs. Stephen Falconer and Patricia Fall will continue their archaeological research in the Jordan Valley. They will conduct one season of excavation at the site of Tell Abu en-Ni'aj and follow this with two seasons of analytic work. Together with the adjacent site of Tell el-Hayyat, also excavated with NSF support, Drs. Falconer and Fall will be able to trace changes in settlement, economy and social organization over a ca. 800 year time span. The earlier Tell Abu en-Ni'aj documents the terminal period of the Early Bronze Age while Tell el-Hayyat was occupied during the succeeding Middle Bronze Age. Both sites are relatively small and represent rural \"towns\" rather than central urban capitals and therefore have the potential to shed light on the world in which the vast majority of the populace of these times lived. To accomplish this large scale horizontal excavations will be conducted. These will yield large samples of floral, faunal and other cultural remains and also permit examination of the spatial organization of this small village site. The data thus collected will be compared from similar classes of material from Tell el-Hyyat.\r\n\r\nWhile, through the long lens of time, one can trace a trajectory of increasing social complexity in which culminated in the emergence of Near Eastern \"civilization\", the process in reality is both much more complicated and poorly understood. Change was not unidirectional but characterized by cycles of increasing and decreasing complexity. The terminal Bronze Age is of particular interest because it evidenced a sharp decline in complexity and is often referred to as a \"dark age.\" In the succeeding Middle Bronze Age cities and large political entities emerged once again. Taken together the two sites allow Drs. Falconer and Fell to examine the entire cycle. Preliminary data indicate a strong degree of continuity across these periods and suggest that small settlements retained a substantial degree of independence and adapted resilient strategies which buffered them against change. The proposed research will permit the investigators to investigate this process in detail.\r\n\r\nThis work is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the rise of complex society in the Near East and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. Because the research is set in a strong ecological context it will also offer insight into how humans respond to climatic change and how they adapted to and affected their surroundings.\r\n",
