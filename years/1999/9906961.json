 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the modern political dynamics of a democratic nation, one can view political activities from different perspectives.  One set of perspectives is associated with the relationship between \"the nation\" and \"the polis\" and the ways in which this relationship is changing.  Nation and polis imply very different political relationships between and among their community members.  Nation implies a community bound together by a shared history, culture, and set of values that is considered unique; it is a community that cannot easily incorporate members that do not share these particular characteristics.  A polis, by contrast, implies a community bound together by a shared set of political principles that include a pluralistic public sphere; new members can be incorporated if they are able to adhere to those political principles, regardless of their identity or other characteristics.  Current theory about democracy theory assumes that the transition to democracy involves a movement from nation to polis, but in practice, the relationship is never so clear-cut.  This doctoral dissertation research project focuses on the relationship between the nation and polis as a way of understanding political transitions in contemporary Mexico.  Special attention will be given to changes in the scales and spaces of political activity.  This research will be accomplished through a comparative study of two urban locations in very different regional contexts:  Monterrey in northern Mexico and Oaxaca in the south.  Intensive fieldwork will be conducted in both locations over a ten-month time span.  Methods to be used include archival research and interviews and focus groups involving political and civic leaders.  This research will provide an in-depth analysis of the democratic transition as Mexico faces a pivotal presidential election in 2000.  It also will develop a specifically geographic approach for evaluating the processes of democratization and democratic consolidation.  While focused initially on Mexico, these theoretical insights also will be valuable for evaluating contemporary democratic processes in other nations, especially forces that often seem to be leading to social fragmentation and national disintegration.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
