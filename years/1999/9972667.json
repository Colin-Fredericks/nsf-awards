Although oxygen is bound to dinuclear copper centers in both, the quaternary structure of the proteins differ dramatically.  Crystal structure analyses show that disulfide bonds are a common feature in both hemocyanin types. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the disulfide bonds of Limulus hemocyanin are essential to the integrity of its oxygen-binding sites. The first objective\r\nof this work is to determine the general importance of disulfide bonds in maintaining the integrity of the oxygen-binding sites in both classes of hemocyanins. The loss of oxygen-binding function and active-site copper is determined spectrophotometrically.  Structural changes that result from the cleavage of the disulfide bonds will be analyzed by gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography, luminescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism.  A second objective of this work is to use the loss and recovery of oxygen-binding function upon reduction and restoration of the disulfide bonds as a chemical probe to determine how intersubunit contacts and allosteric regulators of oxygen affinity affect the conformation and stability of the oxygen binding sites of arthropod and mollusc hemocyanins.\r\n\r\nMost animals live in an oxygen-rich environment and rely upon aerobic metabolism.  The vast majority have specific proteins specialized for the transport of oxygen to interior tissues.  Although hemoglobins are the\r\noxygen transport proteins most extensively studied, other oxygen transport proteins are used by as many different species as the hemoglobins.  Hemocyanins are high-molecular-weight, copper-containing proteins that serve as oxygen-carriers in many arthropods and molluscs.  The hemocyanins have attracted the interest of researchers, not only because of their physiological role, but also because of the appreciable alterations that occur in their structure and function in response to changes in environmental conditions.  In this project, a simple, yet powerful, chemical tool, the ability to reversibly lose and regain function upon the\r\nreduction and restoration of protein disulfide bonds, is used to probe the internal and environmental factors that govern physiologically important structure-function relationships in the hemocyanins.  The factors\r\nthat govern the assembly, stability, and function of the hemocyanins are of general significance in view of the many reactions of biological importance conducted by complex aggregates whose assembly, stability, and function are similarly controlled by pH, metal binding, specific ions, and metabolites.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
