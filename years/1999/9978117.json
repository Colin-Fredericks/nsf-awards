Because of this close relationship to land\r\nplants, an understanding of the relationships and diversity of form within\r\nthe Charophyceae is important to the understanding of the origin and early\r\nevolution of land plants.  Knowledge of these algae provides the\r\ninformation needed to identify appropriate model systems for the study of\r\nfundamental plant properties and guides the study of these algae and of\r\nfreshwater environments in general.  Despite the evolutionary importance of\r\ncharophycean algae, their classification within a single group has been\r\nrecognized only recently, and the group has never been examined in a single\r\ntaxonomic study.  This project is intended to provide a single, unified\r\ntaxonomic treatment of the Charophyceae, and to train students in taxonomic\r\nmethods and in the biological diversity of the group.  There are five\r\norders within the Charophyceae, and each has a distinctive set of taxonomic\r\nproblems.  The Coleochaetales are microscopic, but structurally complex\r\nalgae that have never received detailed taxonomic study, and have no known\r\nfossil record. In this group a complete taxonomic treatment is required.\r\nThe Charales are large in size, are comparable in complexity to the\r\nColeochaetales, and have an extensive fossil record.  This group has\r\nreceived detailed taxonomic treatment, but the classification needs to be\r\nupdated with information from modern phylogenetic methods.  The\r\nZygnematales are a large group of common and environmentally important\r\nfilamentous algae.  This group is in need of a uniform taxonomic treatment\r\namong all of the genera in the order. Finally, the Klebsormidiales and\r\nChlorokybales are poorly understood filamentous or packet-forming algae\r\nthat are very difficult to identify in nature.  Modern methods will be used\r\nto survey natural diversity within these groups and identify previously\r\nunknown members of the group.  The project will provide training to one\r\nvisiting scholar, approximately five graduate students, and ten\r\nundergraduates.  Information from the study will be made available via the\r\nworld wide web, by publication of scholarly articles and taxonomic guides,\r\nand will be placed in archival storage.\r\n\r\n",
