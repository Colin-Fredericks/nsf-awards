The Institute for Learning Sciences at Northwestern has pioneered the use of scientific visualization techniques for K-14 education.  They are one of the few education research groups to pay attention to earth and environmental science education, through the (former) Co-VIS project and the (active) Supportive Scientific Visualization Environments for Education Project.  By working with this group, she will deepen her understanding of cognitive science as it pertains to learning and understanding she will learn from their prior experience in constructing and testing learning environments, and in transforming scientific visualization tools into tools for science education.  During my visit to Northwestern the PI will read deeply in the relevant literature, and talk constantly with faculty and graduate students who know and care about cognitive science and education.  She will have Black Rock Forest and learn-to-read-maps development efforts critiqued by experts in learning and cognition, and by people who have built and tested effective computer-supported learning environments.  She will watch Worldwatcher, the Progress Portfolio, and other learning tools in use in K-14 classrooms.  And she will watch the project staff as they watch the students and teachers, to better understand the iterative process by which such tools can be improved.  Her host and guide on this self-motivated, self-directed educational venture will be Professor Daniel Edelson, Principal Investigator of the Supportive Scientific Visualization Environments for Education Project, the Collaboratory Notebook Project, and the Supportive Inquiry-Based Learning Environments project.\r\n",
