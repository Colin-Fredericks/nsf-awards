 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliable multicast is an important and challenging problem which is yet to be solved in order to deploy multicast services on the Internet.  In this proposal, the researchers propose to design, implement, and evaluate a reliable multicast scheme for core-based multicast routing, with the objectives of avoiding NAK implosion and duplicate replies, reducing recovery latency, achieving recovery isolation, and providing adaptivity to dynamic topology/membership changes.\r\n\r\nMost exsiting reliable multicast schemes focus on source-based multicast trees.  They either cannot be directly deployed in core-based multicast trees or may render sub-optimal performance when directly deployed.  The major difficulty lies in that an on-tree router on a core-based tree does not know, due to lack of the per-source information, how to direct a retransmission request toward the source or some designated replier router. The researchers propose to design a simple, yet effective scheme that facilitates routers on a core-based tree to properly direct retransmission requests so as to closely emulate the optimal recovery scenario achieved in the turning point approach.  Specifically, the researchers consider the following\r\nresearch issues:\r\n\r\n(1) To solve the problem of identifying upstream/downstream interfaces (with respect to a source), The researchers  will (i) define a new path_info IP Option that carries the path information and have some of the data packets in a connection carry this IP Option. Each receiver that receives a data packet with this IP Option stores the path information for future use; and (ii) define a new TP_info IP Option to be carried in the retransmission requests so that a router knows how to direct retransmission requests.\r\n\r\n(2) To conduct local recovery in the case of membership and topology changes,the researchers will carefully devise a mechanism, with the use of on-line error statistics collection, soft state caching, and Bayesian analysis, for selecting designated hosts (called repliers) to which direct retransmission requests will be forwarded.  A router now keeps track of error statistics over each of its interfaces and selects, with the use of\r\nBayesian analysis, the most reliable links as replier links.\r\n\r\n(3) As indicated in [levine:98], a pure NAK-based scheme requires an infinite buffer at the source for correct operation.  The researchers  will devise a delayed ACK approach so that both sources and repliers can purge data packets that have been received by all the group members.\r\n\r\n(4) For the proposed scheme to work in the existence of routers that do not have the reliable multicast capability, the researchers  will devise a mechanism to detect clouds and to properly direct retransmission routers and reply messages through them, without loss of recovery isolation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is a combination of two synergistic components:  development of all the component mechanisms in an analytic framework and their validation with software system building and experiments. We will pursue this research by taking advantage of the GateD Multicast source code (developed by the GateD Consortium, Merit Network, Inc.) as a software platform, and prototyping the proposed reliable multicast scheme (partially in the core-based multicast routing daemon and partially as the routing functions provided in the kernel).  With the help of the Ohio Supercomputing Center (OSC) and OSU Medical Center, the researchers will use asdatabase/server centered on large amounts of patient images acquired from MR and CT as a representative multicast application to illustrate the key functional, reliable, scalable, and adaptive characteristics of the prototype software.",
