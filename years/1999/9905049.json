 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMeiosis is the process by which eukaryotic organisms reduce their chromosome number in half during gamete formation. Early in meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, and exchange although the exact order in which these events occur may not be the same in all organisms. These events are highly regulated in a poorly understood process called crossover control. Failure to carry out these early events leads to chromosome non-disjunction and loss. Mutations that cause non-disjunction are known in many organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in C. elegans that result in X chromosome non-disjunction or loss in either meiotic division in either germline in the XX hermaphrodite are evidenced by a high incidence of XO male self-progeny, and such Him mutations are easy to recognize.  Among the genes with a Him mutant phenotype, two autosomal genes, him-5 and him-8, are the focus of this research.  Recessive mutations in either gene change both the number and the distribution of exchanges on the X chromosome, and cause very high rates of X chromosome non-disjunction. Both genes have been cloned. The him-8 gene appears to correspond to one transcript from a locus with a complex transcription pattern, whereas the him-5 locus appears to be much simpler. This will be confirmed in each case further molecular analysis and sequencing known mutant alleles. Significantly, each gene product is predicted to be a small, highly basic protein that would be expected to be involved in some aspect of chromosome structure The expression pattern of each gene will be examined by RT-PCR at different developmental stages, in both sexes, and in various mutant strains affecting meiosis and germ-line development. In addition, by immunofluoresence studies, the location of each protein within the gonad will be determined, which allows strong inferences about the roles of these genes in early meiosis. If possible, the nuclear and chromosomal location of these proteins will also be determined.  One model has postulated that changes in meiotic chromosome structure are integral to crossover control. The effect of these genes on X-chromosome recombination and their predicted protein products fit this model. Further investigation on crossover control will be carried out, both for the X chromosome and for one autosome. One particular autosomal region with an unusual high rate of crossing over will be investigated in more detail. The effect of these him genes on crossover control will be assessed by doing these experiments in both wild-type and him mutant backgrounds.\r\n\t\r\nAll of these experiments will be carried out by undergraduate students under the direction of the principal investigator. Because meiosis is a fundamental process whose main characteristics have been known for decades, most students are familiar in its basic properties. However, the molecular aspects of meiosis are not well-understood, and the genetic and molecular basis for crossover control is obscure. The experiments will help to address that. Therefore, the students will be carrying out significant and current research on a fundamental and familiar process.\r\n",
