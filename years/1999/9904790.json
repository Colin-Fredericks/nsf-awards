El-Helow, Botany Department, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.  The PIs are to investigate whether plant-microorganism interactions play an important role in making metal ions available for uptake by the plant roots. They hope to identify the microorganism strains from soils with existing metal contamination, and hope that inoculation of such strains into soil in which hyperaccumulator plants are growing might increase phytoremediation efficiency.  The proposal hypothesizes that the absence of suitable rhizosphere microorganisms might be a limiting factor in the uptake of metals by plants.  The specific objectives are: 1. To isolate bacterial strains with multiple heavy metal resistance phenotypes, considerable bioremediation grades, and abilities to express a variety of extracellular digestive enzymes, 2. To determine the effect of plant-microbe interactions on metal removal from contaminated substrates when the isolated heavy metal-resistant microbes are introduced to plant rhizosphere.  The study should also explain whether the efficiency of metal uptake by plants is affected by soil mobility, solubility of the metal ions, soil chemistry, and the inherent characteristics of the plant chosen for the remediation.\r\n\r\nScope:  The project addresses the efficiency with which certain plants can take up metallic contaminants from soil, particularly where the metals are enzymatically reduced into a less toxic form.  Environmental remediation of toxic and heavy metals is of high priority for both Egypt and USA. This is an important question in the phytoremediation field, and the research might yield unexpected insights into phytoremediation processes.  Dr. Terry is a pioneer and a leader in phytoremediation research, and is an expert in plant systems for the reduction and uptake of selenium, one of the metals chosen for the study.  He has expertise with the use of plants for accumulation of other metals from the environment. The Egyptian counterpart is an accomplished microbiologist.  He has isolated bacterial strains that can tolerate and entrap heavy metals from polluted water.  The results might extend a technique now used for phytoremediation of organic contaminants for use with metals.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n",
