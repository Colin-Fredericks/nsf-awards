 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of using complex instrumentation in undergraduate teaching in tasks approaching real scientific research with challenging or open-ended problems has been demonstrated by the success of  NSF-funded projects at Hampshire College, Alfred University, and Rutgers University. Advanced instrumentation is an integral part of modern geochemistry. and this project will use new analytical instrumentation, principally ICP-AES and ion chromatography (IC) to implement changes in the teaching and learning of geochemistry.  The use of similar NSF-funded equipment has been successfully applied to teaching courses at Eastern Idaho Technical College; Minot State University; California State University, Fullerton; and the University of Houston. At the University of Massachusetts we have adapted our ICP-AES and ion chromatography (IC) instrumentation to implement project-based learning in the teaching and learning of geochemistry in courses in the Geosciences curriculum.  The changes effected  include:  1) incorporating environmental investigation and analysis as a laboratory exercise in introductory geology; 2) using short investigations in introductory geochemistry to give students experience in analytical techniques; 3) re-designing upper-level courses in geochemistry (Aqueous and Environmental Geochemistry; Sedimentary Geochemistry) to focus on large, semester-long projects involving research design, implementation and analysis; 4) using of advanced analytical techniques in undergraduate honors programs and independent projects; and 5) adding a geochemical component to projects in courses concerned with hydrogeology and environmental geology. These adaptations have the added benefit of better preparing undergraduate geoscience majors for employment in the environmental industry or for developing their skills for research careers.",
