 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements a lab for the design and testing of digital circuits to be the cornerstone for a new computer engineering curriculum. The lab is based upon reconfigurable hardware, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA),  Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD), and a complete suite of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools.   The choice of this set of elements for the lab and the related courses is based upon the adaptation of innovative and successful programs developed at other institutions as reflected in recent literature about computer engineering education.\r\n\r\nReprogrammable logic is chosen because of its short design cycle, reusability of components, and cost effectiveness.  It allows students to focus on the design process itself, avoid or easily correct design errors, handle relatively large and complex circuits, and learn skills and tools they will use as professionals.  It is also relatively easy for an instructor to manage such a learning environment and permits the same circuitry and equipment to be used in several laboratory and project based courses.   \r\n\r\nThe important pedagogical aspects of this project are an early exposure of students to digital design, the comprehensive integration of digital design throughout the curriculum, and an integrated treatment of testing and design. The expected outcome of this project is the production of well-qualified computer engineers prepared to enter the local industry.  This outcome is being evaluated by an advisory committee with representatives from the local semi-conductor industry, based upon student retention and graduation rates, alumni feedback, and feedback from local industry managers.",
