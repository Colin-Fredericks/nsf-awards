The CMB (and other) data will be compared with several models to determine the tightest possible constraints on cosmological parameter values, and so test theories of the very early universe. The successful conclusion of this program will have profound consequences for astronomical and laboratory searches for dark matter in the Universe, extragalactic astrophysics, general relativity, and very high-energy particle physics. The excitement engendered by, and the conceptual simplicity of CMB anisotropy experiments makes it possible to directly involve undergraduates in frontier research, and to expand the physics curriculum to include aspects of modern cosmology research.\r\n\r\nThis integrated research and education plan for career development will take advantage of opportunities afforded by the new data. Physics undergraduates will mathematically characterize CMB anisotropy experiments and determine the angular scales to which they are sensitive (their \"window functions\"). A Web site will be developed to disseminate these window functions, thus providing a uniform and highly accurate characterization of all CMB experiments (a resource that will be of great use for theorists and experimentalists). Novel but observationally consistent cosmogonies will be developed. CMB anisotropies will be computed in these models, for a wide range of cosmological parameters. Improved statistical techniques (that account for experimental systematic uncertainties) will be developed to use these predictions, in conjunction with the CMB experimental window functions and data, to constrain cosmological parameters. Correlation techniques will be used to compare the microwave data to possible foreground contaminant data, to assess the amount of, and remove any non-CMB foreground contamination. Results from analyses of many CMB experiments will be combined with those from analyses of other cosmological data to determine the tightest possible constraints on cosmological-parameter values, and so test cosmic structure formation models. The favored models will be used to make predictions for what should be seen by the MAP and Planck Surveyor space missions.\r\nAn upper-level undergraduate and graduate cosmogony curriculum, that incorporates topics of current research and uses interactive multimedia tools, will be developed. This will be complemented by focussed lecture series, reading courses, and special departmental colloquia from well-established cosmologists. The goal is to help students develop the quantitative reasoning abilities needed for research in this exciting area of modern physics, and that will serve them well for possible employment in any technology-related field.  The research of the Kansas State University Physics Education Group on effective physics teaching and learning will be utilized while designing this curriculum. Their expertise, assistance, and infrastructure will be used to extend this curriculum to the introductory level, to sustain the natural curiosity of students for things astronomical, and to attract students from traditionally under-represented groups to physics. The longer-range goal is to develop a partially Web-based, introductory cosmogony course into a completely Web-based distance-learning one.\r\nThe extensive overlap between the educational and research activities is deliberately designed to ensure that they reinforce each other. This ambitious but realistic and achievable career development plan will significantly advance fundamental cosmogonical knowledge while simultaneously strengthening many different aspects of modern science education at Kansas State University.\r\n",
