 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary results indicate the existence of a convex relationship between the level of wholesale activity in a city and the population of a city. Consider for example, grocery wholesaling. Preliminary results indicate that in cities with 200,000 people, an increase in population by one person is associated with an increase in grocery wholesaling volume of $1,100, whereas in cities with two million people, sales volume increases by $2,700.\r\n        This project develops an explanation for this pattern based on increasing returns, product differentiation, and transportation costs. Models with these three ingredients have received substantial attention in the economics literature in recent years. This project will contribute to this important literature on the theoretical and empirical fronts.\r\n        The proposal argues that the models in the existing literature do not deliver as an implication a convex relationship between output and market size, at least in the range above the threshold where output is positive. The literature has focused on an important margin, the relationship between market size and the variety of locally-produced differentiated goods. But the literature has ignored a second, perhaps equally important margin, namely the relationship between market size and the scale of production of a given, locally-produced differentiated good. This margin has been ignored because, in the Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition (the workhorse model in the literature), the output level of locally-produced goods is invariant to city size. As population increases, local industry production expands by adding new varieties; the scale of production of any existing product remains fixed. This is an implausible implication. It is reasonable to expect that the output of existing products would increase. This project departs from the standard formulation to incorporate this second margin. Industry output at a location equals the product of the total number of varieties times the average scale of production of each product. As population in a city increases, both terms of this multiplicative product increase: variety expands and the scales of existing varieties increase. Thus there is a natural source of convexity in the relationship between industry output and market size.\r\n        The project has three parts.\r\n        Part 1 of the proj ect is to study the empirical relationship between wholesaling activity and city size in greater detail. It will be argued that the wholesaling sector is an excellent sector to study because it is one where the three key ingredients of economic geography models: product differentiation, scale economies, and transportation costs, are likely to be important.\r\n        Part 2 of the project is to develop the theory discussed above.\r\n        Part 3 of the project is aims to distinguish the implications of the proposed explanation for convexity from the implications of other potential explanations. A key implication of the proposed theory is that the more disaggregated the data, the less the convexity. Indeed, aggregation is the source of the convexity. In other explanations that are considered, a convex relationship should exist even with finely-disaggregated data. This provides a way to distinguish the theories.\r\n        The project will use data from the Census of Wholesale Trade. The Census releases some geographic data on sales. However, the only way to get access to highly disaggregated data, at a fine level of industry and geographic detail, is to use the micro data available at the Center for Economic Studies at Census headquarters in Suitland, MD. A major component of the funding request is to finance access to this data. To date, economists have made extensive use of micro data from the Census of Manufactures but have not yet made use of micro data from the Census of Wholesale Trade. This project's use of this data can be expected to have spillover benefits for other projects that might use this data.\r\n",
