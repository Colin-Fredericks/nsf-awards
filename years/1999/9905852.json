This is particularly true of social science research that examines the risk judgments and perspectives of various social groups.  Understanding how communities think about, respond to and evaluate environmental risk situations has become an important focus of research in decision analysis and environmental psychology.  For more than two decades, social scientists have documented dissimilarities between the public and experts in perspectives on risk problems, but also among various communities in the way in which they respond to and perceive environmental hazards.  Groups who differ in ethnicity, socioeconomic circumstances, educational levels and language frequently differ in their reported risk beliefs and reactions to environmental problems.  This has major implications for risk communication and the resolution of conflict about managing environmental hazards across the diverse communities affected by exposures.  If results of studies are to inform policy in a meaningful way, then scientific procedures used to measure risk perspectives must have demonstrated reliability and appropriateness for all groups, a question of measurement equivalence.  Evidence is required showing group differences to be \"real\" and not the result of faulty scientific and measurement procedures. \r\nThis investigation examines several risk belief questionnaires and measurement tools used to profile public perspectives on risk problems.  Selected instruments previously used will be tested for the ability to produce reliable and valid information for groups who differ in ethnicity, primary language, educational levels and economic circumstances.  The investigation will include as participants a variety of African-American, Anglo and Latino individuals residing in lower and middle-income communities.  Individuals selected for the study will participate in a series of scientific procedures that will generate information for a statistical exploration of the question of measurement equivalence across groups. \r\n",
