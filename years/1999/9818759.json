Such understanding requires both theoretical work that details the properties of equilibria under a va-riety of different market structures or institutions and suggests when particular market structures are likely or desirable, and an empirical framework in which these theories can be refuted and hypotheses can be tested. This project seeks to further understanding of competitive and non-competitive markets by studying both theoretical and observable implications of several different market structures.   This project has four distinct parts. The first two parts focus on theoretical and observable implications of competitive markets. The classical Arrow-Debreu model provides a rich theoretical framework in which to study many aspects of competitive behavior, and is the foundation for much work in modern macro, finance, public finance, and numerous other fields. General equilibrium theory is often criticized, however, for lacking empirical content. This criticism is typically based on the Sonnenschein-Debreu-Mantel theorem, which shows that no properties of individual demand beyond continuity and homogeneity are preserved by aggregation in market excess demand.   Under her previous NSF grant, the investigator showed that, contrary to this view, the general equilibrium model does impose testable restrictions on a finite set of observations of prices, individ-ual incomes, and aggregate consumption, and they give necessary and sufficient conditions for such a finite data set to be rationalizable in a Walrasian setting. The first part of this project studies the extent to which qualitative properties of competitive equilibria, such as local and global uniqueness, comparative statics, and stability of price adjustment processes, are refutable with finite data sets. The second part considers similar questions in a dynamic general equilibrium economy incorporat-ing financial markets. The final sections focus on the observable implications of markets in which some agents act strategically. In particular, the third part of the project considers whether a finite set of observations can detect imperfectly competitive behavior in a general equilibrium set-ting, and the final part considers whether such data can provide evidence of complementarities in choice problems and in markets.\r\n\r\n",
