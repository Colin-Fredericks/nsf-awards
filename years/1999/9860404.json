 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860404\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a novel physical vapor deposition (PVD) alternative to conventional electroplating used in depositing relatively thick functional metal coatings. Electroplating operations are known to generate large quantities of hazardous waste and toxic fumes.  The PVD approach will obviate the use of liquid chemicals, recycle solid metals in situ, and leave no emissions.  The concept is a non-line-of-site deposition of metals at high rates, which will allow the growth of relatively thick (greater than 10 microns) and uniform deposits of metals on three-dimensional objects simultaneously from all sides.  In this way, it may be possible to deposit a large number of small objects or a small number of large objects in a relatively short period.  Phase I will explore the effect of process parameters on degrading inclusions in the growing film and the integrity of such thick films.  Process modeling, using the statistical design of experiments, will be performed.\r\n     Chrome, copper, nickel, and other relatively thick coatings are extensively used in the defense, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries.  It is anticipated that high quality, thick functional metal coatings will be deposited in an environmentally safe manner.\r\n\r\n",
