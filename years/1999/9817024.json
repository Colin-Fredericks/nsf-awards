 "awd_abstract_narration": "Birds develop male or female characteristics during embryonic and early postnatal stages in their life history.  Precocial birds, such as the Japanese quail are relatively independent at hatch; they are very mobile and are able to feed themselves.  Because their systems are well developed at hatch, this species undergoes sexual differentiation during embryonic development.  As such, the  male or female system is organized during embryonic development and require embryonic exposure to the gonadal steroids, estradiol and testosterone for sexual differentiation. Through previous work in our lab and other labs, changes in plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone have been described.  Further, the effects of these steroids on the sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior has also been investigated.  However, although the role of steroids has been determined for sexual differentiation of behavior has been described, little is known about sexual differentiation of endocrine patterns in birds.  \r\nIn avian species, chicken gonadotropin releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I) is the primary hormone produced by the hypothalamus.  GnRH-I directs the function of the rest of the reproductive endocrine system by stimulating the pituitary gland to produce gonadatropins, which in turn stimulate the function of the gonads.  The goal of this research is to investigate the GnRH-I system in Japanese quail during embryonic development and determine if embryonic steroids are critical for later sex differences in the function of the GnRH-I system.  Experimentally, the objective is to determine if the function of the GnRH-I system is altered by treatments known to impact sexual behavior.  Our hypothesis is that the GnRH-I system is sexually differentiated by embryonic steroids, resulting in later expression of male or female endocrine responses.  It is likely that regulatory systems in the brain are critical components of this developmental process and involve noradrenergic and opioid peptide systems. By investigating these processes, this research will elucidate some of the hypothalamic mechanisms that synchronize endocrine and behavioral components of reproduction in birds and provide the basis for understanding the effects of environmental chemicals that may impact these systems.\r\n\r\n \tEFFECT OF BUDGET REVISIONS ON RESEARCH GOALS\r\n\r\nThe first year of our NSF proposal is to be funded at a reduced rate from our request.  In order to accomplish some of our goals within the time and the funding limitations, we will revise our research goals.  In Study I, we will concentrate on Experiment 1.1, in which we will investigate the effects of embryonic treatments on GnRH-I system.  We will not attempt to conduct Experiment 1.2 with our collaborator in Torino because this study will take more than one year and we do not have sufficient funding.  Instead, immunohistochemistry for GnRH-I, enkephalin, and tyrosine hydroxylase will be conducted at UMCP without the 3-D analysis.  If time allows, we will begin some of the work proposed in Study II to determine the effects of embryonic treatments on GnRH-I release  in vitro.  In this way, we will collect additional data regarding the response of the GnRH-I system to embryonic steroid manipulation. \r\n\r\n \tPersonal Participating on the NSF Funded Research\r\n\r\nDr. Mahmoud Abdelnabi will spend 30% time on this project.   His CV is attached.\r\n\r\nMs. Nichola Thompson will spend 50% time on this work in technical support.\r\n",
