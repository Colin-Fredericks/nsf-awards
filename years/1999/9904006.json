 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gardiner\r\nThe objectives of this research project are (1) to investigate the mechanisms regulating glutathione (GSH) in the preimplantation embryo; (2) to investigate the role of GSH in the control of development of the mouse blastocyst; and (3) to improve the research environment and undergraduate science education at this institution.  The investigator's earlier studies indicate that the preimplantation mouse embryo is an intriguing and useful system for investigating processes that regulate glutathione (GSH) and the role of GSH in differentiation. Glutathione is the major intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to have roles in protection from reactive oxygen species, protection from toxicants, regulation of cell differentiation, and triggering of apoptosis in other cell types. Unlike all other animal cells, the cleavage stage preimplantation embryo cannot synthesize glutathione de novo. In addition, the embryo cannot take up glutathione from extracellular sources and is exquisitely sensitive to reactive oxygen species and glutathione-depleting chemicals. Therefore, it appears that the cleavage stage embryo is uniquely deficient in its ability to regulate total cellular glutathione. For these reasons, it is of interest to study how and why this deficiency occurs, and what effect it has on differentiation. The studies described in this grant will investigate the following questions: 1) why is the cleavage stage embryo incapable of synthesizing GSH, 2) at what time and in which cells does this GSH synthetic capability begin and why, 3) can GSH synthesis be induced in the embryo by treatments that typically induce it in other cells, and 4) what effect will altering the GSH status of the embryo have on differentiation?  The research will be conducted on mouse embryos during the first four days of development from the unfertilized oocyte to the blastocyst stage.  Embryos will be collected and analyzed for the total amount of oxidized and reduced glutathione using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of genes that code for enzymes used to synthesize glutathione will be investigated with reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reactions and western blotting. Embryos will be treated with oxidants and GSH-depleting chemicals and the ability of the different cell types in the embryo to recover will be measured with HPLC and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the effects of these treatments on gene expression will also be determined. The embryo will be treated with chemicals that increase the amount of GSH or chemicals that lead to oxidation of glutathione in the embryo and the effects on cell number, cell differentiation, and apoptosis will be measured using fluorescence microscopy.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to further investigate the overlying hypothesis that glutathione regulatory mechanisms have unique features and important roles during the early development of the mouse embryo. Improving  the understanding of the basic processes regulating GSH and the role of GSH in differentiation has significance for development of techniques for scientific inquiry (development of embryonic stems cells for production of genetically engineered animals, etc.), for understanding causes of embryonic mortality, and for furthering the understanding of other biological processes (signal transduction, redox regulation, apoptosis, etc.). Undergraduate students will be active participants in the research and will present their results at scientific meetings and publish their studies in scientific journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
