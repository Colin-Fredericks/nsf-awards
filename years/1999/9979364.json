 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979364\r\nCarstensen\r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary team of Virginia Tech students and faculty will develop a suite of software tools (referred to as the GETWEBS, Geographic-Engineering Tool for Wireless: Evaluation of Broadband Systems) for wireless network system design and layout. This research will be truly unique as it brings together students from engineering, business, and the social sciences to evaluate implementation strategies for fourth-generation (4G) wireless communications. The research and educational efforts within the tool development process will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in three key components of the future broadband wireless industry:\r\n\r\nEvolving wireless technology - How well can future broadband and mobile wireless technologies\r\nwork for a particular application? At what cost will they work?\r\n\r\nWireless technology interaction with the environment - What environmental obstacles (terrain, buildings, vegetation) are present in the implementation region? How do environmental obstacles influence broadband channel characteristics? How do they affect the cost and equipment needed to implement a commercialization plan?\r\n\r\nSystem integration and deployment - How are engineering issues affected by terrain and demographics? How do financial issues constrain engineering choices? How does the service viability affect technology selections? How do regulation, culture, traditions, and the economic situation affect engineering design and system architecture?\r\n\r\nFaculty and students will work together through both research and course work supported by this project.\r\n\r\nThe actual GETWEBS tool will be object-oriented for ease of interfacing among its components, and GIS-based to incorporate actual wireless implementation environments. It will feature interactions among propagation, environmental, demographic, and financial models (Figure 1, Project Description). The tools themselves will be developed by students from Virginia Tech through a series of graduate and undergraduate research courses and through three formal summer courses taught at the Blacksburg campus of Virginia Tech. In these courses, students will be divided into teams. Each team will have participants from engineering, business, and geography. In the formal classes, students and faculty will learn basic theory and practice of all the participating fields through faculty lectures, group interaction, and hands-on development of individual tool components. The areas included in GETWEBS are electrical and computer engineering (channel characteristics and system architecture), geography (Geographic Information Systems), and business (finance and marketing issues).\r\n\r\nSignificant research results from this project will include:\r\n\r\nDesign and construction of a novel broadband channel sounder based on ultra-wideband technology\r\nDevelopment of a GIS-based field-verified propagation model that predicts the bandwidth that a wireless channel can support under a given set of system parameters and quality of service requirements\r\nImproved data-base development techniques for GIS propagation studies\r\nImproved Line-Of-Sight (LOS) algorithms for GIS analysis\r\nDevelopment of Path-Of-Communications (POC) algorithms for GIS analysis\r\nStatistical analysis of visibility patterns aggregated to census enumeration units\r\nField verification of LOS algorithms using radio channel propagation.\r\n",
