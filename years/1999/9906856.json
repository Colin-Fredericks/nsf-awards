The proposed research deals with the basic theory of geometric probability, and will focus on various integral formulas.  The problems proposed fall into three categories:  kinematic formulas of convex bodies; inclusion measures of convex bodies; and integral formulas on manifolds. Applications of this work are anticipated in other fields of mathematics, as well as in areas such as X-ray imaging and other imaging technologies.  The US team has a senior and a junior partner with strong qualifications in this area of research; their Chinese counterparts are also highly qualified.\r\n\r\nThis project involves participation of junior faculty and graduate students and is based on an interesting topic which will profit from the contributions of both groups. The senior Chinese PI is a recognized expert in the area of geometric probability. The junior Chinese PI is at arguably China's top university and is receiving support from the Chinese NSF for this research and for the international cooperation. \r\n\r\n",
