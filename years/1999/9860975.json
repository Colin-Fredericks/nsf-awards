 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860975\r\n    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates an instrument sensitive enough to compete with water vapor measurements made by much larger, more complex equipment, but cheap enough to be a \"throw away\" device.   Unlike current infrared instruments, which are assembled from many separate components, it features a highly integrated \"sensor on a chip\" employing advanced surface modification technology and capitalizing on modem semiconductor fabrication methods.  This new, integrated approach replaces discrete component instruments in much the same way integrated circuits have superseded distributed elements in electronic systems.  In addition to the potential for serving an important role in atmospheric research, the proposed device is a step toward next generation gas sensors for environmental and industrial monitoring.\r\n     This device is expected to be a simple, low cost, light weight alternative to conventional infrared absorption instruments.   By reducing weight, complexity, and cost, it opens applications beyond the reach of current infrared instruments, such as the next generation gas sensors for indoor air quality, environmental research, and industrial controls.\r\n",
