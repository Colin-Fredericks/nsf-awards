New theories and architectures for\r\ndevelopment are being studied in fields related to both artificial and\r\nnatural intelligence.  Scaling up from ground, both in size and functionality,\r\nis required for dealing with real-world problems and for better\r\nunderstanding natural intelligence.  How does an individual, biological or\r\nartificial, scale up its cognitive and behavioral capabilities through interactions \r\nwith the environment?  What are the common mechanisms\r\nthat enable scaling up for a variety of cognitive and behavioral\r\ncapabilities and their integration?  Since this important subject is\r\ninterdisciplinary, this workshop will bring together researchers from\r\nclosely related fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning,\r\ncomputer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, robotics,\r\nanimal learning, developmental psychology, neuroscience and computational\r\nlinguistics.  The aim is to discuss (1) the role that development and\r\nlearning can play in the development of artificial and natural intelligent\r\nagents, (2) the common principles that are shared by the development for\r\nvery diverse cognitive and behavioral capabilities such as vision, speech,\r\nlanguage, reasoning, planning, decision making, locomotion and\r\nobject manipulation. (3) important directions for future research on\r\ndevelopment and learning, and (4) short-term and long-term applications.\r\nFindings of the workshop will be documented in a report which will be widely\r\ndisseminated in the various related research communities.  A website on\r\ndevelopment and learning will be created from this workshop as a long-term\r\ncross-disciplinary information center for those who are interested in\r\nartificial and natural intelligence.\r\n",
