The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. P. Graham Mortyn to work with Dr. Gerald Ganssen at the Geomarine Center of the Free University in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  An additional six months of support is available based on the results of the first year of support, provided by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program.\r\nThe aim of this research is to further develop and calibrate the oxygen isotopic composition and magnesium/calcium methods of assessing paleo-SST (sea surface temperature) in the fossilized carbonate shells of planktonic foraminifera, which are routinely preserved in deep-sea sediments.  The focus will be on mid-to High-latitude species calibrated with modern temperature measures.  If an independent relationship can be determined between salinity and magnesium/calcium, it would remove some of the obscurity in the use of this geochemical tracer as a sea surface temperature proxy.\r\nDr. Ganssen is a leading researcher in the field of paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.  He has formed a collaboration with Dr. Henry Elderfield at the University of Cambridge to measure Mg/Ca and Cd/Ca ratios from modern planktonic foraminiferal samples from the North Atlantic. Dr. Mortyn will benefit from being part of this three-way alliance linking three countries in the field of trace-element geochemistry.\r\n***\r\n",
