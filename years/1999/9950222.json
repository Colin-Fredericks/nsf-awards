 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project strengthens Civil Engineering courses in structures by combining problem-based learning and hands-on experiences to expose students to realistic design and analysis challenges.   The implementation at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez is based on two adaptations.  First, the problem based learning approach is adapted from work at McMaster University, MIT, Dartmouth College, and other universities.  Second, the hands-on approach is adapted from the Mechanical Dissection work at Tuskegee University, as well as similar efforts at Purdue University, Cornell University, and other schools.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are: 1) to modify the current undergraduate structural engineering courses to incorporate skills such as teamwork, critical thinking, and real-world applications; 2) to enhance each student's ability to use the techniques, skills, and tools necessary for the future multidisciplinary environment of engineering practice; 3) to complement the civil engineering department's plan to develop its current curriculum to meet accreditation criteria.  The following two tasks are being completed: development of a workbench for undergraduate structural testing applications, and the incorporation of the hands-on learning technique in current courses.\r\n\r\n",
