 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative learning often leads to better learning than learning alone. One distinct reason for its effectiveness could be that collaboration enables people to learn and integrate different ideas and perspectives, which then predicts that collaboration among children with different background knowledge will be more fruitful than collaboration among children with same or similar background knowledge. This project will explore what kind of and how much difference in prior knowledge is needed to ensure a fruitful collaboration. The focus of the project is on developing (and pilot telling) materials that will be used in a future study which will examine directly whether collaboration among children with different prior knowledge is ironed more conducive to the creation of new knowledge than collaboration among children with same prior knowledge. It is expected that upon the completion of this project, we will be in a better postion to address the effect of prior knowledge on collaboration.",
