 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves recruitment and retention of students in science and engineering. The objective is to develop an introductory hands-on course in the area of telecommunication electronics so that the students are exposed to the technology at an early stage.\r\n\r\nExperiments of this laboratory are divided into two groups. The goal of its first section is to introduce the laboratory equipment through simple experiments. It includes the measurement of resistance, the color-coding, tolerances, and characteristics of the periodic signals. Students perform statistical analysis to analyze the data. Commercial software is introduced for this purpose. Thus, the students develop skills needed to perform experiments of the next set. The second set of experiments introduces fundamental concepts of radiation, frequency domain, time domain, modulation, demodulation, analog, and digital signals. Students use PSpice and HP Advanced Design System (ADS) to simulate their circuits and systems. The laboratory reports include an analysis of the results.    \r\n  \r\n",
