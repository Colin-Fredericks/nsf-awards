 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the continuing research of Dr. Nicholas J. Turro of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.   The proposed research involves collaborative investigations of the structures and dynamics of a variety of supramolecular systems in which reactive intermediates are generated by uv photolysis.   Included are geminate radical pairs and biradicals generated in micelles, radicals, radical pairs, and biradicals generated on the external and internal surfaces of zeolites, and supramolecular assemblies resulting from the interactions of DNA with dendrimers.   Enantiomeric selection in spin chemistry will be explored, including possible connections between angular momentum, optical activity, and molecular chirality.\r\n\r\nFundamental investigations are proposed to characterize novel materials with unusual properties, and to elucidate mechanisms of binding of small guest molecules to biomolecules.   The work is interdisciplinary and has potential applications in catalysis, size and shape selective separations, and materials science.   It will integrate research and education by actively involving undergraduate and graduate students at Columbia in research projects coupled to instruction through the use of the world wide web and other  information technologies.\r\n",
