 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop a comprehensive and systematic approach to the problem of engineering system modeling, simulation and control.  Both the theoretical aspects of the problem, and the issues related to software implementation of simulation and control algorithms in a distributed computing environment will be examined.\r\nEntities flowing through the system and their transformations by the various system processes will be modeled by object-oriented  representations.  Thus system inputs and outputs will be treated as objects having attributes, methods, and links to other objects.  The system flow dynamics, i.e., the structure of the supported entity flows and their associated event timings will be modeled using the formalism of stochastic Petri nets.  This formal modeling framework will provide adequate modeling capability to assist in the analysis of the real-time flow dynamics in the system, even in the presence of uncertainty.  It will also provide the basis for gaining new theoretical insights for the eventual synthesis of pertinent control policies.  In particular, topics of investigation will be the transfer of existing results in the area of structural control to the context of this new modeling framework, the interaction of structural and performance-oriented control, the systematic evaluation of the performance of existing sequencing and scheduling policies in the context of structurally controlled object systems, and the interaction between product quality and system throughput and productivity.\r\nOn the basis of the theoretical insights gained through these investigations, new algorithms for the simulation and control of engineering systems will be formulated, and distributed software implementations of those algorithms will be developed.  'The results obtained through this approach will be validated by their application to a surface-mount printed circuit board assembly line located in the Manufacturing Research Center at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
