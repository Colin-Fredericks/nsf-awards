 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the needs of the legally blind to interact with information systems that utilize graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The research focuses on the study of descriptive animated icons and the development of a framework to enable GUI developers to more effectively address the icon recognition process utilized by the legally blind when designing interface layout and functionality.  In an initial study the PIs will determine optimal sizes for icons, animated as well as non-animated, that are perceived by individuals whose visual acuity is in the range of 20/200 to 20/800.  This study will result in a heuristic that will allow them to describe the means by which legally blind computer users interact with a GUI.  The PIs will then design a library of animated icons which will serve as a foundation in the development of GUIs that are accessible to the legally blind.    A proof-of-concept application will be developed and evaluated using this technology, in order to provide information on how to properly integrate animated icons into a GUI to achieve the stated goals.  The PIs expect the icon library developed as part of this project to be applicable to a wide variety of application domains, and that the use of properly sized, descriptive animated icons in GUIs will help the increasing legally blind population to access information in electronic form.",
