These applications can be classified by the bit rates they require. A broadcast quality video-on-demand system might require several megabits per second, while a commercial video conferencing system might use only a few hundred kilobits per second. At the extreme low end of the scale, video telephone and wireless communication systems are often restricted to rates below 20 kilobits per second. The hybrid motion-compensated Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) structure is a part of nearly all existing video coding standards such as H.263 and MPEG-1,2,4, and commercially available video compression systems. In applying DCT to very low bit rate video coding, blocking artifacts become quite pronounced. This research is focused on non-block oriented decomposition techniques to replace DCT in today's video coding systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne such scheme recently developed at the VIP group at U.C. Berkeley involves signal decomposition over a larger, more flexible over-complete basis set based on Gabor dictionary. It uses the greedy, matching pursuit algorithm from the statistics literature in order to find the expansion coefficients. This approach is found to result in significant PSNR and visual quality improvement over DCT based schemes. In addition, since there are no constraints on the overcomplete set of basis functions over which the signal decomposition is carried out, the elements of the set can be chosen to be free of blocking artifacts, resulting in artifact free reconstructed frames, with no need for compute expensive post processing. The main goal of this research is to investigate signal decomposition along overcomplete dictionaries with applications to video coding. In particular the issues to be addressed regarding video coding systems based on over complete signal expansion include: fundamental bounds on performance, optimum amplitude and position coding algorithms, non-block based motion compensation techniques to match the non-blocky nature of the basis set, dictionary design, decomposition and search strategies, and extension to: (a) spatio-temporal scalability, (b) still image coding, (c) multiple description coding and (d) synthetic video/imagery/graphics. \r\n\r\n\r\nLevel of Effort Statement: At the recommended level of support, the PI will make every attempt to meet the original scope and level of the project. \r\n",
