 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional graduate training program of education and research in manufacturing logistics. The program will build upon the foundation of industry/university research carried out between the Manufacturing Logistics Institute at Lehigh University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  The proposed IGERT program will provide significant resources for both Ph.D. programs, transforming two traditionally strong programs into a multidisciplinary center for doctoral research in manufacturing logistics. The vision is to prepare Ph.D.'s capable of being global industrial or academic leaders in manufacturing logistics.  Manufacturing logistics refers to the planning, coordination and service functions required between the point where customer demands are determined and where they are fulfilled. The increasing international scope of these functions has created a need for broader-based research and education. This requires the integration of operations research, information technology, environmental sciences, and global logistics. Clear research guidelines are provided by a NSF workshop held at Lehigh in 1997. Program goals include achievement of multidisciplinary research proficiency, industry internships, international experiences, and leadership skills.  Thirty-six participants from various universities and industry will work together to achieve these goals. \r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this second year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. This specific award is supported by funds from the Directorates for Engineering, for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences, and for Education and Human Resources.\r\n\r\n",
