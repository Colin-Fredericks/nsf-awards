The project uses an ethnographic examination of the meanings of male initiation practices among speakers of BenaBena to understand how local people understand morality, the life course, and native theories of the physiological constitution of persons and procreation.  The project will analyze how market capitalism, Christianity and the ideology of the nation-state have been exported to these small-scale, kinship-based societies, and how this export has affected the cultural definition of the role of individuals in social groups. The methods will include classical ethnographic participant observation, genealogies, taped interviews, and a census of the community.  The student will study these issues in a range of villages undergoing different experiences of contact with markets and urban society.  The project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n",
