 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University is developing a new model for introductory physics laboratories within the traditional course structure that enhances student engagement in the material and promotes better conceptual understanding of fundamental physics principles. To fully integrate the lecture, recitation, and laboratory components of the course,  qualitative tutorials on a physics principle followed by a hands-on experimental activity are adapted and implemented from the Tutorials in Introductory Physics   (Prentice Hall, New York, 1998) in the laboratory component of the course.  Quantitative computer-based experimental activities are developed in consultation with members of the physics education research community to complement the existing Tutorials in Introductory Physics.  For the computer-based experimental activities, the Duke team is adapting materials from RealTime Physics Active Learning Laboratories (Wiley, New York, 1998) as well as those from the Workshop Physics Activity Guide (Wiley, New York, 1997).  The laboratory physical environment promotes collaborative group learning integrated with technology and provides an important prototype for educational approaches currently pursued by Duke in the sciences.   The laboratory environment is based on a design by Laws (Dickinson College) and collaborators in the Workshop Physics project and is described at the Dickinson web site (http://physics.dickinson.edu/PhysicsPages/Workshop_Physics/Instructor_Resources/Equipment/Equipment_Home.htm).   A comprehensive laboratory Mentor training program is used to train the Mentors in effective use of inquiry-based instructional methods in collaboration with the Duke Center for Teaching, Learning, and Writing, and it is connected to the existing pre-service teacher preparation, Physics Graduate Teaching Certificate programs, and Preparing Future Faculty programs. The mentor program is adapted from the physics program developed at the University of Minnesota (http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/Research/MNModel/orient.html)\r\nand the Science of Life program developed at Duke as part of the NSF-funded RAIRE project entitled Integrating Research & Education: Extending and Sharing Successful Models. Project results are assessed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative tools to determine the effect our program has on student conceptual understanding and perception of physics.  Dissemination of the materials and findings are promoted at the local campus, state and national levels through oral presentations, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and freely over the World Wide Web. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
