Sadler, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Bosphorus University, Istanbul, Turkey.  The two scientists to study the cryopreservation of starfish oocytes, eggs and embryos.  Starfish gametes and embryos provide a useful model system for studying many basic cell biological and developmental processes.  However the seasonal availability of gametes confines the scope of projects that can be carried out with this system since there is currently no means of preserving the gametes of any marine organism.  Tremendous strides have been made towards preserving mammalian gametes, and Toner's laboratory has developed a highly successful theoretically optimized protocol for cryopreserving mammalian oocytes.  This project will draw upon the achievements in mammalian gamete cryopreservation to develop a similar protocol for starfish gametes.  This will benefit from Sadler's research on starfish and will aid the international community working with this system.  Since the cryobiology field has mainly focused on preserving mammalian cells, little is known about the biological consequences of freezing non-mammalian cells.  The project will draw upon Sadler's expertise to address fundamental questions about the effect of cryopreservation on cell function by analysis of cell cycle dynamics, fertilization competency and developmental potential of the cryopreserved starfish gametes and embryos.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow a US scientist at Mass General Hospital and a scientist at Bosphorus University to collaborate in a project in which both have unique expertise and complementary capabilities.  Toner has expertise in the field of cryopreservation of mammalian cells, and most notably has succeeded in the design of a theoretically optimized cryopreservation protocol for mouse oocytes. Sadler has knowledge of starfish oocyte biology as well as the material and the facilities for the studies with the cryopreserved cells.  The results would be useful for researchers world-wide who are studying female gametes from marine invertebrates, as well as those who do not have the resources to collect and maintain marine organisms.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit. \r\n",
