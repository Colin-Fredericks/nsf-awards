Wallenstein, Ph.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT  \r\n\r\nA number of studies have shown that the hippocampus, a region in the medial temporal lobes, is critical for learning and memory. Rats with lesions of the hippocampus are typically impaired on tasks that require spatial working memory. These deficits are also evident in rats with lesions of the fimbria-fornix, the major fiber bundle connecting the basal forebrain with the hippocampus. Selective lesions of basal forebrain cells that release acetylcholine into the hippocampus also impair spatial working memory. Although many studies have examined the influence of cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation in the hippocampus, little is known about the effects of cholinergic nicotinic receptor function in this region. This research will employ a combination of brain slice physiology and computational modeling to examine the effects of nicotinic receptor activation on cellular communication within different regions of the hippocampus. The biophysical data obtained from the physiological experiments will be incorporated into a previously developed model of this region. The model will be used to determine how the cellular/circuit effects of hippocampal nicotinic receptor activation provide mechanisms that support the behavioral memory tasks known to be sensitive to such modulation. The model will also generate predictions concerning the effects of nicotinic receptor activation on population rhythms in the hippocampus and how they may contribute to working memory in general.\r\n\r\n",
