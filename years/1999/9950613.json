 "awd_abstract_narration": "1Northern Arizona University has formed a partnership with three community colleges, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and Prentice-Hall to develop and test a new model of courseware that we call BIOSCAPES: Biological Informatics Office ---Studies of Complex Anatomy and Physiology within Educational Simulations. This interactive software allows students to conduct research on the complexities of multisystem interactions in human anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, including impacts of infections from a variety of pathogens. They identify data necessary to answer a variety of research questions, and begin to collect, analyze, and interpret data within a virtual university-hospital that has two interconnected work settings.\r\n\r\nBIOSCAPES allows students to move back and forth from a research-oriented university setting (with various types of information and databases) to a hospital-oriented database with a very realistic human element. This movement is facilitated by having students work within two virtual but connected worlds, providing complementary databases necessary to answer very complex questions about human systems interactions. Importantly, our educational model is based on strategies to: (1) improve students' tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors; (2) to create articulated mundane and experimental realism in simulated problem-solving venues; (3) to train students how to use multiple databases to answer complex problems; (4) to mimic research on complex problems in a student-active framework; and (5) to find out what works in science education, for whom, at what time, under what conditions and to what effect.  The project has a strong K-12 outreach component that includes formal agreements to test the BIOSCAPES software in courses taken by preservice teachers, and to disseminate information about the model through an extensive inservice teacher network.\r\n",
