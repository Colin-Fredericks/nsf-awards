Technical\r\n\r\nThe long term goal of this project is to understand in atomic detail the molecular mechanisms of copper homeostasis in bacteria. A number of bacterial resistance systems for various toxic metal ions have been identified genetically, but it is not known how the specific gene products combine on the molecular level to provide resistance. The proposed research focuses on the Escherichia coli plasmid-borne copper resistance system pco, which encodes 7 different proteins, including the periplasmic proteins PcoA, PcoC, and PcoE. PcoA, PcoC, and PcoE all contain unusual methionine and/or histidine rich sequence motifs which do not resemble any known copper binding motifs. The research plan involves a combination of X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches. The specific aims are 1) to solve the high resolution X-ray structures of the Cu(II), Cu(I), and apo forms of PcoC, 2) to solve the high resolution X-ray structures of the copper and apo forms of PcoE, 3) to crystallize and solve the structure of PcoA, and 4) to study interactions between PcoA and PcoC. The resultant structural information is expected to reveal novel copper binding sites and to expand existing knowledge of copper centers in biology.\r\n\r\n2.  Non-technical\r\n\r\nCopper is an essential element in microorganisms, but is also potentially harmful. Because large quantities of copper are toxic, a number of plant diseases caused by bacteria are treated with copper containing bacteriocides. Some bacteria have evolved systems to resist copper, however. In order to treat crop afflictions caused by these resistant bacteria, an understanding of the mechanism of copper resistance is required. A number of proteins involved in resistance systems have been identified, but exactly how these proteins interact with copper is not understood. The projects described in this proposal focus on discovering how one such family of proteins binds and transports copper. The information gained is expected to have important practical applications for agriculture. Furthermore, the proposed work will expand fundamental knowledge of copper chemistry.\r\n",
