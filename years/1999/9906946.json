 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most significant lines of inquiry with respect to the human dimensions of global change in research on the patterns and processes of land-use and land-cover change in different parts of the globe.  This doctoral dissertation research project examines the dramatic process of accelerating land conversion in the Brazilian cerrado of the Amazon Basin, a species-rich arboreal savanna that has undergone tremendous land conversion by modern agricultural development.  Soybeans, hybrid maize and cotton, upland rice, and large-scale cattle ranching consumed more than a third (or roughly 7 million hectares) of the cerrado.  This investigation of agricultural and environmental changes in the region will begin by focusing on local land and resource users in eastern Mato Grosso state of south central Brazil, paying particular attention to the sociocultural and economic processes associated with recent land conversion that operate at multiple geographic and temporal scales.  Field research will assess changing local resource use in eastern Mato Grosso since 1969 by exploring land-use decision-making structure, process of colonization, and local history of agricultural and agronomic technology, land tenure, and access to natural and capital resources.  Remotely sensed images will be interpreted and a geographic information system (GIS) used for spatial analysis in order to determine the loss of cerrado vegetation and the establishment of new croplands, pastures, and settlements.  Archival and policy research will highlight the ideological and political economic forces at the local and national scales that are supporting and also contesting agricultural modernization.  This project will shed new light on the role of local-scale processes in human-environmental interactions, with special attention given to the state's role in agricultural subsidies and technological advances in production.  It also will provide new insights into the integration of field-based ethnographic research with remotely sensed data.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
