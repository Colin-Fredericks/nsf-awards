Modern broadband seismic instrumentation has revolutionized seismology and allowed the retrieval of information in almost any frequency band of seismic interest.  Through serendipity, a PASSCAL portable broadband seismic experiment \"captured\" the static displacement just above the earthquake as well as very long period waves between the P and S waves.  These signals may be interpreted as the intermediate- and near-field terms of the displacement field associated with a shear dislocation.  Since the1994 event, more than 16 additional deep earthquakes have been identified which produced similar intermediate- and near-field terms.  Since these terms depend on the temporal evolution of the seismic moment rather than the moment rate (as is observed in far-field seismic signals), modeling these terms could provide new insights into the mechanics of earthquakes.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\r\n     \r\n\r\n",
