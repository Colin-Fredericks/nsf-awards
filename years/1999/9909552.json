 "awd_abstract_narration": "SPECIAL PROJECT:  This project develops, tests and validates a national model for the adaptation and implementation of an advanced technology curriculum by using the current technologies of satellite teleconferencing and Internet resources.  This model starts with a three-hour national teleconference event featuring a panel discussion and multimedia presentation of a new computer networking curriculum. The panelists include faculty who have implemented the new curriculum, industry partners, and members of professional organizations, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the National Association of Communications Systems Engineers(NACSE).   \r\n\r\nThe teleconference is a starting point for a series of activities to provide the necessary resources to two-year college faculty and administrators to adapt and implement an associate degree curriculum in computer networking.   Twenty prime sites will be identified to participate in the project and to receive matching support to develop this track.   Other sites can also participate as viewers of the national teleconference.  This curriculum track is a component of the recently completed ACM Guidelines for Degree and Certificate Programs to Support Computing in a Networked Environment produced by the ACM Two-Year College Education Committee. \r\n\r\nThe measurable objectives of this project include:   1) identification of a variety of resources to support adaptation and implementation of the associate degree and certificate programs in networking;    2)  identification of twenty institutions across the United States to be prime sites to implement the new curriculum;  3) dissemination of information and strategies for adapting and implementing the new curriculum by means of the teleconference event;    4) establishment of a uniform evaluation protocol to be used across the 20 primary sites to validate the model;  5)  establishment of a discussion forum for the participants to enable communication and sharing of resources;  and 6) provision of ongoing assistance, mentoring and peer support to facilitate the adaptation and implementation process. \r\n",
