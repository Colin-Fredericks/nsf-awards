Conventional learning designs are usually based on an effort to minimize either square error or a measure of entropy which can be computationally difficult to handle.  This project will attempt to estimate  and use a new measure of entropy, based on concepts from Renyi.  The appeal of the algorithm is that it can be easily integrated with a Parzen window estimator yielding several practical criteria to adapt universal mappers, either under unsupervised or supervised paradigms.\r\n\r\nIf the research is successful a novel and quite general class of algorithms will be made available to\r\nthe scientific community interested in studying and applying learning systems. The natural goal of this research is to further develop the ITL algorithms, an study their application to a variety of important problems in learning. Specifically, the project will study the properties of the estimator for both entropy  and mutual information, ways to decrease the computational complexity of the algorithm, extend it to time signals, set its parameter and access its scalability.  It will also investigate new distance measures for mutual information optimization and the feasibility of imple-menting an \"entropy chip\" in analog VLSI which will use the laws of physics to do the computation.\r\n\r\nThe research team/will be investigating issues in information filtering, independent component analysis and blind source separation using the newly developed ITL class of algorithms. These areas are important in their own right, and have a momentum that will be further advanced in this research. But the team will also use the common computational infra-structure of estimating entropy and mutual information from examples to compare the proposed ITL algorithms' performance with the best available techniques in each field.  Specifically, (1) They will extend the present state-of-the-art in the blind source separation of convolutive mixtures.  They will apply the new\r\nlearning algorithm to the co-channel interference in mobile communication channels, and noise reduction in hearing aids. (2) They will apply ITL to system identification and dynamic modeling and com-pare it to our previous results using the mean square error. (3) The problem of sparse representa-tions is crucial to understand the brain and design intelligent artificial systems. We will be researching how to learn sparse representation from data, using both overcomplete bases and the ITL algorithm to implement independent component analysis. \r\n***\r\n",
