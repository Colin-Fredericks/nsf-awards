These covalent adducts\r\nare a potentially lethal form of DNA damage, and can be formed from attack\r\nof proteins on oxidatively damaged DNA. Using a photochemical method called\r\nthe flash-quench technique, a powerful ground-state oxidant will be\r\nprepared on the DNA by oxidative quenching of a photoexcited intercalator.\r\nThe oxidized intercalator selectively oxidizes guanine bases.  Given that\r\nDNA is typically associated with proteins in the cell, and that proteins\r\nhave many nucleophilic sidechains, one likely outcome following guanine\r\noxidation is the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks.  Current experimental\r\napproaches to DNA-protein crosslinking reactions produce either a myriad of\r\nnonspecifically crosslinked products or specific products that are not of\r\nphysiological relevance.  In contrast, the flash-quench technique offers a\r\nway to produce specific crosslinks between DNA and protein that may have\r\nphysiological relevance.   The specific aims of this study are to i) define\r\nand optimize the parameters important for generating nonspecific\r\nDNA-protein adducts by the flash-quench technique and ii) create specific\r\nDNA-protein crosslinks to obtain one adduct in high yield for chemical\r\ncharacterization.  The successful establishment of this approach would help\r\nto elucidate one consequence of oxidative damage to DNA at the molecular\r\nlevel. This research experience will be shared with the students.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical: A new method is proposed for the formation of strong\r\nbonds between DNA and protein, known as DNA-protein crosslinks.   Oxidative\r\ndamage to DNA is thought to play a role in many diseases, and many people\r\ntake antioxidants to counteract the free radicals that can cause such\r\ndamage.  Free radicals are electron-deficient species that can oxidize\r\n(take electrons from) DNA, leaving an \"electron hole\" on the DNA.  It is\r\nthought that this  \"electron hole\" can be filled  by amino acids of\r\nproteins that are electron-rich, resulting in a bond between DNA and\r\nprotein.  Because DNA must be free to interact with many different proteins\r\nin the body, the formation of a permanent bond with one given protein could\r\nbe lethal.  Here, the flash-quench technique is used to make electron holes\r\non DNA.  In this method, a \"flash\" of blue light excites a small molecule\r\nnestled between the DNA bases, and this excited molecule is then \"quenched\"\r\nby giving an electron to another small molecule nearby the DNA.  The\r\nquenched molecule then behaves like a free radical and oxidizes the DNA,\r\nwhich in turn leads to DNA-protein crosslinks.  The advantage of the\r\nflash-quench technique is that it only oxidizes one type of group on the\r\nDNA, the guanine base, whereas most other approaches heretofore cause\r\nindiscriminate damage all over the DNA molecule.  This selectivity should\r\nallow for the detailed study of DNA-protein crosslinking reactions with\r\nguanine, and should elucidate one consequence of oxidative damage to DNA at\r\nthe molecular level. This research experience will be shared with the\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
