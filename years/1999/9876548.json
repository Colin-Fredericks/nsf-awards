 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nCurrent economic events in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe strongly suggest the possibility that deteriorating financial conditions at banks are important factors in either causing or prolonging severe disruptions in economic activity. Credit crunches attributable to weakness in the U.S. banking sector have been cited as a contributing if not causal factor in the 1990-91 recession and in the various regional contractions that have occurred throughout the United States over the 1984-1993 period. Recent research suggests that the same economic forces at play in such obviously disruptive episodes also may be at play during the regular course of the business cycle. Thus, frictions in banking and financial markets that propagate large shocks leading to severe recessions may also be important contributing factors in other business cycle episodes, such as the Volcker disinflation and subsequent recession of 1982.\r\nDespite the clear empirical links between bank health and bank lending, there are very few studies that document significant declines in economic activity that can be attributed directly to the observed contractions in bank lending. A key problem is identification. Simultaneous declines in bank health and lending may reflect declines in overall economic activity, rather than vice-versa. This lack of identification reflects a paucity of data linking borrowers to banks. Without such data, loan supply cannot be separated from loan demand. Broad indices of economic activity rather than data on specific borrowers that are most likely bank-dependent must be relied upon to assess the overall impact of credit supply disruptions originating at banks.\r\nTwo separate but related projects will be conducted. The first project studies the economic consequences of credit-supply shocks originating at banks. It uses unique data sources that directly match borrowers to their primary banks to analyze the effect of large disruptions in bank loan supply on the investment, inventory and employment behavior of bank-dependent firms. The use of matched borrower-bank data solves many of the identification problems that have plagued this literature. The sectoral transmission of loan supply shocks is studied by analyzing the response of geographically distant plants that share a common lending relationship.\r\nThe second project considers the macroeconomic consequences of credit market imperfections and investment frictions in a general equilibrium model. The goal of this exercise is to build an empirically-tractable general-equilibrium model that incorporates key interactions between monetary policy, financial markets and investment decisions. A flexible specification of the investment process that provides a realistic description of investment dynamics is used. By combining investment decision lags, adjustment costs and financial market imperfections, the model can rationalize a persistent hump-shaped response of output to monetary policy without relying on unrealistically large nominal rigidities.  The model will be estimated using minimum-distance techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
