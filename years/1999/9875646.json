 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875646\r\nSrinivasarao\r\nThis proposal is focused on the use of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs) for display devices.  Polymer dispersed liquid crystals consist of micron size drops of small molecule (nematic) liquid crystals embedded or trapped in a polymer matrix formed by photopolymerization.  The aim of the proposal is to understand the dynamics of domain growth in a reactive medium that is undergoing phase separation.  A laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) will be utilized to make measurements confirming growth laws operable in these systems, and to develop methods of imaging director configurations in complicated morphologies in three dimension.  Such methods should find applications in a variety of other areas besides the materials under study in this proposal.  The integration of this research with education goals will provide a very stimulating environment for students both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  The integration of research and education to be implemented in this project will provide students with a very broad education that crosses disciplinary boundaries, requiring knowledge of physics of liquid crystals, chemistry, optics, and polymer chemistry.\r\n%%%\r\nOrganic thin films are utilized in various technological applications.  Their role in display devices is a case in point.  The use of devices for displaying information that use liquid crystals are quite pervasive as is evidenced by their use in laptop computer screens.  This particular approach to the integration of research with education will expose both undergraduate and graduate students to interdisciplinary research that provides a glimpse of what is to follow in industrial settings.  The biggest impact will be in educating young minds and preparing young scientists and engineers to compete in future job markets.  These outreach activities are also designed to help educate high school teachers on issues that are pertinent to society in this \"age of plastics\". \r\n",
