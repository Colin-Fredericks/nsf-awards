 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe proposed research concerns the analysis of issues which play important roles in models with interesting physics, particularly of the area of condensed matter.  The goal is to contribute to the understanding of the physics involved, and also to develop mathematical structures which are of relevance as well as of intrinsic interest.\r\n\tParticular attention will be given to: i) the stochastic geometry of excitations related to the correlations in systems which are critical in the sense of statistical mechanics, and ii) the de-localization transition for quantum operators in the presence of localizing disorder.\r\n\tFractal structures play important roles in correlated fluctuations in critical systems, and in the nature of correlations in quantum spin chains at low temperatures.  It is proposed to continue to develop the basic tools for dealing with the emergent stochastic geometric structures, to study some model-specific and dimension-dependent properties in systems ranging from percolation to classical and quantum spin models, and to elucidate the relations with conformal field theory.\r\n\tExtended excitations play fundamental role in conduction phenomena.  The other goal of the proposed work is to analyze the de-localization transition, i.e., the formation of extended states in systems with extensive disorder.\r\n",
