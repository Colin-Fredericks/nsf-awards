 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pflops-2 workshop, unlike its predecessor, will be a conference style meeting involving a large attendance (approximately 200) of experts in related fields.  Attendance will be open and a call for papers will be issued and disseminated widely.  There will also be invited participants and recognized leaders within their respective disciplines including technologies, architecture, system software, applications, and algorithms.  Findings from previous in-depth workshops and studies will be summarized.  Focus groups will provide detailed descriptions of complete systems approaches and the issues requiring resolution prior to implementation.  The call for papers will invite presentations on all aspects of petaflops-scale computing.  There will be invited talks on the areas that have been studied since the February 1994 workshop.  In addition, presentations will be solicited in a few areas not yet considered by the Petaflops initiative, as well radically new approaches such as Quantum Computing , Quantum Dots, Nanotechnologies, Continuum Computing, and Metacomputing.  While these are incipient in development, their potential for future very high performance computing warrants attention.  Participants will work together to assess the relative risk and opportunities of alternative approaches and expose additional possible problems.  One area to be discussed will be reliability for systems of sufficient complexity to achieve a petaflops and will involve reliability enhancement, fault tolerance, and packaging issues.  \r\n\r\nPflops-2 will be held in Santa Barbara, California.  A formal report will be developed by the workshop leaders and editorial staff shortly after the conclusion of the workshop.  This workshop will concluded the formal Petaflops workshop series will provide a strong foundation of information for the computer science community and government program managers to establish new directions in high end computing research.\r\n",
