It consists of\r\nthree main areas of research activity. In part one, the objective is \r\nto investigate some applications and generalizations of doubling property\r\nfor parabolic equations. The emphasis is on the behavior near the boundary\r\nof positive solutions of second order parabolic equations.  In part two,\r\nthe goal is to derive some regularity estimates for fully nonlinear\r\nequations with weaker (than concavity) condition. The a priori estimate\r\nfor fully nonlinear equations with concavity assumption is well developed.\r\nThe understanding of former would give some applications to\r\nstochastic game theory, calibrated geometry, and nonlinear elasticity\r\ntheory. In part three, the aim is to study the best constant in an\r\nisoperimetric inequality. There is a sharp isoperimetric inequality in the\r\nEuclidean space with the standard flat metric. An interesting question is\r\nthe corresponding one in negatively curved space. An affirmative answer\r\nwould also give the sharp Sobolev inequality in the negatively curved\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this project is to have some qualitative and quantative\r\ninformation about our nature and society. Since partial differential\r\nequations model and even describe many phenomena in our world. Estimates\r\nfor solutions of partial differential equations are what we need. Studying\r\nthe equations posed in this project is important for both practical and\r\ntheoretical purposes, and has broad applications in many fields, such as\r\nheat transfer problems, chemical reaction, porous media, traffic flows,\r\nbiology, and economics. \r\n",
