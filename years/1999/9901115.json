 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sheldon G. Shore of the Chemistry Department, Ohio State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to explore avenues for the preparation and study of inorganic complexes that are composed of lanthanide metals and transition metals, either linked by an intervening group such as cyanide ion or directly coupled by lanthanide-transition metal bonds. A further aim of the proposed research is to prepare and examine transition metal and lanthanide derivatives of selected borane ligands that contain one or two boron atoms.\r\n\r\nInorganic complexes that contain transition metals (such as nickel, palladium and platinum) display a great variety of interesting and useful properties. Many such compounds have the ability to catalyze important chemical transformations used in industrial processes and in the synthesis of new organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals. Compounds that contain both transition metal atoms and also lanthanide (\"rare earth elements\" such as ytterbium or gadolinium) atoms have heretofore been  rare. There are good reasons to expect that such compounds, if they could be prepared, would have novel, interesting and important properties, such as the ability to catalyze chemical reactions that cannot now be catalyzed.  Building on experience gained in successful research supported by NSF in the past, Shore and his colleagues will devise methods to prepare  new compounds containing both lanthanide and transition-metal atoms, characterize those compounds, and  explore their properties. In addition, new types of compounds containing groups of two interlinked boron atoms will also be prepared and their properties explored.  Graduate students involved in this work will acquire expertise in several aspects of metal and main group chemistry, as well as in related areas of engineering and geology. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
