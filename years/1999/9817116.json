 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ATP-K channels) of cells are so-named because of their inhibition by intracellular ATP.  This inhibition plays a crucial role in the coupling of electrical activity of the plasma membrane to energy metabolism in a variety of animal cell types.  However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of this coupling.  The ATP-K channel is formed from four subunits each of a regulatory subunit, and a pore-forming subunit.  To understand how ATP inhibits the gated opening of the pore, it is fundamental to understand the number and location of ATP binding sites relative to the structure of the gate itself.  Preliminary studies have defined amino acid sequences involved in ATP binding and gating which map to the C-terminal domain of the pore-forming subunit.  These results will be extended by constructing multimeric fusion proteins of mutant and wild-type subunits to analyze the number of binding sites and gates and how they interact in the presence of ATP.  The approach will combine site-directed mutagenesis and expression of mutant channels in frog oocytes where channel activity can be assayed by electrophysiological methods.  The results will reveal the subunit arrangement of both binding sites and gates and whether they interact independently or cooperatively.  It is anticipated that the resulting molecular model for the ATP-K channel will have broad implications for how other membrane proteins may be regulated directly by ATP and hence indirectly by the energy state of the cell.\r\n",
