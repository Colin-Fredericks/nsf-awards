In the Klamath Mountains province of California, extension related arc magmatism alternated with contraction-related magmatism, but the former resulted in calc-alkaline magmas whereas the latter was associated with distinctive K20-rich magmas.  The Bear Mountain intrusive complex contains these pluton types and their contact aureoles.  This study will address the kinematic and strain history, the petrography and thermobarometry of the plutons and wall rocks in order to relate magma composition to tectonic environment.  Petrologic modeling will attempt to understand the formation and evolution of the pluton and contact zone, including migmatitic rocks.  Results will provide clearer understanding of the links between magma composition, tectonic setting and development of strain fabrics, both for the Bear Mountain complex and other examples for arc magmatism in convergent and extensional circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
