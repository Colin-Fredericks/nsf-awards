 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve electronics-related science, mathematics, engineering and technology education through the development, implementation, evaluation and dissemination of coupling engaging multimedia web-based technologies with interactive learning modules (ILMs). It develops, demonstrates, and implements three web-based multimedia technologies that operate within a browser environment and include: a means to capture, review and process a student's actions while using a interactive learning module (Scribe); a technology that allows for interactive, collaborative exploration, design and testing across the Internet (WebTeam); and the ability to provide Internet access to instrumented experimentation and data gathering using an inexpensive micro-controller board (LongLab). The new multimedia-based functionality that these technologies (developed using Macromedia's Director Team and Java) offer are to be demonstrated using specifically designed Interactive Learning Modules ILMs). The modular interactive learning software materials provide a vehicle to investigate and track how individual students access the information, how students learn collaboratively by working in teams across the Internet; and how access to laboratory experiments from a distance can impact the understanding of key concepts. Three faculty members and five research assistants from this institution, one faculty member and one research assistant from UT Dallas, are collaborating with this University's Academy of Electronic Media staff to develop, test and implement the project's materials and technologies over a period of two years. Consultants from the Evaluation Consortium at the University of Albany are advising and evaluating the overall effectiveness resulting from each of the project activities.",
