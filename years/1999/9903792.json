Results from earlier research indicate that the vegetation of northeastern North America was undergoing pronounced changes for 300-500 years before European arrival and that many of the forest dynamics ascribed to human land-use were actually continuations or modifications of trends initiated centuries earlier by climate change coincident with the Little Ice Age. Despite the compelling need to place forest and land-use dynamics within the context of changing environments and vegetation, there has been no integrated attempt to interpret pre- and post-European vegetation change in light of independent data on climate history and human activity. This research will use a multifaceted approach including paleoecological, paleolimnological, and historical methods to reconstruct climate, vegetation, and cultural dynamics over the past 1500 years at sites arrayed across the climatic and forest gradients of New England and to place these results in a regional framework through analysis of pollen records. Results will provide: (1) an objective characterization of the Little Ice Age and climate history in New England, (2) comparison of pre- and post-European forest dynamics in relationship to independent environmental and land-use histories, (3) a re-examination of historical vegetation dynamics in light of prior climate and vegetation change, and (4) widespread availability of data and results through publications, symposium presentations, and the Harvard Forest Archives and web pages.\r\n",
