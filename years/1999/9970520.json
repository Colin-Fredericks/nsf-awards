 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9970520\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Wilfrid Gangbo\r\n\r\nAbstract: In 1904, in his remarkable paper on the limits of economy in framed structures, Michell attacked the following difficult problem: given an equilibrium system of forces (loads and reactions) with specified points of application, and given an elastic material with allowable range for its uniaxial stress, to design a truss in the plane with bars of the given material such that the given forces produce axial stresses within the allowable limits, while the total volume of material used for the bars is as small as possible. Michell's problem and its many variants and extensions have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years among engineers as well as mathematicians. In the coplanar case, Michell formally proved that, in the optimal layout, bars are arranged along the lines of principal strains of a displacement that arises as a Lagrange multiplier. These lines form an orthogonal system of coordinates in the plane. Any optimal design satisfying these conditions is called a Michell truss. Gangbo plans to study geometrical and topological properties of supports of optimal stresses. Techniques for studying this problem are similar to those that apply to the Monge-Kantorovich problem. Gangbo also plans to make use of the Monge-Kantorovich theory, which has recently been recognized as a powerful tool for constructively studying the semigeostrophic shallow water problem, which is a three-dimensional free boundary problem. \r\n\r\nThe Michell truss problem was originally motivated by the desire to engineer a structure built of beams capable of supporting a specified array of forces, and to do this with maximum economy by using the least quantity of a given elastic material. Of course, while trying to be as efficient as possible, one must still produce a design that ensures a safe structure. Gangbo's interest is to determine good models for the design of such least-volume frames. The determination of the endpoints of the bars of the frame is the most difficult part of this problem. The second part of the proposal consists in studying shallow-water flow, meaning flow in which the vertical length scale is small in comparison to the horizontal length scale (e.g., the flow of ocean currents). If one collects data at a given time, one hopes to predict how that data will evolve over time. For instance, if one measures the pressure of the water today, one would like to forecast its pressure tomorrow. In the geostrophic model, pressure is an important quantity to know. For instance, one can infer the speed of the water from its pressure. Gangbo will use the so-called Monge-Kantorovich theory, which has recently surfaced as a powerful tool in various fields of mathematics.  \r\n\r\n",
