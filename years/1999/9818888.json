 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been asserted that every legislator's principal goal is to be reelected.  The structure, rules, and norms of Congress help legislators to achieve their goals.  And since that structure is endogenous to the institution, legislators can and would change the rules if they failed to meet their needs.  This research explores one such case in which legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives changed the process for selecting their leaders when the old system became suboptimal.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to focus attention on strategic behavior of legislators within an institution, formal models of legislatures often \"black box\" the strategic behavior of voters.  Legislators are assumed to be office-seeking, so they want to please voters, but voters are rarely depicted in formal models of legislatures as making complex rational choice calculations.  This leads to an unnecessary divide in the literature, with neo-institutionalism on one side, and spatial models of voting on the other.  \r\n\r\nThis Doctoral Dissertation Research project develops two formal theories of leadership selection.  In the simple model, pure seniority determines who gets power and who does not.  In the more complex model, each party uses majority rule to determine which of its members will rise to leadership positions.  The model incorporates several assumptions.  Legislators are first and foremost reelection seeking.  They also derive utility from holding a position of power within the legislature.  Therefore, they seek power, provided that doing so does not cause them to lose reelection.  Like the Hotelling-Downs models, voters derive utility from electing legislators who are ideologically proximate to them.  They also derive utility from electing a powerful legislator, but that utility is a function of the ideological distance from the legislator to the constituent.  As members of their political parties, as well, legislators derive utility from electing leaders who are proximate to them and are able to perform leadership tasks well.  The model can easily be manipulated to include term limits and interest group donations.\r\n\r\nThe project includes several empirical tests of the model, using data from the United States House of Representatives and four state legislatures:  California, Florida, Illinois, and New Hampshire.  These states were selected because they diverge on many of the variables relevant to the study, including the power of political parties in the electorate and in the legislature, the role of interest groups, the behavior of interest groups, and the types of leadership selection processes.\r\n\r\nPreliminary data analysis consists of a comparison between relevant variables in the 1950s, arguably the heyday of the seniority rule, and in the 1990s, when party preferences play more of a role in leadership selection.  This data analysis shows differences in behavior among legislatures.  Most notably, party unity scores have increased from the 1950s, in correspondence with the model's prediction that legislators under a party selection process would move ideologically toward their parties in an effort to gain power.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
