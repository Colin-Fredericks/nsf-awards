 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rigorous micro-macro estimates for low-symmetry polycrystals.\r\n\r\nA fundamental problem in materials engineering is the computation of the\r\nmacroscopic behavior of polycrystalline aggregates from the microscopic\r\nbehavior of their constituent single-crystal grains and statistical\r\ninformation about the grain size, shape and distribution. Exactly 50 years\r\nsince its introduction by G.I. Taylor, this is still being done by means of\r\nthe uniform strain-rate approximation. While appropriate for\r\nhigh-symmetry/low-anisotropy crystals, such as FCC and BCC materials, the\r\nTaylor approach is highly inaccurate for low-symmetry/high-anisotropy\r\npolycrystals, such as HCP and ionic materials, especially when the number\r\nof independent slip systems is deficient (less than five). In addition, it\r\nis well known that the Taylor theory leads to texture predictions that are\r\nsignificantly sharper than experimentally observed. To address these two\r\nlong-standing limitations of the Taylor model, we propose to implement a\r\nrigorous nonlinear homogenization method (the so-called second-order\r\nprocedure) that has already been used with great success by the PI for\r\nmetal-matrix and other types of composites materials. The ultimate\r\nobjective is the development of constitutive models for implementation in\r\nfinite element simulations of deformation processing operations, fully\r\naccounting for crystallographic and morphological texture evolution in\r\nthese materials. This research program will have an impact in the\r\ndevelopment of improved manufacturing operations for light-weight,\r\nhigh-strength structural alloys (e.g., titanium), which are of great\r\nimportance in many industries.\r\n\r\n",
