 "awd_abstract_narration": "9760671\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Intellipro, Inc. will exploit Web technologies to respond to the national need for improved quality, accessibility, and efficiency of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) instruction at all levels.  The challenge is to combine the interactive capabilities of simulation with collaborative possibilities of the Web to create collaborative simulation, software to facilitate development and delivery of highly interactive, cognitively motivating, and socially enriched content that will substantially improve SMET teaching and learning in traditional and distance learning settings.  The proposed technology will address several initiatives in SMET instruction--creation of quality content, accommodation of learning styles, and inclusion of underrepresented students.  The researchers envision powerful and pedagogically scalable software to allow faculty, publishers, and others to create engaging content-providing real-world experiences and allowing students to interact, alone or with others, with the material-that will permit implementation of advanced learning strategies.  To determine feasibility, Intellipro will define a pedagogically appropriate software design; evaluate technology available to implement the design; and prototype critical elements of the design; and field-test the prototype.  A professional team with expertise in simulation, instructional design, and SMET content develop will collaborate on the research with a stellar group of engineering educators.\r\n     If the proposed research meets its goals, the resulting software and support materials will have significant commercial possibilities, providing a platform for the development and delivery of interactive content at all educational levels, and in a variety of settings.  It has the potential to have a significant impact on how group learning is accomplished.\r\n",
