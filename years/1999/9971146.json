 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe principal investigator is carrying out research on topics related to the mathematical theory of probability. Specific objectives include continuation of his investigations of optimal-stopping problems (especially stopping under incomplete information), constructions of random distributions, analysis and applications of Benford's law, general partitioning inequalities, and convergence and invariance principles. In new directions he is studying sharp inequalities for expected extrema and general continuity-representation theorems. The research has both theoretical and applied components, and involves collaboration with other researchers both at Georgia Tech and other universities, as well as with several graduate students.\r\n\tThis research involves the study of random processes, such as evolving financial markets or government policies, when unpredictable fluctuations are present. Much is known if there is complete knowledge of the nature of the random fluctuations, but this is usually not the case in practice. One of the thrusts of this research is to try to discover good methods for deciding when to stop or change a policy when only partial information is available about the random fluctuations. Another thrust of this research is to develop new statistical tools for estimating changes in random processes. One very new use of these ideas is application to detection of fraud in financial data. The idea is that fabricated data is usually qualitatively different from true data, and there are just recently tests based on these fluctuation theories which are proving useful in distinguishing true from fabricated data. Applications of the research on random measures includes new models for the distribution of mass in space, including various settings in physics and materials science.",
