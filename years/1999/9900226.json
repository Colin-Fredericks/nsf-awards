 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for development of a modeling framework and design tools for sustained product design.  The research initiatives of this study include developing an environmentally oriented model of the product life cycle, scientific design guidance and evaluation tools, and a systematic procedure to enhance product sustenance.  This research will utilize analogous concepts from classical and statistical thermodynamics in order to comprehend the product transformation at its various life cycle phases and to develop quantitative guidance tools for sustained product design.  The design guidance tools will quantify various desirable and undesirable design scenarios pertaining to disassembly, servicing, re-manufacturing, reuse, and recycling.  A systematic procedure using a variant of the morphological matrix, called the 3-D morphological product matrix, will be deployed to achieve enhanced product sustenance by \"exploring\" the possibility of reusing the sub-assemblies (or components) in totally different product families.  The educational goal is to create and promote student awareness on sustained product development by integrating the research results in the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research results will provide theoretical underpinnings and practical insights for effective integration of product design and environmental product life cycle issues.  The model and new guidance tools developed in this study will help the designers to analyze the environmental profiles of products and provide specific solutions to guide the sustained design process.",
