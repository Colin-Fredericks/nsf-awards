 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify point defects and impurities in ternary chalcopyrites such as AgGaS2 and AgGaSe2. These materials are promising nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for laser radiation frequency up- or down- conversion in the middle infrared (2-20 um) spectral region. The approach is based on the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The focus is on crystals doped with Cr for the purpose of making a laser active medium suitable for the mid-IR. The lasers that presently serve this range demand careful crystal alignment and have other sensitive operation requirements. The doped chalcopyrite-based lasers are expected to be comparatively simple to operate. Such systems are important for scientific studies of a variety of molecular species and for commercial or military applications requiring atmospheric transparency. \r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge relevant to the understanding and development of photonic materials for advanced technological applications. The interdisciplinary project involves collaborations across physics and materials science, and also places emphasis on the integration of research and education by incorporating graduate and undergraduate student participation into research related to classroom activities. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
