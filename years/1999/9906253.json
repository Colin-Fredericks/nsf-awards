 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing number and range of scientists are focusing their attention on issues associated with common property resources, a topic significant not only for its intellectual challenges but also for its relevance to the maintenance of environmental quality, the survival of species, and the quality of life of residents around the world.  No single discipline has sufficient tools and perspectives to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the performance of diverse institutional arrangements to manage such common resources as fresh water, forests, the atmosphere, fisheries, oceans, and the pool of genetic resources.  Furthermore, considerable academic debate surrounds claims for the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of diverse institutional arrangements for coping with local, regional, and global commons in multiple sectors.  To further interdisciplinary work on this topic, a National Research Council study committee will prepare a synthetic report on \"Institutions for Managing the Commons.\"  This report will be based on major papers presented by leading researchers from a range of relevant disciplines and will focus on six major issue areas:  (1) the emergence and sustenance of self-organized cooperation; (2) property rights, markets, and common-pool resources; (3) linkage across levels of organization as a problem for common-pool resource management; (4) heterogeneity and change among resource users; (5) uncertainty, variability, and shocks; and (6) a formal theory of individual behavior in commons dilemmas.  Discussion of the papers will occur at special panels associated with the meeting of the International Association for the Study of Common Property in June 2000, with the final report scheduled for publication early in 2001.  This project will facilitate interaction among scientists from a broad range of disciplines, and it will provide a base for future research and policy analysis on common-pool resources, including a new multiyear research effort under the International Human Dimensions Programme. \r\n",
