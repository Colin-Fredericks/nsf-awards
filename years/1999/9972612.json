 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972612\r\nDonoghue and Ree\r\n\tGraduate student Richard Ree, under the direction of Dr. Michael Donoghue at Harvard University, is studying the phylogenetic relationships and patterns of evolution in morphological characters in the genus Pedicularis (louseworts, of family Scrophulariaceae), a northern hemisphere lineage of flowering plants that has undergone extraordinary diversification in the mountains of south-central China and neighboring regions. Conflicting taxonomic classifications of the numerous species in this genus (ca.. 500 described species in total) have resulted from differing emphases on floral features versus vegetative characters by taxonomists in their mostly intuitive assessments of similarity between species. The primary aim of the project is to test the hypothesis that major differences among classifications of Pedicularis reflect differential rates of evolutionary change in vegetative versus flower characters. Molecular data from nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences, supplemented with morphological data, will be used to construct a phylogenetic (genealogical) framework for a sample of ca. 90 of the estimated 270 Asiatic species of the genus. Patterns and rates of character change will then be explored using methods of inferring ancestral states and assessing heterogeneity in rates across lineages.\r\n\tThe project is the first effort to apply modern, explicit phylogenetic methods to the study and interpretation of floral and vegetative diversity in the genus Pedicularis, and it will provide a framework for extended analyses on other species in the genus and in related Scrophulariaceae. Furthermore, the research targets one of the most species-rich regions in the eastern Himalayan biodiversity \"hotspot\" and hence will provide insights into the processes that have made this remote region the most diverse in the northern temperate zone.\r\n",
