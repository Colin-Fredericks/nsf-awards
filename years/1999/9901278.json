They plan to utilize a new technology that will produce a conditional knockout of dopamine receptor subtypes in selective brain substrates of the adult mouse.  The objective of these mutations in mammalian brain is to provide the experimental control of physiological processes.  The generation of null alleles by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells is a powerful technique to determine the physiological function of genes in vivo.  However, drawbacks of this approach include the loss of multiple functions of a single gene and developmental compensation by changes in the expression of other genes processes in specific neurons. In this project the investigators will develop a new technology to overcome these limitations.  If successful in the dopaminergic system, the same experimental strategy would be generally applicable to the functional analysis of many genes expressed in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe two investigators are experts in the techniques to be employed, therefore significant new mutational approaches, mouse strains and insights into dopamine receptor function will result from this work.  The broader impact of this research includes, besides the development of new methods to produce localized, conditional mutations in central nervous systems genes, the understanding the functional significance of the five different dopamine receptor subtypes in localized brain regions  \r\n***\r\n",
