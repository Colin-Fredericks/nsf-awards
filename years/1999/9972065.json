The first\r\npart concerns a generalization of Bernstein-Beilinson result for\r\nHarish-Chandra modules.  It was shown by Fernando that if M is an\r\nirreducible module over finite-dimensional Lie algebra G then the\r\nset of elements which act locally finitely on M is a Lie\r\nsubalgebra.  If the corresponding Lie subgroup K has finitely\r\nmany orbits on the flag manifold then Bernstein and Beilinson\r\nshowed that such modules can be obtained as D-modules extended\r\nfrom K-orbits on the flag manifold.  The principal investigator\r\nhopes to relate a subgroup K and algebraic properties of M with\r\ngeometric properties of the corresponding D-modules.  As a first\r\nresult she has a geometric construction of (G,K)-module for every\r\nK containing the maximal torus.  The second problem to be\r\nattacked is a generalization of Bernstein- Beilinson theorem for\r\nLie superalgebras.  A straightforward generalization works only\r\nfor non-degenerate central character, while the most interesting\r\nrepresentation theory happens in degenerate case.  The principal\r\ninvestigator hopes to use a superanalogue of Bernstein-Beilinson\r\ntheorem to prove her earlier conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig\r\npolynomials in the super case.\r\n\r\nThe symmetries of geometric objects and physical theories form\r\nLie groups, whose local and infinitesimal structure are described\r\nby Lie algebras: vector spaces with a product operation\r\nsatisfying simple rules.  Representation theory concerns basic\r\ndecompositions and manifestations of these Lie algebras and\r\ngroups in geometry, analysis, and algebra.  The D-modules of the\r\nproject title are algebraic structures which capture essential\r\naspects of calculus and analysis.  The principal investigator\r\nbelieves that geometric aspects of representation theory founded\r\nin works of Brylinski, Beilinson, Bernstein, Kashiwara, Kazhdan,\r\nLusztig and others can be applied to pure algebraic\r\nrepresentation theory, especially in the theory of weight modules\r\ndeveloped by Fernando, Futorny and in recent work of Mathieu.\r\nOne hopes that technical algebraic details of their proofs can\r\nbecome clear when done in geometric language of D-modules.\r\n",
