The research will be carried out in three parts:  (a) preparation of new materials based on stable dipolar molecules, (b) fabrication of thin film devices and (c) determination of device characteristics.  The new molecules, and materials derived from them, belong  to a novel special zwitterionic class of non-Kekule (NK) systems.  These dipolar heteroacenes and poly(heteroacenes) will be functionalized to modify and improve various properties such as solubility, film-formation, luminescence for devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and  lasers, and extended intermolecular interactions related to materials properties that include conductivity and ferroelectricity.  The photophysics of the dyes will be evaluated,  and the solids will be examined using the latest developments in experimental condensed matter physics.\r\n%%%\r\nIn addition to developing  new materials for lasers and other devices such as LEDs, the goal is to produce materials scientists for the twenty-first century who not only have a much broader skills base than the usual student in terms of their technical scientific and engineering training, but also who develop ancillary talents rarely acquired in graduate school.  These include:  (a) working effectively in interdisciplinary teams to solve problems and (b) appreciating first-hand the research priorities, objectives, and modus operandi inside and outside of academia.  The proposed research lends itself naturally to accomplishing these goals through the interdisciplinary interactions among physicists, chemists and engineers.\r\n***\r\n",
