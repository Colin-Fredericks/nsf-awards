Canary    \r\n\r\nAbstract:    Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In his first project, he will will study the global topology of the space AH(M) of hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy  equivalent to a fixed compact 3-manifold M.  The components of its interior are enumerated by topological data and each component is parameterized by analytic data. In the case that M has incompressible boundary, Anderson, Canary and McCullough have given a complete characterization of when two components of the interior have intersecting closures. Canary proposes to further investigate the topology of the intersection locus and thus develop a better understanding of the space. This study of AH(M) is analogous,  via the Sullivan dictionary, to the study of the Mandelbrot set in  complex dynamics. Canary also proposes to study boundaries of quasiconformal deformation spaces of geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, as well as the structure of arbitrary geometric limits of surface groups.  \r\n\r\nCanary studies the relationship between the topology and the geometry of a 3-manifold. A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there is a region which looks like a region in 3-dimensional space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold. Once one has a Riemannian metric on a manifold one can talk about its geometry.  For example, the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. A hyperbolic metric is an especially nice type of Riemannian metric, which has been extensively studied by topologists and geometers since it was first discovered in the nineteenth century. Recently, physicists have been discussing models for the geometry of our universe which have hyperbolic metrics. The choice of metric for one's model of the universe is related to the issue of whether our universe is expanding or contracting. Much of Canary's research involves the study of spaces of different hyperbolic metrics on the same topological manifold.  \r\n",
