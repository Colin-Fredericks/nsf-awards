The project concerns the computation and applications of\r\ntopological invariants in 3-dimensional topology, with an emphasis on\r\nthe use of analytic  and differential geometric machinery. The\r\nareas to be studied include the spectral flow of the Hessian\r\nof the Chern-Simons functional and related 3-manifold gauge theory\r\ninvariants including the $SU(3)$ Casson invariant and\r\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer rho invariants.  Also to be studied are twisted\r\nAlexander invariants of knots, links, and strings and  relations to\r\nCasson-Gordon invariants and  also applications of the\r\nKirk-Livingston combinatorial knot and link  invariants.\r\n\r\n   Kirk's work in pure mathematics has as its goal the solution  and\r\nclarification of geometric problems in 3 dimensions. The setting of\r\n3 dimensions on the one hand is familiar to all of us since the universe\r\nwe live in is 3-dimensional. But geometric problems in this area turn\r\nout to be very difficult for the odd reason that in such low dimensions\r\nthere is \"not enough room to move.\" This tension between a vague\r\nfamiliarity and mathematical difficulty makes this area a particularly\r\ninteresting area for mathematicians to study. Kirk's approach to\r\nthe area is to  combine traditional 3 dimensional techniques with\r\nmethods from other areas, especially methods that have made their way\r\ninto Mathematics from Physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
