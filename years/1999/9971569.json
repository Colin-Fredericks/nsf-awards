The process of discovery can be divided into two steps.  In the first the intrinsic thermally excited motions that the polymer molecules are capable of in the solid state is clarified.  In the second the effect of external stress on these intrinsic motions is determined.  In previous NSF-supported work the Michigan group discovered that the specifics of how parts of polymeric molecules rotate or twist have critical effects on the key mechanical properties.  They showed that if longer pieces of the main-chain of the polymer are able to move together then the polymer is more likely to be ductile rather that brittle.  They then synthesized a polyester-carbonate polymer with impact fracture resistance superior to BPA-polycarbonate, heretofore the toughest of all glassy polymers.  The key to this synthesis is the insertion into a BPA-polycarbonate chain cyclohexylene (c-C6) linkages capable of bi-stable (chair-boat-chair) conformational transitions.  The second step is to be carried out in the present proposal:  To discover how intrinsic mobility facilitates the relaxation of stresses that results in ductile or brittle behavior.  C-C6 groups will be used to link various rigid molecular segments with limited native mobility, which will allow testing of the ability of c-C6 to be the \"engine\" for providing mobility to segments which are otherwise quite immobile.  The resulting molecular motions will be monitored by solid state NMR, dynamic-mechanical spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation, and positronium annihilation.  Furthermore, the cooperative motions will be systematically modified with intra-chain and inter-chain  constraints to alter the ease of segmental rearrangement under applied stress.  The effect can be revealed by following the transient nature of the holes formed when chain segments slip past each other by positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS).  PALS data will be acquired synchronously with oscillating stress of systemically increasing magnitude and frequency.  In this way the time scale of chain movement and its variation with mechanical stress can be determined.\r\n\r\nPolymeric materials are key constituents in applications as diverse as medical implants, microelectronics, compact disks, stealth aircraft, not to mention major household appliances, automobiles, civilian aircraft, bridges, and highways.   In such applications, the mechanical strength and durability of the polymer are both extremely important.  Yet designing polymers with desirable mechanical properties remains an art.  Successful conclusion of the present research should allow the rational design of polymers with high resistance to fracture while maintaining other desirable physical properties.  Ultimately, this should lead directly to higher performance, more durable and energy efficient engineering systems using polymers.  In educating scientists about polymers the traditional approach has been to teach them either to chemically synthesize polymers, or to use polymers as materials.  Consequently a culture and language gap typically exists between industrial polymer scientists trained as chemists and those as materials engineers.  This creates barriers to innovation and successful application of polymers.  The present proposal requires students to learn both aspects of polymer science thus providing society with more scientists that are able to bridge the gap.  The fundamental understanding developed have been and will continue to be incorporated into graduate taught by the PI.\r\n",
