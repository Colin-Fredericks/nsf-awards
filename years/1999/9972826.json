 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oster\r\n9972826\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues continue studies of\r\nbiomolecular motors and mechanochemical phenomena at the\r\nmicroscale.  They focus attention on two particular protein\r\nmotors: ATP synthase and kinesin.  The former is a rotary motor\r\nthat combines in one protein the two major mechanism of energy\r\ntransduction: The F1 portion hydrolyzes ATP to generate a rotary\r\ntorque, and the Fo portion utilizes the energy stored in a\r\ntransmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate a rotary\r\ntorque in the opposite direction.  Kinesin is a molecular motor\r\nthat hydrolyzes ATP to generate linear force and displacement\r\nalong its microtubule track.  Both of these motors have been\r\ncharacterized in great detail, mechanically and biochemically as\r\nwell as structurally.  The challenge is to incorporate this\r\ndiverse body of information into a comprehensive model that\r\nprovides a consistent explanation for each motor's behavior.  The\r\ninvestigators have formulated models for both motors comprising\r\nATP synthase.  These models contain several phenomenological\r\ncomponents that must now be modeled at a more detailed level to\r\nprovide mechanistic explanations.  In particular, the process of\r\nbinding ATP to the catalytic site is the heart of the energy\r\ntransduction mechanism.  They model this process in detail.  The\r\nstarting point for the proposed kinesin work is their 1995 model,\r\nwhich is tested against more recent data, such as trajectory\r\nvariance as a function of load (an experiment that they\r\nsuggested).  The role of elasticity in molecular motor function,\r\nwhich they have demonstrated in the context of imperfect Brownian\r\nRatchet motors, is studied in kinesin (which is connected to its\r\nload through a flexible protein linkage), and also in chromosome\r\ntransport during cell division, in protein translocation across\r\nintracellular membranes, and in the elastic coupling that\r\nconnects the F1 and Fo motors comprising ATP synthase.  The\r\ninfluence of the water environment on the operation of molecular\r\nmotors is investigated by developing a new\r\nmathematical/computational framework for mesoscale fluid\r\ndynamics.  This methodology combines a traditional continuum\r\ndescription of the fluid with random forces that simulate\r\nBrownian motion.  They use similar methods to simulate\r\nosmotically driven water transport within biological cells.\r\n     Mathematical modeling and computer simulation of living\r\nsystems is needed in order to make sense out of the vast body of\r\nmultidisciplinary data that is being generated at an ever\r\nincreasing pace by experimental biologists.  Biological cells are\r\nnow known to be teeming with protein motors, which, like tiny\r\nrobotic machines, conduct the business of life through mechanical\r\nprocesses driven by the expenditure of chemical energy.  The\r\nmechanisms by which these motors operate are fundamental secrets\r\nof nature, vital to the understanding of life itself.\r\nExperimental investigations suggest possible mechanisms, but it\r\nis only through mathematical modeling and computer simulation\r\nthat one can tell whether a proposed mechanism will account, in a\r\nquantitative way, for the observed behavior of any particular\r\nmolecular motor.  The goal of this project is a detailed\r\nblueprint for the operating principles of these molecular\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n",
