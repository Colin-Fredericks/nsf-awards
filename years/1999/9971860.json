Wentworth\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator's main interest is the study of\r\ngeometric structures arising from equivariant harmonic maps to\r\nR-trees, especially where the domain is a compact 3-manifold or a\r\nsymplectic 4-manifold. Harmonic maps to non-positively curved\r\nmetric spaces have had many applications to rigidity-type\r\nquestions. At the same time, group actions on R-trees (a\r\nparticular example of such a metric space target) have played an\r\nimportant role in combinatorial group theory and 3-manifold\r\ntopology.  This proposal seeks to understand the relationship\r\nbetween the analytic and topological aspects of these problems.\r\nThe research will explore the interaction between harmonic maps\r\nand incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and essential\r\nlaminations in 3-manifolds.  A second part of this project will\r\nstudy the notion of an SL(2,C) Casson invariant.\r\n\r\nMathematicians have long been interested in classifying the\r\npossible shapes of geometric spaces.  Of particular relevance to\r\nthe physical world are spaces of dimensions three and four.\r\nThese are, perhaps surprisingly, also intimately related to the\r\nstudy of knots.  Classically, the methods used for research in\r\nthis area have come from algebra, topology, and analytic function\r\ntheory.  More recently, in part motivated from the physics of\r\nvortices, new techniques have been developed involving maps which\r\nminimize energy.  This project seeks to explore the topological\r\nramifications of this approach.\r\n",
