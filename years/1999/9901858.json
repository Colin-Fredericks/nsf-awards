 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops anode catalysts for PEM fuel cells operating with reformed hydrogen.  Noble metal clusters will be finely dispersed onto new, high surface area conductive ceramic supports developed at T/J Technologies.  Catalysts prepared during phase I showed high carbon monoxide (CO)-tolerance for a hydrogen anode operating with a fuel stream containing up to 200 ppm CO, superior to commercially available carbon-supported catalysts.  The Phase II technical approach for optimizing these catalysts includes:  (1) platinum particle size control by exploiting the strong interaction between platinum and the ceramic support;  (2) surface modification of the ceramic support;  and (3) simplification of the catalyst preparation procedure.  This approach will reduce total precious metal content, as well as improve durability and simplify the dispersion process.  In parallel, prototype membrane electrode assemblies will be constructed.  Complete fuel cells will be assembled and tested in collaboration with commercial developers of integrated fuel cells.\r\n     By reducing noble metal content and improving durability, this research will improve the commercial viability of fuel cells operating on reformed hydrocarbon fuels.  Primary commercial markets are vehicle propulsion and kW-scale off grid or portable power supplies.  Global fuel cell markets are projected to exceed $3 billion by 2000.\r\n",
