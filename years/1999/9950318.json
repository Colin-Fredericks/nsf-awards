 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof-of-concept project implements a database of course materials on the World Wide Web. The prototype database is specific to the field of computer architecture, but the software for building the database can be used to construct databases in any academic field. The database contains homework and test questions, lecture notes, laboratory exercises, and multimedia teaching materials developed by instructors and assistants at a large number of universities. Instructors are able to reuse materials from the database in their classes, giving their students the benefit of more and better instructional materials. The ability to reuse and adapt instructional materials instead of creating them anew saves faculty time and promotes multi-campus collaboration in designing new courses.\r\n\r\nMaterials are being gathered for the database by seeking permission from instructors to include materials from their course Web sites. Scripts are being developed to fetch the material over the Web and to store them in the database. The format of the material is adjusted where necessary, and descriptive metadata is being added  to facilitate searching. This project is working in conjunction with the Web Assign project for on-line homework submission and grading. Homework and test problems in the database are available for on-line administration, and, where the format permits, automatic grading. \r\n\r\nDeliverables include a database of computer architecture materials, and software to construct a similar database in other fields. By harnessing materials already on the Web to improve teaching and learning, this project addresses the themes of organizing knowledge from distributed intelligence and integrating technology into education.\r\n\r\n",
