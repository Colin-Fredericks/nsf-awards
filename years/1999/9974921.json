 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Hawaii in Manoa will acquire an upgrade of an existing 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including studies of natural products from blue-green algae; chemical marine ecology; biologically active natural products; biosynthesis of alkaloids; biosynthesis of anatoxins, retinoids, carotenoids & polarized polyenes; novel dehydrogenation catalysts; hydrogen storage materials; the design, synthesis & structure/reactivity characterization of structural motifs that employ rigid tetradentate Lewis bases & bidentate Lewis acids; molecular wires based on structure of DNA; silicon nanoclusters for use in optoelectronic & photovoltaic cells; halogenated marine prostanoids & their analogs; synthesis of roseophilin; enantioselective synthesis of allenyl ethers; acyl silane synthesis; and solid state NMR studies of elastin\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in a number of areas including materials chemistry and biology.\r\n",
