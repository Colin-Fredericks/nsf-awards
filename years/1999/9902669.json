 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pythagorean-hadograph (PH) curves are an exceptionally versatile class of free-form parametric curves, that offer unique computational advantages over \"ordinary\" Bezier/B-spline curves in geometry-based applications such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, CNC machining, rapid prototyping, motion design, and shape analysis and reconstruction.  The PH curves were originally introduced to provide exact solutions to two basic problems of analytic geometry: the computation of arc lengths and offsets for free-form curves.  It has recently become apparent, however, that they offer rigorous algorithms for a much broader range of problems, including exact boundary reconstruction of shapes from medial axis transforms, exact and versatile real-time interpolation algorithms for CNC machining and robot trajectory generation, construction and analysis of \"fair\" shapes based on precise (non-linear) energy minimization, construction of rotation-minimizing frames for computer animation, etc.  These algorithms employ a sophisticated array of mathematical concepts, including complex variable representations for planar PH curves, Minkowski-metric PH curves for medial axis transforms, contour integration for Fourier curvature analysis, homotopy methods for PH spline constructions, etc.  This project will investigate outstanding theoretical and algorithmic problems in the construction, analysis, and applications of planar and spatial PH curves, whose solution will permit their potential to be fully realized in practical use.  The research will be conducted in cooperation with industrial collaborators, to facilitate a rapid transfer of the technology based on the compatibility of PH curves with the standard Bezier/B-splime representations of CAD systems.",
