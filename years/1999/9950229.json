 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a new general education course \"Quantitative Reasoning and Informed Citizenship\" at Moravian College by drawing on, adapting, and implementing practices and materials developed by a number of projects including \"A Practical Guide to Cooperative Learning in Collegiate Mathematics\" by Hagelgans et al.; \"Workshop Physics and Workshop Mathematics\" at Dickinson College; \"Mathematics for Life\" by Don Pierce; \"Workshop Statistics\" by A. Rossman; and \"Mathematics in Public Discourse\" by J. Anderson.  The course is aimed at a large group of students not generally attracted to mathematics and science who are expected to take this course as part of their general education requirements.\r\n\r\nThe course will focus on building students' skills in the areas of numbers and reasoning, functions and graphing, and probability and statistics while engaging them in collaborative activities.  Reasoning skills and learning to interpret and critically assess numerical arguments will be stressed through meaningful applications taken from a variety of sources, including existing problem sets, newspapers and news magazines, and the World Wide Web.  Involving students in collaborative learning activities is expected to build their ability to reason quantitatively, to formulate numerical arguments, and to explain, orally and in writing, the results of quantitaive analyses.  The use of computers on an everyday basis is expected to increase students' proficiency with a variety of computer software and the use of internet resources in a learning environment.  The applications and pedagogical techniques are expected to improve students' attitudes toward quantitative reasoning tools, quantitative analyses, and computers.\r\n\r\n",
