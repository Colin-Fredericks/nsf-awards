 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its ongoing curriculum reform, the Chemistry Department at Albion College is upgrading an existing NMR spectrometer to a multinuclear Fourier Transform (FT) NMR spectrometer.  This upgrade (Anasazi, Inc.)  is in response to the new approach the department has taken in the organic chemistry laboratory with the Techniques and Projects Component Program. This approach is rooted in the growing movement towards research-based laboratories, such as those developed by Amenta and Mosbo, Licht and Thurlow (NSF-DUE 9456035), and Kharas (NSF-DUE 9455681).  An aggressive pursuit of such ideals requires the use of modern analytical instrumentation.  We are building on these innovative programs as we adapt them to our own institutional and departmental vision for the future of chemical education.   This vision includes involving students in authentic research experiences as soon and as often as possible.  Access to modern FT-NMR spectroscopy allows our students to experience a more realistic research environment.\r\n\r\nThe Techniques and Projects Component Program places the student in the center of a project-based research experience and provides the student with the necessary tools and skills to investigate a research problem.  The student experiences multiple research environments including:  library and on-line literature and structure searches, performing novel experiments in the organic laboratory, and careful analysis of experimental samples in the instrument laboratory.  The laboratory experience is divided into two components; Techniques (Chem 211L and the first 5 weeks of Chem 212L) and Projects (the last 9 weeks of Chem 212L).  Each component provides ample opportunity for students to make positive connections with the research experience.  The Techniques component focuses on the acquisition of proper laboratory skills.  Built into this component are a number of research-based laboratories.  The Projects component is a nine-week experience in which the students carry out their own research projects.  This includes searching the literature for information about the project, finding or designing appropriate experiments, and analyzing the outcomes of these experiments.  A number of projects have been suggested for students to investigate, and the student are encouraged to create their own, subject to instructor approval.  Spectroscopic analysis of reaction products is a necessary part of both components.  \r\n\r\nFollowing our first year of this new laboratory program, the need for NMR analysis has become evident. The upgraded instrument is critical to the success of this curriculum revision in that it allows students to obtain for themselves a more complete spectroscopic data set for use in product and intermediate analysis.  This, in turn, provides students with experiences critical to their ability to operate in a modern research environment.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
