 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to characterize the evolution of the energy content of the marine boundary-layer inflow to hurricanes and its relationship with hurricane intensity changes.  This effort will be accomplished in cooperation with reconnaissance missions currently planned by the NOAA Hurricane Research Division to investigate the energetics of landfalling hurricanes.  The key novel feature of this research is the planned deployment of NOAA/U of Hawaii Smart Balloons as part of a Lagrangian experimental strategy.  The Lagrangian experiment leverages the availability of new high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS) dropwindsondes, turbulent flux sensors, and the Doppler radar on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft.\r\n\r\nSince there may be significant cross-stream variability in the inflow, the plan includes acquisition of critical in situ data on the thermodynamic history and trajectories of air parcels in the inflow layer.  Meteorological and GPS position data will be collected by a proven balloon-borne instrument platform (Smart Balloon), developed at NOAA's Air Resources Lab, Field Research Division.  The data will be transmitted via satellite cellular telephone to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the WP-3D aircraft. The Smart Balloon has a large dynamic lift range (sea level to 6 km), provided by a high strength spherical shell and a pump and release valve on an internal pressurized air bladder. This design allows the balloons to remain within prescribed altitude operating limits in the boundary layer despite precipitation loading and effects of radiative heating and cooling on balloon lift. The instrument and transponder package will be contained within the outer shell of the balloon to protect them from environmental hazards.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of each field experiment, two smart balloons will be deployed from a coastal location within 250 km of a passing hurricane. This strategy will allow the NOAA WP-3D aircraft to make a series of measurements in the vicinity of the balloons as they approach the hurricane eyewall.  Balloon release sites and times will be chosen based on storm-track predictions from NCEP and forecasts of air-parcel trajectories made at the University of Hawaii. Sites along the affected US coast will serve as release points to investigate the evolution and impact of air streams of continental origin, while island sites (e.g., Puerto Rico) can serve as release points to investigate trajectories that remain over the open ocean. This research will improve our understanding of how the thermodynamics and angular momentum fields in the core of hurricanes are related.  Real-time data, especially wind data, collected by the Smart Balloons and aircraft during the experiment will be made available to the National Hurricane Center and the National Center for Environmental Prediction to aid in preparation of hurricane intensity forecasts, watches, and warnings prior to landfall.\r\n",
