 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed dissertation research will examine how a school's capacity to prepare students for post secondary success is linked to its ability to provide resources that meet the specific needs of the student population it serves. The study focuses on two types of resources: traditional educational resources and planning and strategic action resources. Each is hypothesized to affect educational outcomes in specific ways. The research considers how structures and practices in a school context that generate social capital resources affect a school's capacity to influence outcomes for disadvantaged students. This research will contribute to knowledge in this area by considering a wider range of educational outcomes, and by employing network analytic theory and measures to understand how qualitative differences in knowledge-based social capital resources affect the schooling experiences and post secondary outcomes of students from different backgrounds. The study considers the implications of traditional approaches to school reform for the educational opportunities of students attending two urban high schools. It will employ both qualitative (archival, ethnographic, interview) and quantitative (student- and school-level surveys) data and methods to model the relationship between school and community resources and their effects on students' educational outcomes.",
