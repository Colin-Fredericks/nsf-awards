The algorithm is based on Bellman's formulation of the SPP. Rather than implementing a classic gradient descent in our system as is typical, a new energy minimization technique was developed. The resulting modified gradient descent has the important benefit of not stabilizing at local minima. It also permits a straightforward distributed VLSI implementation which with the currently available technology is expected to have a peak accuracy within 0.5% and time constant of a fraction of a microsecond. A powerful decomposition technique has already been devised and used to characterize the dynamic behavior of the system.\r\n     Applications of the algorithm involve analog routing assessment or routing control and search problems in chip-level artificial intelligence. The decomposition method may be useful in analyzing the APD paradigm for other combinatorial problems on graphs.\r\n\r\n",
