 "awd_abstract_narration": "As networking and multimedia technologies continue to advance new video-based applications such as digital libraries and video-on-demand services will become increasingly more common, requiring the efficient network transmission of compressed stored video streams. For constant-quality video streams, however, the efficient allocation of network resources is complicated by several factors.  First, compressed digital video data has much larger bandwidth requirements than textual data, and hence, place much larger bandwidth requirements on the network.  Second, compressed digital video data can exhibit significant burstiness in bandwidth requirements at multiple time scales. In particular, stored video content will typically be much more complex than \"live\" videoconference type video streams, resulting in much greater long-term burstiness. Finally, due to the continuous nature of digital video, stringent guarantees on network jitter and delay may be required (especially for live-video transmission).\r\n\r\nTo efficiently allocate network resources for the delivery of compressed video streams, bandwidth-smoothing techniques have been introduced to take advantage of a priori information that may be available for a video stream.  The bandwidth smoothing techniques that have been presented thus far have not considered the interactions of bandwidth smoothing algorithms with network delivery mechanism. The proposed research will address the integration of bandwidth smoothing techniques into current networking mechanisms in two key areas:\r\n\r\n1.  Bandwidth Smoothing over ATM - ATM networks are a popular networking technology because it provides some minimum rate guarantees as well as different classes of service. In this study, we will investigate the interactions between bandwidth smoothing techniques and three of ATM's classes: constant-bit-rate (CBR), variable-bit-rate (VBR), and the available-bit-rate (ABR) services. In the first part, we will investigate the efficient mapping of bandwidth smoothing algorithms into the CBR and VBR services. In the second part of this subtask, we will investigate the mapping of bandwidth smoothing techniques into the ABR service class. In particular, the ABR service class provides a minimum cell rate guarantee and, in times of relatively low network load, an available cell rate which allows the applications to send more than their minimum cell rate that has been guaranteed. We will investigate techniques for shaping video streams into the ABR minimum cell rate while taking advantage of the available cell rate to enhance the video stream when possible.\r\n\r\n2.  Bandwidth Allocation Techniques for Best-Effort Networks - Many of the current approaches for delivering video across best-effort networks such as the Internet do so by monitoring network feedback and altering the video frame rate or video frame quality to fit within the available resources. For stored video streams, these algorithms typically do not take advantage of the a priori information available from stored video, resulting in video frame rates delivered to the user that are more variable than necessary. In this study, we will investigate techniques for the efficient streaming of stored video across best-effort networks that take advantage of the a priori information to smooth the video frame rate delivered to the user.\r\n\r\nThe solutions in this project will be evaluated using two methods. First, the solutions will be evaluated and refined through simulation studies using captured and compressed video data. In the later stages of this project, we will implement a simple streamed video delivery system that will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.  We will evaluate the proposed solutions using (1) the Internet, (2) the Ohio Computing and Communication ATM Research Network (OCARNet) which connects six institutions within the state of Ohio, and (3) vBNS - the very high speed backbone network that we have access to through the Ohio Supercomputing Center.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of this project will be to answer the following question:\r\nWhat is the best way to take advantage of a priori information in the delivery of stored video streams across networks, which may provide varying guarantees of network bandwidth?\r\n\r\nThrough the intelligent management of network resources, a client-side buffer, and the a priori information avail-able from stored video streams, the solutions developed in this project will allow us to deliver the highest video quality to the user. We expect that this work can serve as a catalyst for the development of future stored-video applications such as digital libraries, distance learning, and video-on-demand.\r\n",
