 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical models for superconducting and liquid crystal materials\r\nin the presence of applied fields will be analyzed. First, the\r\nbehavior of solutions to the Ginzburg-Landau system of steady-state\r\nand time-dependent nonlinear equations with realistic boundary\r\nconditions in the presence of an applied magnetic field will be\r\ninvestigated.  Second, the behavior of solutions to the system\r\ndescribing liquid crystals in applied fields is to be analyzed.\r\nThe mathematical models for these problems are systems of partial\r\ndifferential equations. Methods to be employed in this project \r\ninclude maximum principles, bifurcation theory, regularity, \r\nenergy estimates, and large-time analysis of partial differential \r\nequations, as well as numerical methods. \r\n\r\nModern technological devices such as superconducting films and\r\nliquid crystal displays typically are operated in the presence of electric or\r\nmagnetic fields. It is therefore necessary to understand how these fields affect\r\ntheir performance.  In the case of superconductors, external magnetic\r\nfields are present.  This can result in nonsuperconducting sites\r\nin the material (called vortices) which move and therefore degrade \r\nthe device performance.  Engineers have tried to control these losses\r\nby introducing inhomogeneities in the material that curtail the\r\nmotion of vortices, but it is not well understood how all of these\r\neffects interact and how best to use inhomogeneities to achieve\r\nstability.  In the case of liquid crystals, magnetic and electric\r\nfields are used to change optic orientations.  This is essential to the \r\noperation of display devices and visual screens.  The materials in this case\r\nare mixtures of liquid crystals and polymers, resulting in more complicated \r\nphenomena than in the case of superconductivity.  Still, the mathematical\r\nissues are closely related.  The award will support research on mathematical \r\nmodels that will give basic insights into both types of problems and help to \r\ndevise effective numerical simulations. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
