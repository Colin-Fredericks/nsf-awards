 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972586\r\nGiebultowicz\r\n\r\nThis is a condensed matter physics project that uses neutron diffractometry and reflectometry to investigate novel heterostructures and superlattices (SLs) composed of ferromagnetic (FM) and nonmagnetic semiconductors.  Diffraction measurements provide detailed information about the spin structures and about the interlayer magnetic correlations in the SLs. Semiconducting nanos-tructures containing  FM constituents are the most attractive ones for practical applications. However, until recently only multilayers prepared from materials with strongly antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions were available. A break-through in this area has been the preparation of new epitaxial FM films and heterostructures based on the Ill-V semiconducting compounds. These GaAsMn heterostructures and additional materials with potential to exhibit ferromagnetic couplings will be investigated as part of this project. All diffraction and reflectivity measurements will be carried out at the Center for Neutron Research at NIST, Gaithersburg., MD. The research will provide excellent education training for the post-doctoral associate and the graduate students associated with the project.\r\n%%%\r\nMagnetic semiconductors show a range of unusual properties that are of great fundamental interest as well as of potential use in future technologies. This project will use neutron scattering as a powerful tool to investigating magnetic superlattices composed of semiconducting and magnetic materials. The neutron technique allows a determination of the magnetic interactions and spin structures in the atomic layers composing the superlattices. The work will focus on materials where the interactions are ferromagnetic, lead to large magnetic moments in the materials, and hence show potential for practical applications. The practical applications or spintronics field depend on the fact that the electrical transport in the materials is modulated by the magnetic interactions, as in the phenomenon of giant magneto resistance. Some of the materials to be studied, the GaAsMn ferromagnet, are compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, and may lead to practical devices. The students and post-doc involved in this work obtain excellent training in an exciting area of fundamental physics, which has great potential for future practical applications. All diffraction and reflectivity measurements will be carried out at the Center for Neutron Research at NIST, Gaithersburg., MD. \r\n",
