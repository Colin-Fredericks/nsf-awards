 "awd_abstract_narration": "The maturation of the information age has created new challenges. Governments, faced with rapidly changing economies and societies are forced to make far-reaching economic and social policy decisions. These decisions, however, are based on limited static, and expensive survey data. At the same time, large administrative data sets are available that are derived from data collected from households, business establishments and governmental entities. These data, which could describe the dynamic interactions of workers, businesses, government and society, are not fully used in the United States, not simply because the unique advantages of these data have not been clear, but also because key issues of conf dentiality and access have not been fully addressed. This outcome has come at substantial cost. Linked data, if used wisely, have a great deal of scientific importance and can enhance our basic social data infrastructure in a number of ways. They can also be used to reduce respondent burden, increase data quality, and enhance the information available to the federal, state and local agencies which rely on Census Bureau data for decision making. In addition, these data can provide a valuable tool to the research community.\r\n          This research proposal will create three prototype data sets based upon the Census Bureau's demographic and economic products and using link information that permits the data sets to be longitudinal in both the household/individual and firm/establishment dimensions. The Principal Investigators, the Census Bureau, and other external researchers will use these data to examine the value of the claims made above. These data sets, while of immense use in their own right, will also advance knowledge in two additional ways. First, by creating the data and developing the access modality, the research team will explicitly address a series of confidentiality and access/availability issues, using internal Census Bureau expertise and that of external researchers at Comell University, the Urban Institute, the University of Maryland and NCSA. Second, the project will advance the knowledge of both linkage technology and the statistical properties of linked data so that researchers in all disciplines can use these techniques. The proposal delineates an extensive collaboration with the Census Bureau, which is indeed a major sponsor of the project, in addition to three European statistical agencies. The infrastructure project expects to involve additional government and private sector partners, particularly as the confidentiality issues are more fully addressed.\r\n          An innovative set of access support tools that combine a complete simulated environment (at the Comell University support site) with the latest in web-based collaboration tools (from the NCSA at the University of Illinois) will be developed. These tools will be integrated with videoJcomputer teleconferencing access to the Census Bureau and Cornell sites. Under carefully specified access rules that encompass established confidentiality and disclosure review procedures, the Census Bureau will support external research access to the linked data, using the web-based support tools and the video teleconferencing facilities. This external research access will go beyond \"state of the art\" and its enhancement is another major activity covered in the proposal.\r\n          The Cornell University component also includes the support of a restricted-access data site that will house confidential linked data from the national statistical agencies of other countries. Linked French data from INSEE have already been approved for this site. Statistics Sweden has expressed a willingness to complete an agreement that would allow linked Swedish data. The DIW in Germany will release a linked version of the GSOEP to the site, if it is funded. Efforts continue to negotiate restricted access agreements with other national agencies. The restricted access data site provides linked data analysis tools and a supercomputer facility for use with these data.\r\n          The new knowledge that can be generated from these data is potentially far reaching. The prototype American data sets provide the capacity to address fundamental questions in social and economic behavior. The restricted-access data from other countries provides a laboratory in which to test the generality of results found for a particular country. All of the data advances in the proposal provide the opportunity to discover technological advances in confidentiality protection while enabling new partnerships to be formed across disciplines that focus on understanding social and economic systems, organizations and institutions.\r\n          Additional information concerning this proposal is available at http://old-instructl.cit.cornell.edu:8000/nsf-infrastructure/\r\n\r\n",
