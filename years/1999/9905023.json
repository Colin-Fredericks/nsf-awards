 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe research combines expertise in the paleoceanographic record and modern large-scale ocean circulation and air-sea interactions to examine the \"warm saline bottom water\" hypothesis. Previous early Cenozoic modeling attempts routinely failed to support the hypothesis; the proposed research differs from any previous modeling attempts in that ocean bottom water will be forced to form in the net evaporative latitudes. The distribution of the resulting warm saline watermass, its stability, and the conditions required to produce the response will then be rigorously scrutinized. Geological data suggests that the most plausible interval of warm saline bottom water for-mation may be the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM), a brief interval of dramatic global climate change at or near the Paleocene/Eocene epoch boundary. The MOM v.2.2 ocean model will be used to determine the moisture flux boundary conditions required for the formation of bot-tom water in the low- to mid-latitude Tethys Seaway given boundary conditions appropriate for the warm interval of the LPTM. A number of global ocean general circulation simulations will be performed using surface conditions 1) as predicted by an atmospheric model with boundary con-ditions appropriate to 55 Ma, and 2) in which the model-simulated moisture flux is perturbed by gradually increasing aridity over the Tethys, or some portion thereof, until deep convection occurs. When a warm saline (WS) bottom watermass is simulated, a number of issues can be eval-uated, including the following: Is a WS source possible as a steady-state condition over thousands of years? Does WS bottom water coexist with bottom water formed at high latitudes or does one source always dominate? Is the moisture flux required to form WSBW a plausible surface condi-tion? Does perturbation of the moisture flux in different regions produce significantly different thermohaline responses or deep water flow paths? How are global temperature patterns and oce-anic heat transport affected by a WS source? When a WS source is simulated, are any features of the marine geologic record reproduced?\r\n\r\n",
