Fu\r\n\r\nWe propose to study the geometry of certain singular spaces,\r\nwhose curvatures are naturally defined as measures.  The\r\ncurvatures under consideration are those arising in the\r\nSteiner-Weyl tube formula.  For smooth spaces these quantities\r\nare curvature integrals.  For singular spaces they are the total\r\nvariations of certain signed measures which may be regarded as\r\ngeneralized curvatures.  In all known cases these curvature\r\nmeasures, which are a priori defined with respect to an embedding\r\nof the singular space in Euclidean space, are in fact computable\r\nsolely from the intrinsic metric structure of the space.  Our\r\ngeneral goal is to understand and extend this phenomenon.  This\r\nproblem was attacked independently by Alexandrov and by Federer\r\nin the 1950s.  Alexandrov's approach was intrinsic but limited to\r\n2 dimensions, while Federer's theory dealt with embedded objects\r\nof general dimension.  Further progress will depend on the\r\nreconciliation of these two methods.  We propose that the\r\ntechnical key is based on the use of the geometric measure theory\r\nof currents.  The starting point is the fact that Federer's\r\ntheory may be recast in the following terms: to certain singular\r\nsubspaces X in euclidean space there is an associated integral\r\ncurrent N(X) in the sphere bundle of the ambient space.  This\r\ncurrent satisfies the Legendre condition (i.e.  it annihilates\r\nthe differential ideal generated by the canonical 1-form) and is\r\ndetermined by its relation with the Morse theory of X. The\r\ncurvature measures of X are then computable in a canonical way\r\nfrom N(X).  Our proposal is based on recent work of the proposer\r\nusing the current theoretic framework, showing that Alexandrov's\r\ntheory may be understood in similar terms.  This suggests the\r\npossibility of generalizing the intrinsic approach to higher\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary terms, this project aims to develop a mathematical\r\nlanguage adequate to describe geometrical forms we encounter\r\nevery day: for example, the crumplings of a sheet of paper or the\r\nsurface of a rock.  Even though geometrical shapes typically\r\nfound in nature tend to be rough (\"singular\"), for technical\r\nreasons geometry as it has developed historically restricts its\r\nattention to smooth objects.  Our goal is to be able to deal\r\nmathematically with such objects without imposing such\r\nunrealistic assumptions.  We expect that this work will\r\neventually have a technological impact, in such areas as computer\r\nvisualization and the study of buckling of sheets (as of a car\r\nfender during a collision).\r\n",
