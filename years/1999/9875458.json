 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Parquette plans to study the chemistry of dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers with a view toward their use as chiral reagents and phase-transfer catalysts.  Chirality will be explored by incorporating an asymmetric core that is nonracemic and studying its effects on the conformation of dendridic arms that evolve from that core.  Ultimate applications of such structures center on the provision of chiral pockets wherein bimolecular reaction rates will be increased due to hydrophobic compression.  Phase-transfer catalysis stems from the design of dendrimers having hydrophobic cores and hydrophilic surface structures, wherein polar reaction product derived from nonpolar reactants will be expelled into the reaction medium.  Professor Parquette will also initiate a program of cooperative learning groups among undergraduate organic chemistry students.  Students' progress will be monitored through the use of log books and audits of tests earning \"C\" or below will be instituted.  Attention will be paid to providing research opportunities to undergraduates at this large public university.  Additionally, a Chemistry Resource Center will provide a means for students to access mentorship and assistance while economizing the time of participating faculty.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the teaching and research program of Dr. Jonathan R. Parquette of Ohio State University.  Professor Parquette's research is in the area of dendrimers, a specialized polymer molecule that emanates in a spherical manner from a central core structure.  The goal is to control the three-dimensional aspect of these dendrimers so that they will be able to transmit that three-dimensional control through a chemical reaction and into the product structure.  Such molecules that can act as catalysts in this manner are especially sought after.  Professor Parquette is also embarking upon several strategies to decrease the effective student-teacher ratio in chemistry classes at Ohio State by developing cooperative learning strategies and by starting a Chemistry Resource Center to more effectively utilize faculty time.  Web-based dissemination of course material will also be employed to more effectively communicate with students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
