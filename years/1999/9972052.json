These alloys were thought to be immune to solidification cracking and their surprisingly poor cracking resistance defies current theory.  In this project ultra-low carbon iron alloys that contain systematic additions of Ni, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ti, B, and O are examined to determine their susceptibility to solidification cracking and the mechanism of cracking when it occurs.  The research plan combines modeling with experimental studies, including varestraint testing to measure the solidification cracking tendencies of the alloys and characterization of fracture surfaces by Auger spectroscopy.  Differential thermal analysis (DTA) establishes the length of the mushy zone in the selected alloys and the Gleeble and DTA determine the expansion/contraction effects of solid state phase transformations on weld shrinkage stresses.\r\n%%%\r\nIt is important that \"clean\" iron-based alloys be resistant to solidification cracking since they represent the current trend in selection of high strength, high toughness structural alloys for applications in ships, bridges and buildings.\r\n***\r\n",
