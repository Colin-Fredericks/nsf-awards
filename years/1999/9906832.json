 "awd_abstract_narration": "A regime shift (beginning in the late 1970's) in ecosystem dynamics was documented for temperate and subpolar portions of the North Pacific.  However, the temporal shifts were inconsistent (increasing vs. decreasing abundance) and, particularly in the subarctic, the interpretation of results are uncertain because large fisheries have exerted maximum pressure on middle and upper trophic-levels (e.g. anchovy, sardine, herring, pollock, halibut, salmon).  In the tropical Pacific, however, large-scale commercial fishing is confined to tuna that are at the top of the trophic pyramid.  A tropical study could, therefore, be especially informative and would likely provide insights towards the interpretation of inconsistencies in the temperate and subpolar systems.  The investigators will analyze a data set spanning 13 years that will provide baseline statistics on ecosystem dynamics in the eastern tropical Pacific during a decade when ocean warming was strong (1990's) and when yellowfin tuna were abundant.  The indicators of change will be pelagic seabirds, which have been and will continue to be surveyed systematically during approximately 240 days of observations along a 35,500 km cruise-track from two NMFS research vessels.  The PIs will examine temporal abundance of nine seabird species of two foraging guilds: four tuna-dependent piscivores (the tuna drive mesopelagic prey to the surface where epipelagic predators can exploit them) and five tuna-independent species, including four planktivores and one scavenger.  The authors will explore two hypotheses: 1) temporal trends occurred among members of both feeding guilds, and 2) temporal trends were stronger among the tuna-dependent species.  The analyses will be conducted using new statistical software developed for seabird survey data by S. T. Buckland, Research Unit for Wildlife Population Assessment, University of St. Andrews, Scotland.  Generalized additive models vastly improves precision and the ability to detect temporal trends in abundance estimated from at-sea survey data.  The results potentially will have implications on possible large-scale, ecosystem effects (e.g. ocean warming), and/or smaller-scale effects (e.g. fishing) on the abundance/behavior of yellowfin tuna.  Patterns in the abundance and community structure of commensal and non-commensal seabirds will provide further insights on community dynamics of both groups.",
