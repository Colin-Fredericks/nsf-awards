 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820489\r\nClarkson University\t\r\nDayakar Penumadu              \r\n\r\nIt is proposed that a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site be established at \r\nClarkson University in the area of Advanced Materials Processing and Engineering.  The faculty \r\nmentors for the proposed research are all currently active members of the Center for Advanced \r\nMaterials Processing (CAMP) located on the campus of Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY.  Each year \r\nof this three-year program, sixteen excellent undergraduate students will be brought on campus for a \r\n10-week intensive summer research experience.  The objectives of the REU Site program will be to: 1) \r\nprovide qualified undergraduate students with an opportunity to conduct independent research; 2) \r\ndemonstrate the process of conducting sound research and the importance of data analysis in solving \r\nadvanced materials problems; and 3) develop a framework for dealing with professional ethics; and 4) \r\ncreate an interest in graduate school and awareness of its impact on having a successful career in the \r\narea of advanced materials.\r\n\r\nThe primary component of the program will be the completion of a research project in the area \r\nof materials for which small particles, colloidal media or surfaces play an important role in the \r\nprocessing or the properties of the final product.  Undergraduates will be assigned a self-contained \r\naspect of a larger research project and will work with graduate students and faculty who belong to \r\nCAMP to complete their project.  Students will be matched with these faculty based on the interests and abilities of the students and the specific needs of the faculty.  Dissemination of their research results will be emphasized; all students will participate in research group meetings, write a report, and present their work at a university-wide undergraduate research symposium.  Several community-building activities designed to foster cohesiveness among the students and enhance their appreciation for belonging to a multi-cultural group will be included.  Assessment of the program will include continual evaluation and improvement of the proposed program to achieve the stated objectives.  Recruitment of qualified minority students from a nationwide search will be aggressively pursued through the office of minority student affairs.\r\n\r\n",
