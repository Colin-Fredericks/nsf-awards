The PRWORA instituted a program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a state-designed and administered program funded in part with federal block grants. The state government has recently enforced work requirements for all of its TANF recipients, and this project will conduct an ethnographic study of the effects of this dramatic change in welfare on a sample of 100 single mothers and their families.  Using participant observation and extensive life history interviews, the researcher will examine the costs of TANF in terms of child care, transportation, and clothing as well as intangible costs such as the effects on social networks. Half of the sample will be composed of mothers who have left TANF since January 1997, and half will still receive TANF benefits. Subjects will be interviewed on survival strategies, food availability, clothing, cash and other resources, family and child welfare, and subjective orientations to work and welfare.  The project will provide valuable information for the local community, who is considering designing its own TANF program, as well as contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of poverty and welfare reform in a setting that has not been seriously considered in the research on welfare and  poverty, an Indian reservation.  \r\n",
