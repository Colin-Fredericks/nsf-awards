 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973717\r\nRathje\r\nOne common earthquake-induced geotechnical hazard is soil liquefaction, the loss of strength in loose, cohesionless soils during earthquake shaking.  To avoid the devastating damage associated with liquefaction, potentially liquefiable soils are treated to prevent liquefaction.  Drainage is one available liquefaction remediation technique; however, its effectiveness has not been fully documented.  This research project, under support by a POWRE award, will study the effectiveness of drainage as a liquefaction remediation method using large-scale, earthquake-like ground motions generated by the RESCUE (Repeatable Earth Shaking by Controlled Underground Expansion) ground motion generation technique.  The study of drainage methods for liquefaction remediation is critical because drainage provided by prefabricated, composite drains is the only remediation method appropriate for sites with existing structures.  Additionally, the test series will demonstrate the applicability of the RESCUE technique to study the dynamic response of geotechnical systems and pioneer a new testing technique for geotechnical earthquake engineering research.  Support under the POWRE program is provided to enable the PI to obtain experience with experimental techniques which will complement her analytical capabilities.\r\n***\r\n",
