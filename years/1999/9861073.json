 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861073\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development of a novel integrated microsensor system that will accurately and rapidly measure low quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) both in air and in aqueous environments. At present, no inexpensive sensor system is sufficiently sensitivity and rugged for use in continuously monitoring of VOCs in underground water streams, soil, effluent discharge, fugitive emissions and in spent liquid and vapor streams. To remedy this situation, this proposal suggests the development of low-cost continuous organic chemical microsensors based on the change of fluorescence and absorption of dyes embedded in polymer thin films. This program is innovative in combining sensitive diode laser-excited fluorescence with total internal reflection methods of analysis to provide a continuous monitor of VOCs. The Phase I Research Objectives include evaluation of polymers and near-infrared dyes for detection of volatile organic compounds, design and fabrication of micro-total internal reflection fluorescence sensors for improved chemical analysis, and acquisition of families of test data to provide information for instrument optimization and extensive field testing in Phase II of the program. This Phase I research program will result in an integrated microsensor platform that is sensitive, fast, reliable, robust and inexpensive for multicomponent analysis of VOCs.\r\n     Successful completion of the program objectives would result in the development of fluorescent and absorption-based instrumentation for identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds and environmental pollutants in groundwater, soil, effluent discharge and fugitive emissions. A robust, high sensitivity, low-cost chemical analyzer has applications in environmental monitoring, and chemical analysis in the specialty chemicals, petroleum and energy industries.\r\n\r\n",
