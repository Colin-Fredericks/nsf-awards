 "awd_abstract_narration": "A \"reaction norm\" is a description of how a trait changes when the environment changes, for instance, how adult body size varies due to variation early nutrition in insects, mammals, and other organisms. Such variation is often profound and in many cases the variants exhibit additional traits that are adaptations to a particular environment. Reaction norms have a genetic basis, and organisms with different genomes differ in their ability to adapt to their environment via a reaction norm. Because of such genetic differences among individuals, it should be possible to change the reaction norm by selection and therefore change and perhaps improve the adaptation of organisms to a variable environment. The proposed work will test this hypothesis by studying the genetics of the reaction norm of body size in relation to nutrition in two species of Lepidoptera with different growth characteristics. This work will, for the first time, study the genetics of the underlying developmental physiology that determines body size. This physiology consists of patterns of hormone secretion that control when the animal begins metamorphosis to the adult. Because of the PI's earlier work on the developmental physiology of this system, the developmental control of growth and maturation are better understood in this system than in almost any other organism. This enables us to initiate the proposed investigation of how genetic variation affects variation of the developmental processes that control the final adult body size. This work will enhance our understanding of how the reaction norms that lead to variation in body size are regulated by genetics and development.",
