 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual behavior depends on how the eye can identify relevant targets in the environment.  In short, how we see depends on the eye and the brain.  One relatively simple system that has been used as a very successful model for visual study is the compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus.  It is now known that this marine animal can set its eye to extremely high sensitivity under low light conditions, as it searches underwater for mates while walking in shallow water on moonlit nights.  This project combines anatomical and physiological approaches with behavioral work to better understand how the animal sees.  Studies in the field utilize a unique small camera mounted on the shell of the crab to capture the same visual stimuli seen by one eye, and simultaneous recording of the activity in the optic nerve from that eye.  The crab is presented with a variety of stimulus shapes and contrasts to test what features are used to visually identify and approach a potential mate.  The combination of measurements from the camera and the optic nerve fibers allow analysis of how the activity of nerve cells encodes visual information for processing by the brain.\r\n   Results will reveal concepts of how neural signals are used to generate visual behavior, and will be relevant to the fields of neuroethology, behavior, marine science, and reproductive biology, in addition to visual neuroscience.  This project also provides support for students to gain an unusually multidisciplinary research experience.\r\n",
