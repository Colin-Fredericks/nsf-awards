 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an initiative in the development of Internet-based educational software for aerospace engineering: The Michigan Aero Instructional Software (MAIS) project. The Java programming language is used to develop \"applets\" - programs that can be accessed via browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer from anywhere on the world-wide web (WWW). Each applet is a laboratory-like module, in which students learn by doing. \r\n\r\nFor example: An astrodynamics module, of which a preliminary version has already been developed, allows students to choose origination and destination planets for an interplanetary space mission between chosen take-off and final dates.  The student can then plot the orbits of the two planets and the spacecraft, print out the parameters that define the orbits, and animate the planet and spacecraft orbits.\r\n\r\nA potential-flow module, a preliminary version of which has already been developed, allows students to build up flows by combining basic singular solutions to Laplace's equation. Students can then visualize the resulting flow by plotting streamlines, releasing and tracking fluid particles, etc.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Java/WWW paradigm makes maintenance and distribution of the software much easier than has been the case in many past educational-software efforts. It also makes a much broader distribution of the software, to other colleges and even to high schools ultimately a goal of this initiative - extremely easy.\r\n\r\nFurther work is being done on the modules that have been developed to date, and several new modules. Instructors' guides for use of the modules are being written. The modules and the writeups are evaluated by means of small student focus groups, direct feedback from college and high school teachers, and web-based feedback from users of the software. In addition, a plan and proposal for full development, including identification of test sites at universities and high schools, will be an outcome of this proof-of-concept phase of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
