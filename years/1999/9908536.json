The goal of the conference is to use materials research as the \"best\" example of interdisciplinarity to examine how well funding agencies, particularly NSF have fared in supporting this type of research since the early 1970s.  It is hoped that in the conference \"senior scientists will evaluate their experiences and provide reflective guidance for improving the direction of future research, and teaching.\" The outcome of the conference will be published in various forms and should be useful to the materials community and funding agencies. \r\n%%%\r\nIt is proposed to convene a conference entitled \"Interdisciplinarity Revisited:  Materials Research as the Case Study\" to be held  August 30-31, 1999 at Penn State University.\r\nAbout 200 people are planned to be invited with representation from a large variety of institutions, research areas, including research leaders, managers, educators, and policy makers.
