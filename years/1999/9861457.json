 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861457\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on research and development of a prototype of cost effective, efficient, commercializable indoor air quality monitor and HVAC controller based on a new middle infrared optical sensor. This detection system will be capable of measuring C02 level, temperature, time and room occupancy. A  solidstate optical sensor and a monitor will be designed, built, and tested, using premixed gases of known concentration of  C02. Preliminary tests show that the C02 sensor demonstrates promising accuracy and a fast response time, making it a good candidate for demand controlled ventilation (DCV) system applications. The solid state light source with no electromechanical parts reduces maintenance weight, size, and power requirements, and provides the potential for low cost relative to currently available sensors. A dual beam design using matched photodetectors reduces drift and calibration errors. C02 based Demand Controlled Ventilation offers a large potential to conserve energy in buildings while maintaining indoor air quality. Currently available optical sensors for C02 are bulky, and require frequent calibration and maintenance.  The architecture of a demand controlled ventilation system, using the proposed monitor and incorporating a humidity \tsensor will be developed in phase II.\r\n     The indoor air quality monitor described in this proposal has application in any indoor environment where air quality and its effect on health is a concern. It will be particularly useful in large variable occupancy spaces and in buildings incorporating variable air volume ventilation systems and direct digital controls. Commercial applications could involve \tmultiple units placed at strategic locations each connected through a common data network. This configuration would \tallow the developed indoor pollution control platform to become the key sensing component(s) of a larger demand controlled ventilation system which optimizes energy use while promoting the comfort, productivity and health of the building occupants. \r\n\r\n",
