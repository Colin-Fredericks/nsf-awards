 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Congress for Comparative Physiology and Bichemistry is held every 4 years to facilitate the meeting of comparative phsiologists and biochemists world wide to report and discuss current trends resutlts and issues in these comparative disciplines.  This grant provides support for the 1999 International Congress for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry to be held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from August 23-28, 1999.  Due to the global nature of the participating societies of the Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry  Division  of IUBS, worldwide representation is assured, as is major participation from expected from the US and Canada.  High registration is also expected from Japan and Europe since the Japanese and European societies have decided to locate their annual meetings at the 1999 Calgary Congress.  Because this Congress will be an international showcase, a major objective of this particular congress will be to highlight and illustrate work of North-American comparative physiologists and biochemists.  These disciplines have long been specialities in North America, and the PIs have tremendous expertise to offer to scientists from other countries especially those from the PIs newly incorporated societies from Australaisa, South America and Eastern Europe.             Because of the wide applicability of biochemical and physiological processes, the ground covered in the Congress is very broad - including topics such as the control of responses to environment disturbance, the control of vision, neuroscience, the physiology of animals in aquaculture and even dinosaur phsiology!  A total of 46 symposia, 6 plenary lectures and several satelite meetings are programmed.  Thus the Congress should also attract many researchers from other disciplines.   A final major objective of this congress is to expose graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to the best researchers in their area from all over the world.  Having these experts comment on their research is a major motivator for these students and one which they will treasure.  These experts are not restricted to the fields of comparative physiology and biochemistry.  Among the invited speakers are many experts in other fields who would not normally attend these meetings and to whom graduate students, PDFs and younger faculty would not normally be exposed.  The awarding of NSF funding is particularly important for these participants. The PIs  final objective is to make this meeting, probably the last at a North American venue for many years, a major sucess.",
