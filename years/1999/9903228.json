 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many networked applications such as electronic commerce, distance learning, digital libraries, multimedia teleconferencing and on-line entertainment involve real-time delivery of  stored video  to a large number of clients across a heterogeneous internetwork.  For continuous playback at the client, quality-of-service (QoS) must be provided in an end-to-end manner.  The design of efficient large-scale video delivery systems is complicated by such challenging issues as the highly bursty variable-bit-rate (VBR) compressed video, the underlying heterogeneous networking environments, disparate client capabilities, and diverse client QoS requirements.  Solutions addressing these issues must be both efficient and scalable.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the proposed research is to design and develop efficient and scalable streaming techniques for large-scale delivery of stored VBR video.  The project  relies on a novel distribution-tree based video delivery system architecture which employs a group of proxy servers strategically placed inside an internetwork to perform network-wide video streaming and distributed media control. Based on this system architecture, the researchers plan to develop and investigate efficient and scalable real-time video streaming mechanisms that can effectively accommodate the heterogeneity in both the underlying network environments as well as the client end systems, while providing flexible QoS supports to a large client population. In particular,                                                                                                                                          o The researchers will develop  network-wide video smoothing techniques which make use of the in-memory      buffers  at proxy servers and clients to reduce rate variability in video transmission and accommodate           network bandwidth constraints.\r\n\r\n  o The researchers will develop  proxy video staging techniques which exploit the disk storage space of proxy      servers at network edges to achieve significant bandwidth reduction in the backbone wide-area network      (WAN).\r\n\r\n  o The researchers will develop adaptive rate and error control mechanisms such as selective frame discard       and selective retransmission which leverage application-specific information to  meet diverse client QoS        requirements.\r\n\r\n  o The researchers will also develop video stream synchronization and merging schemes which integrate          network-wide video streaming  with proxy-assisted video delivery in a synergistic manner.\r\n\r\nThe methodology the researcherse plan to use in the proposed research will be a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation study and experimental investigation. The end results produced from the proposed research will include new concepts, efficient and scalable mechanisms and algorithms for real-time video streaming, reports of simulation and experimental studies, and a prototyping video proxy server system.",
