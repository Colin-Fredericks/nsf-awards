 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis award will open up new research and professional development opportunities so that the PI can achieve career advancement in a nontraditional cross-disciplinary position between the geosciences and science education.  Currently, she is in a non-tenure track Assistant Professor position, which she has held for six years.  \r\n\tThe PI will further her professional development in earth science education so that she can establish a regional earth science education center.  The PI currently directs a small, local program for teacher professional development in the earth sciences, but has found her current background is insufficient to advance her career goals.  In particular, the PI has been extensively involved in curriculum development and evaluation, mostly at a local level but more recently at the national level.  this work will allow her to develop these curriculum and evaluation skills to the level required for earning a strong national reputation.\r\n\tThis grant will provide the required educational and research background necessary for the PI to jointly conduct conceptual learning research in earth science concepts with University of Utah colleagues in the department of Educational Studies and at other universities.  After she attains the necessary background, she will develop a long term research collaboration on earth science conceptual learning.  Upon completion of this project, the PI will combine this new training with her strong geoscience background and science research skills and be positioned to make significant contributions to the field of geoscience education.\r\n",
