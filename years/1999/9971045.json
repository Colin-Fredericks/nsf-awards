The study can\r\nbe divided up into at least two parts. There are general\r\nfiniteness results where one simply obtains some bounds on\r\ntopological invariants from certain bounds on the geometry. The\r\nPI proposes to work on several finiteness phenomena for manifolds\r\nwith integral bounds for the curvature. The isospectral\r\ncompactness problem for 3-manifolds will also be\r\ninvestigated. There are more specific situations where one can\r\ncompute very specific topological invariants from certain\r\nspecific geometric information. Under this heading one also\r\nstudies various pinching phenomena, where the goal is to\r\nunderstand the specific topological type of a Riemannian manifold\r\nwith restrictions on some of its geometric invariants. The PI\r\nproposes to study Gauss-Bonnet type theorems for noncompact\r\n4-manifolds and their relationship with the study of Euclidean\r\nquantum gravity. This is well studied in the setting of compact\r\nmanifolds, but much less understood for noncompact manifolds. It\r\nis also proposed to investigate various pinching phenomena both\r\nfor curvature and eigenvalues. Finally the PI will undertake a\r\nstudy of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere and try to determine whether it\r\nadmits metrics with positive sectional curvature.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the PI's research centers on understanding the\r\nrelationship between on one hand geometric quantities such as\r\nsize, volume and bending and on the other hand the complexity of\r\nthe objects. Complexity is often measured by how many holes the\r\nobject has, a jungle gym is more complex than a doughnut which in\r\nturn is more complex than a ball.  Depending on how good ones\r\ngeometric information is one can obtain very general bounds on\r\nthe complexity, but it is also possible to sometimes completely\r\ndetermine what the object is. For instance, only a ball has the\r\nproperty that it bends in the same manner everywhere. There are\r\nalso very interesting relationships between the geometric\r\nquantities themselves. For instance, any object that bends in the\r\nsame direction everywhere is bounded in size and volume. Such\r\nresults also have counterparts in Einstein's theory of general\r\nrelativity. There such results are related to the study of the\r\nBig Bang, black holes, and the ultimate fate on the universe. One\r\ntechnical item the PI studies is the possibility that ones\r\nmeasurement of bending does not have to be very precise. In other\r\nwords, slightly vision impaired people's ideas of bending are as\r\ngood as those of people with perfect eye sight.\r\n",
