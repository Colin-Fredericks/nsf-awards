 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 4th AAAI Doctoral Consortium, to be held as a workshop on July 18-19, 1999, immediately preceding the AAAI-99 conference in Orlando, Florida, will provide a unique opportunity for a group of PhD students to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives together with a panel of established researchers.  The consortium has the following objectives:\r\n\r\n               * To provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research, and\r\n\t\tguidance on future research directions\r\n               * To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative\r\n\t\tresearch\r\n               * To support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on\r\n\t\tacademic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths\r\n               * To contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers\r\n\t\tand participation in conference events.\r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Consortium will be held concurrently with other workshops preceding the AAAI'99 conference.   It is expected that it will attract a diverse group of student participants who reflect a wide range of topic areas and methodologies within artificial intelligence, and who have settled on their thesis directions but who still have significant research left to do.  Selection will be based on clarity and completeness of the submission packet, stage of research, advisor's letter, and other evidence of promise such as published papers or technical reports. Participants' thesis summaries will be published in the AAAI-99 conference proceedings.  NSF funds will be used to provide student participants with a travel reimbursement of $750.  Participants will also receive complimentary conference registration.   The organizing committee for the workshop consists of: Janyce M. Wiebe, Chair, New Mexico State University; Mary P. Harper, Purdue University; Evangelos E. Milios, Dalhousie University; Vibhu O. Mittal, Just Research and Carnegie Mellon University; Leora Morgenstern, IBM T.J. Watson Research; and Loren Terveen, AT&T Labs.   Panelists will include: Bonnie Holte Bennett , University of St. Thomas;  Claire Cardie, Cornell University;  Russell Greiner, University of Alberta,  Mary P. Harper, Purdue University;  Evangelos E. Milios, Dalhousie University; Raymond J. Mooney, University of Texas at Austin;  Leora Morgenstern, IBM T.J. Watson Research; and Nils J. Nilsson, Stanford University.\r\n",
