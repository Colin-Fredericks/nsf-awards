 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Award Abstract #9977430\r\n\r\nA Confocal Microscope for Biological Specimens\r\nThis award will be used to establish a multi-user confocal microscopy facility at New York University School of Medicine.  The confocal microscope is generally used to study specimens labelled with fluorescent markers.  Its overwhelming superiority over conventional fluorescence microscopy comes from the fact that its optical system eliminates the contribution to the image of regions of the specimen that are \"out of focus\".  This not only increases the contrast and, hence, the visibility of fine details, but also permits the examination of thicker specimens.  The confocal microscope produces optical sections of the specimen and stacks of such sections can be obtained by repeatedly changing the plane of focus in an automated fashion by an exact fixed amount.  Digitized data from those sections can then be used to generate, by computer methodology, a three dimensional reconstruction of the object being studied.  From such reconstructions one can derive projections or optical sections through any plane in the object.\r\nThe confocal microscopy facility will be located in the Department of Cell Biology and will be primarily used by members of this Department and of the Departments of Dermatology, Medical and Molecular Parasitology, Microbiology, and Pediatric Cardiology.  Confocal Microscopy is an essential tool for the major research projects of the participating investigators.  Their projects include studies on: i) the mechanisms that establish and maintain the polarized organization of the cell membrane in epithelial cells; ii) molecules that regulate the recycling through the cell cytoplasm of receptors that function in the internalization of nutrients at the cell surface; iii) molecular interactions between a protozoon that causes malaria and the liver cells that it infects; iv) mechanisms by which killer lymphocytes recognize and eliminate malaria-infected liver cells; v) the apoptosis (i.e. programmed cell death) of macrophages and neutrophils that takes place when these cells are infected with the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella. vi) the biogenesis of melanosomes, i.e. the formation of the pigment granules of the skin; vii) the pathway that the ras oncogene product follows within the cell to reach the plasma membrane; viii) interactions within myelinated nerve fibers between the axonal membrane and supporting glial cells; ix) molecular mechanisms of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Most of the proposed projects involve the examination of various mammalian cell types and tissues at a subcellular level, with a strong emphasis on live cell studies.  Due to the small size of many of the cell organelles and intracellular microorganisms under investigation, and the emphasis on subcellular localization and intracellular transport, the planned studies require the most advanced instrumentation available which, nevertheless, must be user-friendly to serve effectively as a shared resource.\r\nThe confocal system to be acquired will be equipped with both upright and inverted microscopes and an additional image-processing workstation.  The inverted microscope will be used for many of the experiments involving live cell systems. However, the availability of a suitable water immersion objective will make it also possible to carry out combined microinjection/confocal microscopy studies with the upright microscope.  \r\nBecause processing of the data obtained with the confocal microscope is very time consuming, the data will be exported to a separate workstation to free the confocal system for other users.  This setup will also facilitate the use of the microscope for teaching and training purposes.  It is anticipated that access to the confocal facility will enhance our students' and postdoctoral fellows' appreciation of, and capacity to utilize, the power of this powerful instrumentation for studying diverse problems in cell biology.\r\n\r\n",
