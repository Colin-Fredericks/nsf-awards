 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of spectroscopy and relaxation in liquids, supercritical fluids and proteins.  Three specific areas of research will be pursued: 1) the development of  integral equation theories of density and temperature anomalies of fluids near the critical point; 2) the extension of existing hybrid analytical / simulation techniques, developed for simple model systems, to the treatment of vibrational relaxation of polyatomic molecules in polyatomic solvents; and 3) an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the carbon monoxide myoglobin complex in water in order to compare directly with the experimental observables obtained from time-resolved vibrational experiments.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of liquid solvents plays an important role in many chemical and biological processes.   Vibrational relaxation is also intimately involved in liquid-state chemical reaction dynamics.  Skinner's research attempts to provide a molecular level interpretation of the influence a solvent has on chemical and biological processes in condensed phases.",
