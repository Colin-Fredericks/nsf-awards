 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Madonna Moss, Mr. Robert Losey will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The goal of his research is to use archaeological data to examine cultural responses to tectonic events and the effects of such events upon the landscape in the Northwest Coast of North America. A growing body of geological evidence has documented the occurrence of large earthquakes in this region over the last several thousand years and these resulted in down-dropping of land in relation to lea level and the generation of large tsunamis (tidal waves). It is likely that these may have damaged low-lying settlements destroying houses and food stores and that longer term changes in the landscape affected how and where people could live.  Prehistoric residents depended heavily on fish and shell fish and the distribution of these resources may have been rapidly altered. Mr. Losey will investigate several archaeological sites in Netarts and Nehalem bays on the northern Oregon coast. He will re-examine previously excavated collections and supplement this with small scale excavation, sampling and dating of several archaeological sites. He will also study Native American oral history concerning tsunamis and earthquakes and use these data to examine archaeological settlement patterns before and after the 1700 AD event.\r\n\r\nBased on previous data Mr. Losey believes that the sites selected were occupied both before and after 1700 AD and this will be confirmed through radiocarbon dating of carefully selected samples. Sediment analyses performed on materials taken from the sites and from cores and augers at off-site locations will provide data on local landscape changes before and after the earthquake. Detailed analysis of faunal remains will provide insight into how local environments were affected by the earthquake and how people adjusted to these changes. The large artifact samples collected from the sites by previous investigators will also be correlated with the newly generated data.\r\n\r\nThe research is important because it will increase understanding of the effects of one specific earthquake upon the people, landscape, environments and archaeological record of the poorly known southern United States Northwest Coast. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
