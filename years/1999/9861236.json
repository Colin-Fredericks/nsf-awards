This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Learning in Motion, Inc. is a feasibility study focusing on modifying existing multimedia into instructional tools for PreK-K children with significant hearing loss.  The need is critical: Two out of every 1,000 young children in the United States have hearing loss severe enough to adversely affect learning.  The National Action Plan for Mathematics Education Reform for the Deaf (1995) recommends that more resources address mathematics instruction for children with significant hearing loss.  Learning in Motion has published a research-based, field-tested, multi-media program for early learners of mathematics.  The multi-media includes three-dimensional graphics and characters, completed game logic, and eleven interactive game activities.  The main objectives of this project are as follows:  document the experiences of hearing-impaired students as they use the existing program; from this information, take one game activity and modify it to accommodate the special needs of children with significant hearing loss, and initiate a testing plan for the modified segment.  Should feasibility indicate continued modification, salable multimedia for these students and design guidelines will ultimately be produced.\r\n          The proposed activity will serve to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics activities and learning.  What is proposed although focused on benefiting students with hearing loss may also serve as a model to support students with other types of disabilities.  The project has the potential to produce a completely modified mathematics multimedia program for children with significant hearing loss.  Design of guidelines for others electing to develop specialized software would also be produced, thus setting the stage for and encouraging commercial collaboration with publishers looking to create or convert other multimedia titles.          \t\r\n",
