In collaboration with Liu, Li has set up the parametrized Seiberg-Witten theory and derived a wall-crossing formula.\r\nThe parametrized Seiberg-Witten theory is particularly interesting for\r\nfamilies of symplectic manifolds.  Li proposes to develop further the parametrized Seiberg-Witten and the parametrized Gromov-Taubes theories and  show\r\n that these two theories are equivalent for symplectic families.\r\nThe parametrized theories should be useful for studying the isotopies of diffeomorphisms\r\nas well as symplectomorphisms. And the equivalence between the two theories is expected to play an important role in the classification  of symplectic four manifolds, especially those with torsion canonical classes.  \r\nRecently, it has been shown that smooth Lefschetz fibrations\r\nprovide a link between the topology of symplectic four manifolds,\r\nthe geometry of the moduli space of curves and the algebra of\r\nthe mapping class groups. The investigator plans to explore the\r\nbeautiful and rich interplay to advance  understanding\r\nof all these objects.\r\n\r\nAn n manifold is a space that locally looks like Euclidean space\r\nof dimension n. For example, the space-time universe we live in\r\nis a four manifold.  A symplectic structure \r\n is a very basic structure that underlies\r\nalmost all the equations of classical and quantum physics.  \r\nA symplectic four manifold is  a four manifold with\r\na symplectic structure. Thus symplectic four manifolds\r\nplay a central role in mathematics and physics.\r\nThe fundamental problem is to classify all symplectic\r\nfour manifolds. The investigator aims to gain some understanding of the general shape\r\nof symplectic four manifolds.    \r\n",
