 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tWhy do nations go to war?  For over thirty years, scholars have attempted to develop and test general theories explaining why nations engage in armed conflict.  Both the theories and the statistical methods used to test them have become increasingly sophisticated over time.  However, current general theories still do not explain international conflict very well.  Moreover, there is now reason to believe that past conclusions reached through statistical testing may not be valid.\r\n\tOne important reason for this is the failure to incorporate strategic interaction into statistical analyses.  Historians and political scientists long have considered strategic calculation to be one of the defining characteristics of international politics.  Yet, this crucial element has been generally missing in statistical analyses of conflict - especially those where the outcomes are \"discrete\" or \"finite.\"  In a very real (and negative) sense, past statistical analyses of international conflict are \"out on a limb.\"  Nonstrategic statistical tests are not correct tests of strategic theories.  Moreover, failure to account for strategic interaction is a form of specification error that can lead researchers to the wrong conclusions.\r\n\tFortunately, strategic interaction may be incorporated directly into statistical models in a very intuitive way.  This proposal identifies a broad research program that attempts to bridge the gap between international conflict theory and statistical analysis.  By merging game theory and statistical methods, this proposal shows how to calculate statistics \"out on a limb\" of an extensive form game tree - and thereby derive a statistical model that is consistent with one's theory of conflict.\r\n\tThe proposed research has four main components:  (1) to adapt, develop, and generalize statistical methods for analyzing strategic finite choice models; (2) to address a number of important statistical issues related to those models, such as strategic specification error, multiple equilibria, and dynamic games; (3) to apply these methods to the study of international conflict; and (4) in addressing the first three issues, to make available user-friendly statistical software for the broader research community.\r\n\tThe attainment of many of these goals is crucial not only for the social scientific study of international conflict, but for the statistical analysis of any political phenomenon involving strategic choices over discrete sets of options.  If a statistical test is not derived from the theoretical model, then one cannot be assured that the theory is truly being tested.  Without general results concerning strategic specification error, one cannot speak to the validity of past (or future) conclusions.  Moreover, to model more realistic situations, complex issues such as multiple equilibria and choices over time must be addressed.  Finally, since most political scientists are not programmers or mathematicians, the availability of statistical software allows these techniques to be exploited by a large community of scholars.  \r\n",
