 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Post-Doctoral Research project revisits the issue of whether market prices are higher for food in low-income neighborhoods by analyzing current and historical unpublished price level data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for use in compiling the Consumer Price Index. The researcher will examine whether price differences between low and upper-income neighborhoods have changed over time by analyzing historical price data. The project will test whether there has been significant changes in pricing strategies toward the low-income consumer and analyze how these pricing strategies have evolved with the change in neighborhood demography over time. In a second project to be completed during the fellowship tenure, the researcher will derive a low-income price index to study whether inflation differentially affects the poor. Finally, the researcher will replicate Chevalier (1995) to analyze whether highly leveraged supermarkets charge higher prices.",
