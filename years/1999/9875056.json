The main emphasis will be on global stability and performance for designs with low complexity and distributed intelligence, and on robustness of performance to modeling error and component failure.\r\nNew challenges have emerged in the field of control, driven by recent technological progress. Dramatic advances in micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) enable the fabrication of microsensors, micro actuators, together with micro-electronic circuits on the same substrate.  Distributing such units in large arrays brings unprecedented possibilities for control at a very fine scale, such as \"active skin\" for aerodynamic drag reduction, or \"smart\" materials for control of structural dynamics; these imply a significant departure from the traditional picture of centralized computer control through a reduced number of macroscopic variables.\r\nThe proposed research is aimed at the control-theoretic aspects of this new focus, in particular at methods for analysis and design of distributed control configurations from the point of view of global objectives.  Among the main issues to address are: (I) the computational complexity of analysis and design for these large problems; (ii) the need for a localized solution, implemented by a distributed algorithm; (iii) the problem of communication within the array (architectures, effect of delay, etc.); (iv) the analysis of model uncertainty and robustness in distributed systems; (v) the effects of failure of some components of the array.  \r\nRecently the PI and collaborators have shown how to break the computational complexity of distributed control design under the assumption of spatial invariance in the plant, which is characteristic of regular geometry's; also, some initial results were obtained on the issue of control localization.  These first steps are very encouraging for future research in this wide open area.\r\nIn addition to fundamental theory, the project will include concrete application studies; candidate areas where there is expertise at UCLA include the control of fluid flow by distributed boundary actuation (microflaps, blowing/suction ....), and aeroelasticity problems such as control of flutter by distributed piezoelectric actuation.  An interesting observation from the recent fluids literature, is that robustness considerations are relevant to the long-standing problem of predicting transition to turbulence.  This provides strong motivation for studies in distributed uncertainty modeling and robust distributed control for these applications.\r\nA separate focus of this project is distributed dynamics of large networks, such as the power grid or wireless communication systems.  Connections to the work in distributed control will be explored, but these areas will also be pursued in their own right.  In power systems in particular, the PI has done recent work showing the limitations of current analytical approaches to power system stability, and is involved in a research initiative at UCLA on distributed power electronics for the grid.\r\n\r\n     The educational objectives of this project are: (i) to train students in control and dynamics in engineering systems, with emphasis on the concept of robustness as a key to closing the theory-practice gap; (ii) to introduce graduate students to research in the exciting area of distributed systems; (iii) to establish a curricular environment for interdisciplinary teaching in dynamics of large networks, in close connection to the abovementioned research in this area.\r\n\r\n",
