 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific community has recently turned focused attention to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, with the recognition that gaps in the basic knowledge of the biogeochemistry of these elements is impeding ability to make important policy decisions.  While the main focus has been on CO2, it is widely acknowledged that other trace gases, particularly CH4 and N2O, are significant players in the greenhouse story.   The goal of this work is to study the effects of elevated CO2 on the production and consumption of CH4 and N2O using the Biosphere 2 facility. Biosphere 2 encloses controlled 'mesocosms' of varying complexity and environmental conditions, offering a chance to study natural processes at an intermediate scale between the laboratory and the field.  This study will be carried out as part of a larger collaboration to use Biosphere 2 to better understand the processes that regulate the exchange of CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O, O2, isoprene and other trace gases between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere.  The nature of the proposed work is exploratory, and will result in the design of process-based studies that make optimal use of the Biosphere 2 facility.  It follows on a year of infrastructure development and data gathering to determine a baseline for the Biosphere 2 system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is designed to address the following two questions:  1) What is the effect of elevated CO2 on CH4 and N2O exchange with rainforest and forestry soils in Biosphere 2; and 2) What is the effect of elevated CO2 on CH4 flux from wetlands?  Follow-up work will result in process-based studies and the expansion of the research program to include NOx and stable isotope work.  A key aspect of this award is the support of two workshops to bring a team of interdisciplinary experts to Biosphere 2 to advise on experimental design and initiate collaborations.  Work inside Biosphere 2 will build on and support future field and laboratory studies.  This exploratory work on the interdependencies of trace gas fluxes inside Biosphere 2 will serve as the first phase in the PI's development of a new research emphasis in terrestrial nutrient cycling.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE funding will help the PI transition from administration to a combination of research and teaching/curriculum development for the next several years, and reestablish the scholarship that will sustain the PI's longer-term career.",
