 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project objective is the construction of  an interdisciplinary undergraduate intelligent control laboratory.  The laboratory is based on the adaptation  of  recent advances in soft computing design techniques such as Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neurofuzzy algorithms.  The laboratory design emphasizes creating experiments that are based on industrial applications. Industrial  design ideas, concepts and  innovative techniques that have already been utilized and demonstrated in a fully automated electronic assembly factory are to be incorporated into the laboratory design.  \r\n\r\nThe project includes learning experiences in several different processes, represented by stations in the laboratory, including DC Servo Systems, Heat Trainers, Inverted Pendulums, X-Y Tables and Visual Component Inspection Stations. Each station contains a microcomputer with  A/D, D/A , Frame Grabber interfaces  and six experimental setups. The effect of design performance, robustness,  cycle time and other design parameters are to be investigated by the undergraduate  students.\r\n\r\nThe use of  a digital computer with soft computing capability in a real-time control loop reflects the rapidly increasing use of these techniques for industrial applications.",
