 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use multiple modes of communication (e.g., sounds, visual and/or chemical cues) to recognize members of their own species and discriminate them from others. The research goal is to understand the role of multi-modal signaling in an invertebrate animal model (spiders). As invertebrates have a limited behavioral repertoire and very little learning ability, species recognition in spiders is innate and based on simple cues. It is therefore possible to experiment with specific aspects of multi-modal signals, and gain insights about the recognition \"program\" encoded within their simple nervous system. Video / audio digitization and playback experiments will examine the relationship between visual and vibration signals produced by (male) \"senders\" and the information they convey to (female) \"receivers\".  In addition, field studies will determine how the\r\nenvironment affects transmission of different signal modes. \r\n\r\n Results will allow a better understanding of mechanisms involved in animal communication, and their adaptive value. The research will also contribute to growing knowledge about ecologically important but poorly-understood invertebrate predators. Additionally, this research involves training students in the use of a powerful computer-assisted technique that could be applied to a variety of research questions in animal behavior, neurobiology and other fields (image recognition, artificial intelligence).\r\n\r\n",
