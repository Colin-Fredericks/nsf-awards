 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nKwapisz\r\n\r\nCocyclic subshifts are the supports of locally constant matrix cocycles on the full shift over a finite alphabet.  Despite the simple definition, they contain all sofic subshifts and are much more intricate.  The PI proposes their comprehensive study based on an original approach rooted in the Wedderburn-Artin theory of algebras.  In particular, the goal is to explain topological structure of cocyclic subshifts via a Morse decomposition and their probabilistic behavior via the ergodic theory of the maximal measure.  The functional analysis of thermodynamical formalism will be deployed to compute the entropy and the occurrence probabilities of specific words.  The PI also plans to explore the impact of cocyclic subshifts on coding theory, probabilistic automata, theory of formal languages, finite dimensional algebras, and the general theory of dynamical systems.  The last connection, perhaps less obvious, is the main motivation of this project.  Topological methods of the Conley index may be applied to real-life dynamical systems (differential equations) to perceive them as generators of certain cocyclic subshifts --- which can be used then to detect orbits of the orginal system.  One application is rigorous verification of chaotic behavior, and the PI intends to write computer programs for chaos detection based on the theory.\r\n\r\nFrom a more general perspective, this project explores new ideas in symbolic dynamics, a branch of mathematics that deals with infinite sequences of zeroes and ones and is largely motivated by problems of telecommunication, where routinely data is encoded by such sequences and the volume is large enough to justify the idealization to infinite sequences.  One mainly studies the sets of all possible sequences --- termed subshifts --- that can be generated (or recognized) by a particular type of device.  To give a classical example, sofic subshifts are recognized by automata capable of assuming only finitely many states, which are widely implemented in digital electronics (e.g. modems, hard drive controllers, etc).  Cocyclic subshifts, in turn, require more sophisticated automata that are abstractly specified by two (or more) square matrices A_0 and A_1.  An infinite binary sequence belongs to the subshift if, after putting the matrices in the place of symbols, we get a matrix product that never equals zero.  (For instance, 0110101...is rejected if for some initial segment, say 0110, we have A_0A_1A_1A_0=0; otherwise, it is accepted.)  This scheme can be satisfactorily implemented on a computer; however, it cannot compete with the existing technology without thorough theoretical research of the kind proposed by the PI.  Finally, the relevance of cocyclic subshifts transcends the narrow context chosen here to explain the PI's ideas:  cocyclic subshifts embody a fundamental aspect of (random) matrix products which are ubiquitous in mathematics, science, and engineering.  For instance, detection of chaos in dynamics (e.g. population dynamics in biology and medicine) is one area in which the methods developed by the PI can be implemented.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
