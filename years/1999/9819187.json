 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the educational outcomes of students receiving educational vouchers from one of three private foundations: the Oklahoma Scholarship Program, Children's Educational Opportunity of Michigan, and Students First from Birmingham, Alabama. These scholarship programs have awarded scholarships to lowincome families in their respective states. The scholarships have been allocated by lottery. The random nature of scholarship assignment in these organizations will be utilized to eliminate school selection bias. Lottery losers will serve as a control group for voucher winners.\r\n\r\nThe outcome data will be gathered through surveys and school records. The student outcomes of interest include test scores, school attendance, grade retention, and disciplinary actions. Additional analysis will focus on parental involvement in education and educational outcomes of other children.\r\n\r\n",
