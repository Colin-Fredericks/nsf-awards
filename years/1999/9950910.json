 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements a model laboratory for use by computer science students in a distributed systems course and a computer networks course.  It adapts and updates pedagogical strategies from similar projects around the country, basing the lab upon the latest distributed networking technology now available.  A collection of innovative laboratory modules are being developed to provide students with practical experience to complement the theoretical material covered in the course.  \r\n\r\nALAMODE consists of 21 PC's, a fileserver, and a 100 MB network switch specifically designed to simulate a real wide-area network.  One of the 21 PC's is being used to simulate a faulty wide area network to provide fault tolerant aspects to projects.  The use of a real network switch provides students access to cutting edge network technology.   The D'Agents mobile agent system is being adapted for the simulated wide-area network,   \r\n\r\nAn evaluation is being directed by an assessment committee examining student learning at several stages during the courses as well as an exit survey of student attitudes.  The laboratory modules with explanatory notes are being made available to other computer science departments interested in developing similar courses.",
