He will do a theoretical analysis of a new algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves and give optimizations for the various parameters required by the algorithm.  \r\nHe will study lower bounds for the canonical height on elliptic curves and prove a Lehmer-type bound for non-reciprocal points.  He will investigate the relationship between the Frobenius trace values of an elliptic curve and the rank of the curve so as the study the variation of the rank in families of curves and give a probabilistic quantitative justification for Mestre's method of producing elliptic curves of high rank.  All of these projects will significantly advance our knowledge of the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves, an area of mathematics which is of widespread interest in its own right and because of its applicability to number theory and other areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research project  fits into the general framework of understanding the number theoretic properties of elliptic curves.  This theory has been extensively studied for a long time, both for its intrinsic beauty and its applicability to other areas of number theory and mathematics. In recent years, the full power of modern arithmetic and algebraic geometry have been brought into play, with excellent results.  All three main projects will answer important theoretical and practical questions concerning the arithmetic of elliptic curves and will spur further research in this field.\r\n",
