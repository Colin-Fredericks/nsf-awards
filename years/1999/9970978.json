A standard procedure in\r\nalgebra is to study an algebraic object by studying its localizations at\r\nvarious primes, then reassembling the localizations into a global picture.\r\nIn stable homotopy theory, one can localize at an ordinary integer prime p,\r\nbut after doing so, more primes become visible.  These are known as Morava\r\nK-theories.  Denote the localization of a spectrum X with respect to the\r\nnth Morava K-theory K(n) by L(K(n))X.  Calculation of L(K(n))X can usually\r\nbe reduced to a purely algebraic problem, but little is known about the\r\nreassembly of the L(K(n))X for different n into knowledge of X itself.  The\r\nchromatic splitting conjecture, due to Mike Hopkins, is a conjecture about\r\nthe composition L(K(m))L(K(n))X for finite spectra X, and it would allow\r\none to recover X from the different L(K(n))X.  The truth of this conjecture\r\nis known to have significant impact on several other conjectures in stable\r\nhomotopy theory, and even partial results about it would be a major advance.\r\nOne of the methods involved in the principal investigator's approach to this\r\nconjecture is the study of the derived functors of the inverse limit functor\r\nin a category of comodules.\r\n     Homotopy theory is the study of curves, surfaces, and higher dimensional\r\nspaces up to continuous deformation.  That is, in homotopy theory, the letter\r\nA and the letter O are considered equivalent, because one can gradually\r\ndeform the letter A into a triangle by pushing in the legs, then gradually\r\ndeform the triangle into a circle by pushing out on the corners.  A \r\ndifficulty with homotopy theory is that different dimensions behave\r\ndifferently.  More precisely, given a space X, one can form its suspension\r\nby attaching it with wires to two points outside X.  The suspension of a\r\ncircle, for example, is a sphere, and the suspension of a sphere is a sphere\r\nof the next higher dimension.  In stable homotopy theory, two spaces X and Y\r\nare considered equivalent if, after suspending X and Y repeatedly, one can\r\nbe deformed into the other.  For example, the surface of a donut is obtained\r\nby attaching a sphere to two circles that touch at one point (one circle\r\ngoes around the hole, one circle goes around the filling, and the surface of\r\nthe sphere gets spread out over the rest of the surface of the donut).  But\r\na donut cannot be deformed into two circles and a sphere, all touching at one\r\npoint.  However, the suspension of a donut can be deformed into two spheres\r\nand a 3-dimensional sphere, all touching at one point.  The great advantage\r\nof stable homotopy theory is that problems become much more amenable to\r\nalgebraic methods of solution.  Many geometric problems turn out to depend\r\nonly on the stable homotopy type of the space involved, so stable homotopy\r\ntheory has been of considerable utility.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
