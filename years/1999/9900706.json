 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design and field test an advanced coring system having significant applications in geologic investigation, fossil fuel exploration, and environmental remediation.  Two major shortcomings beset available coring technology: (1) no real-time monitoring of the core length in the barrel; and (2) incomplete closure of the barrel opening, which may lead to core loss.  While partial core loss is generally not a problem in competent formations, it is a problem of some import in unconsolidated and highly fractured formations.  Partial core loss is estimated in approximately 20% of the wells cored in the U.S. and Canada.  Loss of core can be extremely costly, particularly in ocean drilling where rig rates can run in excess of $10,000 per hour.  Phase II will elaborate on a feasible advanced coring concept from Phase I.  Phase II will develop: (1) an accurate electromagnetic core height measurement for cores up to 90 feet in length in both water- and oil-based drilling fluids; (2) a mud-pulse telemetry system having adequate data rate and well-depth capabilities within commercial cost constraints for coring operations; and (3) a reliable full-closure assembly actuated by surface operator command.\r\n     This advanced coring system will be configured for compatible operation with conventional and wireline-retrievable coring systems.  The annual coring services market is estimated at $75 million.  It is expected that the new full-closure technology will be utilized extensively in this market.\r\n",
