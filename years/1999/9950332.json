Extensive faculty consultation is involved to help students plan and continually revise their protocols and final reports.  A pilot testing of this approach served as the basis for design of this course.  The course is part of a department commitment to change the way in which biology is taught to all students.  The new department curriculum adapts and implements ideas from a variety of sources, including work cited by the National Research Council (1997, Science Teaching Reconsidered), the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR Newsletter 1997) and previous pilot projects  of the Principal Investigator (Mayne, J. 1998 An Investigative Laboratory for Cell Biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell, 9).",
