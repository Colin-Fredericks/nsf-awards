Research groups at the University of Califor-nia at San Diego (UCSD), the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) provide synergistic interactions among computationally sophisticated experimen-talists, theoretical biophysicists, and mathematicians. The primary objectives of CCMS are to develop, test, package, and support important but complex methods in such a fashion that they can be reliably used by researchers who understand the science but cannot dedicate ma-jor resources to the computational aspects. These goals require thorough analysis and professional software engineering. XtalView is a complete system for solving macromolecular crys-tal structures by multiple isomorphous replacement, and for fitting atomic models of macromolec-ular structures to electron density maps. During 1998, 939 copies of XtalView were downloaded from the CCMS Web site, http://www.sdsc.edu/CCMS. A recently developed and promising soft-ware product is DOT, a parallelized Fourier correlation docking program that has already proved successful at predicting both transient and stable protein-protein interactions. This award supports substantial improvements in tools for solving, manipulating, and analyzing macromolecular structures in XtalView. New plug-in modules and a restructuring of the plug-in interface to bring other major crystallographic computational packages, including the CCP4 suite, into the same powerful interactive visual environment will be completed. Key XtalView developments will include a) automated chain-tracing and electron density map characterizations, b) evaluations of local and global shape and steric parameters, atomic packing interactions, plus elec-trostatic gradients and c) compatibility with emerging standards from the new Protein Data Bank (PDB), especially mmCIF structure factors. The development of XtalWeb, a web-browser for view-ing electron density and key experimental neighborhood volume parameters (physical, biochemical, genomic, and three-dimensional properties evaluated in the space surrounding a molecule) will pro-vide non-crystallographers with tools to evaluate the actual experimental results alongside derived coordinates and images of computed neighborhood parameters. The tool DOT synergistically interfaces with these efforts by providing a powerful means to comprehensively map docking energy and free energy landscapes. The Fourier correlation methods of DOT will be expanded to objectively and comprehensively evaluate molecular neighborhood volume-based pseudo-potentials relevant to molecular function and recognition, such as fractal dimension and amino acid sequence conserva-tion. Refinement of DOT predictions will incorporate molecular flexibility by using the Convex Global Underestimator algorithm for global optimization.\r\n",
