 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971405\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980's, researchers who were trying to model learning in the brain developed several novel learning algorithms for multilayer non-linear neural networks.  Somewhat incidentally, these algorithms turn out to be very powerful techniques for adaptive regression and classification, and have proven their usefulness independent of whether or not they are a good model for the brain.  They are now being applied to medical diagnosis, chemical process control, shape recognition and a wide range of other important practical problems.  At the same time, there have been significant advances in adaptive techniques in the field of statistics.  The new statistical methods are more powerful than classical techniques such as linear regression and linear discriminant analysis.  Some of the recently developed procedures include CART (Classification And Regression Trees), generalized additive models, MARS (Multivariate Additive Regression Splines), and sophisticated versions of nearest neighbor algorithms that learn an appropriate metric for the input space.  Although they come from different fields using different terminologies, these methods have much in common.  One item in this proposal is a research monograph that seeks to bring many of these ideas under one umbrella, explaining them in a unified fashion.  Two other items explore some recent new methods for improving classifiers and for adaptive model selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work aims at developing new models and methods for making predictions based on historical data.  These techniques are important in many different fields including medical diagnosis, financial forecasting and industrial process control.  The area of biotechnology is an especially important application for these methods.  Scientists now have techniques for measuring gene expression levels for thousands of genes at the same time, allowing the exciting possibility of determining which human genes are involved in a diseases such as cancer and heart disease.  Sorting through the mass of information is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and predictive methods like the ones studied here will provide an important tool in this search.\r\n\r\n",
