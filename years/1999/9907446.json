 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Jean-Francois Richard will acquire a Microway 264 DP-2000+ workstation with 1 GB of SDRAM and associated monitor and site license. This system will facilitate his economic research in two key areas. The first involves very high-dimensional (1000+) numerical integration of likelihood functions by importance sampling. Modern econometric models often include large numbers of unobserved variables. Such models frequently suffer from the fact that important components of individual agents decisions are unobserved and have to be accounted for in the form of unobserved random heterogeneity and Dr. Richard's work examines how this might most optimally be accomplished. The second aspect of his research concerns empirical game theoretic models. In recent years this experimental economic approach has burgeoned with special emphasis on auctions. By carefully controlling and varying game rules one can gain insight into individual player's strategies as well as the dynamics of inter-individual interaction. Dr. Richard's work examines the underlying principles on which such behaviors are based. The workstation will also be available to graduate students and thus have a potentially broad impact.",
