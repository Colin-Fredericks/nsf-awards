The UCOWR Annual Meeting will bring together researchers from the water resources research institutes of the nation's land grant universities, as well as other academics, consultants, and industry officials, most with no prior exposure to the privatization issue.  The technical session is designed to expose them to a range of perspectives, arguments, and experiences.  The phenomenon of privatization is gaining momentum and has significant social, economic, and environmental effects and it is hoped that this session will highlight some of the key issues and information deficits, suggesting a research agenda.  At the close of this meeting we hope, through the presentations and discussions, to have not only greater understanding of this movement but a sharper focus concerning the prominent research needs.  The final product will be included in our annual proceeding as a special session that summarizes the findings of this meeting and point to specific research needs.\r\n",
