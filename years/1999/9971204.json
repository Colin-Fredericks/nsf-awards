Turkington\r\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research project concerns statistical models of turbulent fluid\r\nmotions.  In particular, these investigations focus on equilibrium\r\nmodels of coherent structures in developed turbulent flows that are\r\neither two-dimensional or quasi-geostrophic.  The principal motivation\r\nfor this work comes from applications in geophysical fluid dynamics.\r\nStatistical equilibrium models defined by Gibbs ensembles are\r\nconstructed from the conserved quantities for the underlying fluid\r\ndynamics.  The continuum limit of these lattice models is analyzed\r\nusing probabilistic techniques, especially the theory of large\r\ndeviations.  This approach furnishes rigorous derivations of the\r\nconstrained maximum entropy principles whose solutions are the most\r\nprobable macroscopic states of the systems.  These macrostates\r\nrepresent long-lived, large-scale flows that self-organize in the\r\nturbulent vorticity field.  For instance, they can be zonal shear\r\nflows or embedded vortex structures.  In a variety of contexts,\r\nincluding one-layer barotropic flows and two-layer baroclinic flows,\r\nthe variational problems governing these states are solved numerically\r\nby means of a robust and accurate method.  In this way, quantitative\r\npredictions about the macroscopic behavior of the system, which is\r\nturbulent on the microscopic scales, can be made without resolving all\r\nthe scales of motion.  Another direction of the research is to extend\r\nthese equilibrium theories to a new class of quasi-equilibrium\r\ntheories determined by collective variables that are not necessarily\r\nconserved quantities.  This extension allows the same general approach\r\nto be applied in situations where the coherent states are\r\nslow-varying, but unsteady.\r\n\r\nTurbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical\r\nscience.  A better theoretical understanding of turbulence would\r\ngreatly improve our ability to compute the behavior of natural fluid\r\nmotions.  In particular, geophysical fluid flows -- the large-scale\r\nmotions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere -- are very difficult to\r\npredict because of their turbulent fluctuations.  Nevertheless, these\r\nflow systems, whose motions are mainly horizontal, have special\r\nproperties not shared by general fluid motions in three dimensions.\r\nConsequently, they tend to exhibit organized behavior in their largest\r\nfeatures while they remain disordered and random on a range of smaller\r\nlength scales.  The research conducted in this project addresses the\r\nmathematical and computational issues involved in modeling phenomena\r\nof this type.  Specifically, the work seeks to develop the tools\r\nnecessary to calculate the persistent, predominant states of nearly\r\ntwo-dimensional fluid systems without resolving the full complexity of\r\ntheir detailed behavior.  With such tools in hand, the typical or\r\n\"most probable\" states of geophysical flows can be characterized and\r\ncomputed.  Besides being of fundamental interest in the field of fluid\r\ndynamics, these states can used as building blocks in predictions\r\nabout the long-term trends in the ocean-atmosphere system, and hence\r\nthey are relevant to weather forecasting and climate modeling.\r\n\r\n",
