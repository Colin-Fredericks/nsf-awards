 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks funding to develop an Internet-based, muti-user graphical worlds to support communal constructivist learning.  In particular a muti-user math game would be implemented in a 3-D graphical environment.  Students would be assessed on how and what they learn in these environments.  In stage 2, the students would build 3D games.  Students would be evaluated in terms of what they learn from this type of programming in terms of mathematical reasoning as well as knowledge of computer programming.  Finally, the study will also examine how student learning is facilitated by on on-line community.  The proposal also seeks to understand how on-line communities can support the learning that takes place as students develop the games and simulations.  In summary, the research project explores two hypotheses; first that three dimensional multi-user virtual words on the Internet have a unique potential to help students learn about mathematics and computer science in an interdisciplinary, peer-supported constructivist setting; and second that community support for constructivist learning can make that learning scaleable and sustainable.",
