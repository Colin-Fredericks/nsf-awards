 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate new instrumentation and applications of infrared ellipsometry.  Phase I demonstrated that a viable instrument having significantly superior spectral range, accuracy, and flexibility in application can be built.  Secondly, it demonstrated important new applications.  However, much remains to be accomplished.  Phase II objectives include development of brighter sources, better detectors, spectral range extension, advanced optical elements including polarizers and retarders, in situ applications, and numerous software issues including anisotropy, dynamic data acquisition, and partial depolarization, Materials research objectives include investigating new physics in polymeric nanometer-scale films, microstructures in III-V's and III-V Nitrides, as well as demonstrating low-temperature (> 4K) IR ellipsomctry capabilities.  The J.A. Woollam Co., Inc. has a strong record of commercialization, and is deeply committed to commercialization of the instrumentation and applications developed during this contract,\r\n     Industries presently using visible ellipsometers and FTIR spectrometers are potential users of infrared ellipsometry.  For example: basic and applied research in industry, Universities, and microelectronics.  Uses include analysis of doping profiles in semiconductors, accurate optical constants, interface roughness, and nanometer-scale science: microstructure and chemical identification in complex ultra-thin films.\r\n",
