The knowledge of the physical state, distribution, and velocity structure of this material is relevant for understanding large-scale galactic winds (\"superwinds\") and fountains in active and normal galaxies, quasar absorption-line systems, the baryonic content of the universe, the formation and evolution of galaxies, and measuring the mass and distribution of dark matter in galaxies.  A complete sample of nearby galaxies will be mapped down to unprecedented flux levels using state-of-the-art optical Fabry-Perot interferometers.  These data will provide new quantitative constraints on the gaseous cross-sections of galaxies.  The morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas derived from these observations will help determine whether this material is an extension of the neutral Hydrogen gas (HI) disks, remnant-accreting gas from galaxy formation, tidal debris from recent galaxy interactions, or gas associated with galactic fountains or superwinds. Data on the rotation curves of galaxies will allow a better determination of the dark matter distribution.  The results from the data on the emission-line properties of the warm gas will be compared with the observational data on the disk interstellar medium (ISM) and with predictions from shock models.  Graduate students and undergraduate astronomy majors will be involved in this research effort.\r\n\r\n\r\r\nThe educational component of the project involves developing innovative ways to introduce more observing experiences into the curriculum of non-science university students and to provide K-12 students from local schools with some flavor of what goes on in modern ground-based astronomy.  Astronomy activities attract students of all ages. Activities for the University of Maryland campus observatory will be designed and developed. An inquiry based learning approach is to be used as a means of educating the students. The existing laboratory astronomy course for undergraduate non-science majors will be revamped to take advantage of the added versatility of the campus observatory.  New emphasis will be put on having undergraduate students directly involved in the course material and the learning process.  The telescopes and computers will be used to provide some basic research activities into the curriculum of non-science majors.  These hands-on activities will help the students develop a framework for understanding the scientific method that will facilitate learning throughout their lives. \r\n\r\n",
