 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sense of smell is very important for behavior and food selection, but we still know very little about how olfactory information from the nose is handled by the brain.  One model system that has been very useful in studying the sense of smell has been the crayfish, because these aquatic animals use their antennae as 'noses' of very high sensitivity for compounds dissolved in the water.  Recent discoveries in many invertebrates, including crayfish, have shown some aspects of brain organization in olfactory areas may be similar to olfactory parts of the brain in mammals, so they provide useful comparative experimental subjects for examining functional properties of this common anatomical organization.  This work will utilize electrophysiological recordings from individual neurons, or nerve cells, within the olfactory part of the brain of crayfish.  These neurons form local small networks that show oscillatory activity when stimulated.   Here, the temporal properties of the input signal traffic and of the local networks will be recorded to determine where particular kinds of synchronous patterns of activity originate, how the neurons are selectively stimulated by certain patterns of input and how they are functionally coupled together, and what may be the importance of periodic bursts of activity.\r\n    Results will be important not only to understanding olfactory integration, but also to understanding mechanisms for olfactory-driven behaviors, and to computational and cognitive neuroscience for analyzing how synchronous and patterned neural activity in networks may have a function in developing memories. \r\n",
