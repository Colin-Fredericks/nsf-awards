 "awd_abstract_narration": "In coherent imaging systems the transmitted and/or received coherent signals are spread over a spatially extended coherent aperture. Here, the definition of coherence relates to signals that exhibit a stationary phase relationship over the aperture.  Coherent imaging uses an extended coherent aperture to enhance the resolution and reduce the signal to noise ratio of the desired images. Coherent apertures can either be continuous, such as a lens in an optical system, or discrete, spatially sampled apertures, often referred to as phased arrays. Some examples of phased array systems are electromagnetic-microwave surveillance and synthetic aperture imaging radars, and ultrasound transducers in medical ultrasound. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together a group of distinguished scientists and engineers from academia, government and industry for the purpose of exploring the role of advanced digital signal processing techniques in (discrete, spatially sampled) coherent imaging systems. The workshop will meet for two and a half days to assess and document current advances and recommend potential future research and development opportunities.\r\n",
