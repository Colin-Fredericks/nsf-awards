Beck's Cognitive Therapy\"\r\n\r\nThis postdoctoral fellowship will enable the co-Principal Invesitiagtor to focus on the history of the relationship among religious, scientific and medical impulses in twentieth century American psychotherapy. Her research will examine the history of Aaron T. Beek's Cognitive Therapy, the most popular form of psychotherapeutic practice to emerge in the last thirty years. She will explore how cognitive therapy preaches a philosophy of spiritual growth based on the virtues of being a rational scientist in one's own mental laboratory while offering \"scientific proof\" that it can reduce symptoms quickly.  The Co-Principal Invesitiagtor will also develop a new course on the history of psychotherapy that will compare dominant therapeutic techniques with the moral treatises that their practitioners offer in the name of science, medicine, and mental health, and place these ideas within the broader cultural concerns of their time. Finally, she will participate in developing the framework for an interdlisciplinary conference on transformative experiences of  pain. The conference will bring together neurologists, psychiatrists, and religious practitioners in an effort to compare religious and medical philosophies of pain and its management. Both of these training projects will allow her to learn about the cultural history of psychotherapy that in a manner that extends beyond her graduate training in clinical psychology and the history of psychology.\r\n",
