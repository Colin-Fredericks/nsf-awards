 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future generation mobile communication systems are expected to provide high data rates and support a wide variety of services including voice, video and interactive multimedia. Unless batteries in the mobile communicators are used in the most efficient possible manner, power limitations will become a bottleneck in developing communication systems that can provide such services.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project considers the problem of making highly efficient use of power in wireless multiple-access communications. To this end, a unified theory of multiuser receiver design and power control is being sought. The analytical tools and concepts necessary for a systematic development of such a theory are being obtained. The objective of the project is to ultimately obtain solutions for complex and realistic channel models that will make it possible to practically realize the superior potential of systems that adopt a combined approach to multiuser receiver design and power control. Efficient use of battery power translates into longer lasting (without recharge), lighter, and hence more portable, hand-held and lap-top communication devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevel of Effort:\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recommended level of support, The PI will make every attempt to meet the original scope and level of effort of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
