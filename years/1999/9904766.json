 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of gene expression in bacteria by the accumulation of extracellular chemical signals has been termed quorum sensing or autoinduction.  Quorum sensing regulates a number of metabolic processes including differentiation, competence, conjugation, virulence, and biofilm formation.  The chemical signals mediating this response include peptides, proteins and N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone.  In Escherichia coli, the role of quorum sensing in the regulation of gene expression is largely unknown.  The focus of these studies is to identify the genes regulated by quorum sensing in E. coli and to use biochemical and genetic approaches to dissect the pathways mediating the quorum sensing responses.  To identify genes regulated by quorum sensing, gene fusions with a reporter transposon will be analyzed to identify those fusions activated at high density or by conditioned medium from stationary phase cells.  Genes so identified will then be sequenced.  Biochemical approaches will be employed to purify the extracellular factors mediating the quorum sensing response. Structural characterizations will be carried out by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and peptide sequencing.  To identify genes involved in the production and responses to the extracellular factors, genetic approaches will be used to identify mutants with altered expression of the signaling components.  An additional focus of the project is to define the relationship between quorum sensing and stationary phase physiology of E. coli. The project will contribute significantly to our basic understanding of quorum sensing and stationary phase physiology in E. coli and many other species of bacteria.",
