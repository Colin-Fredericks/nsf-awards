 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Workshop on Seismic Isolation, Energy Dissipation, and Control is being organized as part of the US-China Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III on May 18-20, 1999, in Guangzhou, China.  This workshop will bring together researchers from the areas of base-isolation, passive energy dissipation and control, three of the most important and promising technologies for development of the next generation of seismically resistant structures.  The unique feature of this workshop is that the focus will be on the integration of these technologies to produce the most cost effective and versatile seismic protective systems.  There is a considerable amount of new construction as well as retrofitting of existing structures throughout China, and the Chinese Ministry of Construction has been quick to embrace the implementation of new technologies that will enhance the performance and/or safety of its infrastructure.  Holding the Workshop in Guangzhou will allow researchers to personally examine and discuss these implementations with the Chinese engineers and researchers.  Travel of approximately 10 researchers from the United States to participate in this workshop will be supported under this project.\r\n\r\nThis is US-PRC Earthquake Protocol, Annex III activity.\r\n \r\n",
