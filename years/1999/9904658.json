A paradigm for adaptive responses has emerged called two-component regulatory systems.  In its simplest form, a two-component system contains a sensor and a response regulator.  Changes in the environment result in the phosphorylation of the sensor followed by trans-phosphorylation of the response regulator.  The two-component system which is the focus of this research consists of EnvZ, the sensor and OmpR, the response regulator.  OmpR regulates the porin genes in response to changes in osmolarity of the growth medium.  At low osmolarity, the major porin in the outer membrane is OmpF and at higher osmolarity, ompF is repressed and ompC is activated.  A model arising from genetic studies predicts that phospho-OmpR (OmpR-P) binds with high affinity to activate ompF and with low affinity to repress ompF and activate ompC. Recently published work indicates that this currently accepted hypothesis cannot account for porin gene regulation.  In this current work, the amino acids in OmpR that contact the DNA specifically will be determined. Preliminary studies suggest that OmpR may be in a different conformation when bound at ompF compared to ompC.  The role of various bases in conferring high affinity DNA binding at OmpR binding sites will be examined.  Information gained in studying the porin regulon is relevant to systems in animal cells in which transmembrane signaling-dependent changes in kinase activity result in a phosphorylation cascade and ultimately to changes in gene expression.  It is also relevant to pathogenic systems that use two-component systems to modulate their virulence properties.\r\n",
