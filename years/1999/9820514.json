 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Undergraduate Neuroscience Program at Duke University plans a summer research program for undergraduates who will have the opportunity to become involved in neuroscience research at a major research university. Research and training experiences will be organized around the theme of \"Mechanisms of Behavior\". The emphasis on integrative, systems, and behavioral neuroscience that unifies faculty research interests within this interdisciplinary field at Duke serves as the common theme for the individual projects available to student participants in the program. The focus of the ten-week summer program for each student will be a research mentorship with a participating faculty member. Two weekly seminar series - \"Research in the Neuroscience\" and \"Science Basics\" - will be included in the summer schedule. \"Research in the Neuroscience\" will focus on ongoing faculty research so those students in the program gain exposure to the field of neuroscience research beyond their mentor's specific interests. \"Science Basics\" will address practical matters pertaining to science careers. The summer program will begin with a two-day familiarization retreat and will close with a research forum. Applications to participate in \"Mechanisms in Behavior\" will be accepted from sophomore undergraduates. The Program is especially interested in receiving applications from women and minorities as well as undergraduates at liberal arts colleges.",
