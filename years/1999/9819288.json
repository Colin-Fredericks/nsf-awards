This Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12, project builds upon the successful work of the Colorado State Systemic Initiative and TEAM 2000, a high school Teacher Enhancement project.  \r\n\r\nMiddle schools whose students attend high schools implementing the Interactive Mathematics Program as part of Colorado's TEAM 2000 project serve as COMMSTEP primary target schools.  Major components of the project include (1) examination and selection of materials, choosing from among Connected Mathematics, Mathscape:  Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, and Mathematics in Context; (2) annual summer institutes; (3) monthly or quarterly workshops during the school year; and (4) monthly meetings with COMMSTEP teacher mentors and on-line telecommunications support.  \r\n\r\nOver the life of the project, the entire mathematics faculties in partnering middle schools participate in COMMSTEP.  Sixth-grade teachers attend a two-week summer institute followed by nine monthly workshops, and fully implement their school's chosen instructional materials during their first year of participation.  Seventh- and eighth-grade teachers phase-in their school's materials over a two-year period.  These teachers attend one-week summer institutes followed by four quarterly workshops for two years.  All middle grades teachers receive two years of workshop and mentor support.    \r\n\r\nIn addition to the required LSC core evaluation, the project collects two other important kinds of data:  (1) student achievement data and (2) data that describe the district's capacity to support high quality mathematics curriculum and teaching (e.g., the district's capacity to support reform-oriented classroom practices), comparing COMMSTEP schools/districts with other school districts.\r\n\r\nCost sharing, which approximates 83% of the NSF request, is derived primarily from state and local district funds.  Total commitments from partner schools are expected to exceed 92% of the NSF request.  \r\n",
