This system will involve two main components:  (1)  A Femtosecond Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) systems which is broadly tunable from 240 nm to 2.7 microns, and (2) a low-temperature scanned probe (CryoSXM) microscope with drive electronics.  This system will achieve both ultrafast (<200 fs) time-resolution and sub-micron (<100 to 500 nm) spatial resolution.  \r\n\r\nThis instrument will be used to study directly the nature of the electronic states of excitons confined to self-assembled CdSe quantum dots (SAQDs).  Recent experiment by our groups and others in Germany and Japan have suggested strongly that the structure of the CdSe dots and their electronic excitations are significantly different than observed in the prototypical InAs/GaAs quantum dots.  Such differences are not unexpected as II-VI materials as a group are more polar, with larger excitonic effects, more prominent electron-phonon interactions, and the valence band offsets are significantly smaller than for the III-V materials.\r\n\r\nResearch to be undertaken includes:\r\n\r\n(i) Nano-scale mapping of the CdSe dots;\r\n(ii) Time-resolved Photoluminescence Excitation (PLE); \r\n(iii) Magneto-Photoluminescence of Single Quantum Dots; \r\n(iv) Time-resolved Transport Measurements; and \r\n(v) Exciton Spin-Relaxation of Single Quantum Dots.\r\n\r\nAcess to this state-of-the-art equipment will also provide significant new training opportunities for undergraduate students participating in these areas.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will provide the investigators with significantly increased capabilities to investigate the properties of self assembled quantum dots, and train students in a very important area of materials research and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
