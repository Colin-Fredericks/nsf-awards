Although heavy tailed \r\ndistributions are increasingly being used to model phenomena in \r\na wide range of applications in economics, finance, signal \r\nprocessing, telecommunication network analysis, time series, \r\nphysical and biological provblems, progress in this area has been \r\nlimited by the lack of efficient and reliable methods of modeling, \r\nanalyzing and predicting for such models.  In the past decade, \r\nthere has been significant progress in both the theory and methods \r\nof working with non-Gaussian models.  This conference will bring \r\ntogether many of the top theoreticians and practitioners,\r\nnational and interenational, working in the field of heavy-tailed, \r\nnon-Gaussian models and those with experience with massive \r\ndata sets.  The invited list of speakers includes four women.  \r\nSupport for graduate students and young investigators is provided \r\nwith reduced registration fees.  \r\n",
