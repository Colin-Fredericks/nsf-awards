 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with techniques for supporting integrated services over a wireless cellular network.  A fundamental problem is how to allocate radio resources to different users to optimize an overall network objective criterion while satisfying Quality of Service constraints.  Wireless networks based on Direct-Sequence (DS)-Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks are considered, since DS-CDMA is a strong contender for next generation cellular systems.  Radio ``resources'' in a DS-CDMA network include transmitted powers, processing gains, and number of assigned codes.  The focus of this research is on Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in the presence of time-varying user requests.  The goals are to (1) Develop techniques for DRA given multiple traffic flows with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and (2) Characterize performance/complexity tradeoffs associated with\r\nthese techniques given simple traffic and propagation models.\r\n\r\nThe investigators consider a series of problems and approaches for DRA  in a CDMA network based on progressive refinements of the system model. First, they consider a single class of data traffic flows within an isolated cell.  Reliability is assumed to be guaranteed through retransmissions, and DRA is studied\r\nin the presence of time-selective fading. Two traffic flows, representative of voice and data, are then introduced (in the absence of fading), and the relationship between reassignment of resources and admission control is studied.  DRA in a multi-cell system is also considered taking into account measurement-based power constraints which limit interference to other cells.  Finally, pricing is investigated as a method for DRA which accounts for user utilities. Methods for dynamic pricing are studied in the context of the models previously described.\r\n\r\n",
