 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860220\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop microsensors for determination and control of air quality in building environments.  By one estimate, about two million commercial buildings have been reported to exhibit poor indoor air quality, which adversely affects fourteen million workers. Additionally, poor indoor air quality also has been identified to be responsible for over 125 million lost school days and over 10 million lost workdays per year. Clearly, there is a need for reliable technologies that can cost-effectively determine, control, and improve  indoor air quality. This project seeks to develop non-stoichiometric, semiconductor-based sensors incorporating unique nanoscale materials (i.e., those materials with grain sizes less than 100 nanometers) for detecting one of the most prevalent VOCs that adversely affects indoor air quality, namely formaldehyde.  During Phase I, Nanomaterials Research Corporation will determine optimum sensor compositions, address fabrication issues, characterize performance, and establish proof-of-concept that nano-precision-engineered sensors can be retrofitted into existing HVAC equipment.  The Phase II effort will seek to optimize the technology and produce prototypes for customer qualification. Phase III will commercialize the technology.\r\n     The  research would provide robust sensors for determination and control of air quality. The effort will also help enable prevention of air quality problems in industrial buildings, homes, automobiles, and civic buildings.\r\n\r\n",
