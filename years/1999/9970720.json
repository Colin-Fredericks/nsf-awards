 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, cluster and LAN interconnection networks are being called upon to support distributed access to multimedia data sets with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. The objective of this research is to develop effective architectural solutions that enable QoS guarantees for multimedia traffic in cluster/LAN interconnection networks. The core challenge of the research work is to develop effective high speed QoS schedulers capable of making decisions across a large number of multimedia connections in tens of nanoseconds: QoS scheduling decisions at cut-through latencies. These objectives will be pursued by the design and detailed simulation of the architecture of a single-chip router optimized for multimedia applications. The innovative aspects of the router architecture concern a novel priority biasing scheme and the use of flow control\r\nfor dynamic bandwidth allocation. Around these techniques are constructed new buffering, bandwidth allocation, and flow control schemes. Important research contributions of the program will include (i) router architectures that support QoS scheduling at cut-though latencies, (ii) understanding of effective architectural techniques for constructing high speed schedulers, and (ii) solutions to difficult problems of high speed hardware resource management and scheduling.\r\n",
