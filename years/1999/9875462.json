The ultimate goal of the research is to develop new polymer processing technology for online customization of the properties of the final product by varying the processing conditions during extrusion and molding.  The inverted fringe-effect microdielectric sensing with controlled depth of field penetration is a novel approach for measuring spatially resolved properties of a material in a direction normal to the interface.  In the proposed approach, methods for inferring MWD online from dielectric measurements will be based on theoretical modeling of polymer relaxation in electromagnetic fields and on statistical correlation methods.  Theoretical and experimental studies will be followed by the development of advanced process control systems, which will enable online polymer customization by varying conditions during processing.  The educational program is aimed at creating a balanced undergraduate process control curriculum, which includes project-based hands-on experience in implementing practical control systems in laboratory settings.\r\n",
