As a river meanders, a system of ridges and depressions develops that creates new open soil areas. A spatially structured landscape may favor a particular type of seed dispersal system. This study will combine field data and modeling to investigate the role of bats as dispersal agents: do they confer advantage by distance (colonization) or by the specificity of seed deposition (directed dispersal)?  Field studies will investigate: (1) spatial relationships of habitat types and rate of new habitat creation by the river; (2) recruitment requirements, rates of survival, growth and reproduction of  C. brasiliense, in study plots of differing habitat types; (3) seed deposition patterns created by bats, including direct observations and radio telemetry.  \r\n\r\nThe benefit that bats provide to large-seeded tropical tree species has never been thoroughly studied, even though many large-seeded tropical trees depend on bats to disperse their seeds. Tropical rainforest dynamics driven by river meanders have received much less study than tree-fall gap dynamics, although river meanders may be a predominant cause of successional processes throughout the Amazon basin. Understanding dispersal, recruitment and demography of C. brasiliense will have applications to its exploitation as a sustainable timber resource. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
