 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research funded by this award will investigate how people learn new\r\ncategories of perceptual objects and events. Categorization is a cognitive\r\nprocess of fundamental importance that all people perform countless times\r\nevery day. It allows people to read, to select foods that are safe to eat,\r\nto use objects and tools in the environment, and to recognize friends and\r\nkin. Unfortunately, it is also a fragile process, in the sense that a\r\nnumber of normal and pathological conditions have been shown to cause\r\ncategory learning deficits. These include normal aging, major depression,\r\nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, strokes,\r\nand schizophrenia.  Previous theories of category learning were tested\r\nprimarily on categorization data from healthy university students. To\r\nunderstand category learning in these neglected populations requires an\r\nunderstanding of the brain structures and pathways that mediate this\r\nimportant skill. Toward this end, this research will test and extend the\r\nfirst neuropsychological theory of category learning, called COVIS\r\n(COmpetition between Verbal and Implicit Systems; Ashby, Alfonso-Reese,\r\nTurken, & Waldron, 1998, Psychological Review, 105, 442-481), which assumes\r\nthat category learning is a competition between separate explicit and\r\nimplicit categorization systems. The explicit system is under conscious\r\ncontrol and engages in a systematic process of hypothesis testing or\r\nrule-based reasoning. The implicit system, which is largely not accessible\r\nto conscious awareness, engages in a form of procedural learning. Ashby et\r\nal. (1998) developed a formal version of COVIS that makes precise\r\nquantitative predictions in a wide variety of categorization tasks, and\r\nalso a neuropsychological version that describes the underlying neural\r\nmechanisms and pathways that are assumed to mediate category learning. The\r\ncurrent research includes many new experiments with healthy young adults\r\nthat were motivated by the COVIS theory. Some experiments will test the\r\nCOVIS assumption that normal category learning is a competition between\r\nfunctionally separate explicit and implicit systems. Many of the\r\nexperiments will isolate the explicit system and investigate its\r\nproperties, including the rules that govern how it learns, both with and\r\nwithout trial-by-trial feedback about response accuracy. Finally, many\r\nanalogous experiments will attempt to achieve the same goals with the\r\nimplicit system (i.e., isolate it and investigate its properties). The\r\ncompletion of these studies will not only provide a rigorous test of COVIS,\r\nbut regardless of their outcome, it will also provide valuable new insights\r\ninto the perceptual and cognitive processes and the underlying neural\r\nmechanisms and pathways that mediate one of the most basic of all human\r\nacts - grouping objects and events in the environment by category.\r\n\r\n",
