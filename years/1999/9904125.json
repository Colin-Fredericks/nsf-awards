 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bert Holmes of the University of North Carolina at Asheville is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in a RUI award to study the unimolecular decomposition reactions of chemically activated haloalkanes, haloalcohols, and haloethers in the gas phase.  The primary project objective is to determine experimentally the unimolecular rate constants, reaction mechanisms, and branching ratios for reactions of chemically activated compounds.  As well, ab initio calculations will be conducted for these three classes of compounds that will improve the understanding of the relevant transition state structures.  The overall outcomes are expected to elucidate substituent effects and structure-reactivity relationships, and improve the fundamental understanding of the unimolecular reactions of these compounds.  Undergraduate students at UNC Asheville will participate in these research projects to develop analytical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.  The active participation of undergraduate research students is expected to strengthen the science education environment in chemistry at Holmes' institution.  \r\n\r\nStudents who are involved in significant chemical research throughout the undergraduate years gain a broader scope of challenges and the dedication required for scientific efforts while developing skills in laboratory science.  In this project, undergraduate students will have opportunities to study compounds that have found practical applications as anesthetics, lubricants, and blood substitutes. Incineration of haloalkanes is often the method selected for environmental remediation of these chemicals; the present study will also provide relevant information to understand these processes.   \r\n  \r\n",
