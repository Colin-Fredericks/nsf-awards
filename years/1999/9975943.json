 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975943\r\nMarcus\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide partial support for the acquisition of a new design of dilution refrigerator that uses a pair of computer-controlled sorption pumps to achieve millikelvin temperatures with reasonable cooling power (> 50m W at 100mK), without the use of external mechanical pumps to circulate the 3He/4He mixture.  This novel design offers greatly simplified operation, and the possibility of significantly reduced vibrational heating.  Both of these features are important to the research and educational programs in our laboratory, as described below.  The best-supported and most reliable version of this new design includes a vapor shielded dewar, 10/12 T superconducting magnet, gas handling, and control electronics.  Two new research projects will benefit directly from the new dilution refrigerator.  (1) Adiabatic Quantum Pumping of Charge; and (2) Nanoscale Electroplating.\r\n\r\nThe dilution refrigerator will be located in the expanded laboratory facilities in the Laboratory for Advanced Materials to assure that both graduate and undergraduate students have an opportunity to run their own experiment.  \"Run\" in this sense typically means fabricate their own samples, usually using the NSF Stanford Notification Facility-several undergraduates from our lab in fact now have user grants in this facility-carry out the low-temperature measurements, analyze the data, compare to theory, and write up a report, presumably for publication.\r\n\r\nThe equipment will significantly enhance the research capabilities and educational opportunities of faculty and students.\r\n",
