An additional two years of support will be provided by the University of Minnesota following expiration of this award.  This is a Phase II technician support grant under the Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program and follows three years of Phase I support (EAR-9526239).  Phase I support for a technician for the MRPL under the direction of Profs. Karato and Kohlstedt contributed to the improved operation of the laboratory including training of graduate students, installation of new experimental facilities and maintenance and development of new experimental techniques. As a result, the MRPL is now capable of conducting a range of experimental studies including ultra-high pressure deformation, large strain shear deformation under high P-T conditions, experiments on kinetic properties under well-controlled thermodynamic conditions.  Continued support of this technical position will allow this group to expand collaborative research with outside investigators, and will permit the technician, Dr. Mark Zimmerman, to develop new experimental techniques such as deformation experiments under lower mantle conditions, and to install new facilities including controlled pore-fluid pressure in a gas-medium deformation apparatus.  All of the experimental facilities at the MRPL continue to be used extremely productively by Karato and Kohlstedt to improve our understanding of the rheology of deep mantle phases, the physical controls on seismic wave propagation through deep earth materials, and the relationship between melt distribution and rheology of oceanic lithosphere at spreading centers.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
