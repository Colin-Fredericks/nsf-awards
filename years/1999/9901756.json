 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an all solid-state, compact high-efficiency, broadly tunable, single-frequency infrared laser source.  In Phase I a continuous-wave (cw), room-temperature Cr2+:ZnSe laser was demonstrated that was continuously tunable from 2138 to 2760 nm without any active cooling.  This is the broadest wavelength tuning yet demonstrated from any room temperature, cw laser.  Additionally, the laser demonstrated an absorbed power slope efficiency as high as 63% - which rivals that of the best solid-state lasers yet reported.  In Phase II,  CTI and Fisk University (a HBCU/Ml) researchers will further investigate this laser material and better characterize the formation of the laser active Cr2+ ion in the ZnSe, host.  Additionally, direct cw diode pumping of this material and single frequency laser operation will be demonstrated for the first time.  Laser output power will be scaled by an approximate order of magnitude.  A variety of laser designs, a novel tuning mechanism, and modelocked laser operation will be explored as well.  The result will be a unique laser that will be an alternative to cryogenic color-center lasers and diode-pumped-solid-state laser- pumped-monlinear-frequency-converters (such as optical parametric oscillators) for tunable 2 to 3 mm laser applications.\r\n     The laser source will provide an elegant solution to many near-infrared laser needs.  Applications include high-resolution optical spectroscopy, vibrometry, remote sensing of several important atmospheric chemicals, ultrafast studies, and medical science.\r\n",
