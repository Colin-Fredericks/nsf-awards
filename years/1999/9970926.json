The project involves the mathematical foundation of the notion of virtual topological numbers as used in mathematical physics.  The work will follow up recent progress on the virtual enumeration of curves in projective manifolds.  In related work, Prof. Li will study Gromov-Witten invariants via degeneration. Methods similar to these should yeild computational tools to help study mirror symmetries.  Finally Prof. Li will also try to generalize Gromov-Witten  invariants to varieties over fields of positive characteristic. \r\n\r\nThis project is in the important mathematical field known as Algebraic Geometry.  This modern view of curves and surfaces, generalizes these important concrete geometric objects into very abstract algebraic constructs.  The counter-intuitive notion that things become easier to deal with when they become more abstract and complicated has been part of mathematics for centuries.  In the 20-th century, this idea led to the development of algebraic geometry and has produced important new results in geometry, number theory, and analysis.  Our increased understanding of the tools of algebraic geometry has had practical application in areas from security and communication to robotics and manufacturing.  In recent years, theoretical physicists and mathematicians realized that the physicists had been developing their own form of algebraic geometry for several years.  Professor Li's project is to help reconcile the two views and to make the techniques and discoveries of both sides available to the other.\r\n",
