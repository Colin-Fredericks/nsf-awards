 "awd_abstract_narration": "Connectivity and Minors in Graph Theory\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nConnectivity is one of the most fundamental characteristics of   graphs. Almost all problems in graph theory, including various   coloring problems, routing problems, and embedding problems are very   closely related to connectivity. However, connectivity is not   preserved under most graph operations which are usually needed in   studying graphs. Thus, knowing how to perform these operations, in   particular, minor operations, while maintaining the connectivity is   a very important and fundamental problem facing graph theorists   today. In this project, the PI proposes to investigate three (sets   of) problems on graph connectivity. Instead of concentrating on   local properties like the existence of contractible edges, these   problems are more concerned with global structure of k-connected   graphs. The PI's first problem is a Ramsey-type problem which   basically says that a large complete-bipartite-graph-minor is   unavoidable from every highly connected large graph. Problem two is   about fixing the connectivity of a minor. It seeks the best function   f(k,m) for which, if G is a minor of a k-connected graph H, then H   has a k-connected minor H' with at most f(k,|E(G)|) edges such that   H' also contains G as a minor. The third problem in this project is   a conjecture which asserts that the graph version of Seymour's   splitter theorem can be extended from 3-connected graphs to   k-connected graphs for all k.\r\n\r\nAll these proposed problems are important and fundamental. Their   solutions will provide powerful new tools for dealing with high   connectivity, and that will affect many areas of graph theory. For   instance, these solutions could have a big impact on problems like   characterizing K(6)-minor-free graphs and Petersen-minor-free   graphs, two well-known open problems in graph theory. Moreover, this   study is also very important from the point of view of   applications. It could bring new insights on improving network   reliability and network security.\r\n",
