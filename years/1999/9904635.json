 "awd_abstract_narration": "9904635  \r\nWild\r\n\r\n The widespread use of organophosphorus (OP) neurotoxins poses an environmental challenge for remediation.  The organophosphate degrading gene of Pseudomonas diminuta encodes the metalloenzyme organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) which catalyzes the breakdown of OP neurotoxins including the phosphorus-fluorine bond of Soman and Sarin, and the phosphothioates such as VX, although at very low rates.  The ability to improve the rate of  P-S bond hydrolysis will have implications in bioremediation of extremely toxic neurotoxins.  The broad substrate specificity and hydrolytic efficiency (108-109 s-1M-1 for paraoxon) make OPH suitable for bioremediation technologies. The rate of phosphothioate bond hydrolysis has been improved up to thirty-fold using site-directed mutagenesis.  However, these enzymes show significant reductions in conformational stability.  This research has three goals:  1) Further enhancement of enzyme activity and specificity.  2) Determination of the three-dimensional structure of these enzymes.  3) Investigation of the thermodynamic stability of catalytically important variants and modification of enzyme properties for enhanced stability. Site-specific mutagenesis, protein crystallography and equilibrium and thermal denaturation studies are the basic techniques used.  The requirement for new remediation technologies and the remarkable characteristics of OPH combine to form a biochemical framework for the design of new and improved OPH enzymes.\r\n\r\nFederal, state, and local authorities are concerned about the use of nerve agents in acts of domestic terrorism and are desperately searching for useful countermeasures.  A remarkable enzyme isolated from a common soil bacterium, Pseudomonas diminuta, can detoxify some of the most deadly chemical warfare agents, including VX and Sarin, the nerve agent used in the Tokyo subway incident.  However, the enzyme is not very efficient in degrading these compounds.  This research is tailored to significantly enhance the catalytic capability of OPH for organophosphorus neurotoxins suitable for bioremediation technologies.\r\n\r\n",
