 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has been proposed  for the next generation multimedia wireless networks.  Originally developed for channels with wide bandwidth at  high signal-to-noise ratio, ATM in a wireless environment  faces the difficult challenge that wireless channels are  time varying. The success of wireless ATM, to a great  extent, hinges upon the design of adaptive receivers that  are able to mitigate time varying channel impairments.  This research focuses on adaptive signal processing  techniques for channel estimation and equalization in an  asynchronous time division multiple access (TDMA) network.  The objective of the investigation is to explore new  approaches that minimize the overhead associated with the  transmission of training signals. By exploiting jointly the  structure of the data packet (e.g. ATM cell), the protocol  of medium access control, and spatial-temporal diversities  of the signal, the investigators are developing new channel  estimation and equalization algorithms that have rapid  convergence rates and low power VLSI implementation.",
