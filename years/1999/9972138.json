The theoretical research at Harvard will be done in collaboration with experiments at MIT.  The thermo-mechanical response of disordered gels and networks plays a central role in materials science, polymer physics and biology, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms which underly it.  A remarkable enhancement in elasticity, toughness, and yield strain has been observed in experimental studies of crosslinked random heteropolymers (RHP), e.g., vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), in contrast with its unvulcanized form.  However, a fundamental understanding of the role played by synthesis conditions, sequence heterogeneity and thermodynamical control variables in determining the network mechanical response is still lacking. \r\n\r\nA broad plan of activities that combine both theory and experiment for affecting an understanding of the complex response processes that occur in chemically disordered gels will be undertaken.  First, a statistical mechanical theory for the design of chemically disordered gels that consistently accounts for synthesis conditions will be developed.  The theory will be used to study the origin of the complex thermo-mechanical responsiveness observed in chemically disordered gels.  The goal is to develop and fully characterize the phase diagram of RHP gels at arbitrary synthesis, strain conditions, and final gel states.  The phase diagram will serve as a guide for a full understanding of thermo-mechanical properties of the RHP gels.\r\n\r\nThe theory will be applied to the following experimental scenarios: (1) The synthesis of chemical RHP gels, crosslinked at high temperatures, followed by annealing of the gel; (2) The synthesis of RHP gels at low crosslinking temperatures and heated post-synthesis; (3) RHP crosslinking near the microphase ordering transition of the pre-gel state, followed by annealing of the gel.  The role played by synthesis, thermodynamic, and molecular control variables in shaping the RHP gel phase diagram will be addressed. \r\n\r\nAlso, detailed theoretical predictions will be outlined for the following set of experiments to analyze thermo-mechanical response of RHP gels: (1) RHP chemical gel low-temperature synthesis, followed by measurements of gel volume variations on heating; (2) RHP chemical gel crosslinking carried out in the strained state, followed by the heating/annealing of the RHP gel.  The role of solvent quality variations (especially electrostatic interactions) and thermodynamical control variables, sequence statistics, and syntheisis conditions in shaping the mechanical response of RHP gels will be addressed.  In particular, physical conditions which determine the order of the multiple volume transitions observed experimentally will be addressed. \r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research on the thermo-mechanical response of disordered gels and networks.
