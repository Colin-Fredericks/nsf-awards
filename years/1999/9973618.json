 "awd_abstract_narration": "People often make decisions in which they regret their actions, because another choice would have led to a better outcome.  Students might regret not studying harder for a class if their final grade is low and that of a close classmate who did study hard is high, or managers might regret investments in a business strategy that fails to produce forecasted results if a competitor's strategy produces superior results.  From the first time a child touches a hot pan on the stove with her bare hands, she begins experiencing regret.  The feelings from these experiences affect future decisions that people make.  The study of the effects regret has on decision-making is in its infancy and offers promise as a significant area of research within the general field of decision-making.  Research on regret has vast implications in other related fields, such as organizational learning, knowledge management/knowledge creation, and business strategy. \r\n\r\nThis research will investigate the frequently observed phenomenon that people regret decisions to act more than decisions not to act that produce the same negative outcome.  For example, parents face a dilemma when deciding whether or not to vaccinate their child, because there is a small risk that the child will contract the disease due to the vaccination and a somewhat higher risk of contracting the disease if they do not vaccinate.  The majority of parents surveyed stated that they would regret a decision to vaccinate more than a decision not to vaccinate if their child contracted the disease.  This research will investigate whether this result is affected by the perceived responsibility of the decision-maker; perhaps parents feel more responsible when deciding to vaccinate than they do when deciding not to vaccinate.  The research will also examine the impact of social norms on regret; it may be the case that a strong norm to vaccinate children may reverse this result and cause parents to regret a decision not to vaccinate more than a decision to vaccinate when their child contracts the disease.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, this research will examine how regret affects group decision-making.  Previous research on individual decision-making indicates that people will choose options that minimize potential regret (e.g., not to sell a failing stock for fear that it will increase in value soon after it would be sold).  However, no research has examined if this same result applies to groups.  Since groups, not individuals, make most major business-related decisions, it is important to address this issue.  \r\n\r\nThis POWRE Grant will assist the investigator, one of very few female ethnic minority professors in management, in her effort to become a leader in the field.  It will also assist her in serving as a mentor and role model to other women and minorities.\r\n",
