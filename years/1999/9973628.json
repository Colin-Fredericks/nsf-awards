The aim of these collaborations is to interpret the theories and create observational diagnostics, taking advantage of results from computer models and data from observations.  The diagnostics will allow the discrimination between theoretical models and will finally identify the region in the star-plus-disk system where the stellar wind is formed. \r\n\r\nA deeper knowledge of the different theoretical frameworks, and of the wind structures that they predict, will be acquired.  The results from the models of theoretical structures will be combined with powerful radiative transfer methods to develop spectral diagnostics, which will allow the effective identification of the region of formation of the wind in young accreting objects. Visits to experts in the field, such as F. Shu at the University of California - Berkeley, R. Pudritz at McMaster University, and A. Konigl at the University of Chicago, will be carried out to discuss research results and plan future research projects. There will also be an active collaboration with Paola D'Alessio in Mexico concerning the development of detailed vertical structure disk models. \r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of International Programs, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
