The 14 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet will be used in fundamental studies of correlated electron effects, magnetism, and superconductivity in low-dimensional materials; metalloproteins; materials synthesis and processing of magnetic semiconductors and superconductors; and materials science education.  The requested magnet will be used for experiments below 14 T, while higher field experiments will be carried out at the NHMFL.\r\n\r\nResearch activities which require the high field magnet include:  (I) characterization of molecular beam epitaxy grown ferromagnetic semiconductor structures; (II) magnetic field quenching of metallic 2 dimensional electronic state; (III) electrodynamic studies of magnetic and superconductor materials; (IV) optical studies of correlated 2 dimensional systems in high magnetic fields; (V) biaxially textured superconducting films using magnetic fields; and (VI) high-field electron spin resonance studies of metalloproteins and biological systems.\r\n\r\nAdvanced graduate students and postdocs will do the majority of the work.  As part of their education and training, they will be primary authors in archival publications, attend scientific meetings to present research results and interact with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will carry out smaller projects.  Some of these will be done while working full-time for half-year periods in Northeastern's Co-op Program.\r\n%%%\r\nThis equipment will enable cutting-edge research to be advances, and provide invaluable training for students at all levels.\r\n",
