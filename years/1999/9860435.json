 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860435\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the brazing of silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic components together for use at high temperature.  Thermodynamically, many devices such as heat engines operate most efficiently at high temperature.   Although SiC has the performance characteristics that make it attractive for extreme conditions, the high cost of producing complex components necessitates a reliable joining process by which a part can endure long term exposure to harsh conditions.  Traditional joining technologies, such as brazing, tend to form brittle phases within the joint due to excessive diffusion of elements between the silicon carbide and the braze foil metals.  Phase I will use a multilayer braze foil whose composition resists influx of Si, and forms diffusion barriers within the joint during the brazing process.  The resulting joint is expected to remain immune to decomposition and formation of brittle phases during long term exposure at temperatures above 1OOO degrees Centigrade.\r\n     Commercial applications are anticipated in the production of complex components for high temperature environments such as those associated with combustion chambers, gas turbines, and heat exchangers.\r\n",
