 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grammar and word structure (morphology) of the Navajo language is by far the most completely documented of any language indigenous to the Americas and indeed one of the most completely documented in the world.  In addition, Navajo is a language type that is unusual in the complexity of its morphology.  Notwithstanding the advanced state of knowledge of the grammar and morphology of Navajo, there is very little discussion in the scientific literature of the phonetics of the language's sound system. While many other languages, like English, have benefited from decades of research on their sound and speech systems, similar work on Navajo and other indigenous languages is virtually nonexistent.  This research will be an instrumental study of the baseline phonetic properties of the Navajo language's sound system.  It will consist of fieldwork, in which recordings will be collected from native speakers of Navajo.  Analysis of these data will result in a monograph on the sound system of Navajo. This monograph will provide a description of the consonant and vowel sounds and the tonal system of Navajo, as it is spoken on the Navajo reservation today.  These data and their analysis should prove useful both in classroom education (language instruction) and clinical (speech pathology and audiology) settings.  They will also broaden our knowledge of language sound systems quite different from English.  This POWRE grant will provide support at a critical point in the investigator's career.  By allowing her to complete a project begun while a Postdoctoral Fellow at UCLA, it will assist her in reestablishing herself in the field of linguistics following a three-year hiatus running a medical school laboratory in cranio-facial morphology and upper respiratory function.",
