Multicorn is the subject of this study, which is a newly discovered protease ubiquitous among Eukaryotes.  It is associated with the ability of cells to overcome the effects of partial inhibition of the proteasome, and may also play a role in the cell cycle progression. Controlled proteolysis is one of the key processes coordinating cellular physiology on the molecular level.  Irreversibility of proteolysis marks its unique position among other signals, like posttranslational modifications or oligomerization.  Large, multisubunit proteolytic complexes are especially well suited to serve as regulators because their actions can be precisely controlled by intracellular signals.  The proteasome is the best-known example of such enzymatic complexes of organelle-like status in the cell.  The proteasome is built from numerous exchangeable subunits, and its activities can be adjusted by attaching additional protein complexes. Despite numerous studies our understanding of such regulation of enzymatic activities is far from complete.  The very complicated structure of  the eukaryotic proteasome has thus far allowed only a relatively limited insight into mechanisms which govern proteasomal actions.  In  constrast, multicorn seems to be very well suited to the role as a model of a large enzymatic complex for studies on molecular regulation of its activities.  Preliminary data from the  P.I.'s lab strongly suggest that, at least partially, the multicorn activities may be modulated by its oligomerization.  The specific aims of this study are to:  I.  Clone the gene of the  fission yeast multicorn subunit and express it in homo- and heterologous systems.  II.  Study the  structural basis for functional differences between the oligomeric forms of the multicorn. III.  Identify catalytic centers and explore functional differences between oligomeric forms of the multicorn. To accomplish these goals, the multicorn from fission yeast,  Schizosaccharomyces pombe will be purified and biochemically characterized.  It was shown that the yeast multicorn exists in two stable oligomeric forms:  about 900 kDa and more than 4,000 kDa.  The two forms differ in their catalytic abilities and substrate specificities.  Both forms display peptidase activity, but only the large form is a proteinase.  Both forms have been found to be composed from a single 150 kDa polypeptide.  Multicorn activities and oligomerization status change depending on the physiological status of the cell. In the light of  the prominence of proteolysis in cellular physiology it will be very important to establish the modes of control of  the multicorn activities on the molecular level.  Results to be obtained from this study will contribute to better understanding of how large enzymatic complexes are regulated in and by the intricate web of cellular processes. It will have a broad impact on our understanding of how to manage the operation of complex biological catalysts, and how interplay of large \"protein machines\", like the multicorn and the proteasome, may affect each others' performance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProteolysis, or breaking down proteins to create proteins with new properties or to recycle the protein building blocks, is now considered one of the most important processes regulating the life of the cell.  Proteolysis is performed by  proteins called proteases, or proteolytic enzymes.  Many such enzymes act as large multisubunit complexes because this way their actions can be tightly regulated and physically separated from other vulnerable components of the cell.  Proteolysis, among other events, decides if the cell proliferates, if it overcomes the effects of environmental stress or internal abnormalities.  Explaining molecular mechanisms of proteolysis is extremely important for understanding the regulation of cellular physiology.  The aim of this project is to provide the basis for dissecting the actions and, ultimately, the biological role of a new large protease named the multicorn.  To reach the goal, the P.I. and her colleagues have purified and biochemically characterized the protease from fission yeast, and  have found that the multicorn exists in two stable forms of different size.  The unique feature of the multicorn is that, although the two forms are composed from apparently the same subunit, they differ in their abilities to break down proteins.  This property creates a potential for precise regulation of the actions of the new protease.  This is especially important because the amount and activity of the multicorn forms strongly depend on the physiological status of the yeast, which suggest that the enzyme plays a specialized role in the cell.  In this work, the molecular basis for the functional differences between the two forms of the multicorn will be established.  The knowledge gathered will contribute to better understanding of the role and actions of large proteases in the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
