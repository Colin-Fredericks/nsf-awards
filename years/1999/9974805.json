 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reeck  \r\n\r\nThe following hypothesis will be evaluated in this project: pectin-degrading enzymes are important digestive enzymes in the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae, and, by extension, in other insects containing these enzymes in their guts.  This work is based on the recent success in our laboratories in purifying rice weevil endo-polygalacturonase and pectinmethylesterase to apparent homogeneity and in cloning their encoding cDNAs.  These represent the first pectinases purified from any animal species and the first genes (cDNAs) cloned for any animal pectinases.  The hypothesis will be tested in feeding studies where inhibitors of polygalacturonase and pectinmethylesterase are incorporated into a diet from which artificial pellets will be made.  In this project, the presence of inhibitors of pectinases will be tested for their effects on oviposition within artificial seeds and on larval growth and development. Inhibitors will be added to the artificial diets over a range from 0.01% to 1% by weight.  A compound to be tested first is a peptide discovered in screening phage-display libraries for ligands or inhibitors of rice weevil pectinmethylesterase. While these tests are going on, more inhibitors will be searched for by screening other phage display libraries, a single-chain antibody library, and a chemically synthesized library containing D-amino acids (to try to prevent possible digestion of potential inhibitors in the rice weevil gut during the feeding studies).\r\n\r\nThe significance of this work is that it could lead to alternate or improved ways of controlling the attack on crop plants by certain insects.  The idea would be to genetically engineer plants to produce inhibitors of important digestive enzymes of insects.  The particular enzymes being examined in this work are called pectinases.  They degrade a structural component of plants called pectin.  Genetically engineered plants that contain pectinase-inhibitors should have increased resistance to attack by insects since the insects' attack enzymes would be inhibited.  This approach could decrease our reliance on chemical pesticides for controlling insect pests of crop plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
