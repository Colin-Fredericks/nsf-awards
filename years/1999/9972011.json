 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972011\r\nGlyde\r\n\r\nThis is a condensed matter physics project that employs inelastic neutron scattering measurements and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulation techniques to study the elementary excitations of Bose quantum liquids in disorder. Disorder is induced by confining liquid 4He  and 3He/4He mixtures in highly porous aerogel. The object is to determine the new features induced by disorder such as new low energy excitations, a gap in the dispersion curve, finite excitation lifetimes and how these features relate to the superfluid density, to Bose condensation and possible localization of the condensate. The momentum distribution and the condensate fraction in the same disordered materials will be measured and calculated independently by the same techniques. Thermodynamic and scaling properties of disordered and confined liquid 4He have been studied for 40 years, but there has been no parallel program to observe excitations. This project uses sophisticated neutron diffraction methods at the Institute Laue Langevin (Grenoble, France) and the ISIS facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Oxford, UK). The work provides excellent training for graduate students and post-doctoral associates.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project uses neutron diffraction methods to investigate the properties of liquid helium when the helium is confined in highly porous media like aerogel. The presence of the aerogel modifies the properties of the helium by restricting the 'motion' of the helium in the filamentous silica aerogel network. The propagation of sound in helium is affected, liquid motions, as well as the density of helium is affect by the silica network. The properties of helium found in the confined geometry will be compared with similar information for the bulk liquid. The information is of fundamental interest for quantum mechanics and for understanding the superfluid nature of liquid helium.
