The Principal Investigator is Dr. Issa Batarseh, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Central Florida, in Orlando, Florida.  The Jordanian organizer is Dr. Sadeq Hamed of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan.  The topics will cover: power electronics curriculum development; hardware and software laboratory development; power system, machines and power electronics interface; research needs; and industry-university collaboration.  The objectives of the five-day workshop are: (1) review and discuss the current course offerings and industry needs for power electronics engineers; (2) reach consensus on global power electronics curricula; (3) make recommendations on laboratory course outline and on hardware laboratory and computer simulation support and equipment; and (4) recommend areas for collaborative research. \r\n\r\nScope:  This project will allow eight US scientists, who are experienced in power electronics, to examine with participating scientists from Jordan the needs of training and research in power electronics, and to develop an agenda for joint research in this area.  It is expected that this effort will result in recommendations of a globally usable curriculum for training of power electronics engineers to deal with the various applications and demands of current and nascent industries.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest.  This project is co-funded by INT and the Division of Electrical and communications Systems.   \r\n",
