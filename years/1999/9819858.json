Malek, Materials Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA and Dr. Mohammed A. El Gamal, Institute of Graduate Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.  The two investigators plan to conduct research to 1) explore and provide sound scientific knowledge on the use of ground aluminum slag, a waste product in the aluminum industry, in aerated building products, and 2) investigate the fundamental reaction process, microstructural evolution and properties of the new products.  The autoclaved aerated cementitious materials (AAC) are made of cementitious mixture into which gas is produced or air is introduced so that when the mixture sets, a uniform cellular structure results.  Aluminum powder is the most commonly used gas generating material.  It reacts with lime produced during cement hydration to produce hydrogen gas. The aluminum slag will provide the aluminum needed for aeration, and other constituents (alumina and aluminum nitride) will increase the thermal inertia of the final products.  The AAC has unique properties, as its density is less than or equal to that of water and can provide a better thermal insulation.  \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience.  The planned research will support the Penn State research initiative, including the PI's current research, to expand scientific knowledge on the reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of AAC as well as maximizing the use of industrial by-products and waste.  The AAC building products are of particular interest to the hot-arid zone of the tropical climate belt such as Egypt as well as seismic areas such as the southwest of the United States.   One graduate student each from Egypt and from the United States will participate in this research.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.\r\n",
