Solomon\r\nCCR-9972232\r\n\r\nThe internet presents the potential for efficient and equitable allocation of distributed computing resources, such as high-speed computers and databases, to those best able to use them productively.  Realization of this potential requires a rotation for describing producers and consumers of resources and a mechanism for allocating them subject to bilateral constraints:  Consumers of resources may specify acceptability criteria for resources, and purveyors of resources may impose restrictions on consumers.  The Classified Advertisement language provides a precise and powerful notation for defining these constraints and the Matchmaking algorithm provides a mechanism for enforcing them.  This research improves the efficiency of Matchmaking by discovering and exploiting homogeneous properties of sets of Classified Advertisements.   It also extends the Matchmaking paradigm to \"co-matching\" to support situations in which a successful allocation required assembling a complete and consistent set of resources, each of which may impose restrictions on others in the set.  Thee enhancements are motivated by practical problems arising in the context of the Condor distributed resource management system, which is widely used by computational scientists to harness the power of idle workstations.  The results of this research will be tested by applying it directly to improve the Condor service.\r\n",
