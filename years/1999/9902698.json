The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Vanessa Z. Chan with support for twelve months to work with Professor Martin Moeller at the University of Ulm in Germany.\r\nDr. Chan will study growth and patterning of biological materials on functionalized surfaces.  Her goal is to understand the fundamental processes that govern a cell's internal response to its environment.  Cells will be cultured on biocompatible templates which are several orders of magnitude smaller than a typical cell and the responses of the cell's extracellular matrix determined by fluorescence microscopy and micromechanical measurements.  She will determine what governs adhesion behavior in a cell.  Understanding adhesion on this fundamental level will help to address questions in tumor development, metastases and wound healing.\r\n\r\nThe University of Ulm has all of the necessary facilities and equipment required for this project, as well as linkages with other European research institutions to ensure multiple collaborations.  Dr. Moller's research group has been involved in the development of new approaches to prepare nanoscopic chemical nanopattern by means of block copolymers, which is complementary to Dr. Chan's research.\r\n***\r\n",
