 "awd_abstract_narration": "9974345\r\nMitra\r\nThe purpose of the investigation is to explain the feasibility of using ultra-fast laser pulses with high energy amplified emission to generate hard, medically relevant doses of x-rays.  If shown to be feasible, it is anticipated that a time-gated x-ray technology could be developed for the imaging of phantoms that would greatly exceed the capability of conventional x-ray systems from the point of view of early detection, dosage level, and resolution.  Successful demonstration of this approach has many advantages and can be accomplished with today's laser technology:  resolution would be increased by an order of magnitude (lasers can be focused to ten microns diameter rather than tenths of a millimeter in today's X-ray tubes); an order of magnitude smaller source means that a one-tenth size smaller tumor or lesion could be found; scattering noise would be reduced by the time-gated detector thereby yielding a higher signal-to-noise ration (SNR) of the image by a factor of 5 or more.\r\n\r\nThe investigation and high risk investigation is designed to obtain fundamental knowledge needed to confirm the feasibility of the technology.  The eventual pay-off would be high in enhancing our ability to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and with a lower dose.  This investigation is funded as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).\r\n",
