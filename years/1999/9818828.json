The curriculum builds upon previously funded modules in physical science.  Informed by cognitive science research, complex realistic engineering design challenges, collaborative learning and student reflection are used to promote deep learning of essential concepts and critical thinking skills through hands-on problem solving.  Students attempt a rough solution to a design challenge.  Through class discussion, \"gallery walks\" and \"pin-ups\", students compare and contrast solutions. Students then engage in cycles of experimentation, evaluation, and revision of the design.  The earth science challenges include beach erosion and tunneling.  The life science challenge is to prepare for a long hike.  Challenges that integrate sciences are consumer science and product design.  Assessments are designed to measure student achievement on standard measures and to measure student growth on concept and skill development.  Dissemination is by commercial publisher and presentation of research on how teachers can use design to facilitate students learning of concepts.\r\n\r\n",
