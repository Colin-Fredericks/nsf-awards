The project is a joint effort of Earth Images Foundation and KTEH-TV (PBS affiliate in San Jose, CA).  The series will spotlight the adventures of earth scientists working on leading edge research projects around the world.  The pilot program features two stories, each half an hour in length.  The first story is \"Watching Mountains Grow,\" and it follows a team of geologists as they try to find out why Nanga Parbat, a remote, 26,600 foot high mountain in the Pakistani Himalayas, is the fastest-growing and fastest-eroding mountain on Earth.  The second story, \"Rock Around the Earth,\"  features geologists unveiling the mysterious processes that built Earth's crust, the foundation of all living things.\r\n\r\nThis project offers a look at a subject not often seen on television:  how working geologists approach the study of our dynamic Earth.  If the pilot is successful, there is a plentiful supply of fascinating geologic stories waiting to be told in a high-profile PBS series.  The primary audience for the pilot program, and the envisioned series, is the PBS prime time audience.  Earth Images and KTEH-TV will also attempt to have the pilot aired internationally;  its international scope will be a strong selling point with foreign program directors.  The secondary audience is students in middle and high school science classes and undergraduate earh science classes, who will be reached by educational video distributor Bullfrog Films.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
