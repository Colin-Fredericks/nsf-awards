 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe combinatorial immune response of vertebrates is a complex and precisely regulated defense system that builds upon universal mechanisms regulating cell activation and division, but incorporates the unique feature of recombination of gene segments to generate the variability which enables recognition of  diverse antigens.  In previous grants the recombinase activating gene (RAFG 1) and the  immunoglobulin genes of carcharhine sharks have been cloned and characterized by these investigators.  The immunoglobulin genes specifying shark l light chains and m and w heavy chains have been analyzed in terms of the diversity of their variable regions, the sequence and phylogenetic relationships among the constant regions, and the organization of the gene segments.   The arrangement of immunoglobulin genes in sharks differs from that of mammals in that each light chain or heavy chain gene is an individual self contained cluster unlinked to any of the others.  These investigators have cloned and sequenced the RAG 1 gene and found it homologous to counterparts in higher vertebrates and the microbial integrases.  These results, in the context of studies on the activity of the mammalian RAG1/RAG2 proteins in recombination, support the hypothesis that the combinatorial immune response of jawed vertebrates was the result of horizontal transfer of genes enabling site specific recombination of the immunoglobulin gene segments to occur (\"big bang\" hypotheses).  This project will focus upon the isolation and cloning of the shark RAG2 gene, the determination of its gene sequence and phylogenetic relationships, and the assessment of its functional activity.  Then RAG1 and RAG2 will be cloned into eucaryotic expression constructs and tested in vitro transient expression assays for RAG activity.    They will try to determine whether these RAG proteins increase junctional diversity, like RAGs in higher vertebrates.   The results of this study will provide fundamental information on the evolutionary origins and functional properties of the genes facilitating the emergence of the combinatorial immune system of vertebrates.\r\n",
