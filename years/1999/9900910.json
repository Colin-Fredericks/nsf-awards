 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although substantial variations exist in contemporary cities of the world among different economic classes of residents, public spaces often serve as locales where people with different incomes and social standing meet and interact.  Peaceful interactions among a city's diverse residents in these settings generally has been the product of the continual redefinition of historically produced rules and boundaries.  This has been especially evident in Rio de Janiero, the cosmopolitan Brazilian city whose coastal zones have been the historic site for interaction among the economical diverse residents of the city.  A dramatic rise in the crime rate and in confrontations in some mixed public areas over the last decade has raised questions as to whether recent structural changes in the world economy have adversely affected local social processes.  This doctoral dissertation research project will address those questions through the conduct of a case study of the impact of global economic changes on social conflict and cohesion associated with public spaces in Rio de Janeiro.  Research methods will draw both on large-scale economic data analyses traditionally associated with economic geography and ethnographic methods associated with anthropology, including observations, surveys, and taped interviews with individuals and groups.  This project will provide new insights into the dynamics of social and economic conflict and change in modern world cities, and it will enhance understandings of the interplay of local, national, and global processes that influence urban social order, stability, and unrest.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
