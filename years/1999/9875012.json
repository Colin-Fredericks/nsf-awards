 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Career Development Project integrates research and teaching around the theme of materials in biological experimentation. The five-year research project addresses the role of radioisotopes in postwar biomedicine, a subject that has been virtually untouched by historians of science. This study will help resolve central issues about the reconfiguration of biology after World War II, including the changing relationship between physical scientists and biologists, the degree to which postwar biomedical research corresponded to \"big science,\" and the relationship of practices in laboratory research to those of field science.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with this research project, the PI will develop two new courses to teach Princeton students about developments in postwar biology by involving them in historical research. An undergraduate seminar, \"Biology in the Atomic Age,\" will focus on the intertwined scientific and political developments in the aftermath of Hiroshima, with attention to biophysics, radiation research (including that on human subjects), and scientific assessments of environmental health and safety. Students in a graduate seminar entitled \"Postwar Biomedicine: Big Science?\" will investigate the major trends in life science after World War II, in terms of disciplines, institutions, patronage, and research practices. To complement the seminar discussions, the PI will draw a group of outstanding scholars to Princeton for a three-day workshop on postwar biomedical science. Finally, the Pis yearly lecture course on the history of biology since the Enlightenment will be redesigned around the changing materials and practices of life scientists, incorporating various instruments, organisms, and contemporary biological kits into classroom teaching.\r\n\r\nThis project will also include a second and more limited research project examining the contributions of crystallographer Rosalind Franklin to knowledge of the three-dimensional architecture of tobacco mosaic virus. In addition to enriching our understanding of molecular biology in the 1950s, this historical reassessment will provide a timely and important contribution to scholarship on women in science. The study has more immediate benefits as well:  by extending the PI's scholarship to include work on gender and science (an area in which she teaches a yearly seminar) the project will more fully integrate her teaching and research activities. This historical study grows out of her first book project, which shows how tobacco mosaic virus became an important material for biological experimentation and served as a model for biomedical and agricultural research on other viruses.\r\n",
