 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Information Theory Workshop in any specific area is held annually either in the United States of America or abroad.  In l999, there will be two workshops to be held abroad. The first one is in the area of information theory and communications and will be held in Kruger National Park, South Africa, June 20-25, l999.  The second one is in the area of information theory and networking and will be held in Metsovo, Greece June 27-July 1, l999.  The organizers of both workshops are coordinating their arrangements such that all interested participants will be able to attend both events.\r\n\r\nPapers presented in these twin workshops will be of particular importance to research and applications of interest to the National Science Foundation.  The areas covered in these twin workshops are:\r\n\r\nInformation Theory and Communications: Identification; Cryptology and communications security; Source coding theory and techniques; Modeling and performance of high speed networks; Multi-user communications; Coding and modulation for fading channels; Spread-spectrum communication theory and techniques; New results in information theory and coding.\r\n\r\nInformation Theory and networking: Network Shannon information theory; Source coding; Information theory and queuing; Fundamentals of networks; Cryptography and security; Coding and communications; Role of information theory in multimedia; Role of information theory in networking; Pricing in networks.\r\n",
