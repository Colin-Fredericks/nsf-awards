The first one is to\r\nstudy the potential function of the Bergman metric of a polarized\r\ncompact Kaehler manifold. The first several coefficients of the\r\nasymptotic expansion of Zelditch have been computed by the\r\nauthor.  The method I used is complex geometric. Comparing to the\r\nmethod using the paramatrix of the Szego kernel of the unit\r\ncircle bundle, our method is more straightforward.  We wish to\r\nhave some uniform estimates. Even in the case of complex\r\ndimension one, this problem is interesting.  In dimension two,\r\nthe problem is already complicated enough. Tian proved that there\r\nis a uniform lower bound for the multi-anticanonical bundle over\r\na Kaehler-Einstein surfaces.  In higher dimensions, the problem\r\nis very important, pointing towards the stability of\r\nmanifolds. The second one is the computation of the Futaki\r\ninvariants. This problem is related to the previous one in that\r\nthe potential function is used in the definition of the Futaki\r\ninvariants. Futaki invariants can be used not only as the\r\nobstruction towards the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metric,\r\nbut also can be used to check the stability of manifolds. Since\r\nwe are only interested in the Futaki invariants for those\r\nvarieties which are embedded into some complex projective space,\r\nit is reasonable to think that we can compute the invariants\r\nusing some \"extrinsic\" information(Such as the polynomials in\r\ndefining the varieties). In fact, in the case that the variety is\r\na complete intersection, we found a formula to calculate the\r\nFutaki invariants.  The last one is on the geometry of moduli\r\nspace of polarized Calabi-Yau manifold. A Kaehler metric on the\r\nmoduli space has been defined and was found that the Ricci\r\ncurvature of such a metric is negative away from zero by the\r\nauthor. Furthermore, if one can prove that the scalar curvature\r\nof the metric is lower bounded, one would be able to prove\r\nViehweg's compactification theorem using differential geometric\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nEinstein's general theory of relativity interprets the concept of\r\ngravity as a geometric property of space-time. The main\r\nmathematical tool to study the geometry of these spaces is\r\ndifferential geometry. Since the discovery of general relativity,\r\ndifferential geometry has been crucial to both mathematicians and\r\nphysicists. Our project is in one of the main fields in\r\ndifferential geometry, and should add to our understanding of\r\ngravity and ultimately the space we are living in.\r\n",
