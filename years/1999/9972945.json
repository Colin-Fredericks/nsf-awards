Two senior anthropologists, a post-doctoral and a graduate student researcher will draw a sample of 20 households in each of two neighborhoods in each of four cities, the regional centers of San Antonio Texas and Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and the border cities of Brownesville and Matamoros.  Scales representing economic hardship will be developed and compared for each place, and detailed economic information about income and expenditures will be developed for each household.  The researchers will study transborder processes of work and social activity, and assess the impact of the US welfare system reforms in light of the experience of Mexican families who never were involved with a comparable welfare system. The project will compare the poverty situation in each country taking into account the differing cultural expectations and resources available to households.  The resulting information will be of great value to local planners as well as to scholars studying comparable border situations in other regions and countries.\r\n",
