 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accumulating evidence indicates is that a common set of regulatory genes involved in a common, or related, set of mechanisms underlie many of the developmental processes of the metazoans studied so far.  How early did these genes arise during metazoan evolution and to what extent has their function been conserved?  A useful approach to these questions is to study such genes in a cnidarian, the first group of animals to have a defined body plan.  Among the cnidaria, hydra is particularly useful as the developmental processes are extensively understood.  The overall aim of the proposed work is to determine if the genes and mechanisms underlying axis formation and axial patterning in hydra are similar to those found vertebrates and arthropods.  The four detailed aims are the following.\r\n\r\nIn hydra, axis formation and axial patterning can be studied during the process of bud formation, the animal's asexual form of reproduction.  Two of the aims focus on clarifying aspects of bud formation.  [1] Of the three cell lineages in hydra, the two epithelial lineages [ectoderm and endoderm] play an obvious role.  A possible role of the interstitial cell lineage will be investigated by manipulations that alter or eliminate this lineage.  [2] A number of homologues of axial patterning genes found in vertebrates and Drosphila have been isolated from hydra and show to be expressed during bud formation.  More direct evidence of their particular roles will be investigated by introducing anti-sense oligonucleotides against such genes into budding tissue.\r\n\r\nThe other two aims focus on the isolation of new genes involved in axial patterning in hydra.  One approach will be to look for homologues of genes involved in dorsal-ventral patterning, which is in part, highly conserved among vertebrates and Drosophila.  The other involves using the induction of a 2nd axis in frog embryos to identify hydra genes involved in axial patterning.  Any genes isolated with either procedure will be examined for their role in axial patterning in hydra by examining their expression patterns in a variety of developmental situations as well as using the anti-sense approach to gain more direct information.\r\n\r\nThe results should extend the understanding of the evolution of axis formation as well as how animals with a single axis evolved into animals with more than one axis.\r\n",
