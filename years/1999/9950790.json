 "awd_abstract_narration": "An API 300 Micro Flow Auto Analyzer System has been adapted from advice from and involvement with  the Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture/National Science Foundation program in Stressed Stream Analysis.  This equipment allows us to enhance a faculty and student project, Water Quality in the Congaree River.  Earlier work was time-intensive nutrient testing for nitrate and phosphate.  Previously this work had been carried out by Environmental Assessment students and by geoscience majors with related independent studies. The API 300 Micro Flow Auto Analyzer System with its simple flow through cell allows a sampling rate of 90-120 samples per hour, and the included software package allows fast, efficient analyses which are appropriate features for exposing both non-science and science majors to modern technology and field- based research.   Majors are acquiring valuable experience in the standard techniques in this field. This equipment also makes it possible to offer multiple sections of Environmental Assessment (mainly non-majors) and Stressed Stream Analysis (majors). The auto analyzer increases the frequency of sampling and size of the sampling area, improves the research component in courses and the validity of results, and makes possible the addition of new test sites in the watershed,   The department is equipped with computer technology that can be interfaced with the API Analyzer for rapid graphical displays.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
