 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Catherine J. Page at the University of Oregon is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.The focus of the research is the design, synthesis and characterization of self-assembled organic-inorganic multilayer thin films incorporating nonlinear optical and magnetic properties.  The multilayers will be prepared from transition and rare earth metal salts and bisphosphonates, bisisocyanides, aminophosphonates, isocyanoalkylphosphonates and variants containing nonlinear optical chromophores.  A feature of the research will be the layer by layer characterization of the films by grazing angle x-ray diffraction, ellipsometry, FTIR, XPS, solid state NMR and various microscopies including, scanning and tunneling electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. \r\nStructural order within the multilayers  and film growth kinetics will be determined by in-situ second harmonic generation measurements. When paramagnetic metal salts are used as film formers, magnetic properties will be measured by SQUID magnetometry. In addition to studying the axial metal ligand interactions responsible for the structural integrity of the films, the role of the supporting ligands equatorial to the plane of the metal ions will also be explored.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the formation and structure of self-assembled monolayers on surfaces relates to materials properties such as wettability, corrosion resistance and chemical response as in sensors. The multilayer systems studied in this research will impact nonlinear optical devices, stable charge-separated assemblies and chemical specific sensors.\r\n\r\n",
