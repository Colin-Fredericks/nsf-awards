The Bronx Educational Alliance (BEA), in collaboration with Lehman College, School District Nine, the Bronx High School Superintendency, and the Bronx Federation of High School Parent Association Presidents, provides a four-month Parent Academy twice a year. Thirty-six parents (20 elementary, 6 middle and 10 high school), from 18 Bronx schools in three K-12 corridors with which the BEA Resource/Outreach Center for Parents currently works, participate in each Academy, reaching 360 over five years.\r\n\r\nProject PARTNERS goals are to:  1) increase student achievement in 18 Corridor Schools through meaningful parental support;  2) provide parent training in Math, Science and Technology and enable parents to understand the New Standards;  3) develop skills to reinforce their children's learning at home; and \r\n4) model how to effectively learn in science-rich informal educational institutions.\r\n\r\nParents meet on Saturdays twice a month for six hours.  On one Saturday they team with a teacher and child to visit a science rich institution.   On the other Saturday they learn to use computer software programs which support MST, and math concepts through games and manipulatives.  Incentives for parents include learning computer skills and stipends of $300 upon completion.  The BEA Academies coordinate  with the BUSI and District's Family Math and Family Science workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
