A Sunwheel at the University of Massachusetts campus will be constructed.  This Sunwheel will provide an experiential basis for school children, for University students, and for the general public to learn about, observe, and understand the basic cycles exhibited by the Sun and Moon throughout the calendar year. In October of 1995, permission was given to construct a Sunwheel at an excellent site on campus at the University of Massachusetts. The observations necessary for the data for construction of this Sunwheel were completed between June 1996 and March 1997. A preliminary stone circle was built in May 1997 with stones 2 feet high.  This Sunwheel project will involve the construction of 8-foot tall granite standing stones.\r\n\r\nThrough the Sunwheel, which concretely illustrates the variations in the Sun's position on the horizon throughout the year, a greater awareness and understanding of astronomy will be available to school children, to the University community, and to the general public, thereby enhancing science literacy, encouraging curiosity, and improving the quality of life.  A series of presentations specifically designed for fourth through sixth graders, and to be given at the Sunwheel, will be developed.   It is planned to use these presentations to instill an understanding of the seasons, which is one of the most misunderstood fundamental concepts involving astronomical knowledge. Additionally, through the presence as a scientist and a teacher of science at the Sunwheel site, a role model for young girls will be active and present at a crucial time in the development of their ideas about their future interests and careers.  In this time of increased awareness of the importance of involving research scientists in creative teaching activities, and providing role models for underrepresented groups, the Sunwheel project helps to produce a highly visible educational structure with great power to enhance science literacy and excite youngsters in learning about astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
