 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the keys to understanding development is understanding how children's knowledge changes over time. Thus, an important challenge for developmental research is to specify the mechanisms of knowledge change. This research focuses on one potential mechanism of change in the development of mathematical knowledge: namely, changes in how children represent problems. I define problem representation as the creation of an internal, mental copy of particular features of a problem. I argue that representation is an important link between children's knowledge about mathematical concepts and their knowledge about strategies for solving mathematical problems. The proposed research tests this claim among children learning the concept of mathematical equivalence, which is the notion that the two sides of an equation represent the same quantity. Children's knowledge of this concept is tested using equations of the form 3+4+5=_+5. The proposed studies address two main questions about changes in problem representation as a mechanism of knowledge change. First, how do changes in problem representation influence children's knowledge? The proposed studies test the hypothesis that changes in children's problem representations can lead to changes in their understanding of problem-solving strategies, and to changes in their knowledge of related concepts. Second, what makes representations change? The proposed studies explore three types of factors that may contribute to changes in representation: (a) gains in conceptual knowledge, (b) learning new problem-solving strategies, and (c) gaining experience within a problem domain. This research will shed light on the importance of representation in mathematical learning, and on factors that lead to and influence representation change. My overarching goal is to construct a well-specified theoretical model of how changes in problem representation function as a mechanism of cognitive change.\r\n",
