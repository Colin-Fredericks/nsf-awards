 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATM9872814abs\r\n\r\nThe investigators will conduct two extended measurement campaigns involving meteor and medium frequency radars, a CCD spectrograph, and a lidar.  The objective is to study systematic biases in horizontal wind measurements between the 30 and 40 MHz all-sky meteor radars, and the medium frequency radar at Platteville Atmospheric Observatory, and a sodium lidar located at Colorado State University.  Also, by making coincident measurements, the investigators will validate a new technique for determining mesopause temperatures using meteor radar data.  The instruments will be operated for as many nights as possible during two months, one in summer and one in winter.  The comparison will be conducted using statistical techniques to provide an objective, quantitative determination of any systematic biases that exist in neutral wind and temperature measurements from the various techniques. The results will contribute to the CEDAR/TIMED program. CEDAR, which stands for Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change program that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to study similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.\r\n",
