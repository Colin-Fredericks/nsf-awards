 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since biological function is extremely temperature sensitive, animals can function normally only within a rather narrow range of operating temperatures (e.g. mammals can function normally only at 37+ 1 *C). The temperature sensitivity biological function has its roots within the molecular machinery (e.g. membrane lipids) of the cell and is largely a consequence of the temperature sensitivity of intra- and intermolecular structural interactions. Cellular molecules are designed to operate under very specific thermal conditions. When thermal conditions change, molecular function becomes sub-optimal and this has a negative effect on cellular level physiology which in turn disrupts normal animal function. Unlike warm-blooded animals that regulate body temperature at a constant value, cold-blooded animals, particularly those existing within aquatic environments, must operate at different body temperatures as their environmental temperature changes (e.g seasonally). Cold-blooded animals need to \"re-design' themselves at the molecular level to operate effectively under new thermal conditions. One way that they accomplish this is by adjusting the lipid composition of their cell membranes. Resistance to passive hydrogen ion (proton) diffusion is property of biological membranes that is of considerable functional importance for mitochondrial energy transduction. This membrane property is exquisitely temperature sensitive, but the PIs believe that passive proton permeability is regulated by adjusting membrane lipid composition. The PIs initial results for intact mitochondria from trout muscle demonstrate complete compensation of proton permeability following thermal acclimation. The PIs propose the hypothesis that the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid composition of a cold-blooded animals is regulated to compensate thermal perturbation of membrane proton resistance, a process the PIs describe as homeoresistance adaptation. This will be investigated using intact mitochondria and vesicles derived from inner membrane phospholipids. The significance of this work lies in better understanding how phospholipids mediate proton permeability in relation to other bilayer properties and has implications for clarifying both the structural requirements and functional significance of proton permeability in mitochondria.",
