 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Mathematical Society (AMS), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) propose sponsoring an annual program of research conferences,\r\nspanning the full range of the mathematical sciences, and including connections with other sciences as well as applications to industry. This series builds on the long standing and highly successful series of research\r\nconferences known as the AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conferences (SRCs), funded by the National Science Foundation since 1982, and the AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied Mathematics and the AMS Summer Institute, both with NSF support for over thirty years. There are important changes, however, that add flexibility and promote a high quality scientific program.\r\n\r\nScientific oversight of this activity will be carried out by a committee of leading research mathematicians, representing the three societies. The collaboration of the three societies on this series will permit coverage of the entire breadth of the mathematical sciences and will foster an interdisciplinary character to some topics. The three societies are ideally suited to provide the infrastructure necessary to solicit, promote, and\r\ncarry out these kinds of conferences.\r\n\r\nThe (new) SRCs will consist of from six to eight conferences held in contiguous weeks in the summer at a host academic institution. Most of the conferences will be one week long with between forty-five and sixty-five\r\nparticipants attending a limited number of plenary hour-long lectures by leaders in the field. Additional sessions will be scheduled for presentations by conference participants, including work in progress by\r\nresearchers at an early stage in their careers. Time will be reserved each day for informal research discussions. One group social outing will be provided each week, and a convenient space suitable for informal evening get togethers will be arranged.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, two or three scientifically linked one-week conferences will be scheduled for consecutive weeks. This arrangement may include either topics that are tightly coupled, with a common organizing committee and a single set of participants (100-150), or scientifically related topics with separate organizing committees, and some expected overlap in attendance. The former will essentially represent conferences similar to the AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar and the AMS Summer Institute, which this series\r\nalso replaces. The latter will be a new arrangement serving to highlight different aspects of the same research theme.",
