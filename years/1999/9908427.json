The researchers will work to understand the molecular aspects of extreme cold hardiness in plants.  The objective of the project is to characterize the location of a 24 kDa dehydrin-like xylem protein, using immunolocalization, to ascertain its potential functional roles for enhancement of freezing tolerance during cold acclimation in the red osier dogwood (C. sericea).  \r\n\r\nSurvival of low temperature stress is a major limiting factor of plant distribution and productivity.  C. Sericea is one of the most freeze tolerant plant species.   Investigations concerning the accumulation of cold acclimation related proteins in this species would potentially provide insight on specific molecular characteristics unique to extremely tolerant organisms.  Such insight would increase understanding of the complex trait of freeze tolerance, with important implications for agriculture.  This project will benefit from the complementary strengths of the two laboratories.  In particular, the graduate student will benefit from Dr. Itoh's unique expertise in ultra-microtomy of woody plant tissue.\r\n",
