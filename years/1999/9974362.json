The ultimate goal is to develop innovative, more sensitive and more precise nondestructive methods to characterize the properties of materials much earlier than possible with current nondestructive testing techniques, so that any material alterations detrimental to the desired application can be detected and corrected well before macroscopic defects occur.  Properties of interest include microstructure, residual stress, precipitates, second phases, included particles, dislocation density, porosity, composite cure state and adhesive strength.  These symposia function to gather together the technologists of nondestructive methods with materials scientists and engineers to help explore the applications of nondestructive characterization and solutions to the problems encountered.  Papers include research and applications for aging infrastructure, microstructure characterization, on-line measurements for process control, mechanical property determination, precision and accuracy of nondestructive characterization measurements; advances in computed assisted tomography, laser ultrasonics, microwave advances and applications.  Of considerable interest are state-of-the art developments\r\nand applications where the complex nature of materials has been recognized.  Furthermore, discussions on the applications and possibilities for multi-technique measurement of interdependent parameters and the evaluation of the data through sophisticated computer analysis are encouraged.  In order to permit as many participants as possible to present the results of their research efforts funds are provided to assist distinguished scientists, young scientists, and graduate students, to attend the symposium.  The recipients of funds are selected by the organizing committee with awareness of geographical distribution and the desire to include as many women and minorities as possible.  The proceedings of this symposium will be published as a bound volume entitled Nondestructive Characterization of Materials IX.\r\n%%%\r\nThis symposium is the ninth in a series of bi-annual international symposia that was first held in 1983.  Prior symposia were held in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Montreal, Canada; Saarbrucken, Germany; Annapolis, Maryland, Karuizawa, Japan; Oahu, Hawaii; Prague, Czech Republic and Boulder, Colorado.  Professor Clayton Ruud, Pennsylvania State University and Robert Green, Johns Hopkins University were the founders of this symposia series.\r\n***\r\n",
