Channel restoration is a growing fleld of importance, but there are many improvements that are needed to insure success when applying the various techniques.  The research to improve this field can actively involve undergraduate students and beneflt the classroom.  I will develop a research program involving undergraduates to assess channel maintenance processes in New England channels.  The research will aid in rish habitat studies, channel restoration efforts and further our understanding on morphologic evolution of channels.  Students will assist with high-level research on channel-maintenance processes and perform smaller independent research projects on aspects of the main project.  The students will also plan, implement and monitor their own restoration project on the Connecticut College campus.  The restoration effort will involve students from four main courses and serve as an example for a rifth introductory course.  The heavy involvement of undergraduate students will help provide inspiration and confidence to these students.  The environmental goals of the project can also help generate community interest in the work conducted at Connecticut College.  At the completion of the project, the scientific and engineering community will have new approaches to stream restoration that focus on the importance of the pool and riffle morphology.  In addition, the college will have a better-educated student body and improved campus grounds.  Finally, the local community will see the success of the local restoration efforts and can use these examples to initiate their own rehabilitation plans.\r\n",
