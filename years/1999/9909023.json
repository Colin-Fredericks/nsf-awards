 "awd_abstract_narration": "JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nSeveral sources indicate that HBCUs have been the major source of B.S. degrees awarded to African-Americans in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (SEM) disciplines. But the situation is rapidly changing. Several data also suggests that SEM bachelor degrees awarded to African-Americans by HBCUs have been declining since 1987. Jackson State University (JSU) is submitting a proposal to the NSF HBCU Initiative that will enhance existing programs and promote the integration of teaching and research. The plan will provide resources to greatly improve, throughout the School of Science and Technology (SST), the processes and activities that are being used in the recruitment, retention and graduation of students, in SEM areas. Enhanced/corrective strategies will be implemented using known models which have proven to be successful. JSU envisions the implementation of this project to be a mechanism for fostering the transformation and integration of research and education in SEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe overall program goal is to enhance and strengthen JSU's SEM degree-producing capacity at all levels and increase the number of SEM graduates, especially qualified minority scientists/engineers who can contribute to advancing the state of SEM knowledge and address the technical problems of society. Specific focus will be directed toward enhancing faculty development, the curriculum and student development. Activities being implemented in support of the project goals include: curriculum restructuring, implementation of a comprehensive SEM student support center, integration of information technology into the curricula, enhancement of the educational/research support infrastructure, and faculty development.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of this project will be improvement in the overall programmatic course offerings, enrollment and research activities in SEM fields. Through a strong partnership that already exists between JSU and various national labs, industry and other universities, significant opportunities for quality undergraduate student research and training in SEM fields will be available. Other benefits will include:\r\n\r\no\tStrengthening the program of instruction in the core SEM courses.\r\n\r\no\tRevision and updating of curriculum as needed, incorporation of Information Technology (IT) in the curricula.\r\n\r\no\tExpansion and upgrading of educational resources including teaching facilities and laboratories.\r\n\r\no\tIncrease in faculty research involvement, publications and grantsmanship.\r\n\r\no\tEducating and training significant numbers of minority students for successful careers in SEM fields to met the needs of related institutions including governmental agencies, the academia and the booming demands from industry,\r\n\r\no\tFormation of creative partnerships with local, state, federal and private institutions, and the opportunity for faculty and students to participate in formal internship programs at these institutions.\r\n\r\no\tAn increase in the number and motivation of minority students pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in SEM fields.\r\n\r\n",
