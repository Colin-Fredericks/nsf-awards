The physical heterogeneity of aquifers can be represented within a three-dimensional geostatistical model that represents both its structured and random aspects.  Because the subsurface at environmental sites is never exhaustively characterized, decisions must be made under uncertainty and risk-qualified models are needed.  Useful statistical models of aquifer heterogeneity will only come from many well-studied examples at data-rich sites, in a variety of depositional environments.  Our long-term research goal is to develop statistical models for the most relevant features of the heterogeneity in granular aquifer systems in specific depositional setting and to evaluate the level of detail necessary in simulating macrodispersive transport.  We have begun by looking at glacigenic buried-valley aquifers in the North American mid-continent.  These have heterogeneity ranging across several scales, from unimodal distributions of permeability within facies, to weakly multimodal distributions of permeability within architectural elements, to strongly multimodal heterogeneity at the scale of facies assemblages.  The objective of the project are to build data bases and compute facies proportions, variance in proportion with translation, mean length, variance in length, coefficient of embeddedness and transition probability.  Furthermore, we compute the geometric mean, variance, and correlation range of permeability within facies.  We refer to these statistics collectively, when related to features of the depositional environment, as a quantitative facies model.  We will compare quantitative facies models developed for four different buried-valley aquifers occurring across a broad region of the mid-continent.  Flow and transport modeling will be used to assess whether or not observed differences are relevant in environmental decision making.  This is an RUI proposal, and as in prior phases of funding, the project will have significant undergraduate involvement.  \r\n",
