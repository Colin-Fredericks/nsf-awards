 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nSome grasses appear to be able to obtain fixed nitrogen through\r\nsymbiotic relations with various bacteria.  This project deals with a new\r\nsymbiosis involving European beachgrass (Ammophila arenaria) and\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria living within the shoots and rhizomes of the host\r\nplant.  The primary objective is to determine the extent of nitrogen\r\nfixation (acetylene reduction) activity in this grass in order to confirm\r\nif the rates are significant.  Additional objectives are to characterize\r\nthe microorganisms involved in the Ammophila symbiosis, to determine the\r\nnatural abundance and distribution of these microorganisms, and to\r\ndetermine if a similar symbiosis might be present in or introduced into\r\nother species of grasses (including crop species).  Inoculated and axenic\r\nseedlings will be used in greenhouse and field trials to determine if\r\nAmmophila benefits from its bacterial symbiont.  The rates of nitrogen\r\nfixation in the field and the effects of environmental variables will be\r\nmeasured by acetylene reduction assays.  The precise location of\r\nendophytic bacteria will be determined using immunological techniques at\r\nboth the light and electron microscope level with existing antibodies.\r\nThe bacteria will be characterized with regards to the genes involved with\r\nnitrogen fixation and the effects of oxygen and fixed nitrogen on nitrogen\r\nfixation.  Other species of grasses will also be examined for similar\r\nsymbioses using acetylene reduction assays and immunolocalization by light\r\nmicroscopy.  The Ammophila symbiosis is promising in that it involves\r\nnovel bacterial symbionts with unknown properties and host ranges in a\r\ntype of symbiosis previously thought to be largely if not entirely\r\nrestricted to tropical grasses.  In addition to providing insight into the\r\nphenomenal success of Ammophila on bare sand, these studies might open\r\nossibilities for endophytic nitrogen fixation by grasses of agricultural\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
