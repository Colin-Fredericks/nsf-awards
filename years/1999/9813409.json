The proposed work is on spatiotemperal chaos and seeks to explore the proposal that some properties of chaotic systems are extensive in the thermodynamic limit.  The PI together with a junior colleague have developed parallel codes and have secured resources on parallel computers in support of the proposed work.  Other theoretical issues that will be addressed include the derivation of a long wavelength, stochastic model, and a calculation of the structure factor for systems which exhibit spatiotemporal chaos.  These systems include Rayleigh-Benard convection (a paradigm for current experimental and theoretical studies of pattern formation in fluids and liquid crystals) and a generalized Burgers model of seismic wave propagation. \r\n%%%\r\nResearch and education are supported by this award to investigate pattern formation in a variety of systems that are not in equilibrium.  The PI will use state-of-the-art computing as he seeks a deeper understanding of the fundamental physical principles that underlie pattern formation in seemingly diverse systems.  Examples of such systems that are also important to everyday life include the growth of crystals and turbulence.  This research will also contribute to a textbook that is being written by the PI in collaboration with another scholar and help advance the research career of  a junior investigator at Bowling Green University.\r\n***\r\n",
