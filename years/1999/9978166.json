 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to broaden the scope and enhance the quality of the research and educational programs of the ERC for Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films at Clemson University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology by implementing a collaborative research program with the Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC) in Polymer Science and Technology which represents a consortium of groups of polymer researchers at Universities of Leeds, Bradford, and Durham in UK.  The long-range goal of the ERC is to produce software packages for new fiber and film formulation and processing design.  The ERC's research is organized in three thrusts:  Thrust 1, Computer-based product and process Development; Thrust 2, new Fiber and Film precursors; and Thrust 3, Advanced Fiber and Film Processes.  The purpose of the proposed joint research is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise between the Clemson/MIT REC and Bradford/Durham/Leeds IRC, and to accelerate through collaboration both the computational and experimental programs currently underway at each location.  The primary mechanism for collaboration and technology transfer will be a series of extended visits by the ERC researchers to the Universities of Leeds, Bradford, and Durham.  Each visit will be of three-month duration and will include travel by a faculty member and one graduate student or a post-doctoral researcher.  Six such visits are planned over the course of the three-year duration of the grant Reciprocal visits by researchers at the University of Leeds are envisioned as part of the collaboration.  Funding for reciprocal visits will be obtained from funding sources in UK.",
