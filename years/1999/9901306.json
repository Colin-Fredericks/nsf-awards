 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901306\r\nSnyder\r\n\r\nAbsorption of energy from a pulse-modulated laser beam impringing on a transparent material leads to cyclic thermal expansion and contraction of the surface exposed to the beam. This distortion of the surface forms a transient optical lens structure which can be probed by monitoring changes in a second, continuous laser beam reflected at an angle off the lens curvature.  Major improvements in detection and quantitation of the reflected probe-beam developed at the EMU Experimental Laser Physics Laboratory have resulted in a highly sensitive technique, termed laser Surface Thermal Lensing (STL), for study of the thermomechanical response of surface materials.  Micron-thick films or organic polymers applied over the surface of optical materials have been found to give much stronger STL signals than the glass background.  Since the magnitude and phase of the STL signals should be a function of both the absorbtivity and the dynamic/mechanical properties of the polymer, it is reasonable to theorize that any changes in external conditions which affect these properties should result in detectable changes in the STL signal.  This research project will study the relationship between laser STL characteristics of a polymer, its structure, mechanical properties and relevant external conditions.  Methodology will involve initial study of instrument parameters such as optical bench configuration, pump-beam frequency, power and wavelength in order to optimize the STL response of suitable test polymers.  The STL signal behavior will then be studied as a function of temperature for different polymers to determine the feasibility of using this technique to investigate glass-transition and other solid-state phase transitions.  The effect of small organic molecules adsorbed from the gas phase into the surface layer of the polymer on the STL response of the polymer film will also be investigated to determine it plasticization effects can be quantified by changes in the STL signal.\r\n\r\nThe laser STL technique has numerous potential applications in polymer structural analysis and related fields since it allows studies of dynamic/mechanical properties for polymers as processed thin films.  The ability to measure glass-transition temperatures over minute areas of the polymer surface would be useful in studying structural defects due to phase-separation in commercial coating systems based on polymer blends.  The sensors for airborne materials such a solvent vapors and organic pollutants.  STL with tuneable infrared lasers could also allow the technique to be used as a sensitive detector for analytical spectroscopy of surface chemical composition.\r\n",
