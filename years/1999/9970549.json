It contains\r\nthree parts. In the first part, we try to study problems related\r\nto critical points (or bi-harmonic maps) for Hessian energy\r\nfunctionals of maps between manifolds, such as partial regularity\r\nfor minimizing bi-harmonic maps, existence of bi-harmonic map\r\nrepresentations among homotopy classes from four dimensional\r\nmanifolds, and heat evolutions of bi-harmonic maps from four\r\ndimensional domains.  In the second part, we try to develop\r\nblow-up analysis for flows of stationary harmonic maps, flows of\r\nGinzburg-Landau systems, stable-stationary harmonic maps, and\r\nenergy concentrations and bubbling phenomena for entire solutions\r\nto harmonic maps in three dimensional Euclidean space.  Here we\r\ntry to use geometric measure theory and PDE to understand the\r\ndefect measures associated with these objects.  In the last part,\r\nthe PI propose to study lower bound for p-energy and its\r\napplications to possible dynamics of singularity for p-harmonic\r\nmap flows from two dimensional domains to the circle, as p tends\r\nto two. We hope to build connections to vortex dynamics of\r\ncomplex Ginzburg-Landau equations in two dimension.\r\n\r\nNonlinear partial differential equations are basic tools to\r\ndescribe problems arising from both differential geometry and\r\nphysics. Harmonic maps model optimal objects with respect to\r\nphysically natural energy functionals in families of objects\r\nsatisfying common constraints. Heat flows of harmonic maps study\r\nthe long-time dynamical behavior of objects in such families. The\r\nstudy will enhance our understanding of these maps, improve\r\nmethods to control the singular sets, and predict singular\r\nbehavior of solutions to these problems. Bi-harmonic maps are\r\nnatural in the study of both fourth order nonlinear PDE and\r\nhigher dimensional conformal geometry. Results here will have\r\npotential applications to differential geometry, material science\r\nincluding liquid crystals, elasticity/plasticity, and fluid\r\nmechanics.\r\n",
