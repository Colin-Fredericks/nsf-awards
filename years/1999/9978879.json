 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stony Brook proposes 1) to build on its existing initiatives to produce significant increases (as much as 300%) in the recruitment, retention, and doctoral degree conferral figures of underrepresented students in SME disciplines in five years, and 2) to develop models for the replication and institutionalization of strategies that prove to be successful. The MGE program will enable Stony Brook to improve the centralization of staffing, resources, planning, implementation, and evaluation activities. Key components of the Stony Brook proposal are: increasing the pool of graduate students by building on existing and new partnerships with AMP programs and HBCUs; departmental incentives for the admission and retention of targeted students; building on the 'Chain of Mentors'\r\nprogram already in existence; developing a comprehensive data collection and tracking system; using evaluation to ensure replication and to produce change in institutional culture; and institutionalizing the model through the establishment of a management structure that involves top administrators. The mechanisms proposed by Stony Brook are designed to produce a profound impact on the doctoral student experience in the foreseeable future.\r\n",
