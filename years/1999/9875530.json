 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on active prostheses, which are capable of generating and sustaining knee joint torques. Active porstheses are advantageous over conventional passive prostheses, since the latter cannot generate knee torques in response to the amputee's demands or in opposition to externally applied torques and thus have limited usefulness for activities requiring weight bearing on a partially flexed knee. The project investigates a unique power source - the dynamics of the gait cycle - to provide sufficient energy that can be recovered, stored and used by active prostheses for torque generation. A knee-ankle actuator that can recover energy from the gait cycle and generate knee joint torques for gait and stair climb will be modeled, designed, and built.   An extensive experimental study will evaluate its energy recovery and active torque generation capab - ilities.  The education component focuses on the development of biomechanical engineering courses, targeted at graduate students and upper level undergraduates, that promote interaction between engineering students and clinical and medical professionals, emphasizing the importance of communication and collaboration for improved treatments and devices. A biomechanics laboratory supporting analytical and experimental research projects will be developed to facilitate research efforts and to provide experimental support to course topics. Other educational objectives include promoting distance learning, and encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in engineering.\r\n",
