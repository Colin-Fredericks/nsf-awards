 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary science and technology are perceived by many as hazardous as well as beneficial.  This has led to public concerns about risk management of important policies and projects.  Differences between experts and the public have been central to numerous resulting risk controversies.  This research project studies the way attitudes toward risk issues and their management are formed and the implications for addressing risk controversies.  The primary empirical evidence for discussing the conceptual issues comes from an examination of five risk topics: (1) risk and decision making; (2) values and environmental risks, (3) intuitive toxicology, (4) biotechnology and cloning, and (5) product stigma.  Scientific articles are in preparation for each of these topics. \r\n\r\nThe data for the study comes from archives at Decision Research and elsewhere, from ongoing research, and from the 1997 national risk survey, which was designed to produce new data on these topics.  In particular, this recent survey includes oversampling of minority populations that will allow examination of social, cultural, and political factors that prior evidence indicates are an important part of the context people use to form their perceptions of risk and their attitudes toward public decision processes.  A primary focus of this work is to develop a conceptual framework to understand different approaches to risk and preferences for risk management options.  This research is expected to inform risk communication, risk management, and public policy in ways that will serve as the basis for recommending new approaches for public decision making. \r\n",
