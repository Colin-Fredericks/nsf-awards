 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning style evaluation of more than 100 environmental engineering undergraduate students at Michigan Technological University indicates that the majority of students are active, sensing, visual, and sequential learners.  Unfortunately, traditional educational experiences promote passive, verbal skills.  While learning preferences and experiences are clearly mismatched, it is imperative that students develop all styles of learning.  This can only happen when a balanced mix of educational experiences is provided throughout the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing ten learning modules for a sophomore level, semester-based course in Environmental Measurements and Analysis.  Five modules consist of four common elements: a lecture built upon a modified Kolb's learning cycle to introduce the motivation, theory, application, and analysis of environmental data using statistical data analysis methods; computer-based tools for student-directed learning about data analysis methods and instrumentation; experiential laboratory and field sessions for data acquisition and analysis experiments; and discussion opportunities to facilitate understanding of material and offer technical presentation opportunities.   Materials for these modules are computer-based, allowing classroom presentations, asynchronous learning, integration of multimedia elements, and widespread   dissemination via CD-ROM and the Internet.  The remaining five modules are similar, but do not have a computer-based learning tool.   As each module will be self-supporting, the tools will be available to other faculty to assemble in the order that suits any particular class.\r\n\r\nAssessment of the learning module effectiveness will be determined through a variety of measures: student beta-version tool evaluation, student control group comparisons, evaluation of senior level work, and student exit interviews.  After  implementation and review at several test sites, the tools will be publicly released at the 2002 Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors Education Needs Conference.\r\n\r\n",
