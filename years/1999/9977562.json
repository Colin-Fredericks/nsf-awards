The purpose of this project is to advance our understanding of tapping as a mode of manipulation. Tapping, in its most basic form, consists of striking an object, imparting some initial velocities, and then\r\nletting it slide until it comes to rest due to friction.  The goal of this project is to develop general motion planning algorithms and stable feedback control techniques for positioning tasks using tapping.  The main focus of this research is understanding the role of part shape and actuator constraints in these problems.  Part shape affects both the mechanics of sliding and how the object can be struck to generate initial velocities.  Actuator constraints, such as using fixed-position tapping actuators, limit the taps that can be applied to the object.  Motion planning and feedback control must account for both types of constraints in order to create and execute robust tapping plans.  This work will be evaluated experimentally by building a \"tapping micropositioning cell\" which will precisely position a part by repeatedly sensing its configuration and firing one of the\r\nfixed-position tapping actuators about the perimeter of the cell.\r\n",
