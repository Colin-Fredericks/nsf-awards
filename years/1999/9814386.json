The planning process will use focus groups involving 15-25 participants in seven geographical sites.  During the planning process, information will be collected to design and test an integrative model using innovative materials, strategies and experiences for parents to help support the work of their daughters in SMT content.  Further, the model will demonstrate techniques for use by parents with their children.  These techniques will be designed for use in the education of their daughters by assisting them in gaining the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for empowering stakeholders to advocate for universally available, high-quality SMT education for their children.\r\n",
