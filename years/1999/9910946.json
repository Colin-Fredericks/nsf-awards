The several objectives of the meeting are to: 1) present insights into new basic research in drug discovery, design and delivery, highlighting the important emerging roles for biomedical engineers; 2) present examples of successful academic/industrial collaborations in the drug discovery, design and delivery areas; 3) provide information about funding opportunities, including those for academic/industrial collaborations in these areas; and, 4) provide an opportunity for biomedical engineering students to learn about drug discovery, design and delivery. BEACON is a joint project of four educational institutions-University of Connecticut at Storrs, the University of Connecticut Health Center, the University of Hartford, and Trinity College. The symposium presentations are to be made by a group of eminent researchers and is expected to elicit interest from a national audience.  From 175-200 persons including 20-30 students from BEACON affiliated institutions are expected to attend.  \r\n\r\nThe Symposium addresses an important area of interest to the Biomedical Engineering program, that of reaching out to industry and informing a wider audience than academic researchers about the nature and achievements of biomedical engineering, The symposium is well organized, new topics for engineering research will be reviewed, and the speakers are leaders in their fields of investigation. Dissemination of results of the meeting will occur in a printed publication for which funds are being provided by the National Science Foundation. \r\n\r\n",
