One of the major hypotheses is that there has been a broad reorientation of the private sector's attitude toward generic research for a variety of reasons, resulting in less interest in or need to provide financial support of university research. The project objectives are (1) to assess changes in the level of funds provided by the private sector to industry-university research centers; and (2) to identify the organizational and economic factors that have contributed to the observed trends in the availability of funds to support center research.  Since the project's emphasis is on the management of research in industry, the focus will be established firms, not small-firm conduct and management.  The agencies, universities, and researchers involved in the hundreds of industry-university research centers funded by Federal Government programs should benefit substantially through a better understanding of what pressures, requirements, and interests affect the extent and manner in which firms participate in such enterprises.    \r\n\r\n",
