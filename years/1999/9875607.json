 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875607\r\nWest\r\nRestenosis is a prevalent and life threatening complication of angioplasty and other vascular procedures used to re-open occluded arteries.  Approximately 45% of all angioplasty procedures fail due to restenosis.  Restenosis is due in large part to the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells to form of an occlusive layer of tissue, similar to scar tissue, within the arterial wall.  Though the mechanisms of restenosis are as yet poorly understood, it is clear that initial thrombosis following vascular injury plays an important role and that numerous growth factors and cytokines are involved in stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and matrix production.  Nitric oxide (NO), produced by endothelial cells in uninjured arteries, acts to limit smooth muscle cell proliferation, prevent platelet aggregation, increase the rate of endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and attenuate leukocyte adhesion.  All of these actions are expected to decrease the incidence and extent of restenosis after vascular injury, such as that caused by angioplasty.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research involves the development of biofunctional polymeric biomaterials that produce NO under physiological conditions and that can be crosslinked via photopolymerization to form hydrogels in situ, allowing one to coat the surface of the damaged artery or a cardiovascular device with a thin layer of NO-producing hydrogel.  The proposed materials have potential as a therapy for thrombosis and restenosis and as a novel tool to study the cellular and molecular actions of NO without systemic effects.  Two classes of NO-releasing polymers will be synthesized, one based on S-nitrosothiols (which produce NO for hours to days) and another based on NO/nucleophile complexes (which produce NO for weeks to months), with polyethylene glycol (PEG) composing the bulk of the material for biocompatability and acrylate termini to allow rapid photopolymerization into hydrogel materials.  The efficacy of these novel materials for the prevention of smooth muscle cell proliferation and the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation will be assessed using cultured cells.  Platelet aggregation will be assessed, and prevention of thrombosis will be evaluated in an ex vivo parallel plate blood flow assembly.\r\n\r\nThis research project will provide hands-on training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  This proposal addresses several additional educational goals.  Dr. West will develop a novel biomaterials module for the undergraduate bioengineering laboratory course:  this course will be designed to maximize the integration of teaching with research and thus encourage undergraduate students, as well as more faculty members, to participate in the undergraduate research program.  All of the researchers involved in the project described above will actively participate in community outreach programs, including visiting local public high schools to present their research and educate the community about advances in bioengineering.\r\n",
