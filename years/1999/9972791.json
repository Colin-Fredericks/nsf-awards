 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAlthough native-born and immigrant minority youngsters are often educationally disadvantaged because of household poverty, discrimination, and high levels of community disorganization, it is also evident that many flourish. This study emphasizes the ways in which distinctive backgrounds can be sources of strengths for youngsters and for young adults, and how such strengths bolster resilience and enhance the likelihood of successful outcomes.\r\n\r\nWithin this framework, three perspectives bear on the research. One deals with group differences in values and motivations and how such differences affect outcomes. Because race, ethnicity, and gender differences are related to variation in motivation and learning styles, students are academically challenged in different ways. This study demonstrates how cultural values shape motivation and learning styles, and also how school and young adult outcomes are affected by whether such differences are recognized in families and schools. Moreover, motivational levels are related to achievement (learning) trajectories, but minority youth and females are particularly susceptible to \"shock\" (such as a family death or changing schools) that throw them off their trajectories. Thus, achievement is treated as a dynamic process that involves group variation in values, changing levels of motivation, and how students rebound from shocks to regain their learning trajectories.  \r\n\r\nThe second perspective relates to group differences in social attachments. Such attachments are defined in terms of types of relationships - peers, neighbors, teachers, family members, and others  and also in terms of their salience, or importance. There are group differences with respect to profiles involving types and salience of relationships, and, these, in turn, affect school outcomes. The third perspective relates to school and neighborhood, or contextual, variation, and how such variation directly and indirectly affects achievement. Contextual variation is defined in relational terms, including diversity (heterogeneity), inequality, and consolidated inequality (when inequality is systematically related to group differences). School and neighborhood characteristics that are generally used in education studies, as well as new measures of neighborhood characteristics, are included. \r\n\r\nThe research uses Department of Education data sets: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), the High School Effectiveness Study (HSES), and the Common Core of Data (for schools). Neighborhood characteristics are drawn from the 1990 US census (zip-code level) and from IRS (zip-code level) data on community organizations.\r\n\r\nNew procedures are used to measure youths' profiles of types of relationships and their salience,  to parameterize contextual effects, and to analyze achievement trajectories. Achievement and school outcomes are considered in terms of processes that involve values, motivation, and attachments nested within family, school, and neighborhood environments. The research uses fuzzy-set and dynamic, multi-level modeling techniques to capture these processes.\r\n",
