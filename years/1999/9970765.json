 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will examine communication about the past within families of Jewish Veterans who fought in the Soviet Army during World War II and who now live in the United States. Ethnographic methods will be employed to trace how the decisive moments one generation's past are understood or repudiated by successive generations. The project will contribute to the discipline by applying theory from literature on immigration and ethnicity, identity theory, and theory regarding the sustenance and loss of collective memory to interpretation of a community's relationship to a complex past. Studies of collective memory constitute a burgeoning field of sociological inquiry, and this dissertation will extend this research into the sphere of relationships between grandparents and grandchildren. In addition, the dissertation will contribute to research on intergenerational transmission, which has rarely incorporated more than two generations, and to research on intergenerational relationships, which has focused primarily on concurrent phenomena. The intensity and symbolic depth of both Soviet history and Jewish history will serve to dramatize the dynamics to be researched.",
