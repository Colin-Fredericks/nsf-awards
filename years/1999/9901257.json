 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being made through the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program to enable the collection and analysis of data on the response to the threat of Hurricane Georges in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties during the period of September 22-26, 1998.  This will set up a comparison with the response to Hurricane Andrew which struck the area in August, 1992, and was previously studies.  The major research questions that this project will address include: (1) At the time of landfall, were the communities of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties better prepared to resist the potential effects of Hurricane Georges than they were at the time of Hurricane Andrew?  (2) What factors best explain differences in disaster response at both the household and community levels?  Data for the study will be collected through a telephone survey of a random sample of residents and through in-depth interviews with key organizational officials.",
