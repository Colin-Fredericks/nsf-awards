Grinberg\r\n\r\nThe P.I. will continue to study problems of analysis and geometry\r\non homogeneous and non-homogeneous spaces. He will use techniques\r\nof group representations when these are available, and microlocal\r\nanalysis along with integral transforms, and their\r\ngeneralizations to not-necessarily homogeneous spaces. A major\r\nfocus of his program will include Radon transforms on symmetric\r\nspaces, especially their injectivity and restriction\r\nproperties. He will use symmetric spaces as a guide to analysis\r\non spaces with less regularity.  He will also investigate\r\nproblems in geometric inequalities and also several complex\r\nvariables using ideas closely related to, but formally distinct\r\nfrom Radon transforms. Finally, he will consider orbitfold\r\nanalogs of Radon transforms (or Radon transforms modulo finite\r\ngroups) by means of invariant polynomials and enumeration\r\narguments. He will continue an active program of travel and\r\nseminar visitors that has had a significant impact on the\r\nscientific community in North Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nImaging devices are used with increasing frequency in medicine,\r\nindustry, science, and information technology. While engineering,\r\ncomputational, and ergonomic considerations are critical in the\r\ndesign, production and utilization of these devices, the\r\nfoundational operating principle is generally\r\nmathematical. Typically, a mathematical theorem says that\r\ninformation may be recovered from a geometrically defined\r\nintegral transformation or partial differential equation. The\r\nRadon transform played a critical role in A.Cormack's pioneering\r\nwork on the CAT scanner. Today, this transform and its\r\ngeneralizations play a unifying role in an expanding set of\r\nbranches of mathematics. The P.I.  will focus on the following\r\nareas: 1) geometric inequalities, which relate properties like\r\nvolume, width, cross-sections shadow areas; 2) functions of\r\nseveral complex variables, which may be viewed as data with great\r\nregularity and which play an important role in mathematical\r\nanalysis and physics; 3) homogeneous spaces, where the existence\r\nof a great deal of symmetry is assumed and its exploitation is\r\nthe ultimate goal; 4) finite analogs, where the continuous\r\nharmonic analysis of smooth spaces is replaced by counting\r\narguments involving finite and discrete sets\r\n",
