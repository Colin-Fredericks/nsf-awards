 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973788\r\nJones\r\nIntelligent transportation systems (ITS) represent a fundamental shift in how transportation systems are designed and operated.  Benefits from ITS projects accrue at different geographic scales, yet no one model of traffic flow quality is able to assess these benefits at various scales. A model that is capable of quantifying the quality of traffic flow across scales of transportation systems will be beneficial in assessing the benefits and operations of ITS projects in terms of both localized and system-wide effects.  Such a scalable model has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the processes governing traffic flow.  This project, which is supported under the POWRE Program, investigates the two-fluid model of town traffic, which is one model that appears to have scalable properties.  The scalability of this model will be investigated through a program of data collection and analysis that utilizes machine vision processing.  The research is expected to provide a novel model for traffic flow through signalized intersections. The analytical work related to the scalability of the two-fluid model and the experienced gained with machine vision processing will expand the research capabilities of the PI and will allow her to do future work related to the scalability of other traffic flow models.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
