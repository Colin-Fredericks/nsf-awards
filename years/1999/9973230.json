 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bose\r\n9973230\r\n     The goal of this project is to develop biophysical models\r\nand the accompanying mathematical techniques to describe the\r\ngeneration of temporal codes by the activity patterns of networks\r\nof neurons.  The investigators focus on a robust temporal code,\r\ncalled phase precession, that has been experimentally found in\r\nthe firing pattern of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of\r\nfreely moving rats.  This temporal code is believed to signal the\r\nanimal's location in a known environment.  The investigators apply\r\na modeling approach consisting of three complementary methods:\r\nmathematical analysis of networks of simplified neurons,\r\nsimulations of networks of biophysical neurons, and functional\r\nmodeling that incorporates and interprets experimental recordings\r\nfrom freely moving rats.  The mathematical approach, using\r\ngeometric singular perturbation theory, exploits the multiple\r\ntime scales inherent in the intrinsic descriptions of the cells\r\nand the synapses between these cells.  Simulations are performed\r\non networks of conductance based neurons.  Genetic algorithms,\r\npreviously developed by the researchers, and bifurcation\r\ncontinuation programs aid in analyzing the simulation results.  A\r\ngoal of the analysis and simulations is to make experimentally\r\nverifiable predictions.\r\n     The hippocampus is a primary target for epilepsy and\r\nAlzheimer's Disease and has a well established role in memory\r\nfunction and in spatial navigation abilities.  The dynamical\r\ninteraction between neurons in the hippocampus may be described\r\nusing temporal coding schemes.  In order to detect potentially\r\npathological dynamics of these neurons, it is essential to first\r\nunderstand how these coding schemes are constructed under normal\r\ncircumstances.  More generally, a fundamental goal of neuroscience\r\nis to understand function from the single neuron level to the\r\nsystems level.  The objective of this project is to bridge all of\r\nthe levels of detail for one specific system, the hippocampus.\r\nThis work will also lay the mathematical foundation for research\r\nin other areas of the brain where temporal codes exist.  Funding\r\nfor the project is provided by the program of Computational\r\nMathematics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS\r\nand by the Computational Neuroscience program in BIO.\r\n",
