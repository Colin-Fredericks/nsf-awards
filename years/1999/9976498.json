The premise of this work is that cations are intrinsic to each of these processes. This project describes a hybrid-solvent model that explains why x-ray diffraction has generally failed to detect cations around nucleic acids. In this model, water molecules and monovalent cations share the same solvent sites. Sites that were previously characterized as pure water are proposed to be hybrids composed of both water and monovalent cations. Crystallographically a hybrid is a solvent site occupied by water molecules at some locations in the crystal and by monovalent cations at other locations that are equivalent by symmetry. The goal here is to search for non-average occupancies, i.e., peaks and troughs of cation density. One can anticipate a peak in the minor groove of AT-tracts. Recent high-resolution single crystal diffraction data of several salts of the Dickerson Dodecamer led the PI to a new interpretation with significant occupancy of either sodium or potassium in the minor groove. Cation density appears to be high near the ApT step. This project will test a limiting model in which all DNA deformation is dominated by electrostatic interactions with uneven cationic density. X-ray diffraction will be used to correlate cation occupancies with DNA sequence, phosphate positions, conformation, deformation, ionic radii, etc.\r\n\r\nWatson and Crick received the Nobel Prize for their model of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a beautifully symmetric, base-paired double helix. Although the essential elements of their structure are correct, it is now known that DNA structure is not so symmetric or regular. Depending on the sequence, DNA bends and twists, and the major and minor grooves open and close. This conformational heterogeneity is important in gene expression, viral DNA packaging, etc. Conventional models of the origins of this heterogeneity arise from the 'heterocyclic-centric worldview'. This view is based on the premise that direct base-base interactions modulate conformation. An alternative model is that partitioning of cations around DNA is affected by sequence. Conformation is modulated via interactions of time-average uneven cation density with phosphate groups. X-ray diffraction will be used here to correlate cation occupancies with DNA sequence, phosphate positions, conformation, deformation, ionic radii, etc.\r\n\r\n",
