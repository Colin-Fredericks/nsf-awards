A multidisciplinary panel of distinguished scientists working on climate variability, infectious disease and health will come together to accomplish a better understanding of how climatic factors affect the spread of infectious disease. This is critical to improve disease prevention efforts because such knowledge would enhance the ability to predict the health-related effects of both seasonal weather changes and large-scale disturbances such as El Nino. The AAM will develop a report and disseminate the in-depth analysis of the issues and recommendations for future plan of action, to the scientific community, to federal and international agencies, to policy makers, to the press and to the public. The work is important because it will enhance bridges between several disciplines, and serve as an example of an end-to-end application of the basic research undertaken in Climate Dynamics. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
