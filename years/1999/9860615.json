 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860615\r\n      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop methods to synthesize large volumes of two-photon-transition (TPT) materials for 3-D volumetric displays by dispersing rare-earth ion-doped organic complexes in photopolymerizable monomer host. Although volumetric displays based on two-photon up-conversion using rare-earth ion-doped glass have been demonstrated, difficulty in manufacturing glass-based large volume display media has hindered further development. The proposed effort will address this need by developing a low-cost, scalable synthesis method for producing large volumes of TPT materials.  Commercial rare-earth organic complexes will be mixed with liquid monomer, followed by W irradiation to form a solid. Feasibility and scalability of this approach will be demonstrated by producing a hemisphere (6-cm dia.) of Er3+-doped polymer and characterizing the two--photon absorption induced fluorescence. To ensure that newly synthesized material will satisfy system requirements, a 3-D volumetric display system will be designed to determine the concentration and other parameters for the polymer display media.\r\n     Large volume display media will allow 3-D volumetric displays for air/ground traffic control, medical and scientific 3-D visualization and family entertainment, whose market sizes are enormous. Significantly lower-cost, higher ion-density, and scalability to large volume production make photopolymerizable monomers the ideal host materials for such applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
