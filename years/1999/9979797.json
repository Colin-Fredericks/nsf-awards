 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, DC distributed power systems (DPS) have been used extensively in mainframe computer systems, communication systems, aircraft, fighting jets, warships, phased-radar arrays and space vehicles, and lately been used in the construction of the international space station.  In many of today's applications, theoretical issues and design philosophies of power conversion systems are finding their way into practice.  These issues include not only improving efficiency, but ways to reduce cost and complexity of the over all system used to satisfy the electronic system's total performance requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed research are of three folds: 1) To develop a simplified power supply system, namely, high-frequency AC distributed power system to solve main problems of traditional DC-DPS. 2) To research new power conversion techniques that substantially simplfy the design of power factor front-end converters in new AC_DPS, and 3) To develop new modeling techniques for complex distributed power system.\r\n\r\nThe main perceived technical limitations of the proposed AC-DPS are possible high EMI problem and analysis and post-regulator difficulities.  This project will focus on investigation and resolving these issues and others.  Also a comparative research between DC-DPS and AC-DPS will be conducted through simulation an experimental approaches, illustrating the merits and limitations of both approaches.  Another main task on this study is to develop single switch PFC inverters employing similar idea as single switch PFC AC/DC converters.\r\n\r\nExpected research outcomes include *Development of modeling techniques for AC-DPS structure,* reduced power system size and lighter weight; lower cost; higher efficiency; and higher reliability due to simplification.  In additional, the study on single switch PFC inverters will be brought into other applications such as stable cost-effective PFC-AC power supply and UPS etc.",
