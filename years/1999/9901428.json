 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901428\r\nAverett\r\nAn experimental program is underway to study the structure of the\r\nnucleon in terms of quark degrees of freedom at the Thomas Jefferson\r\nNational Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Laboratory).  This research\r\nwill be carried out in two distinct experimental programs.  The first\r\nis the so-called ``G0'' experiment which will use parity violating electron scattering to precisely determine the weak elastic form factors of the proton.  From this measurement, one can extract the strange electric and magnetic form factors which are directly related to the charge and current \r\ndistributions of the strange quarks within the nucleon.  To achieve \r\nthe goal of high precision and broad kinematic coverage of this \r\nexperiment, a dedicated large acceptance and liquid hydrogen target \r\nare being constructed.  Design, prototype studies, and final construction of the detector is the shared responsibility of the Electroweak Spin Physics Group (Finn et al.) and myself at the College of William and Mary and a collaboration of scientists from North America and France.\r\nThe second area of research encompassed by this grant involves\r\nstudies of fundamental properties of the neutron such as the electric\r\nand magnetic form factors, spin structure functions, higher-twist\r\neffects, and tests of the fundamental Drell-Hearn-Gerassimov (GDH) \r\nSum Rule.  In these experiments, polarized electrons are scattered from an \r\noptically pumped, polarized Helium-3 gas target (which serves as a \r\npolarized neutron target), and are subsequently detected using two\r\nhigh resolution spectrometers.  The first two of six approved experiments\r\nusing polarized Helium-3 were successfully completed from August 1998-February 1999.  These measurements provided high precision determinations of the GDH Sum Rule and magnetic form factor for the neutron at low momentum transfer where non-perturbative QCD effects are important.  Data analysis from these first experiments, and polarized target improvements in preparation for the remaining experiments, are currently underway.  Of particular interest is experiment E97-103 (Averett, Korsch et al) which will search for higher twist (non-perturbative QCD) contributions to the deep-inelastic structure function g2 for the neutron at low momentum\r\ntransfer.  This will be accomplished by scattering longitudinally\r\npolarized electrons from a transversely polarized Helium-3 target.  \r\nIt is expected that this experiment will achieve a statistical\r\nerror which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than \r\ncurrent world data and will provide much-needed quantitative guidance\r\nfor future theoretical calculations in this area. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
