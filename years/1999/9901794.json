 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will optimize the performance and durability of high Specific Surface Area (SSA) catalytic coatings for methane combustion, and extend their development into prototype combustor applications.  In Phase I, reduced lightoff temperature and stable operation of methane-fueled catalytic combustor configurations were demonstrated by developing a high surface area coating for a novel Short Channel Length, High Cell Density (SCL-HCD) metal monolith catalyst substrate.  Two catalytic combustor configurations were successfully demonstrated.  During Phase II, more extensive testing of these concepts, both at atmospheric and at high pressure, will be performed with the aim of incorporating the combustor into a gas turbine engine.  Design, applications analysis, and viability assessment through interaction with product design groups at gas turbine manufacturers will be included in this Phase-II effort.\r\n     The successful development of this technology is enabling commercialization of ultra-low emission catalytic combustion technology for natural-gas-fueled gas turbine engines in commercial applications such as distributed power generation and natural gas pipeline compressor drivers.  In addition, developing the high SSA coating has application in fast thermal response SCL-HCD automotive catalytic converters.\r\n",
