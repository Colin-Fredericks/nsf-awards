 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis proposal seeks funding to continue research on political violence in Africa.  With funding from a previous NSF grant, Robert H. Bates assembled a research team of fellow scholars and graduate students.  Among its major accomplishments were the collection and dissemination of a comprehensive set of political and economic data.  A major purpose of the second grant is to keep this team intact, so as to complete the analysis of these data and secure their publication.\r\n\tMore specifically, two objectives motivate this work.  The first is to complete the analysis of data collected on the political economy of 46 African states over the 1970-95 period, as financed by the earlier grant.  The second is to move from the creation of this regional dataset to the creation of an international data bank.  Drawing on the experience gained from the project thus far and mobilizing the resources of the Web, we aim to develop a technology that, among other  things, will promote a constructive interaction between area specialists and those engaged in the broader comparative study of politics.\r\n",
