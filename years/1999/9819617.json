 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional environmental ethical theories and policy practices are based upon the assumption that natural ecosystems are balanced, integrated, stable and in equilibrium. Recently, several ecologists and some philosophers have subjected this assumption to severe criticism that bears far-reaching implications for environmental ethics and policy. For example, wilderness management practices, the Endangered Species Act, the Global Warming Treaty, sustainable development, food and agricultural aid, population policy, pollution control regulation - all this and more rest upon assumptions that human welfare depends upon the maintenance of a fragile ecosystemic \"integrity,\" \"balance\" and \"equilibrium.\" All these assumptions are challenged by \"the new ecology.\"  This research project undertakes three tasks: a)To examine and clarify the meaning of the concepts and therefore the claims of both the \"new\" and the \"old\" ecologists - thus determining just what is, and is not, entailed by these claims. b)To examine the methodology of both contending schools of ecology, and to assess the adequacy of the evidence and the strength of inference offered in support of their claims. c) On the basis of (a) and (b) to articulate the implications (if any) of the new ecology for ethical theories and policy practices that are based upon the concepts and assumptions of \"the old ecology.\"  During the award period, the investigator will teach an interdisciplinary seminar on \"Concepts in Ecology.\" Results will include lectures, colloquium participation, manuscript preparation and submission to journals, and the development of a book.  \r\n",
