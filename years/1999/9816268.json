 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry\r\nProgram.  The Principal Investigator, Professor Edmond Bowden at North\r\nCarolina State University, and his colleagues are addressing fundamental\r\nquestions of electron transport between the heme site of cytochrome\r\nproteins and the organic monolayer modified gold electrode surface.  By\r\nvarying the self-assembled monolayer modification of the gold surface, and\r\nby careful site directed mutation of the cytochrome protein, the effects of\r\nprotein orientation and electron transfer distance are probed in these\r\nstudies.  Spectroscopic characterization of the modified overlayers, using\r\nscanning probe methods, infrared spectroscopy, and photoelectron\r\nspectroscopy, is used to determine overlayer structure and properties.\r\nMutation and selective chemical modification of the protein overlayer is\r\nused to characterize the interaction between the protein and the modified\r\nelectrode surface.  Fundamental information gained from these studies will\r\nbe of use in the subsequent design of biosensors and biomedical devices. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of electron transfer between electrode surfaces and\r\nprotein molecules bound to the surface is important for the design of\r\nantigen specific sensors and bioanalytical methods.  This research project\r\naddresses this electron transfer problem by careful modification and\r\ncharacterization of both the electrode surface and the protein interacting\r\nwith it.  Detailed fundamental information on electron transfer rate\r\nprocesses results from these studies, with direct application to the design\r\nof biosensors. \r\n",
