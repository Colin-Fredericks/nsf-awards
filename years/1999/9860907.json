 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860907\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the material and design changes that are required to build low-cost flywheel energy storage systems for use in polar\r\nenvironments.   Significant progress has been recently made in reducing the cost and complexity of magnetic bearing, vacuum, and motor/generator systems and in low-cost composite flywheel rims.   Material property studies at low temperatures are required to predict the performance of flywheel components over the required operating temperature range of -75  to 130 degrees  Centigrade.   Phase I will test and evaluate composite materials for use in low ambient temperature operations.   Another objective is to design innovative low-cost flywheel rims with satisfactory low temperature performance, using the materials selected in the project.\r\n     It is anticipated that flywheel technology will fulfill the promise of environmentally friendly energy generation and storage when  combined  with emerging high-performance, renewable solar and wind resources.  In addition to  applications in polar regions, large markets are expected in developing countries where construction of a national energy grid is prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\n",
