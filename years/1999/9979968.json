 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project uses an interdisciplinary approach to large-scale educational interventions that provides for the integration of research and education around issues involving the cognitive development of beginning reading skills. Three projects are centered around a large suburban school district in Houston, TX.   The participants are children who receive two types of classroom instruction (N=384) and their teachers (N=40). Within each type of classroom instruction, children are assigned to one of 4 groups (N=48) as part of a 2 (Classroom Instruction) X 4 (Group) design. The 4 groups include a no-risk group and 3 groups of children at risk for reading problems. Children in these 3 groups  receive only classroom instruction or classroom instruction that matches or doesn't match the type of classroom reading instruction. All children will receive longitudinal assessments of growth in reading and reading-related skills, yearly norm-referenced achievement measures, and assessment of behaviour and the home/school environment. The intervention study (project 1) involves: a) identification of children at risk for reading problems in kindergarten; b) providing a controlled study of the efficacy of a first grade educational intervention designed to prevent reading problems in multiple high-risk schools; and c) evaluation of the use of information and computing technologies (ICT) to provide professional development of teachers on the translation of research on reading development into practice. The second project explores neural changes representing reading development using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate a) functional neural changes that occur as reading develops; and b) changes in the neural representation of reading skills as an indicator of response to intervention. The second study involves 120 children from the overall sample assigned to 3 groups (N=40 each): no risk, at-risk interventions; and at-risk classroom instruction. These children receive MEG evaluations before and after grade 1 and after grade 2. The final project addresses decodability skills and evaluates: a) how lexical and text characteristics of the basal reading programs used in archival intervention studies relate to student outcomes;  b) psycholinguistic factors that moderate the impact of decodability; and c) the relationships of reading instruction in project 1 at classroom and intervention levels to the child's ability to read texts with pre-specified lexical and text characteristics. This study uses both archival data and will also collect monthly prospective data involving preconstructed textual material on the entire sample of 384 children.",
