 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMating stimulates egg laying in Drosophila, as in other insects.  We have shown that this stimulation is caused by seminal fluid proteins received by the female.  Dr. Wolfner has focused on one such protein, Acp26Aa that is evolutionarily related to hormones that stimulate egg laying by mollusks.  She showed that Acp26Aa increases ovulation in mated flies and that it is present in the female's reproductive tract and circulatory system after mating.\r\n\r\nShe will identify parts of Acp26Aa that are required for its activity.  She will also determine whether Acp26Aa exerts its effects from within the genital tract or via targets reached from the circulatory system.  She will survey known signaling molecules to identify the one(s) modulated by Acp26Aa.  Her results will characterize an important modulator of ovulation, and will begin to establish the molecular cascades that control a central reproductive process in a genetically tractable insect.  This research will also add significance to evolutionary questions and potentially to the design of biologically rational insect pest controls\r\n",
