Ladeinde and J-C Han\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObtaining first-rate performance and desirable thermodynamic and propulsive duty from gas turbine engines has invariably led to the use of higher inlet temperatures. Unfortunately, however, a severe problem is created by this industry trend, which are the increased heat load to the turbine components and the consequent thermal damage to the blades. The proposed work has the objective of addressing this issue using an integrated effort that combines high performance direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the relevant equations at SUNY Stony Brook, and experimental studies to validate the numerical models at the Turbine Heat Transfer Laboratory of Texas A & M. The proposed DNS study will be carried out on the IBM SP/2 supercomputer at the NSF-supported NPACI program at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, to take advantage of its massive parallelization. The ranges of the various parameters to be investigated are within those which are relevant to realistic engines. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are planned to answer fundamental heat transfer-related questions concerning the measure of transition, the reliability of existing transition models, the crucial effects of free-stream turbulence intensity, length scale, heat transfer, Reynolds number, and Mach number. The precise mechanisms responsible for heat transfer will be identified and current turbine blade turbulence heat flux and Reynolds stress models will be evaluated and improved or discarded. The gas turbine industry is at the core of aerospace technology, power generation, and transportation and successful research is expected to lead to improvements in efficiency and reduction in emissions. Both the DOE advanced turbine system program (ATS) and the DOD integrated high performance turbine engine technology program (IHPTET), will benefit from this proposed work.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n",
