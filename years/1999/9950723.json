 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands the area of Dynamic Systems and Control in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering disciplines at The University of Texas at El Paso.  Student learning is to be enhanced by:\r\n1.  incorporating laboratory experiments into the present lecture-only Electrical Engineering (EE) Controls course, and \r\n2. by updating the current set of Mechanical Engineering (ME) Controls laboratory experiments. \r\n\r\nThe new laboratory is adapted from a Controls laboratory concept that was originally implemented  at The University of Texas - Pan American.  Several changes to the original formulation result in an improvement in the laboratory's functional and cost effectiveness.  Students in the two (EE and ME) Controls courses will use state-of-the-art software and hardware in this lab to:\r\n1. practice a model-based simulation-oriented approach to control systems design and development, and \r\n2. implement Digital Signal Processor (DSP)-based controllers and physically demonstrate their implemented controllers on both educational and industrial hardware, such as electromechanical actuators, inverted pendulums and simple robots.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to increase the number of underrepresented minority students and graduates in the field of Engineering.  Actual and/or videotape demonstrations of the more 'exciting' experiments as well as dissemination on the World Wide Web will be carried out to motivate lower-level Engineering students and to influence pre-college students in the region (the majority of whom are Hispanic) to study Engineering.  Finally, this project serves as an improved Dynamic Systems and Control model for other schools.\r\n",
