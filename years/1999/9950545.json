 "awd_abstract_narration": "Service-Learning Practices have been widely adapted in other disciplines in higher education, but very few in geology.  We have adapted Service-Learning Practices in upper-division undergraduate Earth Science courses from the model set forth by Mogk and King (J. of Geological Education, 1995) who used this approach in their lower-division geology classes.   We have upgraded our existing geophysical equipment enabling the curriculum in a number of upper-division undergraduate courses to be modified for adapting student-centered learning by studying community-based problems.  The upgrades include a DC resistivity meter, a  12-channel seismometer to 48 channels, and the real-time kinematics (RTK) function to 2 Trimble 4000 SSI GPS receivers.  The improvement of lab equipment  impacts 120 undergraduates and the research of faculty and graduate students.  This equipment is used in at least eight upper-division undergraduate courses offered by the Department of Geology and Geophysics, two by the Department of Geography, and two hydrogeology courses taught at the Environmental Earth Science Department, Eastern Connecticut State University.   The RTK GPS receivers  are used in developing new mapping techniques and in increasing the University's ability to provide outreach service to the surrounding communities.  Some of our service-learning projects at the local community scale include 1) geological and environmental feature mapping; 2) groundwater and soil investigation associated with environmental protection; and 3) geotechnical investigation associated with construction and development. The proposed adaptations have stimulated multi-lateral interactions among undergraduates, and between undergraduates and graduates, students and faculty, students and engineering professionals, as well the educational institution and the local community.",
