Large collections of mini robots, fabricated using rapidly evolving robotic technology will perform useful coordinated work, including small scale actuation and repair, transport of small artifacts, active manipulation of surface properties, etc.\r\n\r\nTo create flexible, robust, and autonomous robotic systems capable of such applications, a fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science-base for self-reconfiguring robotics.  This is a considerable challenge, which is being met through (1) new designs for reconfigurable\r\nsystems and (2) new ideas on algorithmic planning and control that can confer autonomous reconfigurability.  This kind of reconfigurable robotics science will greatly enhance the autonomous capabilities of distributed robotic systems.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the central challenges for this work are to (1) design and build simple modules that can self-reconfigure in three dimensions; (2) build distributed robot systems using these modules; (3) develop and implement centralized as well as distributed planning algorithms and\r\ncontrol systems that allow a set of modules to self-reconfigure as any desired static or dynamic geometric structures; (4) analyze the dynamic stability and fault tolerance of self-reconfiguring structures during motion; and (5) demonstrate the applicability of this technology through experiments in versatile locomotion and manipulation, and self-repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
