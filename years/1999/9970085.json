 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grayson\r\n9970085\r\n     Grayson and his colleague Stillman collaborate in developing\r\nthe computer software system Macaulay 2, a symbolic computer\r\nalgebra program that supports large scale research computing\r\nprojects dealing with systems of polynomial equations in many\r\nvariables.  The program's many functions depend mainly on\r\nvariants of the Groebner basis algorithm for computing standard\r\nbases and syzygies of ideals and modules over polynomial rings.\r\nThe results yield quantitative and qualitative information about\r\nsolutions of such systems of equations.  In this project the\r\ninvestigators develop new algorithms, improve existing algorithms\r\nand implementations, improve the documentation, add new features,\r\nimprove the program's efficiency, and make it more useable.  They\r\nalso provide a web-accessible computation server to facilitate\r\ncontributions from and collaborations between the Internet-based\r\ncommunity of users.  These interchanges improve the algorithms\r\nand scope of Macaulay 2.  Stillman also continues his research in\r\ncomputational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, as well\r\nas into problems involving generalized Green's conjectures,\r\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity, toric varieties and binomial\r\nideals.  Grayson also continues his research into algebraic\r\nK-theory concerning the connection between algebraic K-theory and\r\nmotivic cohomology as mediated by filtrations of the K-theory\r\nspace.\r\n     The goal of this project is to turn Macaulay 2 into the\r\npremiere collaborative research tool for mathematicians and\r\nothers around the world whose work involves systems of polynomial\r\nequations.  Such research is important because systems of\r\npolynomial equations arise whenever mathematics is used as a tool\r\nin science, for example, in engineering, in physics, and in\r\nbiology.  The project extends the algorithms, efficiency, and\r\nscope of Macaulay 2, provides an Internet server for users, and\r\nprovides an Internet-based forum for users to contribute Macaulay\r\n2 packages and to collaborate on the solution of mathematics and\r\napplications problems.  The project also involves the training of\r\nstudents in both mathematics and symbolic computation.\r\n",
