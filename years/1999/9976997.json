In plants, as in other sessile organisms, the ability of developmental systems to respond to variations in ecological cues permits flexibility in the face of changing environmental conditions. This plasticity may be considered adaptive if differing phenotypes confer high relative fitness in the specific environments they experience. For adaptive plasticity to evolve, natural selection on the trait of interest must differ among environments, and there must be genetic variation in the plastic response of that trait to those environments. Very little is known, however, about the specific genes underlying variation in morphological phenotypes to diverse ecological cues or how natural selection acts upon those genes in the wild. Understanding the genetic architecture of developmental plasticity is critical to resolving the current debate among evolutionary biologists regarding the genetic mechanisms that lead to adaptive evolution of plasticity. Dissecting the genetic mechanisms underlying morphological plasticity is equally important for gaining insight into the evolution of developmental pathways currently under intense scrutiny at the molecular level.\r\n\r\nAn integrated, comprehensive research program to study the molecular evolutionary ecology of plasticity. We will focus on the changes in inflorescence architecture and life history traits associated with ecologically relevant variation in photoperiod in the model wild plant Arabidopsis thaliana is proposed.  They will identify genes associated with naturally-occurring variation in inflorescence development and its ecological plasticity under different light regimes, examine the population dynamics of these loci at the molecular level, and explore the genetic architecture of these traits in natural environments. In this integrated research program, they  will specifically: (1) examine the genetic architecture of inflorescence traits in Arabidopsis thaliana and its plasticity under differing photoperiod regimes, (2) use QTL mapping approaches to identify positional candidate loci that affect these traits both under controlled conditions and natural environments, (3) examine the molecular population genetics of the developmental pathway that underlie inflorescence differentiation, (4) probe the extent to which naturally occurring variation at the molecular level among specific loci are associated with diversity in trait phenotypes in wild populations, (5) explore the role of individual loci in plasticity responses, and (6) test for natural selection at specific loci in the wild. Their  efforts will integrate QTL mapping, molecular population biology, ecological genomics, evolutionary ecology and developmental biology by examining selection at both phenotypic and molecular levels.\r\n",
