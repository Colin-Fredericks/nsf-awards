 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II will develop a continuous manufacturing process from powder preparation through mechanical deformation and heat treatment for BSSCCO-2212 wires and tapes.  It is expected that long length multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 with micro-size filaments will be  cost/performance competitive with Nb3Sn.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a cost-effective, high performance multi-filamentary BSCCO-2212/silver alloy wire with filament diameters of 2-4 microns by using partially automated BSCCO-2212 chemical preparation and a continuous heat treatment.  Phase II will concentrate on complete automation of the powder process through calcination and optimization of the continuous heat treatment for long conductors.  The powder process will be further optimized based on Phase I results which indicate that nano-sized BSCCO-2212 particles may result.   A  cost minimization study will be performed on lesser purity materials, the effect of automation on labor costs, and the reduction of overall processing times.  Alternative packaging methods for BSSCO powders will be investigated to defeat carbon uptake, improve ease of handling, and control packing density in the wires.\r\n     Commercial availability of cost effective, high-performance, multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wires will enable the production of a new generation of electric power transformers and high field magnets or magnet inserts capable of operation at fields in excess of 20 Tesla.  These devices will impact the economic efficiency of the electric power industry as well as future developments in high energy physics, advanced MRI (or NMR) analysis, and energy storage devices. \r\n",
