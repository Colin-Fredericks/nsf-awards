 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to understand the inherent mechanical properties of full-density nanocrystalline metallic alloys. Continuing on with our recent progress in devloping procedures to consolidate mechanicallu milled nanophase metal and alloy powders into full-density samples, this work expands the investigation on basic properties to a number of elemental and two phase materials. To systematically investigate the intrinsic mechanical response, nanophase and ultrafine-grained metals and alloys will be prepared with special care taken to minimize porosity and particle debonding problems. Testing will be conducted in compression and tension. Fundamental deformation behavior and mechanisms will be studies. In particular, dislocation structure and behavior in single-and two-phase alloys, before and after deformation, inside grains and near interfaces (grain vs. phase boundaries), will be characterized and monitored over a range of grain sizes. The strain hardening and shear banding behavior and their dependence on composition and grain size will be investigated and compared with those found in conventional materials. The strengthening effects of interphase boundaries in multi-phase alloys will be characterized and modeled. Nanocrystalline metals and multi-phase alloys with a useful combination of mechanical properties will be demonstrated.***",
