 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compiler Support for Advanced Computer Architectures\r\n\r\nCompilers are essential to the spectacular advances in the speed of model microprocessors.  To acccelerate  programs, both compilers and microprocessors identify, and then hide, potential execution bottlenecks.   Despite well-designed memory systems, placing and keeping needed data in the fastest locations is problematic.   This proposal will investigate a number of compiler-based techniques that identify and hide or eliminate a variety of execution bottlenecks:\r\n\r\n (1) When memory delays are encountered, techniques that predict expected data values can be invoked. This allows computation based on predicted values during memory delays. Techniques that simultaneously handle of number of possible result values during memory delays will be studied. These techniques enhance the accuracy of predictions, utilizing effectively the computational resources of microcomputers.\r\n\r\n(2) Modern microprocessor designs extend the size and capabilities of registers (local memory). This proposal will enhance previous allocation results to handle extended register sets. Faster and more effective user programs will result.\r\n\r\n(3) Compilers improve program performance by identifying computations that are fixed (invariant) within a program. This proposal will extend compilers to handle nearly-invariant computations that span a limited range of values.  Underutilized computational resources can be employed to anticipate and precompute such values.\r\n\r\n",
