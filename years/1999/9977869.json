 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe disposal of excess spoil created by mining operations is usually accomplished by placing this material in valley fills, hundreds of which are now in existence.  The Federal Office of Surface Mining, as well as state regulatory authorities, regulate the stability of these structures.\r\n\r\nThis action concerns the stability of one of these excess spoil fills: It is being closely monitored due to concern that failure may occur as a result of spring rains.  This project includes the installation of a comprehensive deformation monitoring system on this fill, investigating water movement through the fill, testing soil samples from the site, and monitoring the ground water table in the vicinity of seeps and wet areas of the surface of the fill.\r\n\r\nData from this case study will advance understanding of the mechanism of slope failure, and the development of new design standards.  It has received strong support from government agencies and the local community.\r\n\r\n",
