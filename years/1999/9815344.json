The continuation of this project expands statistical \r\nresearch to the entire spectrum of scientific activity at NCAR and in so doing, \r\nestablishes a permanent statistics group at this research center. The richness \r\nof geophysical measurements pose substantive research problems in statistical \r\nscience and continue to challenge the boundaries of statistics. Some broad areas \r\nof research include modeling and inference for spatial and spatial/temporal \r\nprocesses, statistical design, inverse problems, statistical computing, and \r\nfunctional data analysis. These statistical topics have many direct applications \r\nto the geophysical sciences, including the detection of climate change, \r\nimprovement of numerical models, prediction of severe weather, and design of \r\nfield experiments.\r\n\tThe primary purpose of the Geophysical Statistics Program (GSP) at the \r\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is to promote collaboration \r\nbetween the statistical and geophysical sciences. NCAR, base-funded by the \r\nNational Science Foundation, is a focal point for basic research on the \r\natmosphere and has strong links to universities throughout North America. The \r\ncomplexity of problems in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences (e.g., large \r\nnumbers of variables and massive data sets) indicates that statistics could make \r\nimportant contributions. There is also a broader benefit to statistics and \r\nmathematical sciences. New statistical methods, motivated by geophysical \r\nproblems, can be transferred to other areas which consider spatiotemporal data \r\nand the output of numerical models.  Besides these benefits to the scientific \r\nfields involved, this collaborative research would result in potential benefits \r\nto society. For instance, it could lead to improved weather and climate \r\nforecasts, as well as to more reliable quantification of uncertainty in global \r\nclimate change studies. Such information should be of substantial value to \r\ndecision makers and policy analysts.\r\n",
