The\r\nprincipal investigator will work on the geometric realization of these\r\ncategories in terms of sheaves on configuration spaces.  In\r\nparticular, he will work on a geometric construction of the unitary\r\ninner product in such categories, which is extremely important for\r\nphysical applications.  He will study the combinatorial identities\r\nthat arise, generalizing Macdonald's inner product identities to\r\naffine root systems.  The principal investigator will also work on a \r\nbook containing an accurate and complete exposition of the theory of\r\ntensor categories, modular functors, and topological quantum field\r\ntheory, using as the main example the category of representations of\r\nquantum groups at roots of unity, whose physical counterpart is the\r\nWess-Zumino-Witten modular functor.\r\n     This study is in the general area of representation theory of Lie\r\nalgebras and related objects, or, more generally, mathematical\r\nstructures appearing in physics (conformal field theory).  This is a\r\nvery actively developing field, in which mathematics is greatly\r\nenriched with the new ideas and intuition coming from physics.\r\nUnfortunately, sometimes there is a large gap between the physical\r\nideas and mathematically rigorous construction or proof, which can\r\ntake years to fill.  This project should fill some of these gaps and\r\npave the way to new mathematical discoveries.\r\n***\r\n",
