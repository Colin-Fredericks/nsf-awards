 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isoetes is a genus of fern allies known as quillworts found throughout much of the world except in arid regions.  Not surprisingly, quillworts are rare in the Middle east, and represented only by three species.  Outside of the Bursa region of Turkey, the endemic Middle east Quillwort (Isoetes olympica) is found only in a single pool in the Jebel Druze in Syria.  The Jebel Druz is a series of ancient volcanoes in southern Syria near Jordon border, and has the highest rate of endemism in Syria and surrounding regions.  It is becoming increasingly impacted by habitat destruction and human intrusion.  The taxonmic status of Isoetes olympica in Syria is unclear and may represent an isolated population long diverged from sister species.  This project is designed to survey the distrubtion and abundance of existing Syrian populations of Isoetes olympica, make cytogenetic, ultrastructural, and molecular studies of the morphological and genetic characteristics, and to curate tissue and herbarium specimens of this threatened species.  This project is funded through the Small Grant for Exploratory Research program which provides small-scale support for high-risk, time-sensitive research.\r\n",
