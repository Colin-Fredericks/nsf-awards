 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular chaperones are proteins, often ATPases, that influence the folding and conformation of proteins.  Chaperones have been implicated in the process whereby proteins are translocated across membranes.  The long term goals of Dr. Chirico's laboratory are to understand how chaperones work and how they promote the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins from the cytosol into organelles.  Attention is being focused on the cytosolic 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) molecular chaperones, because they play a central role in protein folding and translocation.  Hsp70s are ATPases that participate in a variety of cellular pathways involving protein-protein interactions.  They use the energy of binding and hydrolysis of ATP to regulate their oligomeric structure and their interactions with polypeptide substrates.  Protein modulators, such as DnaJ homologs, regulate Hsp70 activity.  In the eukaryotic cytosol an Hsp70 and a compatible DnaJ homolog are sufficient to refold denatured proteins.\r\n\r\nMost proteins exported from eukaryotic cells pass through the secretory pathway.  The first step in this pathway is the translocation of a precursor protein from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum.  Although presecretory proteins are usually translocated into endoplasmic reticulum co-translationally, in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, some presecretory proteins, for example prepro-alpha-factor (ppaf), are translocated post-translationally.  Post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins is mediated by cytosolic, membrane-bound, and lumenal proteins.  In S. cerevisiae the cytosolic components include the Hsp70 Ssa1p and the DnaJ homolog Ydj1p.  The membrane-bound components include a translocation apparatus composed of the heterotrimeric Sec61p complex and four other proteins.  One of the lumenal components is the Hsp70 homolog Kar2p.\r\n\r\nAlthough results from in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that Ssa1p and Ydj1p play important and interacting roles in protein translocation, the mechanism of action remains largely unknown.  We hypothesize that Ssa1p and Ydj1p maintain the translocation competence of ppaf and deliver it to at least one component of the membrane-bound translocation apparatus for subsequent translocation.  The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which Ssa1p and Ydj1p cooperate in the post-translational translocation of ppaf into the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast.  These experiments will shed new light on Hsp70/DnaJ homolog interactions and, therefore, will also interest those studying chaperone-dependent protein folding and precursor protein import into mitochondria.  The specific aims are to determine the roles of Ssa1p and Ydj1p in post-translational translocation, characterize the interactions involving Ssa1p, Ydj1p, and ppaf, determine the sequence of chaperone interactions, and determine the topography of chaperone-dependent post-translational translocation.  The work will be done using biochemical approaches, including in vitro reconstitution of translocation into microsomes.  \r\n\r\n",
