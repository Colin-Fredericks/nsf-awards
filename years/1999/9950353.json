 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College of Philadelphia is developing a new freshman and sophomore engineering core curriculum by adapting and implementing the Enhacement Educational experience for Engineers  (E4) and The engineering Test, Design, and Simulation Laboratory (ETDSL) pioneered by Drexel University.\r\n\r\nE4 and ETDSL give students an experience of real engineering work early in their education.  Students learn the materials needed for engineering practice and retention in the program.  In the traditional curriculum, students learn much of this material by rote memorization without putting it into practice.  This project also enhaces the national need to recruit more minority students into SMET.  As a large, comprehensive urban community college, successful adaption of this program will serve as a model for other community colleges.\r\n\r\nE4 calls for the design, development and testing of an engineering core curriculum emphasizing interdisciplinary sicentific foundations:  the pivotal role of experimentation; the transcendent role of the computer; the imperative for superior communication skills; the importance of teamwork and the habit of vigorous life-long learning; and the role of design as the defining element of professional practice.  This proposal addresses the DUE themes of faculty development, diversity, and integration of technology into education.\r\n\r\nE4 and ETDSL will be adapted to an urban, community college seytting through: (1) the development of two new courses using the E4 aproach and the simulation laboratory; (2) the revision of four existing courses to utilize the the ETSDL approach; (3) a provision of faculty development on E4 and ETSDL; (4) retention of 80% of disadvantaged students in the engineering major by providing a positive educational experience to the students enrolled or interested in engineering; and (5) initiation of two addtional articulation agreements with four years schools offering a baccalaureate in engineering.",
