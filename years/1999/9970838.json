 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970838\r\nBrock\r\nCornell University will construct a new ultra-high flux synchrotron x-ray beamlines (the G-lines) with three experimental stations optimized to study dynamically evolving materials, including thin film growth, patterned surfaces, electrochemical interfaces, polymers, liquid crystals, biomaterials, and systems with novel electronic properties.  The beamlines, which will be among the highest flux beamlines in the world, will make use of previously unused radiation produced by the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR); the NSF-supported high-energy physics ring which feeds CHESS (Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source).  Upgrades planned for CESR in the coming year provide a rare window of opportunity to construct new beamlines without interrupting the high-energy physics or CHESS x-ray user programs.  Cornell University will provide the estimated $2.1M for the underground construction needed to house the new beamlines and x-ray stations.\r\n\r\nCentral to this proposal is the recognition that operating an x-ray source, designing, building and supporting beamlines, and carrying out frontier research programs in materials research requires dedicated multi-discplinary teams with diverse talents.  A second motivation is the central campus location of the beamlines, which allows a level of training and involvment of all levels of students which is otherwise difficult to achieve.  To fulfill the goals of this proposal in a cost- and time-effective manner, this project will draw on the combined expertise and interests of the Cornell faculty, students and CHESS staff, their strong tradition of working in multi-disciplinary teams, and the many special experimental facilities at Cornell that create a comprehensive educational environment for the study of materials growth, processing, and characterization.\r\n\r\nThe beamlines will form a nexus among the various major materials research facilities on the Cornell campus that fall under the auspices of the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR).  Newly formed, CCMR grew out of the NSF-funded MRSEC (formerly MRL) and now coordinates materials research facilities across the campus.  Although the new beamlines will be operated separately from the existing CHESS beamlines, CCMR and CHESS will work closely to coordinate the technical and scientific operations of G-line.  In exchange for its help in construction and support, CHESS will utilize some 20% of the station time for its outside user program.\r\n\r\nAmong the benefits accruing from the successful execution of this proposal are (1) The creation of a unique educational environment to train the materials-oriented synchrotron radiation scientists of tomorrow; (2) The construction of a powerful x-ray resource that will result in new insights into the dynamical evolution of materials in technologically important areas, and (3) An increase in availability of CHESS, a highly successful and over-subscribed national facility.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences), and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences).\r\n\r\n",
