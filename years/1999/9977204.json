 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract 9977204\r\n\r\nThis award will be used to purchase a Zeiss model LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope for research in the Department of Biology at the University of Utah. Research programs in the Biology Department require features or capabilities available on the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, including: the ability to collect multiple fluorescence channels and transmitted light simultaneously; enhanced sensitivity; enhanced resolution of wide-field images provided by the 1024 x 1024 pixel array; and the ability to scan selected regions of interest. The confocal microscope will be fully equipped with up-to-date features, including: argon ion and He/Ne lasers for multi-wavelength excitation; detectors for simultaneous imaging of three fluorescence channels; transmitted light detector; differential interference optics; and software for 3-D reconstruction from serial optical sections. The confocal microscope will also be configured for future addition of a pulsed infrared laser for multi-photon microscopy of living cells and/or organisms.\r\n\tThe Zeiss confocal microscope will become part of the Biological Imaging Facility in the Biology Department at the University of Utah, replacing an aging Biorad MRC-600 confocal microscope. The Biological Imaging Facility is a core facility used by members of the Biology Department and other departments at the University of Utah. As part of the core imaging facility, the instrument will have a dramatic impact on the research programs of more than forty individual investigators, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students, and technical personnel from at least sixteen different laboratories in the Biology Department. These investigators will use the confocal microscope to study a variety of organisms encompassing major taxa of plants (Arabidopsis), fungi (yeast), algae (brown algae), invertebrates (nematode worms, fruit flies, grasshoppers, and moths), and vertebrates (amphibians, electric fish, birds). Four major users will employ the instrument in their investigations of: (1) the organization, regulation, and role of the cytoskeleton during oogenesis and early development in frogs; (2) the role of the cytoskeleton and cell wall during early development of brown algae; (3) neurogenesis and connectivity in C. elegans (worms) and grasshoppers; and (4) the genetics of synapse formation and function in Drosophila (fruit flies). The instrument will also be available to other investigators in the Colleges of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, making it a University-wide resource for basic research.\r\n\tIn addition to its research mission, the Zeiss confocal microscope will have a major impact on education and research training at all levels. More than thirty postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students are expected to be trained in the operation of the instrument and use it in conducting their research. The Director of the Biological Imaging Facility will also teach a course on the theory and application of modern imaging techniques, including confocal microscopy, in biological research to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. Finally, demonstrations of the confocal microscope and its application in biological research will be featured in outreach programs directed at elementary and secondary school students, teachers, and parents. In summary, the instrument will provide substantial benefits to basic research and education in the Biology Department at the University of Utah.\r\n",
