The goal of NSF 99-68 is to address this need and to develop fourth generation (4G) high information capacity wireless mobile communication systems which are characterized by high throughput, mixed traffic, high data rates and wide bandwidth up to 60 GHz. We propose to study the direct conversion digital receiver as shown in Fig. 1 where the 60 GHz signal will be mixed down to I to 2 GHz IF signal via HBT VCO technology. The digital receivers can be used to receive any type of modulation standard including analog (AM, FM) or digital (QPSK, QAM, FSK, GMSK, etc.). Furthermore, the same receiver can be used for both analog and digitally modulated signals. Tuning is performed using a digital down converter (DDQ and filter chip called a channelizer. Since the direct conversion digital receiver performs analog to digital conversion directly from the modulated bandpass signal to maximize the modulated signal bandwidth, the user can eliminate most of the front-end RF components and perform the same function using more reliable digital components. The high speed data stream thus created is then presented to a digital demodulator which separates the individual channels and extracts the modulated information. The efforts in the design of integrated circuits for wireless communication receivers have focused on developing suitable ADC architectures and efficient circuit implementation techniques as well as associated device technologies. However, results reported so far have been insufficient to meet the required specification for 4G wireless mobile communication application due to their speed and resolution limitations.\r\n\r\n4G wireless mobile communication systems require high-data rates as well as wide bandwidth. To meet 4G requirement, the input bandwidth of the ADC should be sufficiently flat to prevent distortions and non-linearities in the resulting digital representation. Thus a high-resolution, high-speed analog to digital converter (ADC) becomes the most important hardware element in successfully developing this communication system. Therefore, we propose a new Giga-sampling analog to digital converter with the following specifications: 2.5 W power consumption, 15 bit resolution, 90 dB SFDR, 84 dB SINAD (Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio), and 14 ENOB at 1.5 GHz using a novel ADC architecture, the folding and interpolation based 15 bit subranging A/D converter. This ADC requires the development of 200 GHz fT InGaP/GaAs or InGaAs/InP HBT process. By achieving these specifications, we may reach data rates equivalent to 22.5 Giga bits/sec. No existing ADC product is currently available which is compatible with the proposed target.\r\n\r\n",
