 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of the research is to create more efficient\r\npropagators for atomistic computer simulations\r\nand thus to make possible more ambitious scientific calculations.\r\nNew deterministic and stochastic algorithms for both dynamics and sampling\r\nare to be constructed using such techniques as operator splitting, modified\r\nenergy functions that compensate for finite steps,\r\nand optimization of method parameters, together with physical insight.\r\nPromising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses\r\nand computer experiments.  Tools for mathematical analysis include the\r\nconcept of effective accuracy, the method of modified equations, linear\r\nanalysis, and KAM theory.  Computer experiments are performed on model\r\nproblems chosen to reveal unambiguously the properties of interest.\r\nFaster algorithms are to be implemented in molecular modeling software\r\nbeing developed for widespread use in a couple of projects at the\r\nUniversity of Illinois Beckman Institute.  Most of the work is\r\nsufficiently general that is transfers to other types of problems such\r\nas occur in astrophysics, wave phenomena, and mechanical engineering.\r\nAnd many of the techniques can be abstracted and applied to generic problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nComputer simulations of atomic detail are heavily employed in physics,\r\nchemistry, materials science, and structural biology.\r\nThese calculations require the generation of sequences of atomic\r\nconfigurations either for the purpose of modeling actual motion or for the\r\npurpose of calculating averaged values and structures\r\nfrom a wide range of representative samples.  The computing time ranges\r\nfrom hours to months, so it can benefit tremendously from faster algorithms.\r\nIt is the objective of this research project to do this:\r\nto create much more efficient propagators for dynamics\r\nand sampling that reliably achieve acceptable levels of accuracy.\r\nThe construction of such algorithms employs ideas from mathematics\r\nand computer science together with physical insight.\r\nPromising algorithms are tested and compared using\r\nmathematical analyses and computer experiments.\r\nThe successful ones are implemented in molecular modeling software\r\nbeing developed for widespread use in a couple of projects at the University\r\nof Illinois Beckman Institute.  These advances in methodology are also to be\r\ndisseminated in articles targeted to practitioners.\r\nMany of the techniques will apply not only to molecular simulations\r\nbut also to simulations in astrophysics, structural mechanics, and fluids.\r\nPotentially, the availability of accelerated propagation algorithms\r\nwill lead to a variety of scientific results that otherwise would not be\r\nobtained.  The performance of the research will be\r\na valuable interdisciplinary experience for a graduate student.\r\n\r\n",
