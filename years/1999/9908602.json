The project has three major components:  (1) focused and sustained work with teachers, administrators, school boards, parents and the public in strategically located current and potential NSF-supported Local Systemic Change communities; (2) the development and implementation of mathematics sessions and materials designed for parents/public and informed by the project's research/findings, and the preparation of teacher leaders and administrators to conduct these sessions within their own communities; and  (3) dissemination conferences and other outreach activities.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the project will  (a) engage in studies that identify the elements critical for successful intervention with parents and the public,  (b) develop materials that can be used by lead teachers and other educational leaders to work with peer teachers and the broader public in their home communities, and  (c) provide the professional development necessary to support implementation.  The plan of work for the project is designed around the following questions:     \r\n\r\n(1) What does it take to secure a public that is knowledgeable of issues in mathematics education and knowledgeable of what it means to teach important and relevant mathematics for understanding?\r\n(2) Will a knowledgeable public support and/or actively advocate for mathematics reform?  If so, what is the nature of their advocacy?\r\n(3) What impact will a knowledgeable and/or proactive public have on the efforts of current and potential Local Systemic Change (LSC) projects to improve the quality of mathematics instruction in schools?\r\n(4) Are there critical times during mathematics restructuring efforts when parent engagement is essential?  If so, what are those times and what is the nature of support needed?\r\n(5) What are the critical issues and caveats that need to be considered in designing and delivering successful mathematics education sessions for parents and the public?\r\n(6) What kinds of public engagement can best be accomplished by teacher leaders working within their own communities?  What kinds of support do local leaders need in order to work successfully with parents and the public?\r\n(7) What kinds of public engagement can best be accomplished by national mathematics education leaders who come into a community on a limited basis?\r\n\r\nThe work to be performed in the project is a carefully designed effort to develop a more practice-based understanding of the critical elements needed for productive public involvement in support of quality mathematics.  Sites participating in the plan of work are Portland (OR), St. Vrain (CO), and San Francisco (CA).  Resources and tools (e.g., deliverables) planned include professional development materials that can be used by teacher leaders and administrators as they work with peer teachers, as well as with parents and the public; rough-cut video tapes that are potentially useful in these professional development sessions; and a website.  \r\n\r\nCost sharing is derived from participating school districts and the Exxon and Intel Foundations.       \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n",
