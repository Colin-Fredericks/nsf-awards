 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tCritics and proponents of the International Monetary Fund attribute to it a great deal of influence over the economic strategies of post-Communist countries; yet, both qualitative and quantitative studies of the role of the Fund in the developing world suggest that its influence is actually quite limited.  Is the IMF capable of filling the role of manager of the post-Communist transition, a sort of central bank of last resort that lends credibility to economic reform policies, or is this role too ambitious to assign to a politicized international organization?  The objective of this project is to address this question by advancing the theoretical and empirical frontiers of our understanding of the politics of adjustment lending.\r\n\tThis project provides a unique combination of research methods:  formal, game-theoretic modeling, quantitative empirical analysis, and detailed qualitative research in four countries.  The combination of diverse methodologies strengthens each:  theory becomes empirically informed and relevant, quantitative tests become more precise and better specified, and qualitative research becomes theory-driven.\r\n\tThe project starts with a coherent theory of why the IMF might be able to influence economic policies, as embodied in a game-theoretic model.  The model embeds the interaction between a borrowing government and the Fund in an infinite repeated non-cooperative game between the government and a market.  The Fund has influence in the model because it can help uncoordinated market actors to coordinate on equilibrium strategies that create incentives for governments to practice fiscal and monetary restraint.  The model incorporates dynamic political constraints, institutional differences between countries, and the political influence of the borrowers on the Executive Board of the IMF.\r\n\tThe second stage of the project involves detailed historical research on the relations between the IMF and Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Bulgaria.  Tracing out the process by which agreements are negotiated and implemented and assessing the impact of elections, institutional variations across countries, and interference by advanced industrial countries help to establish a prima facie case for (or against) the external validity of the model.  At the same time, this qualitative research guards against the danger of overlooking essential variables, since much of the research consists of interviews with participants who have their own theories about how events unfold.\r\n\tThe third stage is an extensive effort to gather data and analyze them using new methods developed specifically for testing game-theoretic models.  Two new, cross-sectional time-series datasets are developed.  One covers the 27 post-Communist countries that have borrowed from the IMF using monthly data between 1990 and 1998.  The second is a global dataset that covers 104 countries and uses monthly data for the period from 1972 to 1998.  Each of these datasets is much more detailed and extensive than any that have been used to assess the effectiveness of IMF intervention in the past, and each incorporates a wider array of economic and political variables.  The datasets are made publicly available, and represent a significant scholarly resource.\r\n\t \r\n",
