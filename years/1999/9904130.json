Butler of the University of Iowa and Helena Tlaskalova of the Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, features refinement of a swine model for B-cell lymphogenesis.  Research over the last decade revealed significant differences in the organization of the immune system among different animals.  These differences are reflected in the number and organization of the genes or gene segments encoding their antibody molecules and in the mechanisms and organs used in antibody repertoire development.  This international project builds upon the Iowa expertise in genetics and molecular biology and Czech expertise in cellular immunology.  Both laboratories use the same animal model, swine. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this collaborative effort is to establish the site of primary B-cell lymphogenesis using a combination of in situ immunohistochemistry and molecular biology as well as surface phenotypic and molecular biological analysis of lymphocytes isolated from various sources.  B-cell development will also be monitored in secondary lymphoid tissues throughout fetal development and in piglets reared under various conditions in isolator units.  Among the issues addressed will be whether the bone marrow is a site of continuous B-cell development as in mice and humans and to what extent B-cells in the thymus differ from those in other lymphoid tissues.    Results are expected to broaden fundamental understanding of B-cell lymphogenesis and pre- and post-immune repertoire development in another mammalian system.  If successful, these studies should expand overall concepts of immunological development in warm-blood animals and specifically advance knowledge of gene coding for the immunogobulin protein.\r\n\r\nThis project in signal transduction fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. \r\n\r\n",
