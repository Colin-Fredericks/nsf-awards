 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals are to develop methods for testing hypotheses depending on infinitely many parameters, and to study tests of fit for time series data.  This part of the research is linked to the first part in that model selection methods play a crucial role in the lack-of-fit tests investigated. \r\n\r\nMathematical and statistical models are an essential part of the process of scientific discovery.  Such models are intellectual constructs that help scientists describe the essence of what they study, from people and animals to physical and mechanical systems process of scientific discovery.  Such models are intellectual constructs that help scientists describe the essence of what they study, from people and animals to physical and mechanical systems. Some models are better than others, and the proof is in the pudding. Upon collecting data, scientists can apply different models to see which ones \"fit\" their data best.  As data become more and more plentiful, models of increasing complexity become more feasible. New and more sophisticated statistical methodology is required to analyze such complex models. This study addresses two important issues in the analysis of statistical models: the selection of a \"good\" model from a large collection of models and testing the suitability of a single model having special scientific significance. An important area of application for this work is EGCH, and in particular global warming. The methodology developed in this study can be used to decide, for various statistical models, if the recent increase in global temperatures is better explained as a chance occurrence or a fundamental change in climate.",
