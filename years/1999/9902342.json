 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant disease resistance genes encode receptors which are capable of recognizing different pathogens and signaling defense responses. A defense response triggered by the interaction between a host and pathogen limits the pathogen spread throughout the plant. The basis of disease resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Pseadomonas syringae pv tomato, has been extensively characterized at the molecular level within the host species of Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium This species is a close relative Of the edible tomato, L. esculentum, and breeding between these species has permitted the introduction of disease resistance into the crop species. Resistance is conferred by the Pto gene which encodes a receptor and signals a defense response to this bacterial pathogen. The purpose of this study is to determine whether other species of Lycopersicon are resistant to this pathogen and if resistance is conferred by the Pio gene or by different genes within these species.  Functional analysis of the Pto gene has identified the regions of the gene involved in pathogen recognition and signaling of the resistance response. These data will provide a basis for analyzing natural variation in Pro genes -from both resistant and susceptible hosts. This study will investigate the taxonomic breadth of disease resistance conferred by the Pio gene and also identify how amino acid sequence differences in this gene influence disease resistance in these species.\r\n",
