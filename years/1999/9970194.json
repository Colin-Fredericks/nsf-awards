These compounds are the critical mediators of biological function and define health and diseased state.  As the genes of various organisms, including humans, is sequenced, there is a pressing need to rapidly analyzed new proteins and assign functions to them.  The MALDI-TOF instrument represents one of the most sensitive and rapid means for determining structure of proteins and DNA, and permits researchers to correlate physiological state of organisms with the appearance of various proteins.  Proteins and DNA are mixed with certain chemicals, deposited on a metal surface, and dried.  The dried chemicals surround the protein or DNA and the sample is placed in the MALDI-TOF instrument.  A very short but\r\nintense laser pulse is directed onto a surface and is absorbed by the chemicals but not the protein or DNA.  The energy deposited in the chemicals effectively ejects the protein or gene into the gas phase with a\r\npositive charge.  The MALDI then measures the time required for the protein or DNA to travel 2 meters and hit a detector.  The flight time is measured and converted to mass.  For additional information as to structure, the charged protein or DNA sometimes dissociates spontaneously or can be dissociated by collision with a neutral gas soon after desorption.  The masses of pieces of the molecule can be measured and used to establish the molecule's identity.  Once a protein or gene has been analyzed in this way,\r\nits structure can be compared to a comprehensive database to establish its identity.  Information from collisional dissociation can also be used to establish whether a protein has been modified after its initial synthesis by addition of sugars, phosphate groups, or other compounds.  Complex biological molecules such as sugars can also be analyzed by with the MALDI instrument taking advantage of its capability for collisional dissociation. \r\n\r\n",
