Increasingly, gels with novel chemistry and architecture are being investigated not only to improve the performance of known processes and products, but also to develop new materials for chemical and biomedical applications.  These applications often rely on the precise control of the swelling behavior of a gel.  Development of useful gels has been hampered, however, by the lack of a molecular-level understanding of the physics underlying the volumetric behavior polymer gels.  In this work we propose to develop the necessary theoretical formalism to predict the phase behavior of polymer gels from molecular considerations, so that new materials with yet to be discovered properties can be designed on a more rational, scientific basis.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to perform Monte Carlo simulations and semi-theoretical calculations to study the molecular basis of several classes of volume phase transitions in polymeric gels.  In particular, the principal investigator examine the effect of (i) entropic factors (such as network topology, chain stiffness, chain length asymmetry, and (ii) energetic interactions (such as hydrophobic interactions, ionic forces) on the onset and characteristics of volume phase transitions.  To date, swelling has only been investigated by molecular simulation for a limited class of regular, neutral networks.\r\n\r\nThis project will also investigate the relation between volume phase transitions in gels and other fluid-fluid phase transitions.  In order to describe effectively the effect of highly anisotropic interactions (due to hydrogen-bonding or mesogenic groups) and compressibility on the structure and thermodynamics of the gel, we simulate coarse-grained molecular models in a continuum.  The approach entails a sequential study from simple to complex polymeric gels, and systems as diverse as polyelectrolyte gels and strain-induced nematic elastomers.  The complexity of such systems will require that novel Monte Carlo simulation methods be developed capable of capturing their phase behavior.    \r\n\r\nThe work proposed here will provide numerical data to test basic assumptions and Predictions of several theories for gel swelling.  More importantly, it could provide general guidelines for the design of improved polymeric gels, which take full advantages of the entropic forces prevailing in multicomponent systems. \r\n\r\nKey words:  materials, polymers and gel\r\n",
