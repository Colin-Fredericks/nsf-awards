 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doering\r\n\tGlycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are post-translational modifications found ubiquitously in eukaryotes.  These glycolipids become covalently linked to the C-termini of cer-tain newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, modifying a tremendous variety of cell surface enzymes and antigens.  The presence of a GPI has been implicated in processes ranging from intracellular targeting and protein mobility to signal transduction.  GPI structures are based on a linear core of ethanolamine (in amide linkage to the protein), phosphate, four hexoses, and an inositol phospholipid.  The lipid moiety inserts into the extracy-toplasmic leaflet of the membrane bilayer, thereby mediating the association of the protein with the membrane.  Although the core GPI structure is precisely conserved across evolution, it often bears side chains that vary with the cell type and organism.  Additional structural variation is intro-duced by the molecular species found in the lipid portion, as well as the type of lipid linkage (e.g. ce-ramide, diacyl glycerol, or alkyl acyl glycerol).  Biosynthesis of GPI anchors has been examined in most detail in the protozoan parasite Try-panosoma brucei, mammalian tissue culture cell lines, and the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In each system fundamental differences exist in structure and biosynthesis.  The aim of this project is the study of  GPIs in the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal organism in a different phylum from the yeast commonly used as experimental models.  C. neoformans contains quite unusual glycan structures in the form of an extensive polysaccha-ride capsule.  Almost nothing is known, however, about other forms of glycosylation in cryp-tococcus, including GPI addition. The first objective will be to establish the importance of GPI synthesis to C. neoformans viability.  This will be done by PCR-based cloning of the cryptococcal homolog of a gene involved in GPI synthesis, followed by construction of a knockout strain to assess viability.  Methods will include use of regulatable promoters, Southern blotting, and library screening.  The second objective will be to purify a GPI-anchored protein from C. neoformans by a biochemical approach, using specific chemical and enzymatic treatments to selectively purify anchored proteins.  Peptides from the protein will be sequenced, and the data used to clone the gene (to allow future antibody production and studies of regulation).  Purified protein will also be useful for determination of anchor structure (beyond the scope of this proposal).  If there is time in the granting period, a third objective, to initiate studies of GPI biosynthesis in C. neoformans, will be pursued.\r\n\r\n\tA recurring theme in cell biology is how proteins that function outside of cells are targeted to the cell surface, and how they remain in place attached to the outer layer of the cell membrane.  One way of anchoring proteins to membranes is via a complex structure composed of sugars and fatty molecules termed a GPI (glycosyl phosphatidylinositol).  Proteins linked to the cell surface in this way play important roles in cell protection, the immune response, and metabolism.  The presence of an anchor retains such proteins on the cell surface, and also influences their localization, movement, and function.  GPI anchors have been found in all eukaryotic organisms studied, although they exhibit tremendous variations in structure depending on the species.  This project is designed to investigate GPIs in Cryptococcus neoformans.  This understudied but important fungus has unusual sugar structures that comprise a protective capsule, but almost nothing is known about its GPI anchors or other sugar-containing modifications. In addition to helping elucidate the basic biology of this organism, the work will also  increase our understanding of GPI structures and biosynthesis in general. This project is being funded under the NSF POWRE program. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
