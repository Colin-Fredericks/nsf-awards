 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Andrei G. Kutateladze of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Denver.   His research is aimed at designing improved organic synthetic methods based on electron transfer- induced cleavage of substituted alpha-hydroxyalkyl dithianes.   These dithianes (cyclic compounds containing two sulfur atoms) are used to protect carbonyl groups (C=O) during the synthesis of complex organic compounds, and have the novel property of being readily removed with light.\r\nThe PI believes strongly in integrating education and research, and involves students in a wide variety of research activities including synthesis, photochemistry and photophysics, nuclear magnetic resonance, materials science, theoretical chemistry, and computer programming.   His educational activities under this grant include developing one freshman/sophomore level organic course and two advanced courses, utilizing multimedia, computer simulation/animation, and molecular modeling.   The PI encourages his graduate students to participate in local high school Science Fairs, and will participate in a departmental summer research program for area high school chemistry teachers.",
