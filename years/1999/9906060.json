 "awd_abstract_narration": "9906060  Bitton  This is an award to support research on toxicology of leachates emerging from landfills containing solid wastes originating from landfills that contain municipal and industrial construction and demolition debris.  The leachates from three existing landfills will be studied to determine their acute toxicity applying procedures developed in research conducted under NSF Grant No. BES 91-17267 in which procedures were developed to use microbial assays to distinguish between heavy metal and organic chemical toxicity.  In this new project, the baseline toxicity of leachates from existing solid waste landfills in Alachua, Citrus and Levy Counties in Florida will be studied to determine their baseline toxicities, the extent to which these are attributable to their content of heavy metals and to determine their potential for endocrine disruption.  Leachates will also be produced in laboratory columns simulating exposure of solid wastes to rainfall and in batch procedures using buffers, deionized water and solvents as eluants.  These leachates will be passed through soil columns to determine the toxicity attenuation potential achieved by passage through soil.  A recombinant yeast will be used to detect environmental estrogens in mixed solid waste and vitellogen produced by fathead minnows will be used as a biomarker for assessment of endocrine disruption. \r\n\r\nSolid wastes from construction and demolition activities are generally placed on sites and in landfills that are not lined or otherwise designed or constructed to prevent or restrain leachate from contaminating soil and groundwater.  Results of this research are likely to provide knowledge that can be used to determine the appropriate placement and engineering design of landfills to avoid pollution of soil, surface and groundwater by landfill leachates.  The work is also expected to validate short-term assays that can be used to rapidly detect the potential a solid waste has for toxicity, endocrine disruption and other deleterious environmental effects on environmental resources.***\r\n",
