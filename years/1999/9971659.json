 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971659\r\nFeller\r\n \r\nCoe College has an exceptional and growing undergraduate research program in glass science.  Substantial expertise and new experiments in optical characterization and laser ablation time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry have been added during the last three years.  The students have expertise in preparing glasses under extreme conditions (rapid cooling with simultaneous dry box protection) and   they measure many physical properties on the resulting samples.  Many of the associated spectroscopic experiments on these glasses are performed in-house at Coe College.  The purpose of this research is to quantitatively relate  observed physical properties with models of atomic arrangement.  Glasses will be prepared over wide compositional ranges and studied during the active period of this grant,.  The following systems will be investigated: Alkaline-earth borates and borosilicates; alkali and alkaline earth germanates; alkali borogermanates;  alkali vanadates; and alkali borovanadates.  Thermal, mechanical, and optical properties and various spectroscopic measurements will be performed on these glasses.  Besides the TOF, FTIR and NQR techniques will also be used in the experiments done at Coe College.  This program enjoys active collaborations with several other, major research groups.  The students will actively participate in this collaborative research using neutron scattering  at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory in Harwell, England, and the Institut Laue-Langevin reactor lab in Grenoble, France.  Typically, the research materials are the glass samples prepared by the students.  Also, magnetic resonance (NMR and QMR) and vibrational spectroscopic studies will be done with the groups at Indiana University, Sandia Laboratory, and Iowa State University.  The short range structure of newly discovered vanadate glasses will be determined by x-ray scattering.  In addition to the scientific research, there will also be significant contributions to the education of undergraduates.  The students will be involved in all aspects of scientific work including experimental design, performing experiments, doing repair work, giving talks at national meetings, and writing papers,  They will be engaged in this activity over a period of several years and thus contribute to the introduction and  training of the next generation of students entering this research enterprise.  The students will be prepared to enter top level graduate programs in science and engineering.\r\n%%%\r\nUndergraduate students and faculty at Coe College will jointly do research on newly discovered glasses.  The goals of this project are fourfold: 1) Form new glasses from novel chemical formulations; 2) Characterize the physical properties of these new glasses.  These include the glass compositional limits, density, thermal effects, and optical property measures;  3) Use spectroscopic means to determine models for the ways in which atoms group together, and use this information to predict how the properties change with composition; and  4) Involve undergraduates in significant roles in original and publishable scientific research.  The bulk of this research will be done in-house at Coe College.  Collaborations with other research groups will allow students to extend their knowledge of techniques.  These collaborations will involve student participation in research done at the Rutherford-Appleton (England) and Institut Laue-Langevin (France) laboratories,  in nuclear magnetic resonance studies at Brown, Indiana and Iowa State Universities, and the Sandia National Laboratory, and in vibrational spectroscopy at Iowa State University.  Through any or all of these research activities and interactions, the students will be prepared to enter graduate programs for advanced studies in various scientific or engineering fields for training in advanced subjects.  This experience will enable them to be productively employed in scientific/technological areas during the next few decades of the 20th Century.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
