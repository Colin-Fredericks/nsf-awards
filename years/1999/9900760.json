Other support is from the following agencies: Department of Energy (Geothermal division, Office Basic Energy Sciences, and Office of Fossil Energy), Department of the Interior (Bureau of Land Management, minerals Management Service, and U.S. Geological Survey), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and National Science Foundation.  The board on Earth Sciences and Resources coordinates the National Research Council's activities on solid-earth science issues.  The Board identifies opportunities for advancing basic research and understanding, analyzes the credibility of earth science information for policy decisions, and reports on the applications of earth sciences to important societal issues.  Through its actions, the Board addresses the overall health of research and education programs related to earth sciences and resource issues.  The Board and its multidisciplinary committees also serve as a forum for discussions and exchange of information among scientists, engineers, and policy makers from government, universities, and industry.  The activities of the Board are subject to NRC bias and review procedures to ensure balance and impartiality.  As enunciated in the Board's 1993 report, Solid-Earth Sciences and Society, earth scientists are currently challenged to develop an integrated understanding of the solid earth and its resources.  Improving worldwide living standards and population increases pose new problems that will require solutions from a broad range of the basic and applied earth sciences.  The Board keeps these global issues in perspective while focusing on the requirements for specialized analyses of technical issues.  At present, the Board is giving great emphasis to environmental concerns through its studies.\r\n",
