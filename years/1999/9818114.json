 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will replicate the work of Kempton, Boster, and Hartley exploring the cultural bases for environmental concern, by using a comparative design based on qualitative interviews in Germany, Japan, and the United States. The technological infrastructures in these three nations are very similar and thus are the environmental problems they face. All three are industrial democracies, although the political systems differ. However, the three nations have very different cultural lineages, especially with regards to values and religions. Thus research in Germany and Japan triangulated with Kempton et al. 's results for the United States, provide an ideal base for cross-cultural comparison. Qualitative, in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the general public, auto workers, clergy, environmental journalists, and government officials in Germany and Japan. Analysis will emphasize recent theories of environmental concerns, especially works on values and religion, and the cross-cultural convergences and differences.",
