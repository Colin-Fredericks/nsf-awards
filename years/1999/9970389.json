 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classical orthogonal polynomials of one variable are significantly involved in several aspects of mathematics, for example: the Chebyshev, Legendre, and Hermite polynomials are used in approximation theory, Gaussian quadrature, and the hydrogen atom quantum model, respectively. The reasons why these polynomials are so effective come from the associated differential equations, the recurrence relations, and the weight functions. The goal of this project is to construct and study similarly useful families of orthogonal polynomials of several variables. A very fruitful approach to this aim is the study of systems which have finite symmetry groups. The main types considered in this proposal are the symmetry groups of the simplex, the hypercube and the icosahedron. The first two comprise infinite families, labeled by dimension, and are associated with systems allowing arbitrary permutations of the coordinates, or sign-changes as well. The icosahedron is a three-dimensional regular solid with a truly ancient historical record, which is the subject of current research in quasi-crystals. These are paradoxical structures; ordinary crystals like salt have a shape which allows the rigid fitting together of an unlimited number of molecules, and even though the icosahedron does not allow such patterns (called regular tessellations) there exist physical substances with icosahedral structures (for example, pentagonal symmetry appears under electron microscope observations).\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with finding orthogonal bases of  polynomials; these bases have a special significance because they can be used directly in the analysis of functions; the origin of the phrase ``harmonic analysis'' is the technique of decomposing a musical note into fundamentals and overtones. This technique has developed into such applications as decompositions of quantum-mechanical systems into different energy levels, or the approximations of functions by easily computable polynomials. Besides the icosahedral group, the proposal deals with the analog of spherical harmonic polynomials for the hyperoctahedral group, which allows both permutations as well as sign-changes of the co-ordinates. One of the aims is to investigate the application of orthogonal polynomials to quantum systems with three-body interactions as well as the spin Calogero models (identical particles in a one-dimensional space, each with a spin of +/- 1). It is a goal to find formulas specific enough to allow asymptotic calculations: qualitative descriptions of the long-term behavior of the systems. Finally, it is planned to investigate exceptional differential equations, in the sense that some underlying parameters take on specific isolated values leading to unusual phenomena; on the one hand there are the bi-spectral equations in the Korteweg-deVries scheme, and on the other hand there are ``super-integrable'' quantum-mechanical systems. The technical foundation of this proposal is the differential-difference operator associated with reflection groups which was constructed by the proposer and has been used in many research articles in physics and mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
