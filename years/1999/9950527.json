 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most biology graduate students do the majority of their teaching in introductory courses and, thus, they can have a great impact on their undergraduate students. However, graduate students in general receive little instruction about teaching. A regimen of pedagogical courses is not the solution since graduate students must take courses in their biological subdiscipline, develop a research program, and have teaching responsibilities of up to 20 hours a week. \r\n\r\nPart of the solution is a course that introduces pedagogical theory and methods in a way that graduate students can see for themselves how their learning is enhanced by a particular understanding or method and see how they can implement that understanding or method in their own teaching. The course being designed in this project is specifically for biology graduate students to help them improve their teaching skills.  \r\n\r\nThe other part of the solution is reinforcing what is learned in this course through supplemental workshops which also reach a broader audience of graduate students and faculty across the sciences, thus fostering a larger supportive culture about teaching science.  These special topic workshops are advertised university-wide and are offered monthly.  Topics include:  how brain chemistry and development affect learning by college students; science and learning styles; the art of leading a discussion; developing and using cooperative learning; developing critical thinking in your students; teaching scientific writing; using educational technology in the classroom; and teaching future teachers.  The format of the workshops stresses collaborative problem-solving among participants (e.g., case studies, inquiry method) and involves as many faculty members as possible as participants and experts. Several instructional videotapes are being made based on the course and workshops. These videos will be used in subsequent workshops and be available at cost to others. The attitude, learning, and competency of the graduate teaching assistants in the course and workshops and of the undergraduates taught by these teaching assistants are being evaluated.\r\n\r\nBoth the course and workshops are based on the generic materials, techniques and practices developed in part for Preparing Future Faculty by the Association of American Colleges and University and the Council of Graduate Schools, but are adapted to be discipline-specific so that graduate students can help undergraduates learn biology content in context.",
