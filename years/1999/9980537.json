 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Educause provides support for a series of activities designed to enable minority-serving institutions to prepare for and then participate in national advanced networking initiatives, including Internet2 and NGI.  Included are workshops and training programs intended to assist administrators in devising technology strategies and financing plans for their institutions.  Similar programs will develop the human support infrastructure in these colleges and universities.  Yet other activites are aimed at preparing the faculty and students in the use of the high performance networks.   An important aspect of this latter array of activities is the involvement of the Education, Outreach, and Training (EOT) program that is part of NSF's Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI).  Coupled with and integral to all of these programs and activities will be experiments with and prototypes of advanced, innovative network technologies for Internet access or for vBNS or Abilene access.  In particular, these advanced technologies will seek to attack the problems of cost and access for locations that have limited telecommunications options.",
