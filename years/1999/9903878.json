Although the ability to respond appropriately to environmental changes seems intuitively advantageous, no organism is able to produce the optimum morphology and physiology in all possible environments. The proposed research will determine what forces can limit the ability of organisms to respond appropriately to environmental change.  A plant species, Viola septemloba, in which individuals can produce leaves with dramatically different morphology will be studied as a model system.  Experiments will be conducted in the field to determine if there are costs associated with the ability of individuals to alter their leaf morphology in response to seasonal variation in the environment.   Such costs could help explain why organisms appear unable to respond appropriately to all environments they encounter.  The biological mechanisms underlying costs in this system will also be examined.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will expand our basic understanding of how organisms respond to changes in their environment.  Knowledge of the limits to environmental response will refine our ability to understand and predict the effects of natural disturbances and human impacts on the environment on plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
