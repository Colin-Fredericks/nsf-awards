 "awd_abstract_narration": "CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nClark Atlanta University (CAU) proposes a program, Enhancing Science, Mathematics,\r\nEngineering and Technology Education (SMET-Ed), that will increase the number of minority\r\nstudents enrolling in, and successfully completing baccalaureate programs that will prepare them\r\nto pursue graduate degrees in SMET disciplines. This will be accomplished through faculty\r\nenhancement, curriculum reform and enhancements, infrastructure development, undergraduate\r\nresearch experiences and critical transition activities. Specific desired outcomes are to achieve by\r\n2004, at least, an undergraduate SMET enrollment of 1500, graduation classes with 250 SMET,\r\nmajors, better than 80% retention of SMET students and 60% of each SMET graduating class\r\ncontinuing to graduate school. The proposed program, SMET-Ed, will support 30-50 students\r\nper year and impact over 1500 SMET students at the Atlanta University Center. It will ensure\r\nthat all students have access to an excellent undergraduate SMET education and are taught\r\nthrough direct experiences and inquiry-based learning.\r\n\r\nFaculty enhancements will be accomplished through sabbatical/exchange programs, rewards for the best student mentors, visiting faculty programs, seminars and release time for SMET enhancement activities. Curriculum enhancements will involve development of courses/labs, revisions and assistance programs for SMET gate-keeping bottleneck courses, and integration of research into the curriculum. The new courses will include Preparatory General Chemistry, Problem Solving, Introduction to High Performance computing and environmental management and treatment technologies, precalculus, and electives in Astronomy and semiconductor devices. The revision and assistance program will affect all the introductory bottleneck courses in the SMET disciplines. A Design and Research Integration Learning Lab (DRILL) will be initiated to enhance research integration into the curriculum. Scientific writing and GRE Workshops will be organized to better prepare SMET students for graduate school. SMET students will be encouraged to seek a minor in information science and technology. The computer and network-based distance learning activities will enhance access to networked computer labs that provide greater instructional capabilities and support distance learning as part of a retention strategy.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure development will involve the purchase of equipment/instrumentation and the strengthening of the abilities of technical support personnel. Undergraduate research experiences will be enhanced through the Program for Undergraduate Research Experience (PURE), the Summer Undergraduate Research Exchange (SURE) and the Annual Competition for Originality in Research and Design (ACORD). SMET-Ed will ensure that every undergraduate SMET major participates in a research experience. It will also provide bridging strategies to address high school/undergraduate, undergraduate/graduate, and university/job market transitions. Planning, formative and summative evaluations will be conducted to measure the project outcomes, ascertain the merit and value of the activities, determine how mid-corrections will be made, and ensure that NSF policies and guidelines are strictly adhered to. Professor Y. D. Yeboah who has management training from the MIT Sloan School of Management and over 20 years of project management experience will direct the program. A Leadership Team of the chairs of the SMET departments and an Advisory Committee of internal and external experts will assist Professor Yeboah. The commitment of CAU is evidenced from the participation of Deans, release time for faculty, reduced indirect cost, and matching of equipment cost. CAU intends to become a leading institution in the production of well-prepared recipients of baccalaureate degrees in SMET disciplines who matriculate in the best research universities for advanced degrees. SMET-Ed will have a major impact in reversing the current decline in African American graduate enrollment.\r\n",
