 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds the development of a methodology for the determination of tolls in congested networks such as urban street networks and communication networks.  While these examples are very different physically, the mathematical models used in their design and control are quite similar.  The theoretical development will identify all tolling strategies that make the network efficient, even when many individual users are allowed to make their own choices as in the case of urban traffic.  The computational development will provide robust numerical methods that calculate tolls accurately for networks of arbitrary size and configuration.\r\n\r\nIn transportation research dating from the 1950s economists have recognized the value of tolling of congested networks as a method of control and to provide revenues for alternative travel modes such as\r\ntransit.  Now technology allows for high-speed tollbooths and the U. S. Department of Transportation is funding several tolling experiments across the U. S.  However, there is no established method for determination of tolls in various settings.  This research will provide network designers and planners with tools that identify all tolls that achieve minimum system impact; and calculate the tolls that achieve additional objectives such as minimizing the number of tolling stations, minimizing costs to the users, etc.\r\n",
