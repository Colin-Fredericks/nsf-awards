The ancient Greeks\r\nunderstood symmetries of Platonic solids, e.g., a cube or a\r\ndodecahedron.  Platonic solids are positively curved, and they have a\r\nfinite number of symmetries.  At the opposite end of the spectrum are\r\nnegatively curved objects, such as the Lobachevsky hyperbolic plane\r\n(featured frequently in Escher paintings), and these typically have\r\ninfinitely many symmetries.  Consequently, the structure of these\r\nsymmetries is both more interesting and harder to understand.  The\r\nsymmetries of an object form a ``group.''  One way to measure the\r\n``size'' of a group, even when the group is infinite, is to talk about\r\nits ``dimension.''  For example, the dimension of the group of\r\nsymmetries of the hyperbolic plane, depicted in the Escher drawing\r\nmentioned above, is two, reflecting the nature of the plane.  In\r\ngeneral, the concept of dimension depends on the background choice of\r\nnumbering system (coefficient ring).  The project will study this\r\ndependence.  Yet another part of the project is the study of polygons.\r\nThese seemingly simple objects in the Euclidean plane and space become\r\nincreasingly more complex as one considers more complicated spaces.  One\r\nof the new phenomena is that an edge of a polygon may be determined not\r\njust by its length but also by its ``direction.''  In the case of\r\nordinary space, if one fixes the origin of an edge, one can rotate the\r\nsecond end to attain an arbitrary direction.  A Euclidean triangle is\r\ndetermined by its three side-lengths.  To construct such a triangle it\r\nis enough to satisfy three ``triangle inequalities.''  These properties\r\nno longer hold in more general spaces, which makes study of polygons\r\nthere much more interesting and complicated.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
