In particular, investigations will be made on the thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions; relaxation and transport of polyelectrolytes in random environments; topological frustrations associated with pattern recognition and complexations; and, kinetics of polymer crystallization from solutions.  Full mathematical expressions will be derived which describe the non-universal features of the fast and slow dynamics accopanying the ordinary-extraordinary transition in polyelectrolyte solutions; pattern recognition and transport of polyelectrolytes in random media; and, shape, thickness and crystallization kinetics of lamellae.  This theoretical research complements experimental investigations which are being actively pursued in many laboratories worldwide.  The results of this work are relevant to numerous applications including separation techniques like chromatography and electrophoresis, preparation and processing of molecular composites, and controlled fabrication of nanoscale structures and artificial enzymes.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a grant to support theoretical research on polymers.
