El-Genk, Director, Institute for Space & Nuclear Power Studies, the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Dr. S. Wahsh, Power Electronics Department, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt.\r\nThey plan to develop new cooling methods and manufacturing techniques for microelectronic components and devices that will help make these products suitable for the compact and high speed applications needed by the computer and telecommunications industry.   They plan to develop and implement an agenda to establish the research infrastructure, build capability and enhance interest in this important field of heat transfer and cooling of microelectronics. \r\n\r\nScope: The US PI is an expert in heat transfer, and his expertise covers a variety of areas relevant to the electronic cooling applications.  The Egyptian counterparts have excellent background in electrical engineering and electronics.  The two scientists have laid out a good organizational plan, with a seminar, integrated research activities, an international conference and training activities to provide a solid array of opportunities to accomplish the stated objective.  The impact of this program is promising.  The interactions with industry, through surveys and training, coupled with the joint research initiatives with academia are important factors.  The specific knowledge of the PIs in the area of electronic cooling is supplemented by extensive experience in heat transfer theory and applications.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n",
