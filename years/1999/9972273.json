 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves developing highly interactive educational materials using the Java language, RealAudio, JavaScript, and other Web-based technologies, for the typical sophomore/junior course on Signals and Systems offered in electrical engineering and related departments. A number of important and difficult concepts that are well suited to highly interactive visualization aids and active learning approaches are introduced in this course. The Java user interface can be used to require student input and manipulation at the outset, for example, by using the mouse to sketch a signal to be sampled. Preliminary development of applets on Fourier analysis and convolution has resulted in  usage at colleges and universities around the world. Building on this base, formative assessment methodologies are used to determine best practices in the design of the material, and applets addressing additional concepts are developed.",
