As the density of devices on chips increases to a lithography-imposed limit, device interconnection in planar ICs is increasingly problematic. Integration of circuits in three dimensions is a possible future direction for increasing circuit packing density and functionality. In addition to homogeneous integration in vertically integrated chips (e.g. Si on Si), heterogeneous integration (e.g. Si with photonic, microwave or ferroelectric material), allows for the possibility of multiple functionality of the integrated structures. The project approach consists of four elements: 1) use of (111) and (110), in addition to (100) Si wafers, to investigate the process of patterned layer transfer. This approach should confirm if the cleavage planes of Si and the preferred location of implanted H platelet are correlated to yield an evenly transferred layer. 2) investigate the mechanism of enhanced exfoliation due to radiation damage. Co-implant Ar and H initially to test if a heavier mass of the co-implanted inert gas ion has a similar or improved effect as compared to He and B co-implanted with H. 3) Investigate the low temperature migration of H towards B and the effect in patterned layer transfer in providing an even cut. Investigate the rate of migration of H toward B by SIMS and/or forward scattering to track the motion of H atoms. 4) Study the combined effects of wafer orientation, radiation damage and electric fields to yield evenly cut patterned layers. The project is collaborative and will be carried out at both ASU and UCSD making use of the complementary nature of the combined facilities. At ASU, transmission electron microscopy and ion beam analysis is featured, and at UCSD, sample preparation and electrical evaluation are provided. There is the capability for ion beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering and channeling) at both institutions.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute new knowledge to improving the perform-ance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by providing increased fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and processing technologies.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.\r\n",
