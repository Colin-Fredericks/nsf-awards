 "awd_abstract_narration": "The disease pathogens of Pythium and Fusarium cause significant losses to corn producers when weather conditions are conducive to the plant pathogens and the seed is not pretreated with a protective fungicide seed treatment.  Chemical seed treatments are commercially available to control the effects of these pathogens on seedlings.  However, no effective treatment is commercially available to control the root and stalk rots that these pathogens cause in later growth stages of the plant.  A combination fungal/bacterial antagonist has been identified that may effectively control these pathogens in the early plant growth stages with continued protection thoughout the growing season.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is   directed toward:  (1) identifying additonal bacterial antagonists; (2) scaling up of biocontrol fermentation processes; (3) establishing large scale procedures for downstream processing, packaging, and storage; (4) evaluating biocontrol agents in field trials; (5) assessing the stability of the biocontrol agents;  and, (6) assessing root colonization of the biocontrol agents.  Phase III commercialization will involve EPA approval and marketing of the tested product.\r\n     This project is designed to develop commercially viable biological disease control agents for corn.  Because the product is expected to effectively provide season long disease control, and the present chemical fungicides do not, it is anticipated that hybrid seed companies would readily accept an alternative product that is more effective. The US market potential for this product is estimated to be in excess of 150 million dollars.\r\n\r\n",
