In addition, nine high quality lenses which can be used for wide-angle and close-up viewing of large specimens, phase and DIC Nomarski optics, fluorescence and limited live action photography will be purchased.  Linked to this microscope are a pair of micromanipulators capable of injecting dyes and solutions, or holding glass electrodes essential for recording physiological responses in a variety of cells.  Additionally, the image analysis software will allow CSUN faculty and students to perform a wide range of studies, including cell counts, cell measurements, fluorescent analysis and three dimensional reconstructions.  This system is one that is quite flexible and can easily be built upon.  It is expected that as the current faculty expand their research interests they will be able to adjust this system to meet their demands.  In addition, the Biology Department expects to hire 2-3 Cell/Molecular Biologists in the next few years.  The new faculty will be able to tailor this particular microscope/image analysis system to fit their own individual research needs.  Thus, the availability of the requested system will certainly increase the department's attractiveness to bring quality faculty to campus.   California State University, Northridge has an excellent history of providing an environment that supports the link between research and teaching.  Currently, the Biology department serves over 1,200 undergraduate majors and close to 100 graduate students (Master's level is the highest degree awarded in the CSU system).  Students in both the undergraduate and graduate programs will certainly benefit from having a state of the art image analysis system, providing assistance to complete their Senior Theses and Master's level experiments.  It is quite clear that CSUN students are actively pursuing research opportunities at CSUN.   A recent NSF study of 529 institutions which grant the Master's degree but not the Ph.D., CSUN ranked first in the number of students who went on to receive Ph.D. degrees in science and engineering.  Thus, the microscope, image analysis software and related ancillaries will be essential components to expand research excellence at CSUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
