 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860884\r\n     Emission control requirements imposed on the automobile industry by state and federal governments continue to become more stringent. Oxygen sensors are currently used to control the air/fuel ratio and to monitor emission control systems in internal combustion engines but have limited capabilities. Further reduction of emissions will require diagnostic systems that correctly identify faults by detection of all gases present in the exhaust. Existing sensors that can measure exhaust gases of interest are expensive and were not designed to operate at high exhaust temperatures. Therefore, improved high-temperature gas sensors are needed for next generation vehicles. The proposed work will investigate the feasibility of using a wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor system to monitor exhaust gases. A wireless system has the potential for high performance with low weight and cost due the elimination of a wiring harness. The Phase I work will focus on the development of a wireless water vapor sensing system to demonstrate the feasibility of high temperature and wireless measurements of gas concentrations. Sensors for the exhaust gases of interest will be developed in Phase II. This wireless system also has potential as a replacement for existing climate control and other sensing functions such as: engine temperature, manifold and tire pressure, ABS, and speed control.\r\n\r\n",
