 "awd_abstract_narration": "Do students who learn concepts act and interact differently from those who don't?  To answer this question we, the Center for Science and Mathematics Teaching at Tufts University, wish to identify student behavior, personal and interpersonal, associated with conceptual learning and also those behaviors associated with little or no conceptual learning.  To this end we have videotaped an entire semester of students working in groups of three learning mechanics in a university introductory physics laboratory.  The students' conceptual learning was measured independently of their performance in the course using the reliable Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE), developed by the Center with NSF support. The students were following a guided-discovery curriculum (RealTime Physics Mechanics) intended to help them learn force and motion concepts and were exploring the behavior of the physical world using real-time data logging (MBL) hardware and software (LoggerPro) to display the results of experiments. More than 80% of students learn fundamental concepts in this environment (as opposed to only 7-20% in traditional environments).  Students were also exposed to traditional physics instruction in the lecture part of the course.\r\nAnalysis of video tapes of students engaged in this process throughout a semester will be used to determine why most students learn effectively while some do not.  The interactions of individual students to be studied include these: (1) with the MBL environment; (2) with the group members; and (3) with the instructors.  The study of student behavior will be carried out over the entire semester and will use the methodology developed at the Center called Concept Talk analysis as well as standard methods of discourse analysis developed in the fields of socio-linguistics and cognitive psychology.  To improve our analysis, we will incorporate knowlege from other disciplines by collaborating with Jim Gee and his associates in the Education Department of the University of Wisconsin.\r\nWe expect the understandings we gain to apply to conceptual learning in general and not to be limited to learning in physics.  But to the extent that this project is successful in developing guidelines for identifying students early on who learn less well, we will also seek clues to formulate appropriate specific learning interventions for them.\r\nFor more information: //http.ase.tufts.edu/csmt/\r\n",
