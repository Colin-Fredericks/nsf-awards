 "awd_abstract_narration": "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in normal development,  tissue homeostasis, and in various diseases.  Apoptosis occurs by activating an intrinsic cell suicide program which is constitutively expressed in most animal cells, and key components of this program have been conserved in evolution from worms to insects to man.  In recent years, many gene products controlling programmed cell death have been identified, and the biochemical pathways they regulate have begun to emerge.  Studies in invertebrates and mammals with loss-of-function or gain-of-function of these genes has demonstrated the role program cell death plays in development, physiology, and disease.  Researchers in this field of apopotosis are a diverse group with interests including developmental biology, biochemistry and cell cycle control. The objective of this conference is to bring together researchers working in these diverse aspects of programmed cell death.  The meeting includes lectures and poster sessions, with participation by junior scientists.  The aim is to create an environment suitable for the exchange of information and ideas which will foster the advancement of the field in the identification of the biochemical and molecular events controlling apoptosis.",
