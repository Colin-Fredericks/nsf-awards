Unlike traditional desktop computing in which the user is required to come to the computer, mobile computing brings the computer to the user.  One of the key problems with mobile/wearable computing is energy consumption.  Battery weight for mobile/wearable computers often exceeds the weight of all other components combined.  In order to make mobile/wearable computing widely applicable, major advances in reducing power consumption and battery weight are needed.  In this research a testbed, Infocator, is being developed to study energy issues in mobile/wearable computing.\r\n\r\nMobile/wearable systems are typically comprised of both computing and communications systems.  While power consumption required by the computing component is rapidly decreasing, power consumption required by the communications component is not keeping pace.  It is estimated that by the year 2001, nearly 80% of the power consumed by mobile/wearable will be due to communications.\r\n\r\nTrading off energy-expensive communication for energy cheap computation through effective partitioning of control and data can result in significant energy savings.  Methods for determining the ideal control/data\r\npartitioning are being developed and codified in a Theory of Energy Locality.  To realize the partitioning and facilitate control movement, a generic application independent framework for proxies is also being\r\ndeveloped.  \r\n\r\nTo maximize the effectiveness of wearable systems in mobile computing environments, the interface design  ust be carefully matched with user tasks and balanced against energy consumption.  Many complex and interrelated issues determine the balance between ease-of-use and power consumption.  Simply trading off  ase-of-use for lower per operation power consumption may result in higher task energy consumption due to the increase in the number of operations needed to traverse a less intuitive interface.  The effect of user interface on energy consumption is also being evaluated by developing several different interfaces for  nfocator and measuring and comparing the ease-of-use and energy consumption.  \r\n\r\n",
