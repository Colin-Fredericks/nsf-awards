There are two steps involved: (1) Find a Relaxation, i.e., a set that encloses the set of solutions to the original problem and is easier to solve, (2) Find a Rounding, i.e., a mapping from a solution of the relaxation to a true solution.  The first idea this project sets out to explore is that of a Convex relaxation.  The set of solutions to the original problem can be viewed as a convex set (viz. Their convex hull) and any convex set enclosing this is a relaxation.  The quality of a relaxation is dependent on how well it estimates the true optimum of the problem.  Building on the past success of this approach, the project pursues promising relaxations for two fundamental problems, finding the Minimum Sparsity Cut (or Conductance) of a graph, and the Minimum Traveling Salesman problem in a directed graph.\r\n\r\nThe second idea is based on a technique of Lovasz and Schrijver, Called \"lift-and-project,\" to progressively refine any given convex relaxation.  Although the technique has so far been used only to solve special cases of NP-hard problems in polynomial time, it appears to be well-suited for approximation algorithms, and one objective of this research is to adapt it for this purpose.  A natural candidate for this approach is the problem of finding the Maximum Acyclic Subgraph of a directed graph.\r\n\r\nThe next two ideas are techniques for rounding.  Random Projection has recently enjoyed much success as an algorithmic tool, for problems ranging from VLSI layout to finding nearest neighbors.  Here it is developed by refining its application to the problem of learning the intersection of half-spaces (convex bodies).\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that a relatively small subset of the solutions to a relaxation, upon rounding, leads to the worst case performance of the algorithm, whereas on average, near-optimum solutions to the relaxation exhibit much better performance.  To exploit this, the idea is to find a Random Near-Optimum of the relaxation, and then round this to a true solution.  The problem of finding a random near-optimum can be solved efficiently via a random walk.  Two candidate problems where this strategy might improve the quality of approximation are the Maximum Cut problem and the Minimum Bandwidth problem.\r\n\r\nThe last tool is a fast algorithm for approximating a given matrix with another matrix of small rank.  Standard methods to compute such low-rank approximations take time that is polynomial in the size of the matrix.  In the context of problems such as information retrieval on the internet, this can be prohibitively expensive.  I contrast, the running time of the new algorithm depends only on the quality of the desired approximation and not on the size of the matrix.  This algorithm will be applied as a tool to speed up existing (polynomial-time) algorithms for several applications, including linear equations, searching for nearest neighbours, and text and image retrieval.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are being integrated into education in the form of two courses, one at the senior undergraduate level, and the other at the graduate level.  The former would be based on the basic concepts and successful ideas that come out of this research, while the latter would be exploratory and present promising directions and relatively difficult results.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
