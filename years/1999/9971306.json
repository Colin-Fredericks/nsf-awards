 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research that is funded with this award will address problems in\r\nplasma physics, stellar dynamics, and superconductivity.  The PI will\r\nconstruct steady state solutions of the partial differential equations that\r\nmodel these phenomena and will study their dynamic stability. Specifically, \r\nthe Vlasov model for collisionless plasmas, models for polytropic galaxies,\r\nand models for superconductivity and superfluidity that exhibit vortices will\r\nbe investigated. \r\n\r\nThis award will fund research on mathematical models for phenomena in\r\nwhich huge numbers of individual particles interact.  These phenomena \r\ncan occur in plasmas, the physical state of the interior of fluorescent lights, \r\nmanufacturing reactors for microchips,  and of the interior of the sun. In this \r\ncase, atomic particles interact by means of electromagnetic forces.  Related \r\nphenomena also occur on cosmic scales, for instance in galaxies, where \r\nthe interacting particles are entire stars and the interaction is by means of \r\ngravitation.  The mathematical models for these very different situations have \r\nsimilarities.  The research will study equilibrium configurations such as the \r\nsteady state operation of a plasma-assisted manufacturing device or the steady \r\nrotation of a galaxy and seek to understand its stability or the ways in which \r\nstability is lost.  Instability may mean loss of efficiency for a manufacturing \r\nprocess or the formation of spiral arms in a galaxy.    \r\n",
