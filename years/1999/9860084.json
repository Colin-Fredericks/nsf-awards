 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860084\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of electrostatic self assembly (ESA) processes for the low cost fabrication of MEMS sensor and actuator materials and devices for the instrumentation and control of civil and mechanical systems.  ESA processing involves coating solid substrates by the alternate adsorption of anionic and cationic complexes of polymers, metallic nanoclusters and other molecules from water based solutions at room temperature and pressure.  By controlling the molecular structure created in the resulting multilayer thin film, materials with different properties may be formed, including piezoelectric sensor and actuator elements, ultrahigh conductivity interconnecting thin film leads, and ultrahard surface protection coatings. Further, three dimensional surface micromachining may be performed as part of the ESA synthesis process to create MEMS devices and arrays.  The company has licensed nine strategic ESA patents from Virginia Tech to enable materials and device commercialization.  During Phase I, work will be carried out with Virginia Tech to demonstrate the feasibility of the ESA process for MEMS sensor and actuator devices fabrication, high conductivity MEMS element interconnects, and surface protecting coatings.   Several large industrial partner companies would provide input during Phase I concerning ESA process scale up and device testing, and would offer opportunities for Phase II development partnering.\r\n     New ESA formed surface micromachined piezoelectric, conductive and abrasion resistant\r\nthin films have widespread applications in MEMS sensor and actuator products for large scale civil infrastructure, industrial control and consumer use.  The ESA process allows\r\na powerful tool for the low cost manufacturing of these and other thin films, devices and\r\nferroelectric like materials.\r\n",
