This project involves the ethnographic research of a cultural anthropologist from West Chester University of Pennsylvania studying how African art commodities are imported, processed and sold in the US by West African traders.  The study will describe how transnational processes and increased access to speedy travel and communication technologies have triggered the short-term migration to North American of West African traders who ship, process, market and sell African art in the US. It will focus on a major center of this trade in New York city, and also follow the traders as they travel to distant markets.  Beginning with a census of the traders, the researcher will conduct participant observation both in the commercial center and on the trading trips, semi-structured interviews with a sample of 60 traders on their commercial and social strategies, and analyze how the new community of West African traders has developed in the US, and demonstrate linkages among new communication technologies and short-term migration.  This research is important because it will provide a rich case study of how members of so-called \"traditional\" cultures use contemporary technology to accomplish economic and social goals, and how the social and economic rules of the culture adapt in light of new opportunities.\r\n",
