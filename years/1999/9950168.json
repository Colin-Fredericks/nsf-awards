 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of the foundation for a coherent curriculum in the area of Information Science and Engineering (ISE).  The objectives of the project are: the formal definition of the overall ISE framework and its curriculum, design of at least one ISE core course and its offering at Arizona State and at two test sites (Univ. of Nebraska and Wright State Univ.), and training and assistance for others teaching the ISE course.  The main deliverable is a manuscript to support the core ISE course.  This manuscript is being developed for publication.  A detailed evaluation and refinement of course and curriculum along with web-site creation and maintenance is also being carried out.\r\n\r\nThe project team is developing a non-quantitative framework for ISE which is analogous to Shannon's quantitative theory.  Conservative logic is the approach chosen, which ties in with the conservative theories which are the basis for many of the engineering disciplines.  It is timely to study the foundations of information engineering starting with the idea of \"conservation of information\" based on conservative logic or a similar suitable logical framework.  An interdisciplinary team including practicing engineers from IT industry will participate in the design, launching, and evaluation of ISE curriculum development, specifically the core ISE course.",
