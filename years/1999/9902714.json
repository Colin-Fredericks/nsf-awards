 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents a radically new multicast model for ad hoc wireless networks.  In this model, the content of the multicast data determines the receiver set for the data and the receiver set changes dynamically as the content of the multicast changes.  Delivering the multicast to intended receivers while minimizing the message overhead and reducing battery consumption is a challenge made harder because of node mobility.  The content of the multicast is specified as time and distance information about the evolving situation in a disaster site or in a battlefield.  Here, information needs to be multicast to receivers to enable them to construct a completed picture of threats and resources in their neighborhood.  However, because some receivers may be moving at high speed while others move more slowly, the definition of the \"neighborhood\" varies dramatically thus complicating the conduct of the multicast.  The ideas contained in the proposal have a significant impact on the efficient distribution of information in ad hoc networks by ensuring that only receivers that really need information receive it.  Finally, an application on the multicast model to the internet is also presented.",
