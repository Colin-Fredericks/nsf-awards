Many of problems are related to M-theory.  This theory can be considered as an extension of string theory.  It is believed that M-theory describes all interactions existing in nature.  It was conjectured recently that M-theory can be formulated as a matrix model, called M(atrix) theory.  It is clear in this approach that the geometry of physical space is non-commutative in some sense, and so it is natural to apply methods of non-commutative geometry.  This idea was used in the formulation of some projects as well as in our recent work concerning toroidal compactifications of M(atrix) theory.  Most of the other problems are related to applications of super-geometry to various problems of quantum field theory, including general problems of quantization of gauge theories and topological quantum field theory.\r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary research is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activity of the Director of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
