 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is aimed at enhancing senior college students' comprehension of endocrinology through student based research, problem solving and learning, and laboratory hands-on investigations. To achieve this, and to expand the students' research equipment pool, the following research equipment is being acquired: a set of mini-gel systems for electrophoresis and blotting techniques, and a microplate reader and ancillaries for precise hormonal measurement by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.  In the new approach, adapted from several projects previously funded by NSF and HHMI, students review literature, develop hypotheses, design and conduct experiments.  By actually participating in scientific inquiry, students master the scientific method, gain enthusiasm and confidence in science, conduct high quality research and presentations. This approach to learning better prepares the students for various post-graduate pursuits and careers. The experience gained is being publicized through manuals, meetings, workshops, journal articles and via internet to schools and colleges around the country.",
