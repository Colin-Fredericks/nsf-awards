A few examples\r\ninclude stabilization of protein structure, oxygen transport, redox\r\nactivity and nucleophilic catalysis. This proposal focuses upon three\r\ndifferent types of site: structural zinc sites, catalytic zinc sites and\r\nredox-active iron sites. The approach taken is to design novel metal\r\nbinding sites on simple protein frameworks that are amenable to study\r\nusing a variety of biophysical methods. In this way the minimal requirements \r\nfor a particular type of site can be systematically explored, and how these \r\nminimal requirements vary with the positioning of the site in the protein\r\nand the nature of the local environment can be investigated. Additional \r\nfeatures can then be incorporated. Such studies are complimentary to those \r\nin which a natural metalloprotein is changed by mutagenesis, or an active \r\nsite is mimicked by a small molecule. They will both enhance our understanding \r\nof natural metalloproteins and generate molecules with novel properties. \r\n\r\n2. Non-technical \r\n\r\nProteins play an enormous number of key roles in all living organisms.\r\nA substantial fraction of these proteins are metalloproteins, which means\r\nthat a bound metal ion is important for protein stability or activity. A\r\nwide variety of catalytic activities are associated with metal ion\r\ncenters. This project is designed to learn more about the requirements of \r\nsuch centers by designing new metal ion binding sites onto simple protein \r\nframeworks that do not normally bind metal ions. In this way we can determine \r\nthe minimum features of a site that are required to achieve a particular\r\nactivity. The outcome of these studies will not only provide a better \r\nunderstanding of the functioning of natural metalloenzymes but also have \r\nthe potential to generate proteins with novel catalytic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
