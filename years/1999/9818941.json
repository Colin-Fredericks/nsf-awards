 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the 1999 Law and Society Association Summer Institute in Sociolegal Studies.  Approximately 25 new entrants to the field of law and society will participate in a four-day program with a faculty of distinguished scholars.  The Institute will provide an opportunity for junior faculty and advanced graduate students to interact with leading figures in sociolegal studies and build linkages between generations of law and social science scholars.  The theme for the 1999 Summer Institute is New Legal Landscapes: Rethinking the Legal Subject in Shifting Contexts.  The 1999 Institute will examine the reconstitution of numerous subjects of legal control at transnational, regional, national and domestic levels.  The central questions to be explored are: How are new legal divisions being forged and old legal divisions being reinforced, and in what ways may this affect whom and what we consider the subjects of legal authority and restraint?  These questions will provide an organizing framework for discussion and exchange of theoretical and research methodologies among the Institute's participants.  The Institute will be organized so that invitees will have an opportunity to meet in small groups to (1) discuss the theoretical ideas in the presentations, and (2) work through specific research ideas and plans.  An explicit goal of the Institute is to provide the kind of small-group exchange, close mentoring, and continued association after the workshop that will enable participants to pursue sociolegal research more effectively.",
