 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a hormone activated transcription factor that acts by regulating specific gene expression.  In the absence of hormone, the GR forms complexes with heat shock proteins (HSPs).  Since heat shock proteins are produced as adaptive response to stress, speculation has existed that communication between the heat shock and glucocorticoid hormone signal pathways must exist.  Only recently has evidence supporting this hypothesis been reported, in that  heat shock  can cause a potentiation of the glucocorticoid response.   Preliminary data demonstrates that heat shock signaling can be regulated by glucocortiocids.  The goal of this project is to determine the nature of  this communication at the molecular level.  The stage of the GR signal pathway involved in regulating activity of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) will be examined.  The results of initial experiments are expected  to show that regulation of HSF occurs either through release of HSPs from the GR complex in response to hormone, or as the result of new synthesis of a GR-regulated gene product.  Follow up experiments will then focus on the mechanism indicated.   General approaches and techniques to be used include: analysis of the effects of wild-type and mutant forms of the GR on stress induced HSF DNA binding and transcription enhancement,  purification of HSF complexes from cells subjected to various treatments, assay for activities of  known negative regulators of HSF, and screening of cells for GR regulated gene products.  These studies will aid in  understanding the molecular mechanism by which two important cellular responses to stress communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
