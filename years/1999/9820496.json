Maldonado and Robert Magnusson\r\n\r\nSince 1985, UT Arlington's Department of Electrical Engineering has conducted a program involving undergraduate scholars in research projects.  In 1991, UTA became an NSF REU site.  Consequently, the program was greatly strengthened by increasing the funding, raising the number of students involved and providing research opportunities during the summer.  This proposal is a request to continue the UTA NSF REU site for 5 additional years.  The program objective will continue to be the participation of undergraduate scholars in research projects with significant interaction between faculty and students.  An academic year component, open to all qualified scholars, and a summer component, designed to emphasize the participation of underrepresented minorities, are proposed.  The scholars will be expected to exhibit qualities such as creativity, productivity, effective communication, and independence upon completion of their training in the program.  Students will participate in the complete research process.  They will select a research topic with their faculty mentor, write a research proposal, conduct the research, analyze data, write progress and final reports, present the work orally, perform an ethics study, and evaluate the REU experience.  Summer students will also participate in visits to local high technology industries and laboratories.  The REU scholars are encouraged to participate in a number of research competitions.  UT Arlington has promoted undergraduate research over the years and hosts an annual campus-wide Symposium on Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity in which the REU scholars are required to participate.  Principal program impact is development of motivated and capable research students with two-thirds of past participants pursuing graduate education.\r\n",
