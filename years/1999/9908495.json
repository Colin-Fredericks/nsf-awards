This work has been carried out within the larger purpose of increasing the pool of talented minority high school students interested in engineering and heightening awareness of engineering within minority communities.  OMP efforts include a week-long residential program for rising high school juniors and seniors, a summer bridge academy for first-year students, internships in the corporate sector, and research opportunities with University of Virginia faculty.  As a result of OMPs programs, over 249 underrepresented minority undergraduate students and 122 graduate students have received degrees from the engineering school during the last ten years. \r\n",
