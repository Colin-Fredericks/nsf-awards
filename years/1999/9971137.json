There is a natural interplay between the\r\nnon-existence of certain types of automorphisms and the existence of\r\ncertain types of invariant sets.  This project will attempt to address\r\nsome of the combinatorial difficulties inherent in extending the\r\ncurrent techniques for automorphisms to finite back-and-forth\r\narguments.  This might help convert the invariant/automorphism\r\ntechnology into a definable/non-definable technology, thus producing\r\npossibly interesting definable sets.\r\n     A recursively enumerable set is a set whose members gain entry\r\nbecause a corresponding computation comes to a halt; thus the\r\nrecursively enumerable sets are examples of a phenomenon described\r\nover time (at any given time one knows only the finite set of members\r\nwhose computation has already halted) but whose actual nature is\r\ntimeless (a potential member is either in or out---the computation\r\neither eventually halts or it never halts).  So the recursively\r\nenumerable sets provide an arena for studying the interplay between\r\nthe appearances in time of some thing and the timeless nature of that\r\nsame thing.  The method used here is to presume, despite appearances,\r\nthat two things are actually `the same' in the sense that they can be\r\nidentified via a symmetry (automorphism).  This either turns out to be\r\nthe case, or the failure of the attempt to produce the desired\r\nsymmetry may (and often does) result in a timeless describable property\r\nseparating the two things and explaining why they are truly different.\r\nThis project also plans to use the above as an exemplar towards\r\nunderstanding the pre-Socratic philosophers.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
