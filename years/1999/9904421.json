The systems to be studied include nitrogenase, hydrogenases as well as 2Fe-2S ferredoxins.  For nitrogenase, the studies will focus on further clarifying the electronic structure of the P-clusters and the FeMo cofactor centers.  These studies will include the use of isotopic hybrids of MoFe protein for which one of the two clusters is selectively enriched with the 57-Fe Mossbauer isotope.  Studies of the associated Fe-protein will be continued with particular emphasis on exploring the biological relevance of the newly discovered all-ferrous form. In addition to characterizing the electronic structure of the all-ferrous [4Fe-4S] clusters, the all-ferrous states of [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters, hitherto uncharacterized with Mossbauer spectroscopy, will be investigated. The studies of hydrogenases will focus on the properties of the NiFe site of [NiFe] hydrogenases and on the H-cluster (6 iron atoms) of Fe-only hydrogenases.  These experimental studies will be complemented by theoretical work that addresses the peculiar properties of the H-cluster.\r\n\r\nMossbauer spectroscopy used in combination with electron paramagnetic resonance is a very powerful tool to study iron-containing clusters found in a variety of proteins and enzymes.  The two techniques have frequently been used to discover new structures present in biological systems, or delineate novel magnetochemical properties.  This project is designed to obtain new insight into the electronic properties of clusters which are currently at the forefront of bio-inorganic chemistry.  The clusters to be studied include two novel structures in the molybdenum and iron containing protein of the biological system that fixes atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia.  The two techniques will also be applied to study two novel cluster assemblies in microbial enzymes involved in the uptake or production of hydrogen.  The goal of these studies is to elucidate the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes and to characterize the magnetochemical properties of the metal centers.\r\n",
