Such a spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF), in addition to providing better frequencies, is expected to be more accurate in structure prediction and molecular dynamics simulations.  Previous NSF support for this research led to the development of an SDFF for saturated hydrocarbon chains, which will now be used in several applications: 1) analysis of the low frequency spectra of crystalline helical syndiotactic polypropylene, in order to identify different types of packing arrangements; 2) a study of the relative stability of this form in comparison with the planar zigzag structure, which is also observed; 3) a determination of the optimum chain conformation and crystal structure of polyisobutylene, which is only partially resolved by x-ray studies.  Continuing studies will develop an SDFF for unsaturated hydrocarbon chains.  This SDFF will be used to calculate structures and spectra of various forms of trans- and cis-1,4-polybutadiene and trans-1,4-polyisoprene.  The results of a parallel development of an SDFF for the hydrogen-bonded amide group will be used to study structures and spectra of nylons.\r\n\r\nThe use of such energy functions in structural and spectroscopic studies of polymers should result in more accurate predictions of their physical properties.  This should enhance the power of computational applications in polymer science and engineering, permitting the development of more complex and sophisticated materials having designed properties.  Such specialty products may not only benefit the economy but can be expected to lead to optimum utilization of our natural resources.\r\n",
