(Totally funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education in the amount of $165,244)\r\n\r\nDLI-Phase 2: Research on a Digital Library for Graphics and Visualization Education\t\r\n\r\nThis is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.  This project focuses on two areas of interest to the development of a national digital library:  testbeds and applications for undergraduate education and  human-centered and collections-based research.  The three goals of the project are 1) to provide a model for the reuse and repurposing of materials in a digital library based upon the Xtensible Markup Language (XML); 2) the improvement of navigation capabilities using information visualization techniques based upon XML and 3D Web graphics; and 3) the creation and development of a collaborative user community.   The project uses standard Web-based technologies and is platform independent.  It is part of the consortium lead by the COLLEGIS Research Institute (CRI) to develop a federated set of collections with a primary emphasis on education.  \r\n\r\nThe project builds upon past ACM Special Interest Group in Graphics (SIGGRAPH) - NSF cooperative efforts, current ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee projects, and the industry effort to create tools for XML and related applications.  It will be a joint effort between ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee (SEC) and the Hypermedia and Visualization Laboratory (HVL) at Georgia State University (GSU).  It focuses on the SEC Digital Library (SECDL) and its community of users.  The SECDL contains a large number of peer reviewed multimedia materials and is rapidly growing in size. It is a stable resource fully supported by SEC.   Using emerging technologies such as XML, this project enables SEC to realize its vision of a hypermedia learning environment that can be used by the community of students and educators from all disciplines interested in computer graphics and visualization.\r\n",
