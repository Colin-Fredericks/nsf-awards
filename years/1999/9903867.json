 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Chemical phenotype matching in wild parsnips and parsnip webworms: causes\r\nand consequences\"\r\n\r\nWild parsnips are attacked by few insect species because they produce toxins called furanocoumarins.  Parsnip webworms can feed on the plant because they can metabolize these toxins.  In different populations, the chemical defense profile of the plants closely resembles the detoxification enzyme profile of the webworms.  The close correspondence of biochemical profiles indicates that plants and insects coevolve, or act as reciprocal selective agents on each other. This project is aimed at understanding how chemical profiles come to match.  Many factors, such as the presence of alternate hostplants, mortality due to predators, and movement of webworms between populations, may influence the degree of chemical profile matching.  These factors and others will be examined in a series of naturally occuring populations in the midwest, as well as in artificially constructed \"mismatched\" populations, to determine ecological influences on the rate and extent of chemical profile matching. . The enzymes that synthesize the defenses in the plants and that dismantle the toxins in the webworm will be characterized at the molecular level, to determine the genetic mechanisms underlying this chemical profile matching.\r\nChemical profile matching resulting from coevolution is of importance in understanding plant-insect interactions in general.  This study will be potentially of value in developing applications aimed at breeding for insect resistance in crop plants, at predicting the rate at which insect pests evolve resistance to synthetic toxins such as insecticides, and at constructing conservation plans that take into account interactions between endangered plant and insect species.\r\n",
