 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze organized efforts to reform drug control policy in the United States. Numerous critiques of current and past anti-drug policies have been published, as have critiques of specific alternative policy paradigms (e.g., interdiction, decriminalization, legalization, treatment and prevention). Thus far, however, no investigator has approached drug policy reform as a social movement and examined its organizational, strategic and rhetorical properties in a relatively dispassionate manner. The first objective of this project is to trace the emergence of drug policy reform movement (DPRM) organizations in the United States since 1970. A further objective is to measure their successes and failures in mobilizing human and material resources and to assess the degree of political legitimacy they have attained. Finally, this study will examine several features of political contention over drug policy which, based upon preliminary work by the principle investigator, appear to be potentially important for its outcome. One of these is the \"structure\" of drug issues, i.e., the degree to which positions on drug abuse and drug policy cross conventional political and social boundaries. Another is the coexistence of multiple and contradictory factions within drug policy groups. A third specific analytic focus of the investigation is the role of \"wild card units\" in the DPR movement, i.e., groups whose participation is solicited because it might serve to neutralize derogatory stereotypes and caricatures of reformers by their opponents.",
