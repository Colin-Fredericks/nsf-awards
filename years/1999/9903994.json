 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many animals, early embryonic development is controlled by molecules positioned in the egg before fertilization.  The best known examples are the \"head factors\" found in the insect Drosophila, and the vertebrate amphibian Xenopus, where RNA messages (maternal messages) are positioned at the anterior end of the developing egg.  When activated after fertilization, they produce control proteins in that localized region, which anteriorization resulting in head formation.  However, localization of these and similar \"messages\" require a prior level of control factors which operate in the formation of the egg itself, insuring that it provides the proper milieu for maternal message localization.  In most animals this involves the formation of an ovarian follicle consisting of an oocyte and one or more sibling nurse cells, the latter being the site of synthesis for most of the RNA used during early development.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this proposal, which extends research in continual progress for 27 years, focus on illuminating and understanding the physiological mechanisms which regulate and control egg formation (oogenesis), which in turn provide the framework into which the maternal messages can be inserted.  Of particular interest is the involvement of internal ionic Ca2+ in the regulatory process. Using microinjection, two dimensional gel electrophoresis and intracellular microelectrodes, this research explores the relationship between an internal Ca2+ current and the distribution of charged cytosolic proteins which may regulate cell functions.  Much of the proposal is based upon extending to Drosophila concepts originally demonstrated with eggs of Hyalophora cecropia, a moth which has frequently served as a research model.  Specific objectives Drosophila include measurements of internal ion activities and ion pumps to better characterize the oocyte cell physiology of this organism so frequently used in research.  In addition it is proposed to determine the effects of changed ion physiology upon the distribution of endogenous cytosolic proteins and upon uridine incorporating activity by the oocyte nucleus.  Overall, this research seeks to increase understanding of the mechanisms which regulate egg production, with the expectation that they will apply not only to insects, but to vertebrate species as well.\r\n",
