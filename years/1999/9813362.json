 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical linear algebra is the subfield that solves systems of linear\r\nequations on digital computers. These systems appear in many fields of\r\napplied science and engineering, as linear equations are the simplest and\r\nmost common approximation to many more complex equations. Numerical\r\nsolutions to these systems are routinely used to solve problems ranging\r\nfrom structural engineering to electromagnetic radiation studies. Because\r\nof their ubiquitous nature, subroutine libraries for solving these problems\r\nHas been one of the most important (and most studied) areas in\r\ncomputational science. This project extends one of the most widely-used of\r\nthese software packages - the LAPACK project - to use new algorithms and to\r\nrun on the next generation of hardware.\r\n\r\nThis project will pursue a broad range of synergistic activities to design\r\nand implement numerical linear algebra algorithms. It targets a range of\r\ndense and sparse linear systems and eigenvalue problems. The overall goal\r\nis to produce the fastest and most accurate solvers for these problems, and\r\nmake them available to a broad and changing user community. Besides the\r\nexisting large LAPACK user community, the software will be made available\r\nas a Grid-enabled service to the PACI, Millennium and ASCI user communities\r\n(Millennium is the Berkeley high performance computing environment).\r\nIndeed, much of the proposed research is motivated by particular\r\napplications demands from these communities. Given the size and diversity\r\nof these communities, part of the project is educational in nature, to\r\nenable users from experts to beginning students to find what they need\r\namong the wealth of tools available. Finally, the researchers are motivated\r\nto meet the opportunities and challenges of new architectures in growing\r\nuse; besides the distributed environment mentioned before, they include\r\nclusters of SMPs (or \"CLUMPs\").\r\n\r\n\r\n",
