 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Professor Gary Kinsel of the University of Texas at Arlington is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the development of a new systematic approach for the study of biomolecular surface interaction that forms the core of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization experiment.  Surfaces are prepared in a number of novel methods, including beam approaches, and then the MALDI responses measured in order to develop an interpretive framework.  In addition to direct applications to improved MALDI analysis, applications to understanding such surface properties as contact adsorption and biofouling are envisioned.   The educational aspect of the proposal focuses on the development of  laboratory courses and mentoring programs under the auspices of a Materials Science program at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe laser-based method of mass spectrometric analysis depends on proper sample preparation.  The work described by Gary Kinsel will establish the types of interactions between metal surfaces and the protein biomolecules often analyzed by laser-based mass spectrometry, and provide the information needed for sample preparation leading to higher sensitivity and specificity in analysis.\r\n",
