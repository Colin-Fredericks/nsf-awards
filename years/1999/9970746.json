 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this research is to develop and evaluate general-purpose architectures for emerging and future media-processing applications. These applications are expected to require orders-of-magnitude higher performance than available on today's general-purpose systems. A key challenge is to design systems that will provide such performance improvements for media applications, without sacrificing performance for more conventional applications.\r\n\r\nThis research avails of a unique opportunity to bring together architecture researchers and applications researchers working on the technologies underlying media processing.  The research focuses on three classes of applications: (1) signal processing; specifically, video, image, audio, speech processing, and high-speed modems, (2) wireless communication, and (3) virtual environments and visualization. The approach is to use simulation to develop a quantitative understanding of the behavior of these applications, and use this understanding to develop new architectural techniques.  An initial quantitative study of image and video applications has motivated two architectural directions: (I) design of dynamically partitionable caches, and (II) use of reconfigurable logic for specialized media functions for a general-purpose system.\r\n\r\nIn the past, such architectural research has been impeded by a lack of access to applications.  The proposed collaboration with industry and other researchers will overcome this impediment and enable the design of future architectures based on future applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
