The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Rosa A. Gonzalez with support for twenty-four months to work at the Observatoire de Geneve at the Universite de Geneve in Sauverny, Switzerland, with a group of researchers led by Dr. Pfenninger.  Twelve months is being supported by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\nDr. Gonzalez will apply two original and successful photometric methods to address two important and outstanding questions:  the dust content and distribution of spiral galaxy disks, and the nature and driving mechanisms of spiral structure itself.  She will use a method she has developed called \"Synthetic Field Method\" to measure average total extinction through the disks of nearby spiral galaxies, from colors and counts of background galaxies. This will be the largest study to date of total extinction in spirals, and will allow the first assumption-free determination of the radial distribution of dust in galaxy disks.  By combining optical and near-infrared data into a reddening-free, supergiant-sensitive photometric parameter, and comparing the results to stellar population synthesis models, she will search for azimuthal stellar gradients and measure the angular velocity of the spiral pattern (in a different sample of galaxies).  Her goal is to secure the first statistics on the frequency of density waves in the stellar component of spiral galaxies.\r\nThe Geneva Observatory has mechanic and computer workshops, instrument calibration labs and a computer center.  It has an active participation within the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the European Space Agency.  The participation in the ESO will offer Dr. Gonzalez access to unique telescope facilities.  Dr. Pfenniger has published extensively on galaxy dynamics.\r\n***\r\n",
