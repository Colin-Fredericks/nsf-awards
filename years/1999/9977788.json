This highly innovative project will revise the current course offerings of both institutions in plant molecular genetics and replace them with an on-line course and laboratory curriculum made possible via Internet II connectivity.  This distance learning experiment also plans to involve nationally recognized researchers in plant genetics at other institutions and make them accessible to students at MSU and NDSU both through \"guest lecture\" modules incorporated into the courses and as remote mentors for graduate student questions and research problems by way of an on-line chat room.  Funds are provided for high throughput DNA sequencing equipment and other instrumentation to set up identical suites of state-of-the-art equipment for molecular research and for technical support positions to design and maintain the on-line course and dialogue materials.\r\n\r\nThis facility will strongly enhance the graduate programs of both institutions and is expected to foster positive relationships with biotechnology industries, potentially leading to a system of student internships.\r\n",
