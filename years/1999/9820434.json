 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9820434\r\nLipo\r\n\r\nThis U.S.-Czech engineering research project between Thomas Lipo of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Miroslav Chomat of the Czech Institute of Electrical Engineering, Prague, features development of a theoretical basis for the analysis, modeling, and control of variable-speed drives that employ advanced types of low cost, highly efficient electric machines.  The researchers intend to derive detailed mathematical models suitable for simulating both transient and steady state operations for such drives.  Their models in turn will permit analysis of electromagnetic processes taking place in the machines under various operating conditions.\r\n\r\nResults should shed light on the dynamic behavior of the drives and improve our understanding of spatial distribution of the magnetic field in electric machines, including the influence of magnetic saturation, iron losses, and higher space harmonics.  Experimental investigations are also planned to verify the mathematical models and optimize the control algorithms used.  Basic findings may yield new circuit and control concepts for reduced cost variable speed drives with significant potential for application in low cost air conditioning drives.\r\n\r\nThis electrical engineering research project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
