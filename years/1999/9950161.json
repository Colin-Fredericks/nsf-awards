 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adapts and implements newly developed interactive courseware that significantly utilizes multimedia into its undergraduate statistics program. The materials are designed to improve students' understanding of basic statistical concepts and their quantitative literacy while providing a flexible, helpful and individualized learning environment.  The materials to be adapted and implemented were developed by Bell Laboratories in collaboration with the Department and have already been tested in the Department's basic non-calculus-based introductory statistics course. \r\n\r\nStudents who take courses in the Department come from over 60 different departments, and include science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) students as well as non-SMET students. The courses offered range from introductory courses for students wishing to fulfill the University's quantitative reasoning requirement to more specialized courses for students with interests in applications to engineering or the life sciences. The statistical training offered in these courses provides students a rare opportunity to learn how to think critically about quantitative problems that are and will be important to them. We believe that providing these students with laboratory exercises in an interactive and dynamic environment can be a very effective educational device. \r\n\r\nThis project creates a laboratory environment where instructors can easily integrate these materials into the curriculum, and where students can work using the computer both in a classroom environment and on their own outside of the classroom.  Along with integrating the new materials into the statistics program, project activities include preparing guides and conducting training sessions for faculty on the use of these materials, and studying the impact of this software on student learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
