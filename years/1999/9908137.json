 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses a number of challenges related to the full realization of the potential of supply chain infrastructures(SCIs), which include those software systems used to support enterprise requirements planning (ERP) and supply chain management (SCM).  A software testbed, which initially will include an SCM component, an ERP component and a middleware component, will be constructed.  The research will employ techniques from operations research, computer science and empirical information systems.   Integer programming based resource allocation models will be developed and embedded within a simulation.  The simulation will be used in conjunction with two empirical studies of organizational decision making to explore the relationships between SCIs and organization structure.  Research on the development of mechanisms for effective query processing in web-like settings will be pursued with the goal of improving efficient SCI implementation in large organizations.  ERP and SCM systems are achieving significant levels of deployment throughout the world.  The research undertaken here is aimed at improving the efficiency of\r\nthese systems and their effectiveness in enhancing organizational performance.\r\n     Practical contributions are anticipated in the following areas:  improvements in the understanding\r\nof how information technology impacts organizations and the how organizations should adapt to take advantage of new SCI technology;  the development of decision models that both explain how supply chain decision making should take place in organizations and provide new techniques for supply chain decision support; new methods for efficiently implementing scalable web-based applications.\r\n\r\n",
