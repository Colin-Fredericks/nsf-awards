 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pines are one of the world's most important crops and one of the most important genera of trees in the world's forests. Pines, as gymnosperms, represent one of the oldest and most successful groups of higher plants. Pines can be difficult to study, due to their long generation times and large DNA content; however, new technology and a genomic strategy promise great returns in knowledge and practical application from understanding the fundamental biology of trees. Forest trees are in the earliest stages of domestication and the major genetic changes usually associated with domestication have not yet been made. Therefore, a genomic approach to understanding the formation of wood and the identification of the genes that determine the major features of wood properties could lead to genetic modifications of great economic significance. Virtually every problem of scientific or commercial importance that depends upon the biology of pine trees would be advanced by knowledge of the identity and function of all of the expressed genes. Wood formation is also of general biological interest as a specialized system for both biochemical and genetic analysis of cell wall biosynthesis. \r\n\r\nThis award will allow us to identify and characterize large numbers of genes that are important in wood formation (xylogenesis) and determine how many of these genes affect the properties of wood and its derived products, pulp and paper.  First, we propose to identify large numbers of expressed genes from differentiating xylem. Second, we will use DNA microarrays to identify genes implicated in the formation of the wood cell wall, through studies of their specific regulation, abundance, or interactions. Third, new methods will be developed to map these genes onto the pine genome using microarrays. The fourth objective is an intensive effort to obtain phenotypic information on the physical and chemical properties of wood from mapping populations. This phenotypic information will be used to map loci having quantitative effects on wood properties and to identify concordance between genes identified from expression data/map location and the wood property phenotypes. Similarly, association in populations of alleles and phenotypes will be examined for genes affecting wood properties and to identify alleles that may be useful for tree breeding.\r\n\r\nThis award will lead to the discovery of a large number of functional plant genes, many of which may have novel functions. The large sequence database of gymnosperm gene sequences will be a rich source of comparative sequence information for studies of evolution and functional genomics of all plant genomes.  There is currently very little information available on the sequences of genes from gymnosperms, one of the two major groups of higher plants.  A genomic approach to understanding the biology of pines represents the first major public genome initiative on an undomesticated forest species with a dominant role in the world's temperate ecosystems.  Such studies will lead to understanding of the molecular basis of response to climate change and adaptation in both the recent past and since the conquest of the land by higher plants.  \r\n",
