A central goal is to test the degree to which elemental concentrations in enamel and dentine reflect diet, nutrition and environmental exposure.\r\n\tThis research is made possible by recent developments in analytical chemistry. Specifically, the development of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ( LA-ICP-MS ) makes possible an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together complementary expertise and a research collection of over 400 teeth from persons residing in communities in Mexico and Egypt. The teeth are key resources because dietary intakes and other key factors were thoroughly documented during their calcification.\r\n\tThe distribution of a suite of elements in enamel and dentine ( including iron,zinc,\r\nlead, and strontium ) will be studied to determine elemental variation within these two relatively stable populations and between simultaneously developing dental tissues. The major thrust of this project is to determine the impact of three factors - diet, environment, and physiology - on tissue concentrations of the aformentioned elements. This study can provide a better understanding of tooth chemistry which could be applied to a wide range of concerns that may be biological, anthropological or environmental in nature. \r\n\r\n",
