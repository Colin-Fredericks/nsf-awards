Organizers are Dr. Philip Cole, U. of Texas, El Paso, and Dr. Fernando Cristancho, Universidad Nacional, Bogota, Colombia.  The aim of the project is is to promote dialog among faculty members and students of North and Latin American institutions, with the purpose to reach common research interests and goals and the opportunity to coordinate programs in nuclear physics research.  Through this effort, they expect to strengthen links and forge new ones within the broad scope of the international nuclear physics community.  These links will help to foster the recruitment of high-caliber graduate level students to pursue research at US institutions and laboratories.  This will help to alleviate the shortage of graduate students pursuing advanced degrees in experimental and theoretical nuclear physics ,that is felt a present in the national laboratories..  \r\n \r\n***   \r\n",
