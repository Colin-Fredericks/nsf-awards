Prasad\r\n\r\nThis grant will support participation by US scientists, faculty, and graduate students at the Third International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal Growth.\r\nThe intent of the funding is to expand the research base and student participation. \r\nThe previous two workshops were held in Germany and Belgium and with the increased emphasis on crystal growth it is appropriate that a workshop be held in the United States. The workshop will cover a broad range of topics related to mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of the growth of single crystals and crystalline layers.  It will focus on physical phenomena taking place at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scale, global modeling of the processes, model-based design of experiments, and the use of the models for prototyping and control.  Speakers, who do not normally work in crystal growth but whose expertise will assist in understanding the growth process, will give presentations in the areas of thermal manufacturing, computational material processing, process optimization, virtual reality, and control. An abstract proceeding and a volume containing peer reviewed papers will be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
