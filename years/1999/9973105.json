 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973105\r\nSchecter\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to continue their research on singular \r\nperturbations, systems of conservation laws and related systems not in \r\nconservation form, and homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation \r\nphenomena.  These areas are related: sharp fronts in singular perturbation \r\nproblems, and shock waves in systems of conservation laws and related \r\nsystems not in conservation form, can be viewed as traveling waves, \r\nwhich correspond to heteroclinic (or sometimes homoclinic) solutions of \r\nan associated equation.  The proposed research falls into four areas: (1) \r\nsystems of conservation laws (failure of strict hyperbolicity, geometric \r\nsingular perturbation theory and the Dafermos regularization); (2) shock \r\nsolutions of initial-value problems for systems not in conservation form; \r\n(3) chaos in a perturbed Rayleigh-Benard convection model that models \r\nthe dynamo mechanism responsible for the earth's magnetic field; (4) other \r\napplied problems involving singular perturbation or homoclinic \r\nbifurcation (forced Chua's circuit, multiple-stage cancer models, plasma \r\nand sheath models).\r\n\r\nSharp wave fronts occur in many areas of science.  At the first level of \r\napproximation, they are simple traveling waves that keep their shape and \r\nmove at a constant speed.  Mathematically, traveling waves correspond to \r\n\"heteroclinic solutions of ordinary differential equations.\"  These can be \r\nthought of as moving particles that start near an unstable equilibrium and \r\nmove toward another unstable equilibrium.  Cycles of such solutions often \r\ngive rise to chaos.  The investigators propose to continue their research in \r\nthese related areas.  For example, they will study certain unusual shock \r\nwaves that arise in model equations for oil recovery.  They will study \r\nshock waves for systems \"not in conservation form,\" which arise in fluid \r\nmechanics and elasticity problems when the original systems are \r\nsimplified to make them more tractable.  They will study chaos in a model \r\nfor the earth's magnetic field, which is believed to be related to irregular \r\nreversals of the magnetic field that have occurred in the past. They will try \r\nto improve the \"plasma-sheath\" models used to model various industrial \r\nsituations, such as fluorescent light fixtures; the solutions include a sharp \r\nfront.\r\n",
