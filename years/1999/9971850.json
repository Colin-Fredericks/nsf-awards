This is a useful step in\r\ntrying to understand stable homotopy theory, since the decomposition is\r\nexpressed in terms of simpler localizations.  In particular, the\r\nconjecture would generalize the very beautiful relationships known\r\nbetween the 0th, 1st, and 2nd chromatic levels.  Similarly, the\r\n``chromatic Segal conjecture'' (due in various forms to combinations of\r\nMike Hopkins, Mark Mahowald, and Doug Ravenel) deals with a\r\ndecomposition of the Tate cohomology of the localization of a finite\r\nCW-complex with respect to the nth Morava K-theory.  Again, this\r\nconjecture intertwines different chromatic levels in a beautiful way;\r\ntogether they give some techniques for inductively determining\r\ninformation about higher chromatic levels from lower ones (like\r\nrational homotopy theory and K-theory).  These conjectures both also\r\ngive data about how the cohomology of the different Morava stabilizer\r\ngroups are related.  The tool used to attack these conjectures is a\r\nspectral sequence based on ideas from work of Goerss that computes the\r\nBP-homology of various spectra involved in this calculation in terms\r\nof the derived functors of inverse limits of comodules over the Hopf\r\nalgebroid of BP-operations.  Surprisingly, at least in the first\r\ninteresting cases, the higher inverse limits seem to be tractable.\r\n     This research is concerned with understanding ``homotopy classes of\r\nfunctions.''  A simple example of the sort of problem studied is given\r\nby considering knot theory.  Take a ``knot'' in space to be a loop of\r\nstring embedded in space in some way.  One is not really interested in\r\n*all* ways of embedding that loop of string; if one can get from one\r\nway of embedding the loop to another just by moving the string a\r\nlittle bit, one considers those two embeddings to be equivalent.\r\nSimilarly, if one looks at all ways of putting a loop of string in the\r\nplane with the origin removed, one considers two ways the same if the\r\nloop of string is wound around the origin the same number of times.\r\nAs the second example makes clear, it is critical to understand\r\n``holes'' in the space to which one is mapping, and how the space from\r\nwhich one is mapping interacts with those holes.  There are different\r\nsorts of holes, though; a circle has a hole one can pass something through,\r\nwhile a (hollow) sphere has a different sort of hole.  The ``holes''\r\nassociated to a map (or to a space) can be sorted into different\r\nflavors (usually referred to as different chromatic components).\r\nThese components do not appear to be independent for spaces and maps\r\narising from geometric considerations, and the goal is to understand\r\nthese dependencies.  Solutions to this sort of problem are potentially\r\nrelated to questions from geometry, but at the same time, surprisingly,\r\nto objects arising in number theory, something that gives this work far\r\ngreater importance than would either aspect alone.\r\n***\r\n",
