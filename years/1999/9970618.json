The objective of this proposal is to continue with the development of an analogous subject, termed algebraic geometry over groups, which applies specifically to group theory.  A number of new ideas have arisen which allow us to not only develop a general theory for groups, akin to that in algebraic geometry, but also to look at various classes of groups in a new way.  In particular there are groups which in a sense are the counterpart to curves, so-called one-relator groups, which can now be studied from a very different vantage point.  In addition, techniques from computational group theory come into play as well and we plan on exploiting them also, in the tenure of this proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion of symmetry is familiar to most of us.  For example, wall-paper patterns, the beautiful arrangements of naturally occurring chrystals and the floor tilings of many old churches are but a few examples of symmetry. Mathematicians have invented a highly abstract object, called a group, which allows them to capture and measure symmetry.  The general investigation of such objects, called group theory, has been carried out with this in mind.  This theory has applications to much of modern mathematics as well as to physics, chemistry, biology, to the theory of computing, to cryptography as well as to our physical world of three and four dimensions.  It is to the further development of this general theory of these groups that this proposal will be devoted.\r\n",
