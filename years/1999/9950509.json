 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning Algebra and Statistics courses at Spartenburg Technical College are being transformed from lecture-based courses to project-based courses in which students learn content as they progress through a series of projects.   Goals include: (1) technology literate graduates; (2) graduates with better affective skills, including problem-solving and team-building skills; (3) graduates with a clear conception of mathematics as it relates to the real world; and (4) a model for mathematics education at the two-year college level. \r\n\r\nThis project is adapting, extending, and implementing materials and practices developed by a number of projects including \"Interactive Statistics\" by Martha Aliaga and Brenda Gunderson; \"Practical Statistics by Example Using Microsoft Excel\" by Terry Sincich, David Levine,and David Stephen; \"Data-Driven Statistics Courses in an Interactive Teaching Laboratory (DUE-9751571), Project Chance; and others.  The current project will also develop some new materials.\r\n\r\n",
