 "awd_abstract_narration": "Christopher J. Grayce is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop a mesoscopic treatment of solvent influence on general models of polymer association, conformational transition and slow dynamics.  Density functional theoretical techniques, along with geometric theories of solvation, will be used to construct solvent influence functionals.  Grayce's teaching plan involves both graduate and undergraduate contributions.  At the graduate level he will develop a more comprehensive, fully modern graduate program in statistical mechanics of complex systems.  At the undergraduate level he plans to put the insight accessible from direct computer simulation into the hands of freshman and physical chemistry students.\r\n\r\nIn biological systems water solvation plays a well-recognized role in the folding of proteins and in molecular recognition and binding.  Industrial polymers are commonly dissolved in or swollen by a variety of solvents during synthesis, processing or end use, and key engineering properties such as solubility, rate and degree of swelling, surface activity, diffusion rate and viscosity all depend strongly on solvent influence.  Grayce's research will attempt to describe solvent influence in polymer systems by statistical mechanical theory grounded in exact microscopic equations of motion and / or microscopically realistic interatomic potentials.  \r\n\r\n",
