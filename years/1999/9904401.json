 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over 100 years, it has been recognized that primates, including humans, show unusual gait patterns and force distribution compared to those of most other mammals.  Throughout this century, it has been assumed that these distinctive characteristics of primate movement as well as anatomical features such as grasping clawless hands, are the result of an initial adaptation of primates to moving and feeding on thin branches. Despite the intuitive appeal of this scenario, the mechanical relationships between primate features and arboreal lifestyle remain uncertain. This research project, to be carried out at the Duke University Vertebrate Movement Laboratory, is designed to test the link between primate anatomical and gait characteristics and thin branch locomotion.  The researchers will compare hand and foot use, footfall patterns, and forces in small primates and opossums while they move and feed on arboreal supports.  These two groups were chosen because their natural habitat is made up of thin branches. As a result, they represent a way to verify if specific morphological and behavioral traits are necessary for such a lifestyle.  Data from this study will not only help us to understand early primate adaptations, but will also shed light on the evolution of specialized primate movement patterns, such as brachiation and striding bipedalism.",
