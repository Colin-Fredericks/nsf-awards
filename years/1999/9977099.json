Applications of this technique to the fundamental classes of normal to paracompact spaces were pioneered by M.E.Rudin. It has been refined and expanded by the Principal Investigator during the previous grant period to get answers to some of the questions left undecided in this area.\r\nSpecific improvements include the technique of complete neighborhoods, reflection tricks as well as new applications. Such constructions are laborious, and so the problems targeted need to be  (a) well-known, preferably old and considered basic;  (b) have no known ad hoc solutions; (c) lend themselves to some \"natural\" inductive construction. Examples of such problems are abundant in the classes of spaces ranging from normal to paracompact. It is expected that the applications will reach into other areas of topology, analysis and infinite combinatorics.\r\n \r\nResearch in set-theoretic topology is aimed at finding out the properties of abstract topological spaces using methods of set theory and model theory. Such research builds, in the setting of a concrete mathematical discipline, concrete techniques of handling infinite objects and processes. It is expected that the techniques will be applicable in other areas of mathematics and interactions with set theory and model theory will be enriched.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
