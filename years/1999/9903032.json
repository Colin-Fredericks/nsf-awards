 "awd_abstract_narration": "9903032\r\nSamson\r\n\r\nSeveral circum-Atlantic Neoproterozoic terranes, such as Avalon, Carolina, and Cadomia, have generally similar characteristics, suggesting the possibility that these terranes are directly related.  However, many critical aspects of terrane characterization need to be determined before hypotheses about possible terrane relationships can be fully evaluated.  Aspects of terrane characterization that are crucial to any meaningful comparisons include establishing the age and nature of the basement to the terrane, determining the timing of initiation of magmatism and subsequent magmatic events within the terranes, documenting the geochemical character of each magmatic episode, documenting the initiation, duration, and style of first-order deformational events, and determining the history of basin development and sedimentation.  These aspects of terrane characterization will be carried out for two major segments of the Cadomian orogenic belt in the North Armorican Massif of France, a region only minimally affected by Variscan deformation.  Results are expected to improve understanding of the development and dispersion of these neoproterozoic terranes that were once in close proximity, but now are widely distributed around the margins of the Atlantic.   \r\n\r\n   \r\n",
