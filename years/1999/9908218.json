 "awd_abstract_narration": "***\r\n9908218\r\nGlaser\r\nEngineers have always relied on rate- and state-dependent constitutive models\r\n(behavioral criteria). Recent advances by the condensed-matter physics\r\ncommunity have resulted in hypothetical theoretical mechanisms responsible for\r\nfrictional resistance to sliding. These models explain behaviors from angstrom\r\nscale to kilometers-long earthquake dislocations, and provide a theoretical\r\nframework for understanding material creep as well as self-healing slip on the\r\nSan Andreas fault.  Since there has been little direct experimental proof that\r\nthe posited fundamental physical mechanisms indeed are at work, the PIs will\r\nleverage their experimental and interpretive ability to image these\r\nmicro-mechanisms. Given that the fundamental kinematics of frictional junctions\r\nresults in production of phonons (vibrational, hence acoustic, energy), the\r\ncombination of quantitative acoustic emission and waveform inversion is\r\nuniquely able to image these kinematics. Glaser has developed surface and\r\nembeddable sensors proven capable by NIST of measuring picometer displacements\r\nfrom 10 kHz to 1 MHz to within 3 dB.  Studies show that the dynamic record\r\ntransduced by these sensors match the theoretical kinematic waveforms\r\nremarkably well, allowing whole-waveform inversion for source kinematics rather\r\nthan single-point moment tensor inversion. \r\n\r\nThe results of this project will further science and engineering on several\r\nlevels. Fundamental understanding of the physical mechanisms behind sliding\r\nfriction, leading to improvement of basic understanding of the physical world. \r\nThis will help refine current empirical understanding of friction and allow\r\ngreat improvement in mechanical design from nanomachines to sub-kilometer-scale\r\nstructures.  In addition, fundamental questions about kilometer-scale\r\nearthquake source mechanisms will be answered, in particular the issues\r\nsurrounding the notion of self-healing slip, thereby leading to an improved\r\nunderstanding of the earthquake dislocation mechanism, and ultimately improved\r\nseismic safety.\r\n***\r\n",
