It also is used widely in acoustics and continuum mechanics. Although the FDTD method has existed for over 30 years, the popularity of this computationally-intensive method continues to grow as computing costs continue to decline. In addition, extensions and enhancements to the method are introduced frequently, further broad-ening its appeal. Because of the tremendous amount of FDTD-related research activity, tracking the FDTD literature is a daunting task. To help researchers avoid duplication and quickly sort through the FDTD literature, an on-line (Web-accessible) database was constructed by the PI and a colleague, Dr. Kurt L. Shlager. Although this database is used widely by the FDTD community, there are several ways in which it, and the software that supports it, can be enhanced to build an on-line resource that provides much greater utility. Funds from this grant will be used to create an open database to which anyone can contribute comments, corrections, and additions. These contributions typically will be associated with citations to previously published work. When a user looks for literature on a particular subject, he or she will see not only the standard biblio-graphic information for the relevant citations, but also the comments for each. The database could be used, for example, by an author who wishes to note a minor typographical error that appeared in a publication, i.e, an error that the author feels does not warrant submission of an errata to the journal. Furthermore, a more substantive typographical error can be brought to the attention of the community immediately via the database (while the errata makes its way to press). Users will be able to comment on the content of publications--what appears to be worthy of notice and what appears to be lacking--and the authors of the paper will be free to clarify, expound, supplement, or rebut as they deem appropriate. By soliciting the collective knowledge of the FDTD community, the database will provide far more information than currently can be gathered individually. The database will be accessible via the Web and all the software developed will be open source and freely made available. Thus, other researchers who have interests in areas that enjoy significant at-tention and activity can easily host a similar on-line database/Web site that will aid their respective research communities.\r\n***",
