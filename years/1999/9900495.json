 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop, entitled \"Workshop on Mechanisms of Developmental Disruption in Amphibians,\" will be held November 5-7, 1998 at the San Diego Zoo. This workshop follows two previous workshops sponsored by the National Science Foundation that addressed issues pertaining to amphibian declines and die-offs. The first, \"Workshop on Amphibian Declines\", held May 28 - 29, at the NSF, brought together biologists who have been working on amphibian declines around the world. One area of research identified for further consideration was the function of the amphibian immune system with regards to the hypothesis that amphibian die-offs are occurring as a result of environmental factors that are altering the balance between pathogens and hosts. To focus on these issues a second, NSF-sponsored \"Workshop on Amphibian Diseases and Immunity\" was held at the San Diego Zoo, July 26-28, 1998. Both workshops pointed out the necessity to address these issues with a broad scientific perspective ranging from the population level to the molecular level. In particular, it was repeatedly noted that the most vulnerable life history stages of the amphibians are during embryonic and larval development, and that an understanding of the effects of environmental agents on these stages is essential. This third workshop is organized to extend the results of the previous workshops into discussions of the developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-induced congenital malformations in amphibians (\"deformed frogs\"). In addition, the proposed workshop will for the first time explicitly address the question of the relationship between amphibian declines and amphibian malformations. The goal of the third workshop is to build upon the accomplishments of the earlier workshops, and to expand the research discussed to include more mechanism-oriented approaches to the problem. The workshop will bring together participants from the previous workshops, including both workshop organizers, with researchers in the areas of limb development and regeneration, endocrinology, developmental immunology, parasitology, receptor-ligand interactions, amphibian early development and metamorphosis, and endocrine disruption. The workshop will be structured to produce a consensus statement addressing issues pertaining to amphibian malformations and the relationship between declines and malformations that will be published in a basic research journal such as Teratology or Developmental Biology.\r\n \r\n",
