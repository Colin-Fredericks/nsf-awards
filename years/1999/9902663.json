The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Lisa K. Fleischer with support for six months to work with Dr. Bill Cunningham at the Fields Institute for Research in the Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto in Canada.\r\nThis project will focus on the development of techniques to solve hard combinatorial problems in network design and routing; problems that arise in transportation, communication and security.  Examples of this include assigning airline crews to flights, scheduling automobile production processes, partitioning and clustering shipments of goods for transport, and designing telecommunication networks.  The techniques Dr. Fleischer will explore are those of approximation algorithms and of polyhedral combinatorics.  She will participate in the Fields Institute special semester devoted to these topics.\r\nDr. Cunningham is organizing this semester at the Fields Institute.  In addition to working with Dr. Cunningham, Dr. Fleischer will be interacting with Drs. Levent Tuncel, University of Waterloo and Dr. Michel Goemans from the University of Louvain, Belgium.\r\n***\r\n",
