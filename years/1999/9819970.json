 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cretaceous period has been considered an analog for an ice-free Earth during which warm conditions prevailed, reflecting high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.  However, evidence from the polar regions suggest that the warm periods during the Cretaceous were intervened by episodes of much colder temperatures.  An indicator of cool conditions is glendonite which is a calcium carbonate pseudomorph of ikaite.  Ikaite is found in rapidly deposited organic-rich sediments in polar regions.  Glendonites are found in the Early Cretaceous sediments in the Canadian Arctic, Svalbard, and northern Siberia and they may record a global climate signal.  The Principal Investigator will undertake both field and laboratory studies to construct a magnetostratigraphy in sediments of the Canadian Arctic (Sverdrup Basin) which contains glendonite-bearing horizons.  After the magnetostratigraphy is determined, he can test whether these cool climate indicators correspond with short-term variations in eustatic sea level, thus supporting periodic polar glaciation during the Cretaceous.  He will also conduct geochemical analyses on the glendonites to better understand their origins through trace element measurements and use carbon isotopes to examine whether methane was involved in ikaite formation.",
