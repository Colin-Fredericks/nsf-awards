 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is aimed at the study of regularity properties of  solutions\r\nof various systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. These include:\r\n(i) Quasilinear elliptic systems arising as Euler-Lagrange equations\r\nof general multiple integrals in the Calculus of Variations and \r\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Questions arising in the study of\r\nregularity of solutions of these equations will be studied from the point\r\nof view of the theory of Compensated Compactness, which provides a unifying\r\nplatform for approaching these seemingly diverse problems. \r\nWe expect that  new  methods in Compensated Compactness recently developed\r\nby Stefan Muller and the PI will enable us to give answers to some relatively\r\nold open questions.\r\n(ii) The Navier-Stokes equations. Here we plan to study both the interior\r\nand boundary regularity for important special classes of solutions.\r\nThe motivation for these investigation is the following: since regularity\r\nquestions for general solutions are notoriously intractable, it will be useful\r\nto study some non-trivial special cases. Hopefully this will provide  \r\ninsights for the general case.\r\nWe also plan to study the relationship between Morrey's quasiconvexity\r\nand local ellipticity conditions for functions on two by two matrices.\r\nThis  problem has recently been linked to some old and difficult conjectures\r\nin Harmonic Analysis and the theory of quasi-conformal mappings, and we expect\r\nthat the interaction of ideas from these different areas  will be fruitful.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this proposal is the study of regularity properties of\r\nsolution of nonlinear partial differential equations. Such equations\r\nappear in many models of the real-world processes. The task of\r\nmathematicians is  to solve these equations. Often this\r\nis done by a numerical simulation on a computer. To be able to do\r\nsuch simulations in a reliable way, one must know something about\r\nthe qualitative behavior of the solutions. For example, if we expect that\r\nthe solutions will oscillate wildly over small distances, we might need\r\na different method than in the case when the solutions change only\r\nslowly. Roughly speaking, one of the main task of regularity\r\ntheory is to develop methods which would enable us to reliably\r\npredict the behavior of the solutions, so that we can then choose\r\nadequately the methods for solving the equations. \r\nThe proposed research will hopefully improve our understanding\r\nof these difficult and important questions.\r\n\r\n",
