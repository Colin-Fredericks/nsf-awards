 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOsteoblasts and osteoclasts, bone-form and bone-resorbing cells, respectively, mediate growth, modeling, remodeling, and repair of bone.  The adult skeleton routinely undergoes remodeling in response to physical, hormonal, and metabolic stresses.  However, uncoupling of the remodeling process by increasing osteoclastic activity without increasing bone formation to the same extent, can lead to a net bone loss. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research by Dr. Wilson is to determine mechanisms by which osteoclastic activity can be increased to increase bone resorption.  Increased bone resorption can be a result of the formation of increased numbers of osteoclasts from progenitors and/or precursors.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in this award are designed to investigate the mechanisms of increased activity of the resident osteoclast population.  Cadmium, an agent that causes increased bone resorption, will be used to activate the osteoclasts.  One method to increase the amount of bone resorbed by a single osteoclast is to increase the time the osteoclast remains attached to the bone in its resorbing configuration, thereby increasing the time for bone resorption.  If this is the case, the extent of osteoclastic migratory activity should decrease proportionately.  Understanding the mechanisms for increased osteoclast resportive activity is essential for understanding the normal responses of bone to stresses on bone homeostasis.\r\n",
