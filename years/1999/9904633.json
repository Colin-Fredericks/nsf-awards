Nonspiking neurons play an important role in neuronal integration and provide a distinct mechanism for information processing in the central nervous system.  These neurons transmit information using graded (or analog) changes in their membrane potential in contrast with the discrete action potentials that encode information in a digital manner in spiking neurons. Although nonspiking transmission has been investigated in various systems, the assessment of the functional advantages of nonspiking transmission has been hampered by the absence of an appropriate context for the evaluation of these systems. This project will determine the transfer functions of nonspiking and spiking proprioceptors in the first two joints of the crab leg and for the synapses and motor reflexes associated with these receptors. The basal leg joint in the crab is monitored by a single proprioceptor, the TCMRO, that contains two nonspiking and one spiking neuron. The position, velocity and acceleration of the next most distal joint is monitored by a single spiking receptor, the CB chordotonal organ, and two nonspiking elastic strand receptors.  One therefore has a system that permits a direct comparison of these two distinct modes of information transmission, although the physiological functions of the receptors are very similar as are the motor behaviors that they mediate. The experimental approach will employ standard electrophysiological techniques and linear and nonlinear (Wiener kernel) systems analysis methods in order to characterize the transfer function of these proprioceptors.  The Wiener approach utilizes Gaussian white noise as a test stimulus to the system under study and determines a series of filters or kernels that describe both the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the system. As the experimental preparation permits access to the reflex pathways mediated by these receptors, the systems analysis approach will be extended to investigate overall transfer properties of the synapses and motor reflexes in response to sensory input from nonspiking and spiking receptors.  An additional goal will be to determine the extent and fidelity of the information transmission in nonspiking and spiking afferents using information theoretic methods that have recently been applied to neuronal systems.  We will thus be able to make a direct comparison between, and contrast the functions of, nonspiking and spiking neurons and the motor reflexes mediated by these cells.\r\n\r\n",
