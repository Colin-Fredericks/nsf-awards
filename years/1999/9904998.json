 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IDM99 Workshop is supported by the interinstitutional grants IIS-9904998, Alfonso Cardenas, UCLA and IIS-9905026, Edward Fox, Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The workshop is held March 7-9, 1999 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The recent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, the explosion of publishing, and the vast increase in data availability from such sources as satellites, that have enabled the emergence of an unprecedented number of new computer applications, present a new challenge to the ways data and information are used and managed. This challenge will shape both the research agenda as well as the technology to be developed for the 21st century. The objective of the workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the National Science Foundation as representatives of two communities, that is, information management (often referred to as information retrieval) and data management (often referred to as database management), along with selected industry and government invitees, to: (1) cooperatively (a) identify the problems that are fundamental in making progress toward this new challenge; (b) specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; (c) identify needed collaborations (e.g., inter-disciplinary, academic-industry); and (d) identify research initiatives and facilities needed to meet this and future challenges; (2) share, provide demonstrations and interact with each other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by the IDM and explore fruitful collaboration and synergism; and (3) provide an opportunity to NSF, other funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and as well as to share their highlights and concerns. The workshop will generate proceedings, that include reports on all projects currently funded by IDM, which will be widely disseminated in both hard copy and electronic form on the Web. The project reports are searchable by different criteria and provide information relevant to NSF's GPRA Performance Plan Outcome Goals (e.g., connections between discoveries and their use in service to society). Further, the findings of the workshop will be presented in a report that will help in formulating future directions of research in information and data management and will suggest promising modalities of research in academia and industry with an aim to foster innovation as well as technology transfer. The workshop Web site (http://www.cs.ucla.edu/csd/IDM99) will also include links to other relevant material.",
