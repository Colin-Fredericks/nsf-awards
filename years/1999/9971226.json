 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an experimental condensed matter physics project to investigate the particles in complex fluid environments. Complex fluids include colloidal suspensions, emulsions, polymer solutions, membranes, and their mixtures. Their study is motivated by their relevance to cell biology, their use in a vast range of commercial products such as paints, pigments, motor oils, foods, cosmetics, photonics, lithography, ceramics and sensor technology. The experiments will (1) explore entropic forces in suspensions of vesicles and DNA, (2) probe force fields in a range of suspensions, (3) probe diffusion phenomena at the molecular length scale, and (4) develop methods to achieve self-assembling colloidal aggregates. The project offers excellent training opportunities for students in the use state-of-the art microscopy techniques to pursue fundamental studies in areas which also relate to a vast range of technologies.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is an experimental condensed matter physics project to investigate the particles in complex fluid environments, such as colloidal suspensions, emulsions, polymer solutions, membranes, and their mixtures. These materials arise in a range of contexts such as cell biology, paints, pigments, motor oils, foods, cosmetics, photonics, lithography, ceramics and sensor technology. The experiments will explore the forces experienced by the particles and the disorder of the suspensions. Another objective is to use this information to develop methods which will lead to controlled self-organization of the microscopic and molecular particles. The project offers excellent training opportunities for students in the use state-of-the art microscopy techniques to pursue fundamental studies in areas which also relate to a vast range of technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
