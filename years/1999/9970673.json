 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paragraph one:\r\n\r\nThis research proposal consists of two distinct research projects. One is on the N-body problem and the other is on the dynamics of non-\r\nuniformly hyperbolic attractors. In the first project we propose to complete our preliminary analysis on the Hill's region to get a detailed \r\ndescription of the integral manifold of the spatial 4-body problem. We further propose to study the topological structure of the integral manifold \r\n\"after regularization of binary collisions In the second project, we propose to study a  class of strongly dissipative non-uniformly hyperbolic \"\r\nattractors that can be regarded as a natural extension of the Axiom A solenoid.\r\nThis new class includes the Henon attractor and dissipative twist maps as special cases. Our program of study includes derivative growth of \r\n\"maps, global geometry of the attractor, symbolic dynamics, topological entropy and ergodic theory in the direction of SRB measure and \"\r\ncorrelation decay. \r\n\r\nParagraph two:\r\n\r\nThis research proposal consists of two distinct research projects. \r\nOne is on the\r\nN-body problem and the other is on the dynamics of a class of non-uniformly hyperbolic attractors. The N-body problem is a mathematical \r\nmodel that has been used in the long history of celestial mechanics to study the motion of  celestial bodies. It possesses ten conservation \r\nlaws which impose restrictions on the possible physical configurations formed by the celestial bodies involved and the possible orientations of \r\nthese configurations in three-dimensional physical space. Our first project is a study on these restrictions. This is a long standing \r\nmathematical problem with potential applications on the orbit design of artificial satellite. The aim of our second project is to understand the \r\ngeometric structure of the coherent part of a class of chaotic dynamical systems. This class of dynamical systems  are arisen from the study \r\nof turbulence and fluid mechanics. Chaotic phenomenon involved in these systems are not as well understood as that of the so call \"uniformly \r\nhyperbolic\" systems. We intend to provide a mathematical analysis that would help to better understand  chaotic phenomenon involved in \r\nthese mathematical models and their corresponding physical processes\r\n",
