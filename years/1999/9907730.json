The materials will consist of a demonstration videotape and supplementary materials for use by middle and high school teachers, career counselors, and university admissions departments.  The overall goal of this project is to draw more young people, particularly students of color, into careers in the sciences.  The videotape will feature interviews with UCAR's Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) students and mentors as well as footage from field experiments.  It will give students, beginning at the 6th grade level, an opportunity to hear from ethnically diverse, young adult role models who have gone through the process of making a commitment to the atmospheric sciences.  Supplementary materials, featuring activities developed with guidance from teachers within the teacher enhancement programs, Project LEARN (Laboratory Experience in Atmospheric Research at NCAR) and LEARN: Atmospheric Science Explorers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), will give middle and high school students an idea of what it is like to de scientific research, both through classroom activities and through gathering data in the field.  High Hopes will be distributed through several channels including the National Educational Telecommunications Association (NETA), an organization that, for many years, has been responsible for arranging U.S. distribution of classroom television programming.  High Hopes will also be distributed and tested through UCAR's consortia of universities and colleges totaling 83 institutions.  The ultimate goal of High Hopes is to help every student understand that, if they work hard and seek effective support, they too can pursue the opportunities of the students who are featured in the video program.  High Hopes will equip teachers to better help their students come to this realization.  It will play a role, so critical in this country as demographics evolve, in increasing the ethnic diversity of students committing to careers in the sciences.\r\n",
