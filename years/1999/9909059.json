This is an annual meeting hosted by a different Midwestern institution each year.  The conference is designed to be accessible to graduate students and a broad range of researchers by being inexpensive, and by having colloquium level talks and a poster session. The goals of this meeting include: bringing graduate students in contact with a dynamic scientific community, and bringing together experimental and theoretical researchers that are established in the same geographic region for intellectual exchange and to spark collaboration.  Topics of special emphasis this year are: semiconductor growth, disordered systems, mesoscopics, and neuro/bio-physics. \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to graduate student participation at the 47th Midwest Solid State and Midwest Solid State Theory Joint-Conference to be held 15-17 October 1999 at Ohio University.
