 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979292\r\nSchutt-Aine, Jose\r\n\r\nRadio frequency integrated circuits will strongly influence the versatility and portability of fu-ture wireless communication systems. With the ever increasing demands for higher bandwidth and capacity and for reductions in size, weight and cost, the need for more robust and efficient RF cir-cuits is expected to increase. In spite of recent advances in wireless circuit technology, several bar-riers still remain to be overcome before the next generation Low-cost portable systems can be im-plemented. These barriers require in-depth investigations in areas of design, modeling, simulation, processing, fabrication and testing. In this collaborative effort, we propose to integrate resources in these areas in order to implement a state-of-the art scheme for the design of future wireless RFICs. This effort will take advantage of recent developments in the processing of micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) devices as well as other technologies in microwave circuit design and process-ing. This integration combined with robust design guidelines and a low-cost packaging scheme will represent a substantial step towards the next generation communication system.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This proposal is a joint effort between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champalgn and the Georgia Institute of Technology and is being submitted by both institu-tions.\r\n***\r\n",
