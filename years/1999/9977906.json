 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States of America will host the 42nd International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the year 2001 in Washington DC.  The IMO is the premier international mathematics competition for high school students and it will bring to the USA more than 500 of the most talented high school age mathematicians from more than 80 countries.  The American mathematics community will use this opportunity to promote the importance of mathematics for all students and to celebrate the accomplishments of our best and brightest students.\r\nFor the American mathematics community, the IMO provides an opportunity to promote the importance of a strong mathematics education for all students--much like the Olympics are used to promote physical fitness for all--and to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our nation's young men and women in mathematics.\r\nFunding from the National Science Foundation will support the office and staff that will plan and manage the event to provide a part of the participant support.  This funding comes from the Infrastructure Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).  Staff will work with volunteers and the Board of directors of IMO 2001 USA Inc to coordinate the outreach activities, solicit corporate sponsors and promote research efforts.\r\nThe goal of this project is to organize and put on the IMO in the USA, to use this opportunity to promote excellence in mathematics among all students, and to study the characteristics of an international sample of exceptional mathematics students and attempt to understand how to identify and nurture such students, no matter the seting in which they may appear.",
