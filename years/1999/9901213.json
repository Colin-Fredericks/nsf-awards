 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore how the local environment of a photoreactive molecule affects its spectral properties and its observed photoreactivity.  A variety of substrates will be studied in environments that include adsorption on one of several solid materials, in supercritical fluids, or as deposited on semiconductors and organic coatings.  Results from these studies will provide fundamental insight into the influence that structure has on long-range electronic coupling and in turn, how these interactions dictate the optical and physical properties of supramolecular arrays.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues to support the research of Professor Marye Ann Fox of North Carolina State University.  The research that Professor Fox is carrying out studies the effects that a molecule's environment has on its photochemistry, such as when individual molecules in a sensory device interact with light.   A thorough understanding of these effects is important in the context of nanotechnology and optical computers, in addition to providing significant new contributions to the underlying science involved.\r\n\r\n",
