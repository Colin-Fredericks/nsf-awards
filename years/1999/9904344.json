Prior grants to V. Markgraf; INSTAAR, established the first PEP I office in 1993. Project leadership has now been transferred to G. Seltzer, Syracuse University, and the requested funds will be used to continue the activities of the PEP I office over the next five years.\r\nIn March 1998 a meeting of PEP I was held in Merida, Venezuela, which ended the first five years of coordinated activity along this transect. The meeting preceded the open science meeting of PAGES, which was held in London, England, in May 1998. As an outcome of these two meetings, many areas of scientific focus warrant continued coordination and analysis during the next phase of PEP I activity. Based on these areas of emphasis, themes will be chosen for a series of annual workshops. The intent of the workshops will be to address the following questions: (1) what is the nature of the extant paleodata in the Americas and where are the critical gaps in these data, especially in the tropics and South America? (2) what is the current understanding of climatic teleconnections between the northern and southern hemispheres with regard to these overriding themes? and (3) other than a compendium of current projects and data, how can a synthesis of observations and interpretations be developed for these themes? These workshops will culminate in the next PEPI science meeting at which these syntheses on the proposed themes as well as other questions will be presented and published.\r\nThe role of the PEP I office in carrying out these objectives will be to help organizers obtain funding for these workshops by providing preliminary focus, ideas, and contacts. The project leader of PEPI will continue to act as the representative of the PEP I transect to meetings of PAGES and other related projects. Contact with the scientific community will be maintained through the PAGES and IGBP newsletters and through the World Wide Web. Finally, the PEP I office will organize the next science meeting of the transect.\r\n",
