 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wooley\r\n9974457\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the research involve the development of methods for the preparation of unique amphiphilic core-shell polymer materials of nanoscale dimensions (5-100 nm), characterization of their chemical, physical and micromechanical properties, and their modification for the advancement of nanotechnological devices.  Over the past five years, a synthetic approach has been optimized to generate stable nanospheres, which involves the preparation of amphiphilic di-block copolymers, followed by organization of the copolymers into micellar assemblies, and then stabilization of the self-assembled structures through covalently linking together the copolymer segments located in the periphery of the polymer micelles.  Efforts will next be devoted toward evaluation of the chemical control that can be exercised in modification of the surface, functionalization of the shell, probing of the interface properties, and periphery of the nanostructures, the development of nanocapsule-like membranes will result by removal of most or all of the core material.  Additionally, the synthesis of cylindrically shaped production of well-defined complex materials, which consist essentially of single macromolecular entities of nanoscale dimensions that possess specified features and domains.  In each case, the preparation of new materials will be closely coupled to characterization of their composition, structure, and physical properties, by a combination of spectroscopic techniques (infrared, solid-state NMR, fluorescence, UV-vis), transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy.\r\n\r\nThe nanostructured materials can be considered to be sub-microscopic particles that can act as containers for binding, transport, and release of pharmaceutically or agriculturally active agents, or for the entrapment of environmental pollutants.  They are also expected to be applicable in many areas that are currently employ larger latex particles, for example as coatings, lubricants, recording materials, etc., where they are expected to demonstrate superior performance, due to the smaller size and larger surface area-to-volume ratio.  Furthermore, the research is ideally suited to provide students with experiences and challenges in various aspects of chemistry, from polymer synthesis, to supramolecular chemistry, to materials science.\r\n",
