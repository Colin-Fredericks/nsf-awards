The research plan concentrates on increasing device efficiency by using materials design, chemical synthesis, and device characterization to improve understanding of charge injection and transport in heterojunction devices.  The specific aims are to improve electroluminescence efficiency:\r\n\r\n                   by improving electron injection\r\n\r\n                   by using new emissive polymers\r\n\r\n                   by designing new emissive co-polymers that ease electron injection and confine carriers to the                         emissive layer\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructional Innovations\r\n\r\nA primary aim of this project is to incorporate semiconducting polymers into the undergraduate curriculum.  Devices based on semiconducting polymers offer simple and relatively low cost means of exposing lower division students to semiconductor device fabrication, characterization and operation in preparation for upper division treatments of semiconductor physics, electronics, and opto-electronics.  The specific aims are to:\r\n\r\nInvolve students in projects that emphasize interdisciplinary research, engineering, and teamwork.\r\n\r\nDevelop a Chemistry course module to teach synthesis and characterization of semiconducting                          polymers.\r\n\r\nRevise the required Electronic Devices and Electronics Manufacturing courses to let students build                 and test polymer light-emitting diodes [LEDs] which are opto-electronic components that literally                 shed light on semiconductor device operation.\r\n\r\nRevamp the Solid State Electronics course to incorporate opto-electronic device theory and                 experiments based on polymer LEDs and photo-detectors.\r\n\r\nMentor Cal Poly students who choose to complete senior projects on topics related to semiconducting                polymer devices.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
