 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to further develop a revolutionary approach to nanostructure fabrication.  This Near-Field Scanning Optical Nanolithographic approach which has already been shown to be capable of writing 100nm width lines, utilizes a direct, optical write technology in conjunction with optical photoresists.  The direct optical writing is performed with a customized Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM) tool.  The major goal of the proposed work is to design and construct an NSOM lithography tool and demonstrate processes for flexible pattern generation on 4 inch wafers.  Phase I work will involve design of the NSOM lithography tool and photoresist process demonstrations using the proposer's novel inorganic hydrogenated amorphous silicon resist, as well as conventional polymer resists.  Fundamental studies of the oxidation of hydrogen passivated silicon will be performed.  Phase II will see the construction and demonstration of the NSOM lithography tool.\r\n       An NSOM lithography tool with sub-100nm resolution will be much cheaper than e-beam lithography systems, making nanolithography available to a much broader range of scientists and engineers within the research community, thereby accelerating the level of innovation in nanoscale IC technology\r\n",
