 "awd_abstract_narration": "An intelligent system needs to control the flow of information through judicious choice of its scarce resources.  In Biology and in Engineering, Motion and Shape Estimation is probably the most important subtask that the visual pathway needs to perform.  In this research, we concentrate on MOTION and study how an Artificial Turtle might visually attend to its prey or in engineering, how a robot might control its gaze and lock on to a moving target.  Our starting problem is the engineering problem of generating reasonable motion models that describe the optical flow on the retina, how the retinal flow is represented by neural signals and how these motion parameters can be estimated using robust filters operating on a sequence of noisy observed spikes.  Our second problem, is to study how the optical flow is internalized by the visual pathway.  This involves representation of an analog signal by the neural circuit, stable communication of the neural code, from retina to cortex and finally computation at each stage but predominantly at the cortex.  Our third problem is to view the cortex dynamically and study the feedback and feedforward interconnection of the various cells.  We introduce a new neurodynamical system with Automatic Gain Control and plan to compare our model with known experimental data.  We would like to know under what condition the cortex remains a stable dynamical system.  We also propose to study the frequency response of the cortical interconnection.  Our last problem is to study the motor control problem pertaining to the eye movement.  If the turtle has to stare at its prey, both the instantaneous position of  the prey and in input to the eye-movement control system are analog signals that have to be represented by neural codes.  Such a tracking problem with both the tracking signals and the control signals are represented neurally has never been studied.  Specifically, we would like to design a neural circuit that would generate the required control inputs to maintain a given eye position or to gaze at a given target.\r\nThis research is about Dynamics and Control with neural encoding, interneuron communication and computation with the eventual goal to perceive and act intelligently in a dynamic environment\r\n",
