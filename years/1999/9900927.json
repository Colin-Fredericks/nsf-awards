 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Research project will examine the roles that human, social and political capital play in promoting entrepreneurial activity and small business success in the Ukraine.  The 1990s has produced considerable economic upheaval in the Ukraine and in other parts of the former Soviet Union as newly independent nations attempt to create viable institutions that support market economies.  Researchers who study social stratification and policy analyst have debated the nature of the relationship between location in the stratification system produced by Soviet State Socialism and social stratification during market transition.  The primary goal of this research is examine the role that human, social and political capital plays in decisions to enter into private business ventures (the leading source of new jobs in transition economies) and the role these same factors play in fostering relative success in these ventures.\r\n\r\nThe projects seeks to improve on prior research on social stratification during market transition in major ways by: (1) systematically sampling registered and unregistered entrepreneurs to gauge the full range of entrepreneurial activity and its correlates, (2) systematically comparing the general population to entrepreneurs so that systematic differences between those who start private businesses and those that do not can be compared, and (3) developing more nuanced measures of human, social and political capital so that different types of personal capital and the timing of acquisition can be assessed.  The research has the potential to create an important foundation for future research on the development of private business ownership in the rapidly transforming economies of the Ukraine and other former state-socialist countries.\r\n\r\nData will be collected from subsamples of entrepreneurs (N=550) and the general population (N=550) in the city of Kharkov, Ukraine.  A survey will be conducted of these two to collect information on educational attainment, social network contacts, political positions and political network connections. Logistic regression analyses will be performed to examine differences between entrepreneurs and the general population and assess the probability of being an entrepreneur; and ordinary less squares regression used to estimate the contribution of human, social and political capital to entrepreneurial success.\r\n",
