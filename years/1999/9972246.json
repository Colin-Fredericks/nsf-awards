 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972246\r\nSafinya\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the properties of biomolecular materials consisting of biological polymers (e.g. DNA; components of the cell cytoskeleton which consists of the filamental proteins: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and filamental-actin) condensed with oppositely charged chemical species such as multivalent counter-ions.  These materials are useful models for statistical theories of polyelectrolytes. For example, the studies should shed light on the nature of the molecular forces in the condensation of DNA in vivo (i.e. the DNA packing problem). The project provides excellent training for graduate students within a diverse, interdisciplinary program enabling them to acquire skills that are currently in great demand in Industry, National Laboratories, and Universities. Advanced miniaturized materials will be produced from biological molecules self-assembled on patterned surfaces. The biological-semiconductor hybrid materials should be utilized in the next century in pharmaceutical, biomedical, and semiconductor industries emphasizing miniaturized materials (e.g. nano-conduits and nano-wires).\r\n%%%\r\nThis project offers excellent research and education opportunities for graduate students within a diverse, interdisciplinary program, focused on biomolecular materials, in particulal biological materials that self-assembled on patterned surfaces. Potential uses of these processed materials include chemical and biological sensors, micro-machine elements, and molecular sieves. The graduate students will acquire skills that are currently in great demand in a broad range of industries including those which combine nanometer scale fabrication systems with biomolecular materials in chemicals, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, and semiconductors.  They will be trained in state-of the-art techniques which include, methods for preparing biomolecular self-assemblies, fabrication of micron and nanometer scale patterns on semiconducting surfaces, direct imaging with Atomic Force Microscopes and optical light microscopes, and structural measurements using quantitative x-ray diffraction methods at the National Synchrotron Facilities at Stanford and Argonne National Laboratories.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
