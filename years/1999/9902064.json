The mycorrhizal fungi community is an often-overlooked factor which may influence forest regeneration rates and plant species composition in regenerating landscapes. This dissertation research will use a combination of field studies, greenhouse experiments and molecular analyses to examine differences in mycorrhizal fungi community composition between tropical forest fragments and pastures, and whether these differences have consequences for seedling establishment in pastures by a tropical forest tree. Principal objectives of the research are to determine (1) whether species composition of mycorrhizal fungi differs between forest fragments and adjacent pastures, (2) whether species composition of mycorrhizae differs between forest- and pasture-grown seedlings of a tropical forest tree, and (3) whether mycorrhizal fungi of forest and pasture differ in their growth benefit to seedling hosts. Results of the proposed research have implications for pasture recolonization by forest tree species, forest regeneration and maintenance of plant and fungal diversity in human-impacted tropical ecosystems.\r\n",
