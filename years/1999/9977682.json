The spectrometer will operate at the highest available resonance frequencies and will perform the full range of high-resolution solid-state NMR experiments needed for the resolution, assignment and measurement of spectroscopic parameters of individual resonances from uniformly labeled protein samples.  The structures of membrane proteins, in particular, are vastly under-represented among known structures in the Protein Data Bank because of the technical difficulties they present for conventional x-ray crystallographic and solution NMR methods.  These proteins do not crystallize and reorient too slowly in solution.  The ability of NMR to determine protein structure, characterize dynamics and describe chemical properties and interactions depends on the capabilities of the electronic components and, especially, the strength of the applied magnetic field.  The advantages of using the strongest available magnet are disproportionately large because of the associated synergistic improvements in sensitivity, resolution and control.\r\n\r\nThe group plans to purchase the highest field magnet available, and to develop the associated instrumentation, especially the probes, for a research spectrometer optimized for protein structure determination by solid state NMR spectroscopy.  Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing and tuning high power double-and triple-resonance probes for frequencies in the range of 700 to 1100 MHz.  There will be substantial impact on future generations of spectroscopists because much of the development and experimental work will be performed by graduate students and postdoctoral research associates at the Resource for Solid-State NMR of Proteins at the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n",
