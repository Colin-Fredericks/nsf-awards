 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815925\r\nMoore\r\nThis project has two goals. The first is to explore the relationships among productivity, diversity and trophic structure in a low production detritus-based cave community. The second is to provide rich educational and research experience for undergraduate students. Communities are shaped by the level of productivity and by the regulation afforded by consumers. An extensive survey of the sediments in Wind Cave and Jewel Cave, South Dakota, revealed patterns in species diversity and trophic structure that could be explained by the rate of input of organic matter, the diversity of organic inputs, and/or the colonization rates and potentials of consumers. Sediments close to the cave entrance possess a diverse assemblage of microbes and invertebrates. Further into the caves, inputs are restricted to artificial light, lint and water droplets. Beyond the tour route in these caves, inputs are reduced to windblown dust and water drops. Hence, there is a steep gradient of input rate that is coincident with declines in the diversity of inputs, species diversity and trophic complexity. To meet the first of the project goals, types and rates of organic input into different regions of the cave will be manipulated and the diversity and trophic structure of the communities will be followed. Colonization abilities and natural histories of the organisms will be determined. Particular attention will be given to both taxonomic and functional diversity of microbes. From a pedagogical perspective, caves are exotic and ideal of working with undergraduates. There is an allure about caves that makes them model classrooms to teach and study basic ecological principles. Students will be integrated into all aspects of the research, including setting up manipulative experiments, data collection, design and implementation of laboratory experiments, modeling, data analysis and publication. Overall, the cave ecosystem is represents the best type of system in which to investigate how energy inputs may affect diversity and trophic structure in communities. While there is a wealth of descriptive natural history on cave communities, few studies have focused on community structure and dynamics in these low productivity systems.\r\n",
