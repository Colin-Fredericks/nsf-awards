 "awd_abstract_narration": "In carrying out this project the Principal Investigator will complete the research for a book that will specify the reasoning underlying the theory and method of functionalist anthropology. Formulated in Britain in the 1920s, the functionalist model influenced social scientists of all types throughout the world. Not least of the reasons for its importance was its popularity among American social scientists, whose global prestige rose dramatically after World War II, among whom functionalist theory patterned after the British model was the dominant paradigm until the 1960s. Functionalism's history has been poorly understood, however.\r\nFor functionalists, social anthropology was an autonomous enterprise, whereas their predecessors had coupled it to natural scientific inquiry. The investigator has previously shown that functionalists' account of the emergence of their scheme was revisionist history -- which historians of anthropology have mistakenly accepted. Functionalism derived from inquiries informed by natural science -- by both Darwinian biogeography and energetic physiology. Darwinian precepts suggested that the Australian region was a strategic site for anthropological investigations -- the most important of these being studies of the Torres Straits Islanders and the Aborigines of central Australia conducted at the instigation of A. C. Haddon and Baldwin Spencer (both trained biologists) respectively -- the conclusions of which, paradoxically, led anthropologists to argue that biological variations within the human species were unrelated to behavioral variations. Energetic physiology informed the field research method defined by W. H. R. Rivers, the most distinguished scientist who participated in Haddon's Torres Straits Expedition, whose methodological guidelines gained wide acceptance at the same time as his model of the anthropologist as an embodied instrument (a variant of the scheme that linked ontogeny to phylogeny) was disregarded.\r\nFrom individual and institutional archival collections, the investigator will reconstruct the social and intellectual networks that linked social anthropologists and other naturalists from the middle of the nineteenth century through the first decades of the twentieth. Her new book should reach an audience that includes both anthropologists and historians, as has her previous work. They will likely find this project interesting because it describes one resolution of the classic debate over the relative importance of nature and nurture in the determination of human behavior, a debate which has recently grown as intense as it was a century ago -- and which for anthropologists in particular is freighted with prescriptive implications for research.\r\n",
