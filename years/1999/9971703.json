One important \r\nexample is the propagation of pulses, and pulse trains, in optical fibers. \r\nOther examples are fronts and spiral waves that arise, for instance, in \r\nautocatalytic reactions or during cardiac arrhythmias. This project is \r\nconcerned with investigating such patterns and their interactions using \r\nanalytical techniques. Specifically, the existence and stability of multi-\r\nbump pulses in partial differential equations with phase symmetries such \r\nas the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is addressed. Another issue is \r\nto understand the interaction between small Turing patterns and large \r\nfronts or pulses that may lead to modulated time-periodic waves. While \r\nthe interaction between pulses is amenable to a finite-dimensional (though \r\nnot standard) perturbation analysis, it seems difficult to explain the \r\ninteraction between Turing patterns and fronts by a reduction to a finite set \r\nof equations since this interaction involves the continuous spectrum. \r\nAnother problem where the continuous spectrum becomes important is the \r\ninteraction between a planar spiral wave and the boundary of a domain. It \r\nis planned to explore this interaction in more detail in order to facilitate \r\nthe comparison of theoretical predictions for planar spiral waves with \r\nexperiments and numerical simulations that are carried out on bounded \r\ndomains.\r\n\r\nUsing optical fibers for the transmission of information bits over long \r\ndistances has become an important issue in telecommunications. An \r\noptical pulse that is sent through an optical fiber encodes a single bit of \r\ninformation. If the fiber were capable of supporting multi-bump pulses in \r\na stable fashion, these could be used to encode multiple bits of \r\ninformation. It is part of this project to study the propagation and \r\ninteraction of pulses in certain nonlinear optical fibers taking loss along \r\nthe fiber and amplification into account.\r\n",
