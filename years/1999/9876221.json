These advances have also brought a new class of exciting issues into the dynamics and processing of these materials, because engineering has to be done from the molecular, to the macroscopic level.  The ultimate goal of the CAREER research plan is to create advanced materials and novel processing methods for polymers, through nano-scale understanding.  To achieve this, novel combinations of experimental methods are being developed by taking advantage of the latest developments in rheology, polarimetry and FTIR spectroscopy.  In the research plan, three specific objectives are identified:  (1) obtain a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and rheology of model miscible polystyrene-poly(vinyl methyl ether)(PS/PVME) blends; (2) determine the molecular origin of substrate birefringence in magneto-optical materials; (3) investigate the rheology and elastic behavior in metallocene-catalyzed syndiotactic polypropylenes.  In blends, using the dichroism spectra, the individual component contribution to stress (  ) will be measured.  The temperature dependence of     will provide insights into the hypotheses of whether components of a miscible blend exhibit 'blend-averaged' response, or maintain their individual identity.  In polycarbonate based magneto-optical materials, component contributions to flow-induced birefringence, and the subsequent relaxation are probed to identify the molecular origins of birefringence.  In semi-crystalline syndiotactic polypropylenes, the role of tacticity on the unique mechanical and rheological properties is investigated.  These materials exhibit unique elastic behavior in stretched films.  A study of this phenomenon will clarify whether this is due to crystal-crystal transformation, or physical crosslinking induced by residual entanglements.  This work has implications to the processing, and properties of metallocene-catalyzed polyolefin elastomers, in general.\r\n%%%\r\nIn the CAREER education plan, a synergy between classroom, industrial exposure, and state-of-the-art research is proposed, to prepare chemical engineering students to apply basic knowledge in open-ended, real-life problems.  To achieve this, three specific educational activities are proposed,  which take advantage of Wayne State's proximity to a thriving industrial belt:  (1) develop an integrated unit operations course, which involves con-current, tailored, industrials visits, followed by case studies; (2) develop a 'capstone-type' course in polymer science named, 'case studies in polymer science'; (3) provide sustained, productive research experience in nanostructured polymers to undergraduates, by developing research teams with faculty, graduate students, and the undergraduate students.  Plans (1) and (2) are already receiving enthusiastic support from industrial collaborators.  A key element for Plan (3) is that students will be recruited into the research group at the sophomore level, and will be part of multi-disciplinary research teams, composed of faculty-graduate students-undergraduate students.  Research exposure is a powerful way to introduce, and encourage the non-traditional undergraduate students at Wayne State to careers in research.\r\n***  \r\n     \r\n",
