The gypsy moth is a classic example of an irruptive forest pest, and is a major economic problem in the eastern US where it periodically defoliates millions of hectares of deciduous forest. Factors that contribute to this kind of population dynamic remain unknown, and comprise a central focus of both population biology and pest control efforts. Previous work has identified the ability of the gypsy moth to induce changes in tree leaf chemistry, and the inhibitory impact of those changes on a virus that can influence gypsy moth population growth, as likely important mechanisms determining gypsy moth population cycles. In this LTREB project, two long-term hypotheses will be tested: (1) Gypsy moth-induced changes in oak leaf chemistry during incipient outbreak increases caterpillar resistance to a baculovirus, promoting gypsy moth population growth, and (2) gypsy moth defoliation has direct and indirect impacts on a range of coexisting herbivores in its community. Results thus far indicate that gypsy moth numbers are increasing as expected for an impending outbreak, and that defoliation and leaf chemistry are changing in concert. Experimental studies linked to the core long-term monitoring suggest some of the mechanisms involved in tree changes and link these to moth population dynamics. This study will provide valuable understanding of the dynamics of gypsy moth, and how the host plant and associated herbivores respond to periodic outbreaks of an economically important pest species.\r\n",
