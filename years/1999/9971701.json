Their analysis is much complicated by correlations among components, censoring, and time-dependent covariates.  This project initiates some new approaches in the semiparametric regression analysis of multivariate failure time data.  Various univariate semiparametric regression models are considered for the components of multivariate failure time data.  They include some familiar models, such as the Cox model, as well as some new models.   Inference procedures are proposed from diverse considerations, ranging from  pseudo likelihood to martingale residuals and estimating functions.  The new procedures are applicable to the currently two main modeling approaches: the marginal and the frailty approaches.  The proposed methods much enhance and extend the existing results by considering various semiparametric marginal models, by proposing several classes of general inference procedures, and by eliminating the computational burden that is almost always associated with the existing frailty methods. A key ingredient in the new approaches is the use of some weighted empirical functions.\r\n\r\nApplications of multivariate failure time data analysis may be found in industrial life testing, clinical trials and genetic epidemiology, among others. A machine component may break down repeatedly; a patient may experience failures of several organs; phenotypic traits may be collected on human pedigrees that consist of blood relatives and their spouses.  Often, data of interest are not observed completely due to the time frame of the study design or loss of follow-up; also, risk factors, such as treatment indicators, may vary over time.  Adding to the complication are the correlations among observations taken from the same patient or within the same pedigree.  The new approaches deal with these challenges and propose various modeling and analysis tools to the study of multivariate failure time data.  The emphasis is on developing statistical procedures that are flexible, robust, simple to interpret and easy to implement, while maintaining good efficiency properties.\r\n",
