 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career research involves developing in situ techniques that can directly assess the liquefaction characteristics of near surface deposits, within 5 to 10 meters of the ground surface.  More accurate and reliable determinations of liquefaction potential will be possible with these techniques and the state of knowledge regarding liquefaction will be advanced through various site investigations.\r\n\r\nThe research to be undertaken entails developing a liquefaction evaluation test that dynamically loads the soil in situ while measuring the induced strains and excess pore water pressures.  This testing technique will provide significantly more information regarding the liquefaction potential and pore pressure generation characteristics of a soil deposit than in currently possible with available empirically based liquefaction evaluation techniques.  Pore water pressure generation, migration, and dissipation during and after the induced shaking will be studied with embedded pore pressure transducers.  Data from pore pressure transducers in the field, along with numerical modeling of the pore pressure generation phenomena, will provide validation of various pore pressure generation models.  This is situ testing technique will allow the liquefaction characteristics and liquefaction potential of soil deposits to be assessed more accurately, the pore pressure generation characteristics of soil deposits to be evaluated in situ, and the state of knowledge regarding liquefaction to be advanced.\r\n\r\nAs an integral part of this project, engineering students will be prepared for both technical and non-technical issues through the use of engineering cases in class-rooms.  An engineering case is a written account of a real engineering project.  Reading and discussing relevant cases in both undergraduate and graduate level engineering courses can better prepare students for engineering careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
