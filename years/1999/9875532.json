Monte Carlo methods will be investigated for adapting these models for clinical dosimetry studies.  The project will use CT/MR/photography images from the Visible Human Project to construct new tomographic models that are much more anatomically accurate than the existing simplified models. Fundamental studies will focus on five areas: 1) developing methods for adapting CT/MRI/photographic voxel data to construct body models; 2) segmentation and processing of extremely large tomographic data sets; 3) integration of the 3-D and anatomically accurate models into state-of-the-art Monte Carlo computer codes; 4) simulation of clinical modalities in radiology, radiotherapy, and nuclear medicine; and 5) developing techniques for determining organ doses and effective doses to patients.\r\n\r\nThis innovative project defines a new and exciting area of research that involves interdisciplinary efforts in both radiological engineering and biomedical engineering.  Essential developments will provide, for the first time, the extremely fine (0.3 mm3 voxels) computational adult male and female whole-body models needed to make significant advances toward accurate 3-D Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport and interaction in the human body under realistic clinical conditions.  Results from a preliminary study at Rensselaer have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach and identified key issues to be further addressed.  This project is an ambitious undertaking, but Rensselaer's experience and recent progress by the scientific community in the proposed areas of investigation argue cogently that these goals are indeed achievable.  This project will advance the state of the art in tomographic data processing, radiation dosimetry, and Monte Carlo simulation.  It will eventually revolutionize the way clinical radiation dosimetry is performed by opening doors for patient-specific organ dose calculations, thus significantly improving the quality of clinical diagnosis and treatment involving radiation.  The successful execution of this project will also help establish a leadership role for the U.S. in this important research field.\r\n\r\nThe education plan focuses on four innovative activities, which are integrated into the research plan: 1) establishing a strong undergraduate research program in radiological and biomedical engineering, 2) adopting computers for interactive learning, 3) developing a new course/book in the proposed area, and 4) forming a university consortium.  These activities will enhance existing educational efforts, which are also addressed.\r\n\r\n",
