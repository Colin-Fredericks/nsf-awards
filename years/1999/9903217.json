Their tectonic behavior under normal and shear loading has fundamental importance in seismology and tectonic studies.  The PI proposes a theoretical analysis of slip between two rough surfaces that are loaded by normal and shear tractions.  The two bodies are treated as elastic half -spaces, and the contact is nominally planar.  The topography of the surfaces is Gaussian, simulating the statistical properties of samples from the laboratory and the field.  As shear stress is increased, slip against Coulomb friction occurs at lightly loaded asperities, gradually spreading to contacts under higher normal stress.   The PI has developed theory that describes the process mathematically and has applied it to the case where the contacts are widely spaced. These preliminary results show good agreement with published experimental data.  This work will extend the theory to fualts where normal stress is high enough to cause complete contact. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
