 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have dedicated a new GIS Laboratory and developed an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) course at New Jersey City University by adapting concepts, data, materials, and equipment from New Mexico State, San Antonio Community College, UC Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego; software manufacturers including ESRI;  agencies such as the USGS, New Jersey State and Jersey City; and from industry.  This has allowed us to successfully train and provide \"hands-on\" lab experiences for our students in state-of-the-art GIS technology.  Mike DeMers of New Mexico State has provided lab exercises and data with environmental themes.  Jeff Wenger of the Jersey City Planning Department has provided an exercise that allows students to merge spreadsheet data developed outside GIS with that in GIS.  Ilya Zaslavsky of UC San Diego has introduced independent projects as a means of providing realistic problems associated with GIS data collection, formatting and analysis. We have adapted and implemented existing equipment resources by utilizing Windows NT-equipped with Dell Optiplex GX1 computers as instructional platforms in the Electronic Learning Lab (ELL).  Our laboratory and course provides immediate training and \"hands-on\" lab experience for our students in state-of-the-art GIS technology.  This experience provides our students with marketable skills that are leading to professional technical employment in a variety of disciplines and increasing their opportunities in graduate school.  We have taken the lead role in developing the pedagogy and are working with several other departments in creating an interdisciplinary course that has received broadbased support.  We are also in contact with institutions in the greater New York City metropolitan area in collaboration to increase our learning strategies and outcomes.",
