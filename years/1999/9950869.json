 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional instruction methods in engineering do not address all types of learners. This is particularly true for the thermodynamics curriculum, which is poorly suited to visual and active learning types. The goal of this proof-of-concept project is to develop an educational software material, which combines computer simulation and visualization to improve learning effectiveness for students in thermodynamics. The proposed software will be modular and expandable over time. The programming structure will take advantage of graphical programming methods in the G language of LabVIEW. The user interface will be completely graphical as well. Indicators and controls will mimic real-life devices for ease of student use. The specific learning objectives are: 1) improvement in instruction for different learning types, 2) an increase in the amount of course content which can be covered in a semester, and 3) facilitation of student exploration/design. Material, which simulates a basic thermodynamic power cycle, will be created to evaluate the concept. Trial implementation in an Engineering Thermodynamics classroom will be performed to allow evaluation of the project concept and outcomes in meeting objectives. The evaluation will emphasize the effectiveness of the material for different types of learners, including, relevance to underrepresented groups. Program documentation will be produced, as well as curriculum development plans for thermodynamics courses in Mechanical, Nuclear, and Chemical Engineering. Results will be disseminated primarily through electronic means and technical publication.",
