 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project delivers undergraduate instruction in the area of digital signal processing (DSP) with applications to digital filtering, control, communication, and power systems. It is intended to bring the rapidly advancing DSP technologies into the signals and systems course, control systems course, communication systems course, and the senior design projects course, currently being taught at Alfred University without laboratory experiments using the latest DSP technologies. Based on industry expectations, students need a better understanding of the fundamental principles of signals and systems, control systems, and communication systems, and the new DSP technologies. The requested funding supports the purchase of software and hardware development tool and three spectrum analyzers. This purchase complements equipment on hand including six TMS320C31 DSK Starter Kits, one set of the TMS320C30 software and hardware development tools, six Pentium 300 PCs, five speed/position control systems, one communication workstation, MATLAB, oscilloscopes, and function generators. All equipment supports the students in various experiments including IIR (infinite impulse response) and FIR (finite-duration impulse response) filters, FFT, MATLAB interface, digital controllers, echo cancelers and adaptive filters, a serial voice communication link, and senior design projects. In addition, the laboratory is to be used for demonstrations for visiting high school students on the annual Open House in Spring, Summer Institute in July, and Engineering and Science Day in October, at Alfred University.\r\n",
