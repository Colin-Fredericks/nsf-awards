 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program involves a collaborative effort between Rutgers University and their industrial partner Saint Gobain Industrial Ceramics (Norton Advanced Ceramics Co.) to study dimensional control of silicon nitride in manufacturing parts such as roller bearings and valves.  Even a small amount of warpage from the sintering process may prevent the part from being economically manufactured due to the added cost of grinding with the finishing diamond wheels.  A major cause of warpage can be attributed to temperature gradients in the sintering furnace.  Finite element  (FE) techniques will model the sintering process to determine the strain tensor of distortion during sintering in a temperature gradient.  The fundamental knowledge gained in such a study would provide better control of furnace heating rates, hold temperatures, pressurizing rates, fixturing and placement of parts during manufacturing.  All the input parameters for the FE technique will be measured but much of the research will focus on measuring the sintering stresses necessary for the FE analysis.\r\n \r\nSintering stresses  and creep rates in silicon nitride will be measured in experimental studies conducted between 1500C and 1950C.  Knowledge regarding the sintering stresses in liquid phase sintering systems and the effect of the a to b phase transformation on sintering stress will be enhanced by these studies of silicon nitride.  As a model material the sintering stress of alumina/anorthite glass will also be measured to better understand parameters affecting sintering stresses in liquid phase sintered systems. The successful completion of this project may lead to significant cost savings for other industrial high-performance ceramic components.\r\n\r\n",
