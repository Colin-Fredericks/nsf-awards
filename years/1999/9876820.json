 "awd_abstract_narration": "A \"collisionless\" plasma is a fully ionized gas in which\r\nelectromagnetic forces dominate collisional effects.  The motion of a\r\nhigh temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by\r\nthe Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of partial\r\ndifferential equations.  The major question to be addressed is this:\r\nare there shocks in a collisionless plasma?  That is, could a\r\nsingularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time\r\nprogresses?  Additionally, \"induction heating\" will be studied.  In\r\nthis area one investigates how a conductive material is heated by\r\nusing electromagnetic waves.  Microwave heating is a particular\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\"Plasmas\" are often called the fourth state of matter (after solids,\r\nliquids and gases).  Plasmas account for a huge proportion of the\r\nmaterial in the universe.  Famous examples of plasmas include the\r\nsolar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae and comet tails.  The\r\nmotion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated equations\r\ndictated by physics.  The mathematician's goal is to show that these\r\nequations have solutions, at least under certain conditions.  This is\r\nthe main thrust of the proposal.  A completely different application\r\nto be studied is called \"induction heating.\"  Here one tries to\r\ndetermine how various materials can be heated by passing \r\nelectromagnetic waves through them.  The microwave heating of food \r\nis a particular example.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
