Gordon  \r\n\r\nAbstract: The focus of Professor Gordon's project is the study of Dehn filling on 3-manifolds, and in particular the program to obtain the optimal bounds on the distances between the various kinds of non-hyperbolic fillings on hyperbolic manifolds.  Many of these bounds are now known,   the only remaining cases being (1) reducible fillings on complements  of (hyperbolic) knots in the 3-sphere; (2) toroidal fillings on knots  in lens spaces; and (3) the case where one of the fillings is a small Seifert fiber space.  Professor Gordon will continue to investigate these questions, as well as other problems concerning Dehn fillings.  A special effort will be made to attack the Cabling Conjecture, which asserts that no fillings of type (1) above exist.   \r\n\r\nThe area of mathematics which forms the context of Professor Gordon's project is 3-dimensional topology, the general goal of which is to understand the structure of 3-manifolds. These are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional space, but whose global structure may be quite complicated.  Since we live in a 3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to describe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial universe.  This aim is still not realized, although there is tantalizing evidence that such a description might ultimately be possible.  One very interesting application of the mathematical theory of 3-dimensional manifolds is the \"circles in the sky\" project, in which, in two years' time, certain observations will be made from a satellite, on the basis of which an attempt will be made to mathematically determine the geometric structure of the universe.   An important aspect of 3-dimensional topology is the theory of knots - a knot being a closed loop embedded in some tangled fashion in 3-dimensional space - and one of the main ways in which knot theory relates to the general theory of 3-manifolds is through Dehn surgery, a process in which a solid tube around a knot is removed from space and sewn back in differently, giving a new 3-manifold.  Much effort has been devoted over the last few years to investigating this construction.  Although the impetus for this effort is the desire to further our understanding of 3-dimensional topology, it is interesting to note that a theorem about Dehn surgery, the Cyclic Surgery Theorem, has recently been used to determine the topological action of  certain enzymes on strands of DNA.  \r\n",
