One\r\nmain theme of these interactions is the dualities among the\r\ndifferent physics theories as well as their counterpart in\r\ngeometry. In the recent work of Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa and\r\nWarner, they had predicted a certain family of beautiful power\r\nseries encoding the numbers of singular irreducible holomorphic\r\ncurves on a rational elliptic surface. It is rather mysterious\r\nwhy the generating functions of the predicted answers constitute\r\nthe q expansions of certain modular forms.  The research project\r\nis aiming at studying the relationship between their formulas and\r\nthe geometric universal formula regarding the reducible\r\nholomorphic curves on the same rational elliptic surface.  To\r\nfully understand their deep relationship, one has to study the\r\nexcess contributions of the multiple coverings of certain\r\nholomorphic curves in the universal formula. The goal is to\r\nunderstand the inner structure of these enumeration datum as well\r\nas the geometric origin of the modularity behavior.\r\n\r\nThe super-string theory was originally developed to build up a\r\ntheory of everything, a fundamental theory which unifies the\r\nrules governing our natural world. Surprisingly, extensive study\r\nleads to some rather un-expected predictions in the ideal world\r\nof mathematics, particularly in geometry.  The last ten years\r\nhave been a blooming period that these magic ideas and\r\npredictions in modern physics change the way mathematicians\r\nthink. A lot of new structures have been discovered which we\r\nreally do not know too much about. Despite of the intensive\r\nactivities in this research area, it is still far away from\r\nhaving a complete picture toward the full understanding of the\r\nmechanism of duality.  The hypothetical string-string duality has\r\nled to numerous predictions which the mathematicians were never\r\naware of. The present research project attempts to confirm some\r\nmathematical predictions string theory has made, following the\r\nprevious research program of the author.  The confirmation of\r\nthese conjectures will give strong mathematical evidences to the\r\nconsistency of the original physics theory.\r\n",
