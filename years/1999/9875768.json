 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Christopher C. Landry at the University of Vermont is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The research deals with the synthesis, characterization and catalytic and chromatographic behavior of mixed phase microporous/mesoporous silicates and aluminosilicates. The mixed phases will be prepared by initial polymerization of a silicate source in the presence of an organic micellar template in aqueous solution and room temperature to form a weakly-organized mesoporous material. This material will be subsequently heated in the presence of a structure-directing agent, typically tetrapropyl ammonium cation, to form a microporous material.  Incomplete annealing will produce mixed mesoporous/microporous composites. Structure, as a function of reaction variables will be explored. XRD, NMR, IR, SEM, TEM and porosimetry will be employed to characterize the mixed phases. The materials will be evaluated as catalysts for olefin isomerization and as chromatographic supports.\r\n\r\nThe CAREER educational plan will focus on the inclusion of Materials Chemistry into both graduate and undergraduate curricula. Courses in Materials  Chemistry will be developed which will also utilize local faculty and industrial scientists as resources.  Classes and special lectures will be electronically disseminated through the University's Distance Learning Network, permitting both graduate students and industrial scientists at remote locations to earn credit towards advanced degrees. The program will include examples from Prof. Landry's research and other local industrial projects and is expected to stimulate industrial-academic research partnerships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
