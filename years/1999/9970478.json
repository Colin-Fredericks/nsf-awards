 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate several problems regarding the analysis and\r\nclassification of orthogonal polynomials to spectral-type differential\r\nequations. The most general of these problems is the so-called\r\nBKS(N,M) problem which seeks a classification of all ordinary differential\r\nequations of integer order N, up to a real linear change of variable, that\r\nhas a sequence of polynomial eigenfunctions which are orthogonal with\r\nrespect to a Sobolev bilinear form involving the M-th derivative of\r\nfunctions. When M=0, this problem is classical with key results due to\r\nBochner and H. L. Krall. Recent progress by Littlejohn, K. H. Kwon and D. W.\r\nLee has been made on second-order equations in the cases M=1 and M=2.\r\n\r\nThese problems in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and differential\r\nequations are classical and have been an outstanding challenge to\r\nmathematical analysis since 1929. Applications of these problems abound in\r\nmany areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, physics, and engineering.\r\nIndeed, the classical second-order equations having orthogonal polynomial\r\nsolutions are important in many areas of applied mathematics and physics,\r\nincluding quantum mechanics. Moreover, a complete solution to the BKS(N,M)\r\nproblem will require an indepth knowledge of distributions, difference\r\nequations, moment theory, Lie algebras, complex analysis, and operator\r\ntheory. The applications of the higher-order examples look very promising.\r\nIndeed, each of the examples that we find will have an impact on applied\r\nsampling and interpolation theory with applications to engineering (theory\r\nof communication and signal processing). Recent improvements in both theory\r\nand techniques, by mathematical colleagues throughout the world, lend hope\r\nthat these difficult problems will soon yield global solutions.\r\n",
