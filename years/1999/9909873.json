 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funding for the exploration of the unique research needs of biomedical manufacturing and the definition of an appropriate research mechanism for delivering those needs.  The biomedical industry is one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the world economy.  It includes highly sophisticated products, which are complex to manufacturing\r\nand have relatively short product lives.  This is particularly true of electronic products, with product lives similar to the computer industry.  Additionally, it will include many products, which are not currently\r\npossible to manufacture, such as a tissue engineered liver.  Two companies are currently marketing manufactured skin.  As part of this project, biomedical companies will be interviewed and included in an\r\nadvisory board to help define the biomedical manufacturing research needs along with representatives from government and academe.  The state of the art in manufacturing research relating to the biomedical industry will be defined.  Government regulatory requirements will be investigated and the impact of these requirements on biomedical manufacturing will be characterized.\r\n\r\nThe successful conclusion of this research will lead to improved biomedical manufacturing processes and improved efficiency in the transfer of biomedical prototype products and processes to full-scale production.  It will define the unique research requirements for biomedical manufacturing and transfer those requirements to academic and industrial research groups for implementation.  Further, this project will define the most appropriate research mechanism for performing biomedical manufacturing research, which will deliver the research results to industry.\r\n\r\n",
