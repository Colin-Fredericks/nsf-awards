 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909109\r\nWhitham\r\nConventional theory argues that ecotones gradually shift in elevation or latitude over thousands of years. Recent evidence, however, suggests that rapid shifts may be occurring in the Southwest due to climate changes brought about by drought. At low elevations, pinyon pines growing in poor soils on exposed southern slopes have suffered 40-100% mortality as a result of the 1996 drought. This SGER research has two major goals. First, because many of these trees are now being harvested in salvage operations, it is important to document the geographical patterns of mortality before the evidence is removed. Second, by studying the patters of mortality within individual sites, much can be learned about the factors that determine who lives and dies, improving our understanding of the community-level consequences of this mortality. This study will record an event that impacts vegetation patterns at large spatial scales. This is especially important in the arid Southwest where the predicted impacts of global climate changes are thought to be great. Furthermore, because pinyon pine is a dominant tree of the third largest vegetation type in North America, anything that affects this tree is likely to have ripple effects on the rest of the dependent community. Analyses will provide evidence of the dynamic nature of boundary populations, document short-term responses of long-lived species, and quantify rapid stand replacement of one dominant by another. Demonstrating such events has important implications for understanding of community and ecosystem responses to record droughts and climate change. The results of this project will be incorporated into an on-going LTREB research program in this area. \r\n",
