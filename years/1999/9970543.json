The main \r\nparts of the project are devoted to the study of the attractors for rational functions, rotation sets for maps of trees and graphs, entropy of the \r\n2-dimensional golden mean shift (using methods developed for studying one-dimensional systems), and nonautonomous discrete dynamical \r\nsystems, both low-dimensional and general.\r\nFor almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a mathematical \r\nmodel that can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of this system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be \r\nreduced to the study of a much simpler, low dimensional one. This project is devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of this type \r\nof systems from the mathematical point of view. The results that can be obtained are usually much stronger than in the general case.\r\n",
