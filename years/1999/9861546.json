 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861546\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore novel low-cost manufacturing technology for micro-fabrication of vacuum microelectronics components from self-organized alumina ceramic. The approach is based on self-assembled Inorganic precursor, that can be anisotropically etched due to its unique nanoscale morphology The proposed innovation allows the creation of high aspect ratio high resolution micro-components, and does not require expensive deep X-ray lithography for micro-machining. The devices of interest include vacuum integrated circuits, as well as high power and high efficiency vacuum micro-devices with high mechanical, temperature and radiation stability. The capabilities of the technology at the proof-of-concept stage will be evaluated during the Phase I based on the prototype vacuum triode. During Phase II NRC will optimize and scale-up the technology, and Phase III will be a focused on commercialization.\r\n     Ultrafast, radiation and temperature resistant micro-devices can potentially enable new level of performance and functionality of vacuum microelectronics. The application potential of the proposed technology is exceptional. Any application requiring high power electronic devices capable of functioning in the harsh conditions, such as space, satellite communications, radars, deep well drilling, control of nuclear reactors, and others, will benefit from this approach. Spin-off applications will include fast response low power low power sensors and actuators, flat panel displays, electrostatic thrusters, chemical processing micro-systems, and other micro-electro-mech\r\n",
