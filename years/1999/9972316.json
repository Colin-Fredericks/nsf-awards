 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is producing curricular materials for an advanced, interdisciplinary undergraduate course for students majoring in the life and quantitative sciences that surveys mathematical and computational approaches to molecular biology. These include applications of statistics, combinatorics, computational concepts, graph theory and basic topology to the sequence and structural analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. These materials include a working prototype of a textbook/lab manual for such a course. This text is being disseminated on the WEB, where the materials include Java based demonstrations and exercises, and is being prepared for commercial publication.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, the course and materials are being tested and refined, based on evaluations of their effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on the use of real-world data from publicly accessible molecular biology databases. Students are being introduced to the basic use of these databases and software for analyzing the data.\r\n\r\nThis project is providing a curriculum and educational materials that gives students of the life sciences proficiency in quantitative and computational skills and techniques that expands their capabilities for further scientific development and their access to emerging career opportunities that require a substantial quantitative and information science background. The project is also giving students of the quantitative sciences an opportunity to be exposed to an important area of applications. The nationwide implementation of curricula such as this one is helping to satisfy the growing need for quantitatively trained life scientists in industry that is resulting from the biotechnology revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
