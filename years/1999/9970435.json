 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns several topics in algebraic geometry:  (1) (with A. Buch) to find formulas for degeneracy loci arising from several vector bundle maps in terms of Chern classes of the bundles; this involves a combinatorial problem generalizing the notion of Littlewood-Richardson numbers; (2) to understand relations between such formulas and quantum cohomology; (3) (with J. Harris) to understand why Schubert calculus (orintersection theory) on a given Grassmannian is controlled by Schubert calculus on smaller Grassmannians, as it must be by recent work of Klyachko, Knutson, and Tao; (4) (with R. MacPherson) to investigate compactifications of spaces of curves along the lines that we have done for sets of points; (5) to study toric varieties, especially as related to quantum cohomology; (6) (with K. Behrend, D. Edidin, B. Fantechi, L. Goettsche, and A. Kresch) to write an accessible introduction to the theory of stacks.\r\n\r\nMy main interest is in algebraic geometry, and neighboring areas in representation theory, topology, and combinatorics.  Many of the fundamental spaces that arise in mathematics are very special algebraic varieties, most of whose properties can be described by some finite (combinatorial) data.  Important examples of these are Schubert varieties, related to loci where matrices have various ranks, and toric varieties, whose combinatorics involves convex polytopes and lattice points.  The mutual interplay between the geometry and the combinatorics is beneficial to both.  I am also interested in constructions of moduli spaces, which are spaces of geometric objects. Deciding how to include limiting objects, which amounts to compactifying these moduli spaces, is a central theme in algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
