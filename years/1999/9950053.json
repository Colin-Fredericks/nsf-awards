 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging technology of the biochip--a microchip that contains DNA--including both its production and its use as a diagnostic tool, presents a unique opportunity for advanced technology education programs.  The similarities in the production  process between the biochip and the microchip place the proposed biochip curriculum directly in parallel with curricular programs that already exist for microelectronics and electronics.  Currently, there are no known comprehensive curricular programs at the community college level to address the workforce development needs, competencies and skills for the biochip industry, although these gene chips are already in production at several companies and in limited use in the medical profession.  This pilot project brings together national academic and industrial experts in biotechnology, biochip technology and microchip technology to build the foundation for a biochip science and technology curriculum that interfaces with existing microelectronics, electronics, and engineering programs being offered at many community colleges.  J. Sargent Reynolds Community College (JSRCC), in close coordination with faculty from the School of Engineering at Virginia Commonwealth University, is leading the project.  In addition, JSRCC is developing and coordinating the project using science and technology faculty from the Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia community college systems.  Activities that support the development and dissemination of this unique biochip specialization are:  1) travel to biochip and microchip industries and biotechnology firms in Arizona, California, and Texas to meet experts involved in these industries and to invite them to join this project as part of a Curriculum Exploration and Development Team; 2) sponsorship of a Fall 1999 workshop entitled, \"Bioelectronics, Biosensors, and Biochips\" in Richmond, VA, for community college faculty from the three CC systems involved; and 3) hosting workshops to delineate competencies, skills and workforce development needs in the biochip industry and to produce biochip specialization courses.  This multidisciplinary program will provide the framework for a national curriculum model for other institutions interested in offering a curriculum that will prepare workers for careers in the biochip, microchip, and biotechnology fields.",
