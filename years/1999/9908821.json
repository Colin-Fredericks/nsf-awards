 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of Professor Theodore Madey of Rutgers Unievsrity, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry, supports travel and participation costs for graduate students and young faculty to attend the Eighth International Workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 8) to be sponsored by Rutgers University 27 September- 1 October 1999, and held at Long Branch, New Jersey.  Topics to be covered in the Workshop include basic mechanisms and theory, electroncally induced surface chemistry, semiconductor processing, ion-induced desorption, gas-phase processes such as core excitation and electron attachment, DIET processes in scanning probe microscopies, formation of negative ions at surfaces, laser-induced desorption, and desorption of particles from insulating and condensed layers.   \r\n\r\nAn international group of researchers is scheduled to attend this workshop on desorption induced by electronic transitions (DIET 8), with lecturers from France, Germany, Sweden, Japan and Canada, along with several prominent US researchers.  The DIET workshops are held every 2.5 years.  The last two meetings were 1997 (Ambleside, UK) and 1994 (Krakow, Poland).  This will be the first DIET workshop to be held in the US in the last 7.5 years, and therefore represents a unique opportunity for interaction of US graduate students and young faculty with their colleagues from around the world.   The process of desorption from surfaces is central to the areas of photochemistry and semiconductor processing.\r\n",
