 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one day meeting called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day will be held at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in Raleigh on Saturday, April 24, l999.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way.  This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the region's graduate students will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support.  The meeting will have three invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computer algebra.  The speakers will anchor the meeting and will help attract participants.  The invited talks and poster sessions contributed by the community are expected to cover the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.  The principle theme of the l999 meeting will be applications.\r\n",
