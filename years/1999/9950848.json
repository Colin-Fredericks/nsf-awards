 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving sociology education at Morehead State University through adaptation and implementation of exemplary materials, laboratory facilities, and educational practices.  Its design is to improve the basic and advanced science skills of undergraduate students through reforming 8 classes ranging from freshman to senior level.   All of these improvements are based on the implementation of what this department calls the Technology Enhanced Core Project (TECP).  \r\n\r\nThere are three major components to TECP: \r\n(1) Implement pedagogical strategies to strengthen students' analytic abilities.\r\nThe central pedagogical approach is implementation of the idea that students are best able to learn good scientific practice and reasoning through hands-on projects conducted under the mentorship of an experienced practitioner.  These projects are introduced at the beginning of a student's university career, through the use of computer facilities to perform simple workbook exercises, such as the instructional materials provided by MicroCase and the Social Science Data Analysis Network (SSDAN).  The basic features of inductive and deductive reasoning are introduced at this time.  \r\n\r\nStudents will learn advanced skills through student-initiated research, starting with the creation of a research design.  Students learn effective use of bivariate and multivariate inferential statistics, and how to produce clear and accurate written and oral reports of the results.  In some courses, students will use secondary data sources, obtained from SSDAN and MicroCase.  In other courses, students will design their own data collection procedures and will gather original data.  \r\n\r\nStudents who show the strongest motivation and skill at the advanced level may elect to take a special class that introduces SPSS Basic and the use of a large, complex data set, such as the National Longitudinal Education Study of 1988-94 (obtained from the National Center for Educational Statistics).  Because scientific research is so often a group endeavor, the development of teamwork skills will be enhanced throughout the curriculum by assigning projects to small groups of students whose work is supervised by the instructor.\r\n\r\n(2) Provide students with a state-of-the-art, interactive computer lab with the tools, software, data sets, and linkages to actively pursue scientific analyses.  \r\n(3) Enable students to do science by preparing and publishing reports on topics such as criminal justice and education.  Opportunities for students to become involved in the preparation and publication of scientific reports will be realized by student participation in funded projects being carried on by Morehead State's Institute for Regional Analysis and Public Policy, Institute for Correctional Research and Training, and R & D Center for Students, Schools, and Communities.  Students will have the opportunity to become co-authors with faculty of monographs and  publications on which they make important contributions.  Furthermore, the annual meeting of the Kentucky Association of Anthropologists and Sociologists provides an appropriate, supportive forum for students to present their own research results.  \r\n\r\nStudents are required to maintain individual portfolios of their accomplishments with which their progress through the curriculum is being assessed.  Regular analysis of the portfolios of each cohort of senior students is also providing a means to evaluate the project.  \r\n\r\nTECP is a national model for similar institutions and programs.  Results of the project are being disseminated via: (1) the World Wide Web, (2) workshops or panels delivered at a regional and national meetings, and (3) professional newsletters and refereed journals.  \r\n\r\n",
