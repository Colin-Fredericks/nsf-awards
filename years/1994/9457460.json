Three  specific projects are described below:    The rotation profile in the solar interior was mapped by  helioseismology several years ago, and yet our theoretical  understanding of the physical processes taking place in the sun is  very poor.  However, progress has been made on this problem (Kumar,  Narayan and Loeb), and the plan is to continue to work on this  problem.  The solution of this problem is not only important in the  context of understanding stars, but has considerably wider  application in astrophysics.    A detailed study of the tidal evolution of binary stars, which  includes the transfer of angular momentum and the tidal energy  dissipation in stars, is being carried out.  Particular emphasis  will be placed on astrophysical binary systems containing a neutron  star (pulsar) which allows very accurate determination of the  orbital parameters, including the periastron advance.  Two such  binary systems, because of their high eccentricity and small  periastron distance, are particularly interesting from the point of  view of detecting tidally forced oscillations in the companion main  sequence star. A number of pressure and gravity modes of  oscillations are expected to be tidally excited in these stars to  an observable amplitude. The detection of these oscillations will  enable us to determine both the mass and the age of the stars very  accurately.  This should provide an excellent opportunity for  studying the orbital evolution of the binary orbits.    The last project that will be pursued pertains to the study of the  large velocity dispersion of the material in molecular clouds.  There are several giant molecular clouds about 1 kiloparsec in  distance from the galactic center which are very peculiar in that  they show a large random internal velocity.  The velocity  dispersion of the clouds, obtained by observing the carbon m onoxide  (CO) emission, is found to be about four times their virial  velocity.  These observations are also supported by observations of  other molecular emissions as well as by the 21 cm neutral hydrogen  line emissions from the clouds.  Therefore, it is almost certain  that these clouds are not gravitationally bound.  A plausible model  for the large velocity dispersion is clumping and collisions of  clouds that are moving on non-circular orbits in a bar potential.   This theoretical model will be analyzed carefully to see whether it  explains the observations.  The observations of the clouds may  offer additional evidence for the presence of a bar in the central  region of our Galaxy.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  The award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
