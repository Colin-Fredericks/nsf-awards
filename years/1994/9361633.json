 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361633  Steffan  Bacteriophage particles will be developed using phage display  technology that specifically bind heavy metals (mercury and  chromium). Random phage libraries will be generated by cloning  degenerate nucleotides into genes encoding coat proteins of the  bacteriophage M13.  The resulting phage will have one of as many as  1013 random peptides exposed on their surface in up to 2700 copies.   The resulting phage particles will be screened to select those that  specifically bind heavy metals.  Selected phage particles will be  used to remove metals from a variety of wastewaters including those  generated by industrial processes, nuclear facilities, soil  washing, and improper storage or disposal of wastes.  %%%  It is expected that using phage binding to pre-treat mixed organic  (organics + metals) wastes to remove metals will allow for the  successful biotreatment of many of the nation's heretofore  untreatable waste sites.  The successful demonstration of this  technology will provide a precedent for the future developments to  remediate even more difficult wastes such as mixed low-level  radioactive wastes (organics + radionuclides).  Completion of this  research will allow the development of a commercially-viable  biological treatment system for hazardous wastes containing  mixtures of organic contaminants and heavy metals.  ***",
