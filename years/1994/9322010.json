They participate in ongoing research projects with the faculty members in the Computer Science Department (and closely related disciplines) at The University of Alabama. The program is ten weeks in duration, spanning the same time frame as the summer term at The University of Alabama.     Individuals from small, primarily undergraduate schools in the South are the major focus of this program. Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of female and minority students. The program actively recruits students from Colleges and Universities across the South. Students from institutions that lack a graduate program in Computer Science, as well as predominately minority institutions, are the major focus of the recruiting efforts. The program at the University of Alabama targets students who have completed three years of studies and have an interest in participating in current research efforts underway in the Department.   u    raduate Research Program brings together nine students from s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             C   E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            !         !         !         !
