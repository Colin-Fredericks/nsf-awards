 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407763  Kende  Deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a subsistence crop in large  areas of Southeast Asia and West Africa which are flooded during  the rainy season.  Survival of this rice depends on its capacity to  elongate rapidly when it becomes partially submerged and to keep  part of its foliage above the rising waters.  In previous work,  these investigators have reconstructed the chain of events that  leads from submergence to accelerated growth.  They have shown that  the initial signal for elongation is the reduced partial pressure  of oxygen in the submerged internode and that three plant hormones  -- ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellin -- participate in  regulating growth.  Reduced oxygen tensions promotes ethylene  synthesis; ethylene causes a reduction in the level of a growth  inhibitor, abscisic acid; gibberellin is the immediate growth-  promoting hormone; the rate of growth may be determined by the  balance of endogenous abscisic acid and gibberellin.  Internodal  elongation is based on increased production of new cells in the  intercalary meristem and on enhanced elongation of these newly  formed cells.  Experiments outlined in this proposal aim at  investigating further the mode of action of ethylene and  gibberellin and at studying biochemical and molecular reactions  that underlie enhanced cell elongation and increased cell division  activity.  This research may advance our understanding of plant  growth in general and may be important for the eventual transfer of  elongation capacity from low-yielding deepwater rice to high-  yielding rice cultivars.  ***",
