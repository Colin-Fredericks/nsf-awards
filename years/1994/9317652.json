Dr. Morse will test  this assumption by examining the role of experience in the  development of choice of hunting site (\"patch choice\") of  the crab spider, a sit-and-wait predator on flowers.  His  previous research has established the importance of success  in juvenile patch choice, because it affects the spider's  chances of becoming an adult.  Further, if one succeeds in  becoming an adult, earlier patch choice may affect the  chances of capturing enough prey to produce a clutch of  eggs, which will differ markedly in size and resultant  lifetime fitness with adult success.  Dr. Morse has  carefully worked out the relationship between adult foraging  success and lifetime fitness of the crab spider, making it a  uniquely suitable species for studying the role of juvenile  learning on adult fitness, a problem on which virtually no  information exists.  Dr. Morse will focus on two aspects of  the role of experience:  the effect of juvenile patch choice  on immediately subsequent choices, and the effect of such  juvenile experience on choices subsequently made as adults.  Experiments will be run both in field enclosures and in  laboratory settings, carefully controlling for prey type and  spatial and temporal distribution of prey.",
