 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320220  Maddy  The theory of sets functions as a framework for most contemporary  work in mathematics:  all mathematical entities are ultimately  modelled as sets and all mathematical theorems are ultimately  provable from the standard axioms of set theory (i.e. from the  system ZFC).  Unfortunately, the axioms of ZFC are probably not  strong enough to settle some questions that turn up in the various  branches of mathematics:  e.g., in algebra, in analysis, and in set  theory itself.    One reaction to this problem has been to embrace all relatively  consistent extensions of ZFC as equally admissible, and thus to  dismiss the independent questions as meaningless (they are true in  some models, false in others, and that is the end of the story).   For various good reasons, this solution is not acceptable to many  leading set theorists.  The alternative is to search for new axioms  to add to those of ZFC in hopes of answering the independent  questions.    The pressing philosophical question is how to make sense of this  evaluation of new axiom candidates.  If there is an objectively  existing world of sets, then such candidates should be accepted  insofar as they reflect the truth about that world.  Philosophers  have puzzled over the nature of that world and our cognitive access  to it.  These philosophical matters aside, this realistic position  has shortcomings from a purely mathematical point of view:  it  short-circuits various legitimate methodological questions inside  set theory itself.  In this project, Dr. Maddy aims to produce a  better understanding of the proper means of evaluating axiom  candidates with less attention to extra-mathematical philosophical  quandaries, and more attention to the texture of the mathematics  itself.     Her approach, which she calls `set theoretic naturalism', provides  a framework for the defense of various general methodological  principles for set theory, principles defended by their ability to  generate good mathematics rather than by some purported  ability to  generate truths about some extra-mathematically characterized  reality of sets.  With these principles in place, it is possible to  defend various additional axioms and hypotheses and to answer at  least some of the independent questions.  ***",
