 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is designed to follow up projects carried out under  NSF Grant DMS-90-03216 (Data Analysis, Modelling, and Inference)  and to intitiate and carry out research of the same types as  under the previous grant. These projects are of two basic types.  The first type seeks to develop new statistical techniques in the  context of several case studies, with the goal of integrating  tools of various sorts, including study design, data analysis,  modelling, and inference (mainly Bayesian inference). The  projects includeJ a study of estimating state level employment  and unemployment rates, modelling and inference concerning  dynamic patterns of hormone concentrations in blood plasma, a  study of hospital ICUs, and other social , environmental or  geophysical processes. The second basic type of study is  theoretical analysis of methodological issues, including  understanding and improving statistical methods in the face of  low frequency time series behavior, addressing the logic of model  selection, studying design and analysis issues under weighted  sampling, studying the justification and computation of belief  function inferences, and tracing the history of contentious  issues in 20th century statistics, mostly centering on  probabilistic inference.    Statistical studies are essential contributors to scientific  knowledge in virtually every branch of physical, biological, and  social sciences. The nature of these studies is changing rapidly,  in large part because computers have made possible the collection  and analysis of large quantities of information, and also have  revolutionized the study of the mathematical theories and laws  that govern statistical phenomena. Consequently, there is a  continuing and growing need to develop and assess the methods  that statistical scientists rely upon to make sense of data and  to package their findings for practical purposes, such as  assessing long term trends in global warming, aiding doctors to  make good decisions about medical treatments, or  providing  accurate and timely information about the economy for government  poicymakers. A basic strategy adopted in the project is that  technical tools should be developed in the framework of specific  scientific problems, and through collaborative efforts with  scientists actively working on such problems, in order to  guarantee the relevance of the procedures and models developed.  Also, since statistical methodology has features that are shared  in common across very different fields of science, it is  important to pursue a second strategy of addressing and improving  problems that arise in the same form in these different fields.  In statistics, these problems center around coping with  uncertainties about measurements or about the consequences of  decisions that might be taken on the basis of uncertain  knowledge. The project addresses such problems through techniques  that rely on the mathematical theory of probability. It is  important to refine and clarify the principles and techniques  that govern the selection and use of such mathematics.",
