The major activities during the conference are 15  invited one-hour presentations and free discussion sessions.       The main purpose of this conference is to offer an  opportunity for the mathematicians working in diffusion  theory and analysis and other related fields to communicate  and update their latest knowledge on the subject.       Diffusion theory as a part of probability theory  studies collective behaviors of a special class of random  systems.  These random systems are characterized by the  properties that they evolve continuously in time and  possessing so-called Markov property, which roughly means  that the future of a system is independent of its past  history and is completely determined by its present state.  The class of random systems have been studies extensively  both for its rich mathematical structure and its practical  applications in science and engineering.       Our conference emphasizes the mathematical aspect of  diffusion theory, especially its applications in analytical  fields such as differential geometry and differential  equations.  The speakers are carefully selected to reflect  the current state of the art of the field.  They are active  research mathematicians whose lectures will no doubt both  promote further research in the field and serve current  educational activities by attracting new graduate students  into our field.",
