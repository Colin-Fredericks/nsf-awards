 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will continue and expand a vigorous program  of research on questions related to binaries in dense stellar  environments and close binary systems.  The specific problems  exhibit a range of difficulty.  Some, like the influence of the  interstellar medium on the observability of supersoft sources, are  ones for which the relevant tools are rather easily available and  can be completed relatively quickly.  Others, like work on three-  and four- body processes in globular clusters, require a good deal  of study and work to lay proper foundations for the research  proposed here.  The work on mass stripping during tidal capture and  circularization falls into this category.  This is a broad research  program, to be carried out over a two year period.  There are  interconnections between many of the questions to be explored, and  previous work in all of these areas provides a strong lead-in for  several of the problems.    Interactive activities include teaching an astronomy course at the  advanced undergraduate level, and a graduate course on galactic  dynamics.  Other activities involve:  hosting a regional conference  to address local needs regarding encouraging young women in the  sciences (at the undergraduate level and above) to enthusiastically  pursue their interest in science, and the possibility of networking  and other strategies to enhance the effectiveness of existing local  resources; and working with the Center for Astrophysics Women's  Program Committee to design and participate in workshops for young  women scientists at the Center.",
