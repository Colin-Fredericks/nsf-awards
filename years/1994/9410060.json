 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410060  Allen  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects  Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student engineers to provide prototype \"custom designed\"  devices and software to aid persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at the  University of Delaware which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on these projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects. Forty  projects are planned during the five year duration of this award,  and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted  for an annual publication.  Once completed, each project will be  given to the person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that  this \"real world\" experience will give engineering students a  sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve the  community, attract new students into engineering, and raise  student interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their  undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a  population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.  ***",
