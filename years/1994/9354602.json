 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354602  Hurst  This project is a collaborative effort between Duke University and  the University of North Carolina.  An introductory geology  laboratory course is being developed which emphasizes a  multidisciplinary approach to solving geological problems using  state-of-the-art information technologies.  Laboratories are being  designed as case studies utilizing an electronic data bank  integrated with more traditional maps and hand samples.  Each case  study requires students to use tools such as satellite images,  topographic and geologic maps, cross-sections, three-dimensional  animations, and simplified geophysical and geochemical data to  unravel the geologic history of an area. Hypothesis formulation and  testing are being emphasized.  Not only are students learning  factual information in the context of real geologic problems, but  they also are seeing how geologists use physics, chemistry,  mathematics, and biology to study Earth. In addition, they are  becoming familiar and comfortable with the use of computers and  sophisticated data handling techniques in a user friendly  environment.  Laboratories and exercises are being designed by  investigators from both institutions.  Software programming is  being carried out at Duke.  Evaluation and assessment are primarily  utilizing the larger introductory classes at UNC.  Duke faculty and  students have created over twenty computerized  prototype \"field  trips\" over the last two years, and a pilot study of how the  technology employed in the field trips can be applied to teaching  introductory geology has been conducted.  Thus, the investigators  are able to use the programming expertise and classroom testing  experience already gained in developing this comprehensive  introductory laboratory course.  Dissemination is planned through  several channels including: 1) a full-day workshop at a GSA  national meeting; 2) the distribution of an announcement to all  geology departments in the country; 3) publication of the results  in the Journa l of Geological Education; and 4) commercial  publication of the products.",
