 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317629  DeVries  McMurdo Sound fishes are the most freeze resistant, and are  exposed to greatest extremes of ice and temperature of any fishes  in Antarctica. The project will focus on the extent of the ice  association and its fate within these polar fishes.  The deepest  depths of ice exposure will also be determined.  These results  will be compared to those obtained for fishes living in less icy,  warmer environments near the Antarctic Peninsula where the  influence of ice shelves is absent.  The fate of experimentally  introduced endogenous ice will be determine to find out whether  Antarctic fish possess mechanisms for disposing of accumulated  ice.  The relationship of structure to function of the  antifreezes will also be investigated by determining the three-  dimensional structures of some of the antifreeze peptides (AFPs)  and searching for lattice matches between their polar residues  and their ice adsorption plane.  Two-Dimensional Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance and molecular modeling techniques will be used.  With  the antifreeze glycopeptides (AFGPs), the importance of size for  adsorption to specific planes will be determined. These studies  will indicate what the important features are which give rise to  antifreeze function in structurally diverse molecules. The  investigation of the inhibition of ice growth by the various  antifreezes (AFs) will also be continued on how adsorption to  various ice planes leads to inhibition of ice growth. This  question remains thus far unanswered, which they hope to address  by examining the effects of the various AFs on the growth forms  of single ice crystals.  The organization and structure of the  antifreeze genes of Antarctic fish will also be investigated by  identifying and sequencing genes that code for the high molecular  weight AFGPs and comparing them to organization of the small  AFGPs.  The sizes of the AFGP polyprotein gene family will be  determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization.  Information on  the organization and struc ture will lead to an understanding of  the factors that lead to the necessarily high levels of AF needed  for survival in this extreme freezing Antarctic environment.  ***",
