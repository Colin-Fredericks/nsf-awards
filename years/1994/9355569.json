 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355569  Crow    Participating in a series of three-week institutes and eight  academic year follow-up meetings, a core of 45 leader science  teachers from middle schools in the Houston Independent School  District will gain new skills in instructional practices, student  assessment, test and measurement statistics, and important related  science content.  This core group will then serve as workshop  leaders and as a human resource for their peers in their schools  and district.  The goal of this three-year project is to produce  assessment literate, subject matter competent teachers who can  implement authentic assessment of science, use the best science  teaching practices and provide the classroom environment needed to  achieve the goals specified by current science reforms such as  Project 2061, Scope Sequence and Coordination and the emerging  national standards.    The project uses a three part model that directly links the desired  goals for students, the behavior of the teacher (including  assessment), and the role of the student necessary to achieve these  goals.  Intertwined with this model is the need for teachers to  understand the targeted science concepts and relevant statistical  test measurements.  The project includes a research component to  assess its effectiveness and its impact on student learning.",
