Reddy,  Department of Chemical and Metallurgical  Engineering at the University of Nevada at  Reno, and Dr. P. Krishna Rao, Department of  Metallurgical Engineering at the Indian  Institute of Technology (IIT) in Bombay.  The  topic relates to the factors controlling the  properties of intermetallic aluminides during  processing from the primary metals.  The  properties of superalloys depend to a large  extent on the segregation phenomena associated  with solidification. Electroslag refining (ESR)  is one method for controlling the parameters of  the melt and therefore the final product.  The  focus of this project is on investigating the  effect of ESR processing on the microstructure  and tensile properties of structure  intermetallics.  The scientists propose to: 1.  evaluate, collate, and generate the physico  chemical data for molten slags for ESR of  intermetallic aluminides; and 2. assess the  efficiency and reliability of various existing  mathematical models and where necessary develop  new models to predict the physico chemical  properties of fluxes.  The scientists at Reno  will work on data-base generation, and the  development of mathematical models, while  scientists at Bombay will process the various  intermetallic aluminides and study the  structural-property correlation.    Scope:  This project brings two complementary  capabilities, at the U. of Nevada, Reno, and at  the IIT, Bombay, to conduct a fundamental  chemical engineering study, with the objective  of understanding the relationship between the  slag conditions and properties of the resulting  alloys.  The work is likely to lead to  developing better models for these  relationships that can be used for design and  processing of various materials.  The  collaboration should be beneficial to the U.S.  and India and should advance scientific  knowledge in the area of metallurgy in general.   The project meets INT's objectives well.  * **",
