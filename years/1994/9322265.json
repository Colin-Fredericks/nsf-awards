 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bianconi  The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize the properties of  new inorganic polymer network materials and to create others of  specific designed properties by new synthetic techniques.  The  approach is to use a recently devised process for the  functionalization of polysilyne network polymers to introduce new  functional groups which enhance, modify, or create new electronic  and physical properties in the polymers.  Specifically, fluorinated  and alkoxide side chains will be explored as means of improving  these polymers' sensitivities as deep UV photoresists.  Grafted  polymer sidechains will also be studied as means of altering the  polymers' solubility properties and decreasing their absorptivities  at 193 nm, the target wavelength in microlithographic applications.  Attempt will be made to create new surface-imaging methods, and  new materials, by applying functionalization reaction sequence  to solid-state surfaces.  Finally, syntheses and properties will be  optimized for two new network backbone polymer systems, the  polystannynes and the polycarbynes.  The tin-based polymers will be  studied as soluble photolytic precursors to conductive and  transparent optical glasses, and the carbon-based polymers will be  studied as examples of previously-unknown carbon-based  macromolecules and as low temperature and pressure precursors to  diamond and hard carbon ceramics.   %%%  The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize the properties of  new inorganic polymer network materials and to create others of  specific designed properties by new synthetic techniques.  A  recently devised process will be used to introduce new functional  groups which enhance, modify, or create new electronic and physical  properties in the polymers.  The development of such new materials  would have substantial impact on the development of new fabrication  and processing procedures for electronic and photonic devices and  for the understanding of the fundamental chemistry and properties  of soluble  inorganic network.",
