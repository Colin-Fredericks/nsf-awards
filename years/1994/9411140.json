 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do animals adapt to changes in their environments?  Are  all healthy, normal appearing individuals or their offspring  equally able to survive?  Since finding and utilizing food  resources are important aspects of survival and the  occupation of new or altered habitats, this proposal aims at  the study of foraging and food use in a species with a  generalized diet that is known to exploit novel prey.  This  species is the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis,  which can feed on a variety of small animals.  This  investigator will follow babies from birth through the first  months of life in a study that will look at the effects of  genetic background, diet, and ontogeny on food choice,  foraging ability, and growth.  The initial responses to prey  involve chemical cues in newborn common garter snakes. There  is great variability among individuals, even from the same  litter.  Experience with different prey types can alter prey  recognition, prey preference, and prey capturing ability.  This project will investigate this individuality and  plasticity with snakes from different litters born to  mothers from the same natural area.  Since one advantage of  snakes is the large number of animals born to each mother,  snakes from each litter will be put in various groups raised  on controlled or free-choice diets.  Another advantage of  this species is that different babies born to a given female  may have different fathers.  Thus identifying which snakes  in a litter have the same or different fathers can help  separate genetic factors from prenatal environmental ones.  Newly developed microsatellite DNA techniques will be  applied in identifying animals with the same or different  fathers.  It is hoped that the results of this work will  help in predicting which aspects of foraging are most  important to survival when animals confront different or  changed environments, and how environments and genetic  differences interact.",
