 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451580  Danowski  Over the past four years, the Union College Biology department has  hired three junior faculty members with expertise in modern  cellular, molecular and biochemical techniques. As part of our  efforts to incorporate methodologies and techniques not previously  available to our students into our laboratory curriculum, we  propose to establish a dedicated Cellular and Molecular  Biochemistry Laboratory, which will be used for four upper level  undergraduate courses as well as for independent student projects.  Specifically, we want to (1) familiarize our students with modern  techniques used in research and medical laboratories, (2) extend  their understanding of cellular and molecular structure, function  and engineering through the use of computer-aided imaging,  visualization and design programs, (3) Develop an integrated  laboratory experience demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of  biochemistry, cell, and molecular biology, and (4) allow students  to develop an independence and competence in the laboratory that  can in turn be applied to the pursuit of independent research  projects.  To accomplish these goals, we have begun by establishing  three new and one redesigned laboratory/lecture courses, which  incorporate basic molecular techniques and limited computer  analysis. However, to achieve our goals, we need additional  laboratory and imaging equipment, microscopes, computers and  software. By designing a single laboratory facility for these  courses and for student research, we eliminate the need for  duplicated equipment and provide a dedicated workspace for our  students to work outside of class. Laboratory sections will be kept  small (8-10 students), making it-possible to undertake more complex  experiments, provide more extensive supervision, and a more  realistic research lab environment.",
