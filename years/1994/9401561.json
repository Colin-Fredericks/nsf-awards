This system will be investigated  in  a  region  of  the  phase  diagram where correlations  between  electrons  determine  the  in-plane and out-of-plane dynamics.   The  experiments  focus on (a) the phase boundary of the electron crystal and how it  is  affected by screening; (b) the interplay between the electron  crystal  and  Landau  quantization in the presence of a perpendicular  magnetic  field;  (c) the effects of crystal correlations on tunneling; (d)  the  effect of the Landau quantization on magneto-tunneling rates.    Non-technical abstract: Electrons captured on a thin layer  of  helium  at very low temperatures form a two dimensional system which can serve  as  a  prototype  system  for the study of  electron  states  in  more  conventional  states of condensed matter.  The key task  required  for  realizing  a  case in which very many electrons are clustered  on  the  helium film is to reduce significantly the impurities and roughness of  the  underlying  solid on which the helium film  is  deposited.   This  project  will  focus on utilizing ultra clean and ultra  smooth  solid  substrates in order to achieve such a high density of electrons  which  has  not  been previously  achieved.  This high electron density  will  allow search of as yet undiscovered effects which will be important to  the  electron on helium problem in particular, but also to  other  two  dimensional electron systems in general.  ***",
