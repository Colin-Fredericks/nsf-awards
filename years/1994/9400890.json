 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400890  Appelquist  The Condensed Matter Physics Conference for 1994 at Aspen will  focus on the symmetry of the pairing states of high temperature  superconductors, the doping dependence of the anomalous normal  state transport and magnetic properties of the high Tc materials,  and the physics of three dimensional Mott-Hubbard systems.  In each  of these areas exciting and controversial new experimental and  theoretical results have appeared, but these results have not been  critically examined or systematically related to other work.  On  the topic of the symmetry of the pairing state, recent experimental  results of photoemission, penetration depth and Josephson tunneling  will be compared with results of other techniques such as NMR,  specific heat and neutron scattering.  On the normal state  properties the nature of the doping dependence of transport  properties and the spin gap behavior of the magnetic susceptibility  will be examined.  The third topic of interest relates to the  occurrence of metal-insulator transitions in some regions of the  phase diagrams of high Tc superconductors.  Certain three  dimensional transition metal oxides also feature metal-insulator  transitions but are not superconductors.   The conference will  examine this issue from a theoretical and experimental viewpoint.  %%%  High temperature superconductors exhibit remarkable physical  properties which have potentially significant technological  applications.  It is the very unusual properties of these materials  which offer a daunting challenge to experimental and theoretical  practitioners alike.  Many apparently contradictory experimental  results and theories have been published.  This conference is well  timed to critically examine the available data and compare it to  existing theory with the hope of defining future directions of  investigations.  ***",
