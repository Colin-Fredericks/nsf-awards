 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9414035  Roger Doherty    The purpose of this equipment grant proposal is to modernize the microscopy facility of the Mechanical Engineering at Drexel University (ME-DU) by acquiring an analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an EDS X-ray detector and its microanalytical processor.  This equipment will substitute the corresponding aging  instruments that are currently available at ME-DU.  This equipment is important for a large number of research projects, including the following:  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Processing of Ceramic Polymer Nanocomposites Using Thermal spray (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Plasma Sprayed Lightweight Coating for Lightweight Structure (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Evaluation and Control of Microstructure During Spray Deposition (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Structure-Processing-Properties in Ceramic-Ceramic Composites Manufactured by       Transient Plastic Phase Processing (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Semisolid Processing of Spray Cast Alloys and Composites (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Investigation of the Micromechanics of Failure Unidirectional Composites Using Laser       Raman Spectroscopy (NSF)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  In-Situ Metal Matrix Composites Via VLS Reactions (ONR)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Modeling and Microstructural Development During Spray casting (ONR)  {SYMBOL 183 \\f \"Symbol\"}  Recrystalization and Deformation Processing of Polycrystalline Metals (NSF/ALOCOA)    The currently available SEM has been continuously used for over 11 years and is essentially at the end of its useful life.    The responsibility of maintaining the machine in good working condition, training students in its use and driving the instrument for occasional non-expert users, will be assigned to the full-time technician currently employed by the ME-DU for the microscopy laboratory.  The technician is overseen by the principle investigators of this proposal.    The new SEM machine will also be used, as was the previous SEM, in t he senior design projects and teaching of undergraduate courses at Drexel in light of the newly developed Drexel Curriculum which has an emphasis on the laboratory experience.",
