The American Association for the Advancement of  Science, Girls Incorporated, the Education Development Center, and others will use their  collective resources to work in partnership with organizations that can act as advocates for equity  and influence the reform efforts and the formal education system.  The objective of the initiative  are to (1) strategies with the initiators of systemic reform efforts to determine how to make  equity both a driving force an a measure of success; (2) to collaborate with the initiators and  implementors of systemic reform to translate hate equity means into concrete strategies and  activities; (3) to provide support and assistance for systemic reform organizations and equity-  based organizations to advocate effectively for equity in mathematics and science education  reform; and (4) to strengthen the equity community by building a common language for equity  in mathematics and science and addressing the issues that separate advocates for gender equity,  racial/ethnic equity, and disability equity.  ***",
