Students may choose  from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under  the direction of senior faculty members from the Department  of Physics at the University of Arizona.  The main student  audience will be those who have finished the equivalent of  the first or second year curriculum in science or  engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for  transfer to a 4-year degree program.  This program will also  be available to similarly prepared students from regions  outside southern Arizona who will be resident in Tucson  during the summer.  Graduate Teaching Assistants from the  physics department will serve as mentors for the students.  Special orientation and skills activities will be  individually tailored to enable the students to make  significant contributions to the research projects.  Opportunities exist in many cases for the students to  continue their associations with the research project after  the completion of the summer REU program, most often as paid  laboratory associates.  Recruitment activities will place  special emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities.  Because most students will start in this program at a very  early point in their scientific education, we encourage  continuity in their development by allowing past  participants to apply for admission in subsequent summer  sessions.  ***",
