Both theoretical and  computational issues are addressed.  The theoretical objective is  to make a significant impact on the traditional perturbation  theory for stochastic matrices and Markov chains. One goal is to  completely describe the nature and characteristic features of  sensitive Markov chains and to build a clear and concise theory  of perturbations in the eigensystems of stochastic matrices. This  perturbation theory will be used to better understand the  convergence and stability properties of a variety of multilevel  algorithms for computing stationary probabilities.  The  computational aspect is concerned with the numerical  determination of stationary probabilities associated with  large-scale irreducible Markov chains with special emphasis on  those which are nearly uncoupled (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems).  The focus is on the  development, implementation, and analysis of  aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.  Both iterative and exact  aggregation/disaggregation methods are to be considered along  with some hybrid A/D techniques.       This research focuses on the analysis of stochastic matrices  and associated Markov chains concepts. Markov chain techniques  constitute a unifying theme and are the basis for an extremely  wide variety of mathematical models which are used to describe,  predict, and analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems.  Markov chain models are fundamental mathematical tools in areas  as diverse as engineering, economics, physical science, and  social science. In particular, analyzing and computing stationary  probabilities associated with large scale Markov chains is a  primary concern in problems involving queueing models and  networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,  economic modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems  modeling, and more generally in applications  where stochastic  models are used to understand the behavior of systems that evolve  with time. This project emphasizes both computational and  theoretical issues, and special attention is devoted to the  analysis of nearly uncoupled problems (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems). The following specific  research topics are to be investigated:  (1) As they evolve with  time, many physical systems eventually settle down into some sort  of steady state.  If the physical system is modeled by utilizing  the theory of Markov chains, then the steady state nature of the  system is characterized by a set of probabilities called  \"stationary probabilities.\"  Consequently, analyzing the behavior  of the stationary probabilities is a fundamental issue. The  theoretical component of this research involves studying the  stability properties of stationary probabilities. The results of  this research should clarify the understanding of the mechanisms  which contribute to either the stability (or instability) of the  underlying physical system being examined.  (2) The computational  facet of this project is to develop new algorithms for computing  stationary probabilities and to develop new methods by means of  which such algorithms can be analyzed. In practical applications  such as those mentioned above, it is usually the case that the  physical system under question involves an extremely large number  of components, but these components can often be grouped into  clusters for which there is strong interaction within any given  cluster but weaker interaction among the clusters themselves  (e.g., consider the economy of the United States).  This research  effort devotes special attention to analyzing and computing the  stability and steady state nature of such systems.  Mathematically, this involves computing and analyzing the  stationary probabilities of such systems. To this end, numerical  algorithms known as aggregation/disaggregation techniques will be  designed to specifical ly to exploit the special features of these  types of nearly uncoupled systems.",
