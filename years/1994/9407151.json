 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407151  Iwamoto   The preserved fish collection of the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) is considered the second most important international ichthyological research resource in North America.  Of the 218,00 specimen lots contained, only 60,000 (27.5%) are currently entered in a computer database.  This will capture catalog data from hand-written CAS and former Stanford University catalog ledgers using the MUSE collection-management software.  This accomplished, the Academy's fish collection will have more than 157,000 records in its electronic database, representing 72% of its total collection.  In a subsequent phase, electronic cataloging will capture data for all 61,000 remaining uncataloged lots.  When completed, the database will allow maintenance of better inventories and records of collections and loan transactions, immediate access to collection data, and quick and efficient computer-generation of lists of specimens, localities, and other custom-sorted data for the user community.  Cost savings in personnel time necessary to carry out these routine functions will be enormous compared with using the old hand-written ledger and records systems.  The value and use of the collections will be greatly enchanced by the unlocking of information previously unretrievable because of limitations in time and personnel.  Time saved by curatorial staff will be better used to continue high-quality maintenance of the collection.  Sharing of the captured data set will be a prime concern, and to this end the collection database will be made accessible to the world community through Internet, using the Gopher system.",
