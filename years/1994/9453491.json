 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453491  Ni         The award is for research in precision engineering, machining  technology, and quality control in manufacturing.  Research in  precision engineering is focused on cost-effective software-based  error compensation methods to improve machining accuracy, and  development of methods to enhance performance of coordinate  measurement machines.  Research issues to be addressed include  characterization of the thermal behavior of machine tools and  coordinate measurement machines, and development of statistical  sampling and evaluation methods for geometric dimensioning and  tolerancing requirements based on discrete measurement data.   Research in machining technology would focus on developing a  science based for drills and drilling processes, and prevention of  chatter in machining.  Research in quality control involves  utilization of advanced statistical techniques to deal with more  extensive process measurement data, and integration of automatic  process monitoring and diagnosis techniques with engineering  process knowledge.       Research in precision engineering is important for both  commercial applications and weapons systems, and offers great  potential for improving manufacturing competitiveness.  Drilling is  the most commonly used material removal process, accounting for  more than 80 percent of chips produced.  Chatter is a significant  barrier to increase productivity in machining in general.  Research  in drilling and chatter is thus of great practical importance.  The  new generation of quality control methods proposed here is  important for industrial competitiveness, and is needed to  accommodate current production practices which result in more  extensive measurement data.",
