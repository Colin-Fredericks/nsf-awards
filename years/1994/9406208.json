 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406208  Davis       The Colorado Plateau is a large area of relatively undeformed  rock that nevertheless was distal to a series of tectonic stress  patterns during Sevier, Laramide and Tertiary time.  The plateau  stratigraphy is rich in porous sandstones in which deformation  bands form with strains as small as 0.1%.  Because these are work-  hardening features, successive deformations are likely to form new  sets of deformation bands rather than extensively reactivate old  ones.  This project will map deformation bands in suitable  lithologies and related them to large features (faults) of known  age.  After spatial correlations, the stress orientations implied  by the deformation bands will be inverted from band orientations  and a set of paleostress patterns for the Colorado Plateau  produced.  Results should provide a much better understanding of  the directions, magnitude and degree of localization of stress of  these events in the Colorado Plateau.",
