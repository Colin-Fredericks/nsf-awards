 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400507  Mikkola    This research is aimed at understanding the mechanical properties  of  cubic  forms of trialuminides.  The work focuses  on  various  cubic  aluminum-titanium-chromium and aluminum-titanium-manganese  alloys,  though it is expected that the results will be important  to  the  understanding  of  other alloys  having  the  cubic  L12  structure. These chromium and manganese ternary alloys have  many  desirable  properties, but are unusual in that,  while  they  are  relatively  soft  and have little tensile ductility,  failing  by  transgranular fracture.  Similar behavior can be found among some  other  potentially useful intermetallics.  The primary thrust  of  the  research  is  to  improve these  alloys  through  additional  alloying,  based  in large part on studies of the micromechanisms  of  plastic deformation by high resolution transmission  electron  microscopy.  In this approach weak-beam imaging is combined  with  computer  simulation  of  images and related  to  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  alloys  as  a  function  of  temperature   and  composition.   It is the intent of this research to  define  this  behavior in the cubic trialiminides, thereby sorting out the wide  variety  of  conflicting ideas and interpretations found  in  the  literature.  Specific details of interest include the  nature  of  the  superdislocation configurations and dissociation  mechanisms  and  how  these  change  with temperature and  composition;  and,  further,  how these changes determine the mechanical  properties,  including ductility, work hardening rates, and the occurrence  of  serrated stress-strain behavior.  %%%  It is expected that this research will lead to improvement of the  properties  and engineering potential of the cubic trialuminides.  Effective  modeling of the deformation behavior should contribute  in a meaningful way to the future of intelligent alloy design.  ***",
