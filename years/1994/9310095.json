 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Rollins, 9310095      Gross error detection (GED) is directed at identifying and correcting inaccurately measured process variables when nuisance quantities (gross errors by some researchers' terminology) contribute to physical process constraints not being satisfied.  These nuisance quantities include biased measurements, process leaks, and other physical parameters that can cause inaccurate estimation of process variables.  Two reasons GED has not seen widespread use in the chemical process industries are its poor performance and limited applications.    The major objective of this research is to increase the use of GED in plant operations when the steady-state assumption is invalid (i.e. dynamic conditions).  The PI plans to develop a statistical approach that will provide accurate detection, identification, and estimation of process variables with gross errors and measures of performance, such as confidence intervals for true values and power functions for controlling error rates.  The research addresses dynamic processes operating at a set point (pseudo steady state) and dynamic processes with changing steady states.    The anticipated results include a-level global tests, a-level tests for specific identification, power functions for all tests, unbiased (or nearly unbiased) estimators, consistent estimators, and 100(1-a)% simultaneous confidence intervals when variances and covar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    iances of measurement errors are known and unknown.  The scope of the work includes missing data, unmeasured variables, and serially correlated data.  In addition, the PI plans to incorporate the work into an overall strategy to detect, identify, and correct process measurements with gross errors when conditions are dynamic.",
