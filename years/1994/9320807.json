 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320807  Williams    With this planning grant from The National Science Foundation,  Dr. Sloan Williams will develop models which will allow her to  reconstruct forms of prehistoric social organization using DNA  data obtained from the analysis of ancient bone. In the course of  archaeological fieldwork in southern Peru, Dr. Williams and her  collaborators have excavated a series of cemeteries which contain  well preserved human skeletal remains. The graves also yielded  numerous burial goods which provide information on the social and  occupational status of the associated individuals. Using current  biochemical techniques it is possible to extract and analyze DNA  from these bones and with the data thus collected determine the  degree of relatedness among individuals. On this basis it should  be possible to reconstruct biological affinity and relate this to  social and occupational organization.    While the archaeological significance of this work is clear and  the research is technically feasible, Dr. Williams must still  develop analytic techniques which bridge the gap between data and  question. This grant will provide her the time to accomplish  this. The project is important for three reasons. It will help to  develop an analytic technique of potential widespread use. It  will pave the way for Dr. Williams to design a large scale  effort. It will also facilitate the development of a promising  young scientist.  ***",
