Formby, University  of Alabama and Professor Chao-Cheng Mai, Academia Sinica.  The  invited participants for this workshop are the top current  researchers in the income distribution area.  They plan to  compare data and to discuss studies of growth and income  distribution in Taiwan and the U.S.  This is an important and  opportune subject as drastic changes in income distribution have  been taking place in many developing and developed economies. The  comparison of data on earnings distribution between the developed  economy (U.S.) and rapidly-developing economies such as Taiwan  can improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which  lead to changes in income distribution and their relationship to  economic growth.  This workshop is to be held on July 22-24, 1994  at the East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.",
