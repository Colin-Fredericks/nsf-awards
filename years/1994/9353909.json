Twenty-five faculty members will attend a five-day  residential workshop at St. John's University.  Applications of  techniques and current breakthroughs using this technology will  also be discussed. Follow-up activities include an evening  Lecture Series during the academic year focusing on the impact  of molecular biological techniques on current knowledge in cell  and molecular biology. SJU faculty and invited speakers from  other Metropolitan area research institutions will present  these lectures. Informal discussions will follow the lecture,  facilitating networking among the participants, SJU faculty and  invited speakers. Time will be made available on those evenings  for consultation and discussion with SJU faculty concerning  implementation of laboratory exercises by undergraduate faculty  participants.  In addition, one session of the follow-up  activities will be devoted to informing participants of grants  opportunities that can help them obtain equipment to use the  molecular techniques in their courses.  ***",
