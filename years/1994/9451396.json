Students will carry out one main experiment of their own design.   Computer-based data collection and spreadsheet analysis will be  used, affording students experience using the tools and methods  common to modern research.  The main experiment would be limited to  the general area of resonance of a damped and driven oscillator or  system of oscillators.  The oscillator was chosen because of its  centrality in physics, its connection with subsequent upper-level  courses, and the fact that it provides the students a wide variety  of effects to investigate, including the currently active topic of  chaotic motion.  To provide flexibility, the oscillatory systems  will be built in house.  Each oscillator system will require a  driver, a mechanical transducer, a range finder, and a data  acquisition/analysis and modelling system consisting of a 486 level  computer and software.",
