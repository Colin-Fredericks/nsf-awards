 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to help the ethnically and culturally  diverse community served by Miami-Dade Community College improve  scientific skills by assisting physics students and high school  physics teachers. In order to help our students improve their  understanding and applications of physics, they will be introduced  to a series of laboratory experiences using computers and video  technology. It is our expectation that in the process of doing  science, students will develop computer skills as well. In addition  to formal laboratory settings, a separate facility, fully equipped  as a tutorial lab run by both instructors and peer tutors, will be  made available to physics students who need additional help. This  will enhance their understanding physics through active engagement  in their own learning in an environment that encourages them to  build and communicate their knowledge. The combination of formal  laboratories and tutorial services is expected to improve student  retention and achievement in science courses and to help students  develop higher levels of scientific literacy, analytical, and  computer skills.  MDCC is deeply committed to working with the  community, particularly with the public high school system. This  project will provide training for high school physics teachers in  the use of MBL laboratories as well as in the adaptation and  development of new laboratory experiences.",
