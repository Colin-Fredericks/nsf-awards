 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451554  Stroup  This project will improve the ability of Francis Marion University  science and nonscience majors to analyze and solve new problems by  developing their higher order thinking skills. The major components  of the proposal include laboratory exercises organized around  hands-on experimentation, a series of interactive introductory  videotapes, Computer-Augmented Teaching (C.A.T.) techniques, and a  program of recently published analysis problems and case studies to  improve student oral and written communication. We propose to  enhance the development of thinking skills by a combination of  microvideo-instructional techniques and C.A.T. exercises. In two  pilot research projects these multimedia presentations have been  shown to significantly improve identified thinking skills when used  in combination with the requested equipment. New laboratory  exercises, and simulations will improve the content mastery and the  process skills of our students and promote an increased interest in  the biological sciences. The proposed project will impact directly  on approximately one thousand students annually enrolled in  Biology, will provide models for other FMU Departments, and will be  extended nationally through the authors' NSF sponsored Chautauqua  Short Course, the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT)  monograph series and an NABT sponsored videotape.  The South  Carolina Commission on Higher Education competitively funded our  pilot research project, which partially equipped two of our four  introductory Biology laboratories. The purpose of this NSF proposal  is to request funds to purchase microvideo and microcomputer  instructional systems to fully equip all four freshman  laboratories. Successful implementation of our instructional  strategy in all of our introductory biology laboratories will not  be possible without the requested instructional equipment.",
