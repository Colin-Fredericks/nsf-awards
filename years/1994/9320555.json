 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320555  Koenker    Quantile regression is gradually developing into a comprehensive  approach to the statistical analysis of linear and non-linear  response models.  By supplementing the exclusive focus of least-  squares-based methods on the estimation of conditional mean  functions, with a general technique for estimating conditional  quantile functions, it has greatly expanded the flexibility of  both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.  Research  is proposed on methods of inference for quantile regression,  nonparametric quantile regression and smoothing, and economic  applications.  The new applications of quantile regression  include non-parametric demand analysis and related welfare  economics, several applications to time-series analysis,  extensions to errors-in-variables and more general multivariate  settings, and applications to survival analysis and duration  models.    There is already a well-developed theory of asymptotic inference  for quantile regression.  However, when inference on discrete  quantiles is desired, as is increasingly common in econometric  applications, one is faced with a rather bewildering array of  methods based on direct estimation of the asymptotic covariance  matrix, an approach which involves estimation of the reciprocal  of the error density at the quantile of interest, or some form of  the bootstrap.  Versions of both approaches are available in  existing econometric packages.  Recently, however, three  alternative approaches to inference have emerged.  All of the new  approaches share the advantage that they circumvent the necessity  to directly estimate error density.  This project will compare   systematically the available methods for constructing confidence  intervals and for linear hypothesis testing.",
