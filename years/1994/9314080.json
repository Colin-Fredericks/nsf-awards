The investigators intend to study the  Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) transition, which marks one of the  dramatic environmental changes in Earth's history, resulting in  the extinction of dinosaurs, invertebrates and marine plankton.    Current faunal, stratigraphic and mineralogic records suggest  that the biotic effects of the K/T boundary event were most  severe in low latitudes and negligible in high latitudes, that  there may have been multiple events, and that long-term oceanic  instability marked the K/T transition.  The researchers propose  to study whether the mass extinction was the result of a giant  earth-impacting bolide in the Yucatan region, whether the effects  of this impact were more severe or limited to low latitudes, and  whether there is evidence of long-term oceanic instability that  would suggest that the bolide impact was a temporal coincidence,  rather than the primary cause for the mass extinction.    For this work, laboratory based geochemical and quantitative  faunal studies will be mostly done at Princeton University,  whereas sediment and stratigraphic analyses will be largely done  at the University of Nuevo Leon in Mexico.    ***",
