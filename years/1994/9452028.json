Teamwork, technology, creative and  critical thinking, and communication skills are crucial to success  in today's professional world. To ensure better prepared students,  the Mathematics Department at Central Oregon Community College  (COCC) implemented major curriculum reforms which foster skills so  crucial to success.  This comprehensive reform effort involves  developing and incorporating various interactive/experiential  formats across the curriculum.  Central to this reform program is  the creation of the Mathematics Activity Resource Center (MARC).   Project funds are being used to equip the MARC with computers and  other instructional aids.  The MARC greatly facilitates activities  that encourage teamwork, discovery, learning-by exploration,  open-ended group projects, and technical writing. The MARC enhances  the learning environment for all math students at COCC by providing  a setting physically separate from the traditional classroom.  In  addition, the MARC serves as a district-wide resource for  strengthening mathematics education at all levels.  The key  components COCC is addressing in its mathematics reform project  include: development of a cooperative learning environment;  integration of hands-on activities to promote skills and concepts;  implementation of interactive/experiential activities; introduction  of modern technologies and innovative educational methodologies;  involvement of faculty department-wide; incorporation of realistic  and open-ended problems; and, promotion of technical writing  skills.",
