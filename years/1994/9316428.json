 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316428  Bull       Tree-ring dating of recent New Zealand earthquakes is an  important and robust test of lichenometric dating of regional  rockfall events caused by earthquakes.  Lichen studies indicate  that about 240 years have elapsed since the most recent Alpine  fault earthquake, and a magnitude 8.1 +0.2 earthquake may soon  rupture about 400 km of the Alpine fault.  Verification of  lichenometry earthquake dates would substantiate needs for  establishing seismic monitoring and earthquake hazard reduction  programs.       Small patches of trees of the same age are typical of the rain  forest between the Alpine fault and the seacoast in the South  Westland district of New Zealand.  Partial destruction of the  forest canopy by disturbance events, such as windstorms or  earthquakes, allows a new generation of rimu (Dacrydium  cupressinum) to germinate and fill the gaps.  Regeneration patches  appear to be larger on poorly drained (seismically sensitive) soils  of the Okarito Forest near the coast where we will make our study.   Increment-core estimates of germination times for even-age patches  of rimu in two plots at a more inland site were made by Boyd  Cornere.  His M.Sc. thesis suggests that both plots had a canopy-  opening disturbance approximately 250 years ago.  These preliminary  results encourage us to accurately date forest-disturbance events  through study of times of abrupt increase or decrease of tree-ring  widths.       The proposed dendrochronology data set is a by-product of  selective logging in the Okarito sustained-yield forest.  An  initial phase of our work will be to develop a model for spatial  patterns of tree populations ages.  This important task will allow  us to make predictions about the way seismic shaking will affect  tree-ring width.  About 1000 mature rimu trees will be harvested in  1993 and 1994.  Departures from a standard chronology for rimu will  be identified by anomalous patterns of tree-ring widths and  densities.  We will select, prepare, and analyz e 200-300 sections  from basal rimu trunks for dates of canopy-opening events, tree-  damage events, and germination dates.  Year 1--Stand dynamics study  of the Okarito Forest; sample collection, shipping, and  preparation; measuring and cross-dating of tree rings.  Year 2--  studies and dating of tree-ring anomalies, analysis of data, and  report preparation.       Our project has multidisciplinary significance.  Comparison of  tree-ring and lichenometric dates should validate a new surface-  exposure dating method that is more accurate than radiocarbon  dating.  We expect to determine the earthquake recurrence intervals  for the adjacent Cook and Brunner segments of the Alpine fault, and  the times since the most recent earthquakes.  This will test the  hypothesis that a major earthquake is imminent.  An ecological end  product will be improved understanding of forest dynamics and  microenvironments, and forest-landforms relations.",
