 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406614  Reed  This award supports Professors Irving S. Reed and P. Vijay  Kumar of the University of Southern California, together with a  postdoctoral associate, to collaborate in applied mathematics  research with Professors Tor Helleseth of the University of  Bergen, Norway, and Henning Stichtenoth of the University of  Essen, Germany.  In general, they are working in the area of  the interaction between algebraic geometry and coding theory.   A major focus of their collaboration is the study of  exponential sums over Galois rings, and the application of this  to the design and study of error correcting codes.  Another  significant component involves Grobner basis techniques, both  their computation over finite fields and their application for  the decoding of cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes.  To  complement the U.S. groups' strengths in error correcting  codes, Professor Helleseth contributes necessary expertise in  the theory of algebraic functions and their applications to  coding theory as well as experience with Galois rings and  Grobner bases.  He also offers access to massively parallel  computing machines in Norway which will be used for some of the  joint research.  Professor Stichtenoth is an expert on  algebraic geometry and a world leader in the area of algebraic-  geometric codes.  The combination of their talents creates an  extremely powerful collaborative team.       The proposed research is an interdisciplinary combination of  discrete mathematics, symbolic computation and algebraic  computation theory.  Results will contribute to advances in the  theory of exponential sums and new and improved decoding  algorithms for error-correcting codes.  Such results will have  useful applications in several fields of mathematics, computer  science and engineering.  ***",
