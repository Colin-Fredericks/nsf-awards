 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322199  Anderson       This proposal offers undergraduate research experiences in a  ten-week program integrating the research activities of ten  investigators from Black Hills State University, the University of  Wyoming, the City of Spearfish, South Dakota, and the United States  Forest Service.  The specific research projects focus on the impact  of urban and rural activities within the City of Spearfish on the  quality of surface and groundwater, and on possible remediation  techniques.  All projects will utilize Black Hills State  University's newly purchased microcomputing facilities, including  a Macintosh Quadra computer laboratory and a IBM-compatible 486 lab  equipped with GIS and AutoCAD software.  The goals of our proposed  program are to give undergraduate students an opportunity to   1) participate in environmental research projects that utilize  high-end microcomputing facilities, 2) become acquainted with a  variety of related scientific subdisciplines, 3) improve their  scientific writing, 4) present research to their peers at the  National Conference on Undergraduate Research, and 5) disseminate  the research to the scientific community through publication.  The  overlying theme of the program is to expose students who are in the  early stages of a research career to environmental projects that  involve application of field, lab, and microcomputing skills.  We  believe that exposing students to a variety of related  environmental research topics will convince them to develop a  strong, interdisciplinary science and math background, and enhance  their research abilities.",
