The program will give undergraduates majoring in geology, geophysics, physics, and closely related disciplines, experience working in a research environment.  The program objective is to acquaint undergraduates with exciting research opportunities in the various fields of geophysics concentrating on seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, paleomagnetics and tectonics and encouraging the undergraduates to go on to graduate school in these or other scientific fields.  Women and minorities will be particularly encouraged to apply.  Many of the students will be recruited from small liberal arts colleges throughout the Nation, and programs like this are likely to be their only opportunity for in depth exposure to the fields of solid earth sciences before they must make decisions regarding graduate school.  In their contacts with graduate students and by attending seminars and thesis defenses, the students will obtain an accurate perspective of graduate student life.  In this program, students are assigned to work with individual faculty investigators on projects assigned by the investigators.  In addition there will be an organized series of weekly lectures and field trips to expose students to other fields of research beyond the scope of their own project.",
