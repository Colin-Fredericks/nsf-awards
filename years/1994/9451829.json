Introductory Astronomy  students will have the opportunity to use a completely computerized  8 inch telescope, coupled with a computer  controlled CCD camera to  obtain images.  Engineering students, in their junior year, will  can do astronomical projects using the same equipment. This project  has been motivated by new skills the  project director learned this  past summer participating in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for  Astrophysics program entitled \"Research Techniques for  Undergraduate Faculty At Small Observatories\". An observatory under  construction at the college, with a 16\" computerized  Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, will be utilized in conjunction with  some of the equipment in this project by engineering students in  advanced projects.",
