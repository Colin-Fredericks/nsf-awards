 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408776  Ballance      This is a symposium focusing on the materials and processes  used to manufacture musical instruments to be held at the  1994 Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society.  The  Acoustical Society of America is co-sponsoring this  symposium, which will be the first where materials  scientists and musical acousticians will be brought together  to discuss musical instruments.  We are expecting much  participation by professional instrument makers and artists  and therefore hope to promote communication and  collaboration between these four groups.  Among the topics  to be discussed at the symposium are (1) the affect the  materials used to make an instrument has on the sound it  produces, (2)the materials and manufacturing related  problems that instrument makers have and what new materials  and processes they are using, and (3) new or advanced  materials for instruments or parts of instruments to achieve  an improvement in sound quality or a reduction in price.  A  group of eminent scientists and instrument makers have been  invited to contribute to the symposium and the symposium is  being organized by a group that includes materials  scientists, instrument makers and an acoustician.    As this event is a first of its kind, the organizers feel  that it will be a unique opportunity for students interested  in this area to meet the foremost researchers and to hear  them speak.  This proposal  will provide funding for the  travel expenses of students.   ***",
