Our specific interest is to apply this  instrumentation to transport and exchange in surface and bottom  boundary layers However, the technique will be applicable to a wide  range of flows where simultaneous velocity measurements are  desirable. At the heart of the innovation is a completely non-  intrusive optical geometry which forms several sample volumes in  the flow, and corresponding receiving optics to distinguish their  images.  Such a device is needed to observe structures in natural  flows and to deal with issues such as flow stationarity.  This  simultaneous view of the velocity field will remove uncertainty in  the interpretation of velocity profile information; e.g. the  velocity shear and shear stress, turbulent characteristic scales  and roughness lengths.  The concept also concept also removes the  need for mechanical scanning devices or profilers, both of which  yield non-simultaneous measurements.  The use of this instrument  for characterizing the concentration and transport rate of  sediments in the bottom boundary layer is described.  The concept  is also beneficial to laboratory scientists using flumes, towing  tanks, and wind tunnels, in that multi-point measurements provide  additional information on flow structure and improve productivity.",
