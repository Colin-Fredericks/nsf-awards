Even with  current  gigaflop performance, however, the capabilities of the  machines  executing state-of-the-art algorithms are still far below  the  needs; in order to reduce the risk in planning projects, the  petroleum industry needs much greater computational power in  order to make improved predictions of reservoir performance.  Further advances can come by introducing sophisticated  algorithmic techniques, such as adaptive local grid  refinement  and parallel processing.  In this postdoctoral research  program,  we propose to extend adaptive local grid refinement  techniques,  currently being developed at Duke University for micellar-  polymer  flooding, to compositional reservoir simulation.  We also  propose  to investigate the parallelization of this algorithm on a  network  of IBM RS6000 workstations at Mobil Exploration and  Production  Technical Center.",
