 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320499  Price    Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Price, Mr. Michael Kimball  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Working with a  team of volunteers, he will conduct systematic survey of the  Lough Swilly region of County Donegal, Ireland. Researchers will  walk over large areas of exposed ground and note stone tool  scatters and other archaeological occurrences. On the basis of  artifact types, many of these can then be dated to time period.  The data will be plotted and analyzed by Geographic Information  System. In this way it will be possible to reconstruct settlement  patterns in different time periods and relate these to geographic  features. The work will reveal the shifting interaction between  landscape and human society and relate changes to subsistence  technique.    Mr. Kimball will focus on the period of the Mesolithic-Neolithic  transition. The former, which follows immediately on the end of  the last glaciation marks the end of a hunting and gathering way  of life in Northern Europe. In the succeeding Neolithic period,  populations adopted a lifestyle based on domesticated plants and  animals. Archaeologists wish to understand how this change took  place and how it affected human use of the landscape. It is  unclear whether population replacement occurred or whether  Mesolithic inhabitants gradually incorporated agriculture and  pastoralism into a hunting and gathering way of life. Mr.  Kimball's work will help to answer this question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on human change and adaptability and how humans interact with the  natural environment. It will also assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.",
