 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403026  Zeng    This award supports the travel expenses for Dr.  Xiao Zeng, Department of Chemistry at the  University of Nebraska at Lincoln, to spend  four months conducting research with Professor  Koichiro Nakanishi in the Division of Molecular  Engineering at Kyoto University. The research  entails studies of phase equilibria and  nucleation in fluids.    The kinetics of gas to liquid phase transition  starts from a nucleation process which involves  the passage from a metastable state over a  barrier to reach a thermodynamically stable  phase.  Using classical nucleation theory,  discrepancies in temperature   dependence rates remain unexplained. Recently,  two-dimensional systems, such as monolayers,  permit the study at the microscopic level of  the kinetics of the phase transition.  This  project will allow Dr. Zeng, who recently has  worked on a variety of problems in the  materials sciences involving the application of  statistical mechanical methods and density  functional techniques, to join Dr. Nakanishi  and his group of researchers in Japan. The  team at Kyoto has conducted extensive work on  computer modeling using Monte Carlo  calculations concerned with fluid phase  equilibrium. The project brings together the  complementary research interests of the  investigators.    The award is funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP  Science Fellowship Program.  ***",
