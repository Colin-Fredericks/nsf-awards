 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Ciric - 9408694      Traditional process synthesis involves optimizing the steady state economic performance of a chemical process.  Stability analysis and control system design are performed after the flowsheet structure, equipment sizes, and nominal operating parameters have been specified.    The objective of this work is to incorporate controllability issues into process design.  The idea is to use an optimization based test to screen out process designs that are unstable or difficult to control.  The test is a non-local optimization-based test of dynamic stability that asks whether a dynamic system will always remain within the control neighborhood.  The test is flexible and can be applied to systems with parameter uncertainty, to constrained dynamic systems, or to systems with discrete dynamic modes.  The work will embed this optimization-based test for stability within a larger optimization problem that seeks an economical design.  The PI plans to solve the resulting bi-level optimization problem with a dual-temperature simulated annealing approach.  Four specific problems will be investigated: heat exchanger network synthesis, heat integrated distillation systems, heat integrated reactor networks, and homogeneous azeotropic distillation.",
