 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452209  Marovac  The objective of this project is to expand the multimedia  capabilities of our Multimedia and Software Engineering Laboratory  (MM&SE).  Currently, our laboratory has one SUN IPC workstation,  four IBM-PS2 Model 80 PCs based on 80386 MPU, and an IBM AT with a  color monitor for high resolution graphics.  The laboratory is used  for class work and research in undergraduate courses that cover  multimedia, graphical user interface environments, computer  graphics, and software engineering and a graduate course in  software engineering. However, for graphical interface  environments, computer graphics and software engineering courses we  occasionally also use departmental Sun 4/110 workstations that are  shared with a number of other courses.  The improvement through   this project consists of an addition of 6 computers, 3 Silicon  Graphics INDY multimedia workstations and  3 IBM multimedia 9557 DV  PCs.  All computers will be equipped with 16 bit audio, hardware  supported moving video and ISDN interfaces.  This project primarily  impacts our multimedia course and our undergraduate research  projects in multimedia.  The equipment is used in teaching full  multimedia including high quality audio and moving video.  However,  the project significantly affects our undergraduate courses in user  interface environments, raster graphics and software engineering.   The equipment is also used for a number of undergraduate research  projects involving development of multimedia tools supporting other  computer creative activities, e.g. a group development environment  in which the students can fully communicate with each other through  audio and real time video while working as a team on software  engineering projects.",
