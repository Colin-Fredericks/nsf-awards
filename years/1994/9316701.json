 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316701  Hyman       Transcription termination, defined as the release of the  nascent transcript and dissociation of RNA polymerase from the  template, is arguably the least well understood aspect of  eukaryotic transcription.  The goal of the proposed research is  to contribute to defining the mechanism(s) that are responsible  for termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II.  There are  two specific aims.  The first describes experiments that address  which sequences are required to direct 3' end formation in vivo.   Models proposing that a secondary structure may be important for  this event will be tested.  The second aim is to utilize an in  vitro biochemical assay to complement, and extend the molecular  approach.  %%%  The focus of much research in molecular biology is in the study  of gene expression.  This is concerned with how genes are turned  on in some cell types but not others.  This work is concerned  with how transcription, an important step in gene expression, is  controlled.  Specifically we will ask how the enzyme which is  responsible for the transcription reaction stops at the  appropriate place in the gene.  This reaction is referred to as  transcription termination.  Little is known about transcription  termination yet it is an extremely important part of fundamental  cell mechanisms.  ***",
