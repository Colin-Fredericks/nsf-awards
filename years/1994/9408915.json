This project will estimate measures of the structure of  international technological cooperation, such as the relative  frequency of collaboration between different countries; and  measures of the distribution of each industry's \"knowledge base\"  by detailed research field.  In addition, the project will  reexamine several important hypotheses about R&D specialization  and collaboration, e.g., the relationships between the  characteristics of organizations, the nature of the R&D they  conduct and the R&D results they produce, and their demand for  collaboration.    This study of these European data will provide important  comparative findings to the US research community engaged in the  analysis of the conduct of research and development in the public  and private sectors.  * * *",
