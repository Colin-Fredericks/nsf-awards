The meeting is an annual activity organized by the  Pakistan Ministry of Science and Technology and arose out of a  vital need for communication among scientists.  It offers  participants a forum to discuss advances in physics and their  relationship to modern needs, particularly issues and concerns of  developing countries.  The first two weeks will cover the general  aspects of Particle Transport, and Laser Physics and  Applications.  The last week will be devoted to an International  Workshop on Lasers and Quantum Optics.           Scope:  The proposed summer college has been held annually in  Nathiagali, Pakistan with participation from scientists  throughout Asia and Africa and with lecturers from the western  world.  Each year, a number of women scientists are also invited  both as lecturers and participants.  It has received strong  endorsement in the past from participants from these countries as  well as from international organizations including the Inter-  national Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste.  It received  partial support from that center as well as from the Chinese  Academy of Sciences in Beijing.   ***",
