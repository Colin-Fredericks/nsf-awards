 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has been designed to significantly improve the quality  of technological education in Southwest Virginia by increasing the  capability of five community colleges to respond to industry-  identified needs for advanced manufacturing technology (AMT)  education.  The project activities will serve as a model for rural  appalachian colleges and will be coordinated through the Southwest  Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Center, formed through a consortium  of five community colleges.  The project involves two components:  1) enhancement of faculty skills and knowledge to teach the  advanced technologies required by AMT curricular courses via \"back-  to-practice\" internships in industry and attendance at seminars and  workshops, and 2) initial development of common AMT curricular  courses by cross-disciplinary teams, comprised of faculty from the  five participating community colleges, representatives from  regional business and industry, and faculty from area high schools  and senior institutions.",
