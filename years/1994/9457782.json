 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the complexity of proof systems is fundamental to  logic and has a broad range of applications in computer science  as well.  First, the efficiency of any deduction system is tied  to the speed of logical  reasoning (e.g., Prolog, Datalog, and  many inferencing systems in artificial  intelligence).  Secondly,  the complexity of propositional proof systems is  intimately  connected to the central question in complexity theory of whether  NP equal coNP.  Finally, there are links between particular  propositional proof  systems, systems of arithmetic, and  complexity classes.  Exploiting these  connections, one can apply  a whole new range of tools from logic to attack  difficult complexity questions (such as P = NP).   The basic question in  propositional logic to be considered is:  How long does a proof of a  propositional tautology have to be, as  a function of the size of the tautology?  The best upper bound  for all known proof systems is exponential in the size of  the  tautology and it is conjectured that a similar lower bound holds.  This  question is equivalent to whether or not NP = coNP, and  while it has been  studied extensively for the last 25 years, it is still far from solved.  Propositional proof systems can be  divided into classes that correspond  directly to complexity  classes.  An approach toward proving NP = coNP is to  establish  superpolynomial lower bounds for specific proof systems of greater  and greater proof strength.  Much of this research is  aimed at attacking this  difficult problem.   Another line of research concerns feasible arithmetic  (also known  as bounded arithmetic) and its connections to   propositional  proofs and complexity theory.  The concept of a feasible   proof has been the subject of much research in the last ten years.",
