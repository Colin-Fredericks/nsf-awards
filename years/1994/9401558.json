 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401558  Shatah       This award supports mathematical research on partial  differential equations which arise in studies of classical  fields.  The work involves studies of hyperbolic Yang-Mils  equations and wave maps.  It is planned to address fundamental  questions on existence, uniqueness and formation of singularities  for these models.  Also considered will be models defined on the  n-sphere where efforts will be made to show that, at least in the  one-dimensional case, unstable stationary solutions possess  homoclinic orbits.  Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of  solutions to perturbed wave equations and nonlinear lattices will  also be carried out.  Decay estimates for solutions of the wave  equation on the Schwarzschild metric where there is a trapped  sphere and decay rates for the discrete wave equation will be  developed.  This results will be used to study the dynamics of  nonlinear multi-dimensional lattices, specifically the phenomenon  of resonance.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
