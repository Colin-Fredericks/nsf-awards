 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415303  Andrews  The project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs  that are clear, portable, and efficient.  The three common  approaches to this problem are parallelizing compiler, very high-  level languages and imperative languages or software systems with  a single communication model.  This project will develop a common  base of programming abstractions and underlying software that  simplifies as well as supports all of these approaches.    The center piece of the research is the Filaments package, which  supports efficient execution of fine-grain parallelism and a  shared communication on both shred and distributed memory  multiprocessors.  The specific topics to be investigated by this  project are:  1) expanding and refining Filaments package, 2)  designing and implementing MIF, a multi-paradigm intermediate for  compilers that will be both language and architecture  independent; and 3) designing and implementing a simple and  efficient programming language HPSR (high performance SR).  Filaments and MIF address the problems of portability and  efficiency, independent of the language used to write parallel  programs, and HPSR addresses the problem of program clarity.  ***",
