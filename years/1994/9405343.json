Ramakrishnan,  Department of Civil Engineering, South Dakota  School of Mines and Technology, to conduct with  Dr. P. Paramasivam, Department of Civil  Engineering, National University of Singapore,  a workshop on the durability of concrete with  particular emphasis on the marine environment.   Nine U.S. participants and at least an equal  number from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and  Brunei will be selected by an advisory panel of  experts in the field of the workshop.  This  workshop is a satellite conference for the 4th  International Conference on Structural Failure,  Durability, and Retrofitting which will be held  in Singapore, July 14 and 15, 1993.  The magnitude of the durability problem is  considerable.  In the concrete infrastructure  estimated at $6 trillion, current replacement  and repair requirements caused by inadequate  durability is conservatively estimated at  several billion dollars.  The workshop will  focus on the use of new supplementary cementing  materials, corrosion inhibitors, improved mix  design, rebar types, and construction  techniques.  The collaborators are well known  researchers in this field.       This project is relevant to the objectives of  the Science in Developing Countries Program  which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and developing country  scientists and engineers through the exchange  of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mutual interest and benefit.  ***",
