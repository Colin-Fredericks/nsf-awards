The International Geographical Union (IGU) brings  together geographers from 94 nations for a wide range of  purposes, the most important of which are (1) promotion and  coordination of research on geographic problems, (2) involvement  of geographers in the work of relevant international  organizations, and (3) facilitation of the collection and  diffusion of geographic data among scientists in different  nations.  The most important forums for the work of the IGU are  its regional conferences and international congresses, which  alternate every two years.  This award will provide group-travel  support to increase participation of American geographers at two  upcoming meetings of the IGU.  Twenty scholars will receive  awards to assist their travel to the regional conference to be  held in Prague, Czech Republic, in August 1994.  Twenty-five  American scholars will receive funds to assist facilitate their  participation in at the International Geographical Congress to be  held in The Hague, Netherlands, in August 1996.  Travel awards  will be made following review by a screening committee of  applications submitted in response to an open solicitation.  The  most important criterion to be used in evaluation of applications  is the scientific merit of the applicant's contribution to the  conference.  Emphasis also will be given to increasing  participation of American geographers who are at early stages of  their independent research careers.       This award will facilitate involvement of more American  geographers in two major meetings sponsored by the IGU.  As a  result of their participation, these scientists will conduct a  broader range of higher-quality research.  Some  will become  involved in collaborative research projects with leading foreign  scientists.  Greater participation will enable some Americans to  assume important leadership positions in the IGU and its  subsidiary committees.  By giving special emphasis to younger  scientists, these travel grants should also hasten the  involvement of productive young researchers in international  activities.  ***",
