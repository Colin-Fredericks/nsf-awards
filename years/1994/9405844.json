In previous research, two  operons required for cellulose synthesis were identified and  sequenced.  In the same studies, an in vitro cellulose synthesis  system was also developed.  With this in vitro cellulose synthesis  system together with mutant cells in the cel (cellulose synthesis)  genes, the role of each one of the cel gene products in cellulose   formation may be determined.  By using the same in vitro cellulose  synthesis system and mutant collection, putative intermediates in  cellulose synthesis were found.  The chemical structure of these  intermediates will be determined.  In addition, cellulose synthesis  in A. tumefaciens is increased in the present of plant cells or  plant extracts.  The mechanism of this regulation will be examined.  %%%  Cellulose, which is made by plants and by some bacteria and fungi,  is one of the most abundant biologically produced materials on  earth.  It is a relatively simple molecule consisting of a linear  chain of beta-1,4-glucose molecules.  However, the detailed  mechanism of cellulose synthesis is not well understood.  It is not  now known whether all organisms which make cellulose use similar  pathways, or whether there are different pathways used by different  groups of organisms.  The regulation of cellulose synthesis is also  poorly understood.  In this research project, the mechanism and  regulation of cellulose synthesis by a bacterium called  Agrobacterium tumefaciens will be examined.  The advantages of  using a bacterium to study cellulose synthesis are that the  bacteria are relatively simple and often allow more easily for the  determination of genes required and the individual role(s) of the  same gene products in a complex biosynthetic pathway.  In an  earlier study, the genes for cellulose formation by this bacterium  were determined.  Now with a collection of mutant cells and the  development of a cell-fre e cellulose synthesis system, it is hoped  that the function of each one of the genes of cellulose synthesis  can be determined, that the chemical steps in the pathway for  cellulose formation will be identified, and that experiments can be  undertaken to begin to understand how the microbial pathway is  regulated for cellulose formation.  ***",
