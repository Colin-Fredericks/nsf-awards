Yet how equity considerations influence  institutional development, and thus specific patterns of  environmental and social outcomes, is a largely underdeveloped  arena of research. This project will study how equity concerns  enter into the structure and performance of an institutional  format that has long been utilized for managing common-pool  resources, namely common property resource management systems.  The study will first examine how three types of equity  conceptions (procedural, distributive, and redistributive) are  embodied in the formation and operation of rule structures  governing natural resource property regimes. Second, an analysis  of how the resultant property regimes produce specific patterns  of resource distribution and environmental change will be carried  out. The research will involve an historical and comparative  study of two different ethnic groups, the Yi (the minority group)  and the Han (the majority) in a poor agrarian region located in  the environmentally-degraded Liangshan Mountains situated in  Sichuan Province, China. The methodology uses a diversity of  methods focussed on the collection of primary qualitative and  quantitative data through surveys, interviews, and the  examination of village records and legal documents.       This study will provide important new insights as to how  cultural differences in the conception of equity enter into and  shape institutional rules, producing differential effects on the  environmental and social outcomes within the same mountain  landscape. As a doctoral dissertation research enhancement award,  this project will also provide support to enable a promising  student to establish a strong independent research career.  ***",
