The emphasis of this  project is to explore an area at the border between  low-dimensional topology and geometry via the concept of thin  position.  In knot theory, this concept was first introduced by  D. Gabai and used to solve the long-standing property R  conjecture.  The analog to thin position in minimal surface  theory has been studied extensively the H. Rubenstein; in  particular, thin position proved to be the key to the solution to  the recognition problem for the 3-sphere.  The knot theoretic  interpretation of thin position has recently been used to give an  alternate proof of Rubenstein's theorem, confirming close  connections between the two points of view.  Pursuit of such  linkage between two different areas promises to be extremely  fruitful.  The goals of this project are twofold; first, to  acquire a deep understanding of minimal surface theory,  particularly PL-minimal surface theory.  Second, to exploit thin  position, with the intent of using insights from knot theory to  solve interesting questions in minimal surface theory and  vice-versa.  ***",
