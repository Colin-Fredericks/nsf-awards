 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) exhibit a constellation  of traits associated with a monogamous social organization  including the formation of pair bonds between males and  females.  Among characteristics of pair bonding are  preferences for a familiar partner, usually of the opposite  sex.  Preliminary data indicate that in male prairie voles  corticosterone treatment produces a dose-dependent increase  in the preference for a familiar female partner; in contrast  in females it appears that treatment with corticosterone  inhibits partner preference formation.  Conversely  adrenalectomy, which eliminates corticosterone secretion,  reduces pair bonding in males and facilitates pair bond  formation in females.  In the proposed research, this  investigator will:  (1) examine the behavioral and endocrine  parameters associated with the behavioral effects of  corticosterone.  These studies will document the amount of  stimulation necessary to form a clear partner preference in  males versus females.  Concurrently, she will (2) examine  the time course of changes in endogenous corticosterone  titers following exposure to a member of the opposite sex.  In addition, she will (3) continue her studies of the  behavioral effects of corticosterone to determine dose  response curves for the above behavioral changes.  Finally,  she will (4) compare the behavioral effects of exogenous  corticosterone to those of a stress-induced release of  corticosterone.  The results of this research will  contribute to our understanding of the physiology of social  attachment and social organization.  The existence of social  bonds is widely accepted, but we know relatively little -  especially in adults - about the factors that regulate the  formation of social attachments.",
