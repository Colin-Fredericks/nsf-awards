Los Angeles, CA  Cobb, Jewel    \"Residential Intensive Math and Science Academy\"    Residential Intensive Math and Science Academy (RIMSA) is a 4-week  residential program aimed at underrepresented seventh grade  students in Los Angeles.  The Academy will serve 50 students by  offering math, science, computers and expressive writing for  curricular enrichment.  Academic monitoring and follow-up will  occur through 8 Saturday Academy sessions.  The program will offer  an intensive experience for students who attend school on year-  round calendars and cannot participate in a traditional summer  program.  The curricular focus will be mathematics, scientific  inquiry, hands-on science, computer application, and creative  expression.      Students will be recruited primarily from ACCESS Center pipeline  schools representing low SES minority student populations.  Faculty  will be recruited from math, science and/or equivalent Education  and computer science departments at CSU Los Angeles and schools in  the ACCESS pipeline.  A Program Director also serving as the  outreach coordinator will administer the program and ensure active  parent participation.  ***",
