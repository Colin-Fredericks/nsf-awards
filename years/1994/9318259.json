 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318259  Bookman  Support from the NSF is requested for the development of new  instrumentation to measure rapid changes in the capacitance  of biological membranes with high resolution. These  measurements of changes in capacitance will permit the  investigation of a number of biologically important  phenomena. The principal use of this instrument is likely to  be the detection of increases in cell surface area arising  from the fusion of one or more secretory vesicles with the  cell's plasma membrane during the process of exocytosis. The  study of secretory vesicle fusion events and the  quantitative characterization of the kinetics of secretion  made possible by this instrument can improve our  understanding of a fundamental process in cell biology. An  additional component of membrane capacitance arises from the  mobility of charged groups on proteins lying within the  electric field of the membrane. Recent results show that the  detection of such charge movements from voltage-dependent  ion channels as a capacitance signal can provide new  information about ion channel gating and its modification by  toxins. Thus it is expected that the proposed instrument can  help to establish new methods for studying conformational  changes of membrane proteins.        The project consists of the development of software to  implement a stimulus synthesizer, the development of  improved and user-tunable algorithms for measuring membrane  capacitance, their implementation in software, development  of new analysis and data base tools for the data produced by  this instrument, and documentation of the instrument for  both users and programmers. The fundamental assumptions  behind this instrument include: 1) that the cell under study  can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit, and  2) that a cell under voltage clamp can be driven by a  band-limited, arbitrary-frequency voltage stimulus and the  resulting current can be faithfully sampled with high  resolution. Based on these assumptions, the inst rument will  be able to combine traditional transient membrane  depolarization with more spectrally complicated waveforms in  order to study processes activated by the cell's electrical  activity. This proposed instrument will attempt to resolve  changes in membrane capacitance that are on the order of  10-1s Farads and to resolve such changes occurring in a 1kHz  bandwidth.    This instrument is an example of a new class of  instrumentation made possible by developments in three areas  of technology: 1) high speed general purpose  microprocessors, 2) fast, high resolution A/D and D/A  converters, and 3) special purpose digital signal processing  algorithms. A key feature of this project is the reliance  upon hardware components that already exist in most  laboratories, i.e., a personal computer and a data  acquisition interface. With the increasing power of the  scientist's data acquisition computer, new types of  measurements become possible solely by the addition of  software. With its implementation of appropriate algorithms,  the proposed instrument will provide information that is  unattainable with any commercial instrument and make  possible new types of experiments to study membrane  processes. A particular advantage is that the proposed  instrument can be widely and rapidly disseminated to the  research community electronically (i.e., through Internet))  at no additional capital cost to the nation's laboratories.",
