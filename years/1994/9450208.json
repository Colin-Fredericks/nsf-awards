Teachers, school administrators, university and college faculty,  parents and students need to accept these assessments as valid  measures of both quality and quantity of science learning and  achievement.  Three Golden State Examinations in Science (Biology,  Chemistry, and Coordinated Science) have been developed and  implemented on a broad scale on California high schools.  This  study aims to use these examinations, the students taking them, and  the teachers teaching those students as basis to begin to establish  the parameters and methodologies that can be most efficiently used  in future large scale efforts to monitor secondary school science  reforms.  The study will focus (though not exclusively) on the  schools working with the state Scope, and Sequence and Coordination  (SS&C) project reforms.    The Golden State Examination development and implementation has  been a collaborative effort of school science teachers and college  science faculty.  This teamwork has been a valuable professional  development opportunity for several hundred science teachers,  involved in various facets of the examination, such as development  committees, scoring teams, portfolio judges, and as workshop  leaders.  This study will add a research component to this  evaluation design and data analysis among core groups of these  teachers.  The majority of those involved will be from schools  heavily involved in implementing high quality coordinated or  integrated science from all students, which is the platform of  California's SS&C project.  These teachers will design surveys to  monitor attitudes and pathways of learning of students, and  progressive subject matter tests, will score essays, performance  tasks, and portfolios, and will analyze results to make  recommendations for future assessmen t and evaluation implementation  efforts.",
