The outcome is a plan for teacher  enhancement that would be activated statewide first in elementary school science and later in  middle school mathematics.  The project, entitled Science Access for All Students, has the  following goals:    o    Science curricula will be reviewed and made accessible for all  students,   o    Science educators and staff developers in California will be  prepared to meet the       needs of students with disabilities,  o    A selection of elementary schools where students with  disabilities are mainstreamed       will be established as model sites for total inclusion in science curricula,  o    A replicable model for accessibility review and staff development will be       disseminated, and  o    A proposal for statewide enhancement of teaching science and  mathematics to       students with disabilities will be developed.    These goals will be achieved through a process of reviewing the accessibility of instructional  materials, adapting instructional materials, providing on-site support and professional  development, and disseminating findings and procedures.",
