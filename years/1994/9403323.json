 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403323  Emlen     Males in natural populations of the dung beetle Onthophagus  acuminatus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) occur in two discrete forms:  those larger than a \"critical\" size have a pair of large frontal  horns, a deeply indented prothorax, and wide heads with an upturned  frontal lip while males smaller than the \"critical\" size lack  horns, have a smooth prothorax, and a narrower head without frontal  lip.  The developmental basis of this morphological dimorphism in  males will be investigated by examining larval hormonal and growth  processes that underlie horn expression and other developmentally  linked traits correlated with horn morphology.  %%%  Effects of (proximate) developmental mechanisms on directions of  (ultimate) phenotypic evolution will be revealed by the research.   This study of condition- or environment-sensitive expression of  developmental morphology sets the stage for greater understanding  of the relationship between microevolutionary change and  macroevolution.  Such knowledge enhances our appreciation of the  Earth's biodiversity and how it came into existence.  Generally,  studies of insect developmental patterns have potential for guiding  safe but effective biological control strategies.  ***",
