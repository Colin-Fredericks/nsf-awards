 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioengineering and catalysis are important aspects of chemical  reaction engineering education. Problems associated with the  maintentance of biocultures have prevented thee introduction of  bioreactors into chemical engineering lab courses. Similarly, the  high temperatures and pressures coupled with student safety  concerns have prevented the widespread use of catalytic reactor  systems for student laboratories. This project will develop an  immobilized enzyme bioreactor that will allow students to  thoroughly study both bioengineering and catalysis systems without  the problems associated with conventional reactor systems. The  resulting process will be an inexpensively constructed apparatus  for illustration of the principles of chemical catalysis that can  be operated at near ambient temperatures and pressures. Student  interest will be maintained since the reactor system is based on a  proven industrial process. This option for study of catalytic  bioreactors may not have occurred to many chemical engineering  departments. Thus, when the results of this project are presented  and published, there will be a significant positive impact on the  chemical engineering laboratory curriculum nationwide.",
