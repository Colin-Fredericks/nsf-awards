This purpose is achieved through a five-day  workshop and follow-up activities involving twenty faculty  members. Participants are urged to apply in pairs, two from one  institution or one from each of two neighboring institutions.  During the workshop, the participants are brought up to date on  the computing sciences topics and methodologies that can be  offered in associate-degree programs, as identified in the  recently-completed two-year college computing curricula  recommendations of the Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM). By engaging in small group activities based on the  report's contents, participants develop items such as  implementation strategies for specific content areas,  educational materials, ways of combining topics into courses,  and project or laboratory exercises. Through contact with  industry representatives, participants are informed about  current employment opportunities and issues for graduates with  an associate degree in the computing sciences. Upon completion  of the workshop activities, each participant-pair is required  to conduct a local follow-up mini-workshop to disseminate  materials and knowledge gained from the workshop. These  follow-up activities provide means for participants to interact  with colleagues in the same or neighboring institutions on a  person-to-person basis. The results of the project will be  presented by the participants in journal articles and  conference presentations.  ***",
