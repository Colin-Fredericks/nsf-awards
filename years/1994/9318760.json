 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scattered photons blur positron emission tomography images,  degrading image resolution, contrast, and quantitative accuracy.  No general correction for scattered photons has been found,  because the spatial distribution of scattered photons has yet to  be characterized.  The investigators study photon scattering based  on a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo computer program, developed at  Los Alamos National Laboratory, that can provide more information  than is readily measurable experimentally.  At present, this  powerful analysis technique requires enormous computational  resources.  The investigators evaluate the advantages of using a  massively parallel supercomputer to conduct the computer  experiments and also examine methods for improving the  computational efficiency.       Positron emission tomography (PET) is an emerging technology  with unique capability for imaging biochemical processes in the  human body.  The motivation for this research is that by  accounting for scattered photons, the diagnostic and research  value of PET data is improved.  Scattered photons is a significant  problem as 10 to 25 percent of detected photons are deflected from  their straight path prior to detection.  Moreover, the fraction of  photons is even greater, 40 to 50 percent, with the latest  generation of PET scanners that use three-dimensional imaging  capability to scan the entire body for cancer detection.  Even as  such, PET is more sensitive for cancer detection and can detect  cancer earlier than computed tomography (CT) and magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI).  PET images can show the vast changes in  sugar metabolism associated with cancerous tumors, whereas the  tumors must grow to a size sufficent to significantly alter the  normal tissue structure in order to be visualized by CT and MRI.  More generally, a proper scatter correction will benefit PET's  ability to detect and quantify the biochemical changes associated  with numerous diseases and particularly those of the heart and  brain.",
