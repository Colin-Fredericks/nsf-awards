Experiments will be conducted at  the University of Missouri Research Reactor (neutron diffaction)  and at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven (x-ray  diffraction).      Non-technical abstract:  A microscopic understanding of the  structure of organic films on metal surfaces is fundamental to the  technology of catalysis, lubrication, and adhesion.  Toward this  end, neutron and x-ray experiments are proposed to investigate the  layer-by-layer structure and growth of the simplest (rare gas)  films and then of more complex hydrocarbon films adsorbed on solid  surfaces.  Quasielastic neutron scattering will be analyzed to  determine the effect of molecular size and shape on the motion of  adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules.  Experiments will be conducted at  the University of Missouri Research Reactor and the National  Synchrotron Light Source.  ***",
