 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322437  Collins    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve  undergraduate students to gain research experience synthesis  and characterization techniques..  The students will be  participating in on-going research projects, including:  ionic exchange waveguides in soda-lime glass; manophase  clusters in insulator hosts by synthesizing and  characterizing the infrared reesponse and thermal properties  of dielectric materials confined to porous borosilicate  glass and alumina; crystal growth and characterization of  ternary telluride crystals; spectroscopic studies of glasses  for nonlinear optical applications; surface characterization  of modified surfaces of zinc-cadmium-telluride single  crystals using electron and ion-beam spectroscopies; and  photoconductivity studies of mercury iodide and lead iodide.      %%%      The goal of this program at Fisk University, a Historically  Black University, is to provide undergraduate students with  a successful research experience in on-going research  projects which will serve to teach students the scientific  approach to problem solving, as well as advanced methods of  materials synthesis and characterization, and motivate more  students to obtain professional/advanced degrees.  Increased  participation from other institutions will be emphasized and  where possible, students from different schools will be  paired together to foster a better learning environment.",
