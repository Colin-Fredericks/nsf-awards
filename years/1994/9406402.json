 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a continuation of a program of research in  elementary particle physics at the University of Chicago which  consists of three teams, each of which is playing a leading role  in one of the premier experiments in particle physics on a world-  wide scale:  (1) the CDF experiment at the 1.8 Tev proton-  antiproton collider at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois; (2) the  OPAL experiment that is one of the four detectors at LEP, a large  electron-positron collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and  (3) the KTEV experiment, which is being constructed for the new K  meson beam in the fixed target program at Fermilab.  The major  goal of CDF is to find the top quark, the last and heaviest of  the six components of hadronic matter in the Standard Model.  Opal is investigating the Z , the neutral intermediate vector  boson that, along with the photon, is central to the unification  of the electromagnetic forces and the force governing nuclear  beta decay.  KTEV is the next step in a program that is  attempting to understand the origin of CP symmetry violation  which in turn is thought to be the key to understanding the  asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe - a  necessary prerequisite to our existence.  The grant will support,  including the Principal Investigator, Professor Frank Merritt, 9  faculty members, 3 senior researchers, 9 postdoctoral research  associates, 17 graduate students and a majority of the technical  staff at the Enrico Fermi Institute.",
