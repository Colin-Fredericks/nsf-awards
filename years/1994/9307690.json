 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division  is supporting work by John W. Brady, Jr. at Cornell University on molecular  dynamics simulation of the conformations and dynamics of carbohydrates in  water solution. The work includes parameterization of a molecular dynamics  program especially designed to reproduce the factors controlling carbohydrate  conformational flexibility as affected by aqueous solvation.    Theoretical prediction of molecular structure by use of empirically derived  vibrational force and interaction constants has had much success both for  small molecules and in large DNA and protein studies.  Little effort has been  expended on the biologically significant family of carbohydrates, probably  because of the difficulties presented by their polyfunctional, highly  flexible structures.  Dr. Brady is attempting to extend the use of molecular  mechanics to these systems so that the technique can be used in studies of  cell binding, antigenicity, and viral attack.",
