Many modules are be  self-contained units whose main focus is a topic involving the  construction and analysis of a mathematical model using a  computer-based approach. Some modules are designed to shed new  light on traditional topics found in introductory ODE courses. The  material is being produced and field-tested by a Consortium of  seven institutions and is being made available to the authors of  the next generation of textbooks on differential equations. The  overall administration of this project is at Harvey Mudd College,  but the work will be done at all seven Consortium institutions:  Cornell University, Harvey Mudd College (CA), Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute, St. Olaf College (MN), Washington State  University, Stetson University, and West Valley College (CA).  Building on the network and experience accumulated during a  previous DUE grant on faculty enhancement, the Consortium is  broadening the scope of its newsletter C ODE E to publish  information about the new ODE course syllabus and modules before,  during and after test-runs.  In addition, C ODE E is disseminating  information about other ODE projects around the country. A textbook  publisher is adding additional support for workshops, computing  programming expertise, and evaluation.",
