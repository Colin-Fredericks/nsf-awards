 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harwood  9316257  Aromatic compounds are abundant in the environment as major  components of plant material (lignin) and as toxic by-products of  industrial activities.  Although we know something about how these  compounds are degraded, not much is understood about how bacteria  detect them in the environment.  Several genera of motile bacteria,  including Pseudomonas, have a strong attraction to aromatic acids.   We will study the molecular basis for chemotaxis to 4-  hydroxybenzoate and related aromatic acids in P. putida.  Recently,  a gene encoding an apparent chemoreceptor for these compounds was  cloned and sequenced.  The aromatic acid receptor is a membrane  protein with a structure different from other bacterial  chemoreceptors that have been described.  We will attempt to define  the chemosensory signaling domain of the aromatic acid  chemoreceptor by metagenesis, and then asses a possible role for  methylation and/or phosphorylation of the protein in chemosensory  signal transduction/adaptation. The genetic organization of the  region contiguous to the chemoreceptor gene will be determined, and  the regulatory requirements for chemoreceptor gene expression will  be defined.  Finally, genes that are required for P. putida  chemotaxis will be cloned and sequenced as a means of putting the  aromatic acid chemoreceptor \"in context\" with the central  chemotaxis machinery of this bacterium.  Since the chemoreceptor  protein for aromatic acids appears to have distinctive structural  characteristics, our studies will broaden current concepts about  mechanisms of bacterial chemoreception and sensory transduction.   %%%  Many environmental pollutants have a benzene ring as the main  structural constituent and are classified as aromatic compounds.   Bacteria have the ability to remove aromatic compounds from nature,  and there is great interest in harnessing this ability to develop  new methods for bioremediation to use in toxic waste management.   To effectively use bioremediation, we need to  understand how  bacteria degrade aromatic compounds, and we also need to know how  bacteria sense the compounds in nature in the first place.  This  project will examine the behavioral responses (chemotaxis) of  bacteria to aromatic compounds.  The bacteria we study are motile  and can detect these compounds as food in their surroundings.  Our  main experimental plan will be to develop mutants that don't sense  the compounds and then determine what is missing in the cell that  is responsible.  Once identified, we will clone and analyze the  gene(s).  If we can understand the mechanism(s) responsible for  attraction to aromatic compounds (which involves one or more  receptors), then it may be possible to devise strategies to recruit  bacteria to bioremediation sites.  ***",
