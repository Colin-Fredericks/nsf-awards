The experimental model for these studies is the humoral immune  response, wherein B cells with antigen specific sIg either proliferate and differentiate into  antibody-secreting plasma cells, or are functionally eliminated, depending on molecular size and  hapten valence of the antigen arrays.  Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated  profound suppression of specific antibody production in vivo.  Ongoing, high level T-cell  dependent anti-fluorescein (anti-Fl) IgM, IgG and IgE serum antibodies were reduced 90-99%  in adult mice by intraperitoneal administration of fluoresceinated dextran (Fl-Dex) of molecular  mass less than 100 kDa.  Recent studies with Fl-Dex of molecular mass 30 kDa demonstrated  that high affinity anti-Fl antibodies are preferentially eliminated.  In contrast, high molecular  weight (500 kDa) antigen-arrays are stimulatory at comparable hapten concentrations.  Using  adoptive transfer experiments, it was shown that suppression is dependent on antigen-array dose  and exposure time in the donor animals and can not be attributed to antigen carryover.  The  suppression affects the B-cell compartment selectively, as carrier-specific T-cell help remains  intact and splenic T cells from suppressed mice could not transfer suppression.  The molecular  basis of the observed suppression is currently being investigated using the anti-nitrophenyl (NP)  response as a model system.  The anti-NP response in C57BL/6 mice is characterized by a  highly restricted VH gene usage as well as a common somatic hypermutation pattern of higher  affinity anti-NP memory B cells.  Preliminary PCR analysis indicates that memory B cells with  the most common somatic hypermutation are eliminated from immunized animals by  administration of antigen-arrays.  The ma in goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that the  elimination of anti-NP memory B cells is the underlying mechanism of suppression.  For this  purpose PCR analysis will be optimized, quantitative Southern blot analysis employed and the  cloned VH amplification products from DNA isolated from NP hyperimmune and suppressed  animals will be sequenced.  The effect of antigen-arrays on a homogeneous B cell population  has been examined in mice transgenic for a phosphocholine (PC)-specific mu heavy chain.   Preliminary results indicate induction of apoptosis in these cells by PC-Dex of molecular mass  30 kDa.  This experimental system will be used as a model for exploratory studies of the  regulation of suppression.  Together, these findings indicate that, depending on the physical-  chemical characteristics of a multivalent ligand, interaction with B cell surface Ig may result  either in positive signaling (cell proliferation and differentiation) or negative signaling (cell  death).  The ability to induce deliberately, either stimulatory or suppressive signals in B cells by  manipulation of the molecular properties of the antigenic material can be used as a tool for the  study of the control of cellular function by extracellular multivalent ligand interacting with cell  surface receptors.  %%%  The mammalian immune response is highly regulated.  An immune response is started when a  foreign substance (antigen) binds to a specific receptor on the surface of a cell of the immune  system.  It is well known, however, that some antigens may either stimulate an immune response  or suppress an immune response, depending on the form in which they are administered and on  other factors not well understood.  A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that  determine whether a particular signal will result in stimulation or suppression of would be a  major contribution not only to our understanding of the regulation of immune function, but would  enhance our knowledge more generally of the mec hanisms by which cells respond to external  signals.  These investigators have preliminary data suggesting that antigens closely related  chemically may stimulate or suppress an immune response depending on certain defined  physical-chemical properties.  The goal of this research is to define more closely the mechanisms  by which differences in the molecular properties of an antigenic material lead to dramatic  differences in its effect.  The ability to induce deliberately, either stimulatory or suppressive  signals in cells by manipulation of the molecular properties of signal molecules can be used as  a tool for the more general study of the control of cellular function by extracellular signals  interacting with cell surface receptors.  ***",
