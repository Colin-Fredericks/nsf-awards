 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southwest Regional Center for Advanced Technological Education  is a collaboration among two-year colleges, four-year colleges and  universities, industries, and Tech Prep consortia in West Central  Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma to provide technical education in  a vast rural region through distance education. The project is  developing the infrastructure and the pedagogy to deliver many  technical courses through distance learning.  These include  existing courses in CAD/CAM/CIM which are being converted for  delivery via distance learning to two-year institutions and  secondary school sites.  Faculty at two-year colleges are working  with the Department of Education at Texas Technical College to  develop new instructional materials.  In particular, the Center is  developing new AAS programs in polymer technology and electro-  mechanical technology to complement needs of industry in the area.   Through an intensive effort at developing distance education and  electronic networking in the consortium, the Center is enabling the  member institutions to share their substantial resources, to  deliver quality instruction throughout the area, and to exchange  data and information rapidly and efficiently.  This \"center without  walls\" addresses the intertwined problems distance, expense, and  limited resources inherent in delivering advanced technological  education in such a large region.  Its findings, strategies,  tactics, materials, and methodologies constitute a significant  contribution to technical education in the nation.",
