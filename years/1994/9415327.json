The  purpose of the meeting is to bring together NSF and NIST grantees, as well as  researchers and managers from industry involved in collaborative projects, to review  the  results of the NSF initiative worth the same name, promote collaborations among  academic, NIST and industrial researchers, and review future research needs.  The  main topics of the meeting will be production of nano-sized particles, their  characterization, and applications.  The Conference will be organized into four parts:   Synthesis of Ultrafine Particles; Characterization of  Nanometer-scale Particulate  Materials; Industrial Perspective; and Future Research tends and Opportunities for  Collaborative Projects.  This is a timely meeting to evaluate the results of the  ENG/NSF initiative on Ultrafine Particle Engineering started in 1991, the opportunities  created at NIST by increased funding in this field is FY94, and new NSF and NIST  initiatives for collaboration with industry.  The proceedings will be published.  ***",
