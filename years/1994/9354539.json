 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354539  Henderson  The recruitment and retention of under-represented students  continues to be one of the primary challenges for higher education.  In the field of engineering, women are one of the most  under-represented groups, and women continue to have higher  attrition rates from engineering than their male peers. We have  identified a number of factors which contribute to the differential  attrition rates between men and women in engineering and have  developed, with preliminary funding from NSF, a novel,  collaborative laboratory course to explore \"how things work\". The  course, known as Engineering 25, provides freshman and sophomore  women engineering students with the opportunity to disassemble  equipment and construct devices to discover the underlying  engineering principles involved. The course is unique in that it  has, so far, been limited to women engineering students, uses  open-ended hands-on projects to stimulate scientific curiosity and  alleviate mechanical anxieties, it is based on a collaborative,  group exploration approach to learning, and it allows students to  explore issues of gender in science and engineering. In the  proposed project, we will further develop the course by offering  two sections of E25 which will be team-taught by the P.l.s, assess  the importance of the various course components (gender make-up,  tinkering, collaborative nature, and women's issues), and determine  the best way to institutionalize the course.  ***y",
