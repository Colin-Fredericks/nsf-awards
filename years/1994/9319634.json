 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319634  Pickard    Living organism possess internal biological clocks that control the  timing of many different biological processes.  Jet lag, ability to  concentrate, the way you respond to anesthesia are all affected by  daily or seasonal biological cycles.  Organisms isolated without  exposure to day:night cycles or other environmental time cues  continue to express rhythmic processes but with a period only  approximating 24 hours.  One striking day/night rhythmicity is the  synthesis and secretion of the hormone melatonin by the pineal  gland.  While it is clear that the pineal gland plays a major role  in the control of circadian activity rhythms, a major question is  whether single isolated cells also exhibit these 24 hour circadian  oscillations.  Dr. Pickard is establishing the technology to  accurately detect rhythmic fluctuations in hormone secretion from  single cells.  Using an in vitro preparation of dissociated pineal  cells in short-term culture, he is developing a reverse hemolytic  plaque assay to measure melatonin secretion in single isolated  cells.  This technology will enable Dr. Pickard to detect rhythmic  hormone secretion in the attamol range (10-18mol).  With this level  of sensitivity, he will establish the procedures to sequentially  assay melatonin secretion from the same isolated cells, thus  providing an answer to one of the major fundamental questions  regarding the organization of biological clocks.  ***",
