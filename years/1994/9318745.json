It will be used in part on the  approach of first finding the integrals of motion of the  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations describing the flow.  The development of a one-dimensional analytic model in which  the system of the ideal MHD equations is projected onto the  jet axis (the narrow-jet model) will be completed.  Using  these models an investigation of the relative importance of  different physical mechanisms on the collimation and  continuous acceleration of outflows from a variety of  astrophysical objects will be conducted.  The first  objective of this project is to find the allowed ranges of  values of the physical parameters at the jet origin (e.g.,  magnetic field strength, density, etc.) for an outflow to be  possible, and to study its evolution as the physical  conditions close to its source change continuously.  The  goal is to study the physics of the regions at the origin of  jets by using the information provided by observations of  the outflow along its length.  The second objective is to  examine the effects of different pressure distributions and  magnetic field strengths in the medium surrounding the  outflow on its collimation and evolution.  The goal is to  study the propagation and stability properties of outflows  in different environments.  Using appropriate values for the  parameters of interest or, when available, the limits  imposed by the observations of  specific outflows and the  environments, the theoretical results will be compared with  numerical simulations, and with outflows from active nuclei,  neutron stars, and prostars.  ***",
