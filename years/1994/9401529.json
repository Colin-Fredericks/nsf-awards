The focus will  be on the now classical problem of Arhangel'skii and Tall:  Are  normal locally compact metacompact spaces paracompact?   Because  of recent progress by the principal investigator, a solution to  this problem may be near.  Another set of problems revolves  around the failure of the Lindelof property in products, and  includes Michael's long-standing question concerning the  existence in ZFC of of a Lindelof space whose product with a  complete separable metric space is not Lindelof.  Yet a third set  of problems involves extensions of the PI's recent solutions to  problems of Watson, and Dow and Porter, on closed partitions of  compact Hausdorff spaces.       Set-theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical  disciplines which have common turn-of-the-century roots.  Set-  theory provides a framework upon which all of mathematics can be  based.  Objects of study in topology include familiar spaces such  as the plane and ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and  their subsets, as well as much more abstract spaces.  Pioneering  work of Goedel and Cohen led to the realization that some long-  standing topological questions could not be solved assuming only  the standard axioms of set-theory.  It is illuminating to  determine whether or not topological propositions are independent  of the standard axioms in this sense, and if so, what further  axioms are necessary to settle them.  This project involves just  such questions, concerning basic topological properties and  constructions, including product spaces, partitions, and  refinements of coverings.  Questions to be studied include ones  which date back to the 1960's and have been worked on by many  experts with only partial success so far.  Significant recent  progress by the principal investigator indicates that a complete  solution to some of these may now be at hand.  The new tech niques  involved in their solution are likely to be applicable to a wide  variety of other problems.  ***",
