However, their behavior in this earthquake was  clearly unsatisfactory.    The aim of this project is to critically investigate a number of  bridge abutments (damaged and undamaged) located in the area  affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake using the ground  motions measured in this earthquake.  These investigations  address the following issues:  (1) Why did some of the abutments  behave poorly and some not?  (2) Is guidelines, and the modified  version used b the principal investigators in their recent study  adequate?  (3) Was there any unexpected contribution from deck-  abutment interaction forces?  (4)  Are there any anomalies  between characteristics of Northridge motions and other existing  excitation records (e.g. those used in the recent study by the  proposer) with respect to their effect on abutment behavior?  (5)  did higher than normal vertical acceleration component present in  the Northridge excitations play a role?  ***",
