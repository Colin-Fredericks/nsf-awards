 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400615  Temam    This project will focus on the study of the equations of fluid  mechanics and turbulence as well as on the development of  efficient numerical codes for the solution of these equations.   Part of the project will involve the study of turbulence, based  on a dynamical systems approach; according to dynamical systems  theory the permanent regime for a turbulent flow is  mathematically represented by an attractor that is a compact set  in the phase space.  It is hoped that the study of this attractor  can improve understanding of the physics of turbulent flows.    The approximation of attractors by smooth finite dimensional  manifolds called Approximate Inertial Manifolds (AIMs) is part of  this study.  On the one hand these manifolds are related to the  concept of slow manifold used in meteorology for data  assimilation.  Used from a different point of view in  computational fluid dynamics they lead, on the other hand, to new  multi-resolution algorithms and to methods of data compression in  scientific computing.  Thus, it is believed that approximations  of this attractor can lead to efficient new algorithms for the  numerical simulation of turbulence.  Finally, a significant part  of the effort will be devoted to problems related to climate and  global changes.  Various models for climate will be investigated  from the mathematical and computational points of view in order  to see how they are connected and what are their domains of  validity.  Such models include the primitive equations of the  atmosphere, the primitive equations with vertical viscosity, and  the geostrophic and quasi geostrophic equations.  Models of this  type will be studied for the atmosphere and for the ocean  separately and also for the Coupled system of Atmosphere and  Ocean (CAO).     The understanding of the equations of fluid mechanics and  turbulence as well as the development of efficient numerical  codes for the solution of these equations are challenging  problems of considerable importance in p articular in industry or  for studies in meteorology or global climate change.  The aims  for this project are three fold: (i) to explore what can be  learned about these problems from the theoretical and  computational viewpoints, using the dynamical systems approach to  turbulence; (ii) to develop new efficient computational  algorithms taking into account the physics of turbulence and well  adapted to the current evolution of large scale computing towards  parallel computing; and (iii) to devote special attention to the  problems related to the study of climate and global changes.",
