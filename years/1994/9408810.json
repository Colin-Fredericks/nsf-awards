Specifically, our goals are threefold:  (1) Development and  construction of new highly efficient photorefractive polymeric  devices for holographic storage and image processing applications.   Under our current NSF grant we have obtained the highest  diffraction efficiency (approx. 34%) of any polymer so far.  A  respectable two-beam coupling gain (30 cm-1), with net gain of (6  cm-1, was also obtained.  We will optimize these devices by  improving the photogeneration efficiency and the electro-optic  effect.  (2) Device physics of electroluminescent (EL) pi-  conjugated polymers.  Our goals for this part of the project are to  understand the mechanism of electroluminescence in polymeric  materials like poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and related pi-  conjugated polymers through combined experiment/theory studies of  the electronic structure, nonradiative decay processes, excited  state absorption, and optical gain investigation.  (3) Multiexciton  effects in low-dimensional organics.  The PI's have recently  reported the discovery of multiexciton chains in a quasi-one-  dimensional mixed-stack charge transfer organic solid and of  biexcitons in PPV.  These results revealed new excited state  absorptions to higher multiexciton states.  The PI's believe that  such multiexciton states would occur in other quasi-1-d materials  like the segregated stack CT solids.  ***",
