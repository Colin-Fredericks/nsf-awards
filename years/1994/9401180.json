Part of the project is to derive results about the existence of  wavelets and MRA's, quality of the wavelets and MRA's, and  summability results for wavelet expansions. In the abstract  context, one may bring to bear the powerful and modern theories  of unitary representations, von Neumann algebras, etc. Another  part of the project is to use abstract theory to describe the  notion of windowed Fourier transforms, which notion can also be  formulated in terms of unitary representation theory and  non-commutative harmonic analysis.       Research on Wavelet Theory is an incredibly active area of  mathematics. This is due mainly to the powerful applications to  important areas involving high performance computing such as data  compression and pattern recognition. Usually wavelet theory is  approached using the real variable techniques of harmonic  analysis. This project is aimed at formulating Wavelet Theory in  an abstract mathematical setting. Powerful abstract mathematics  can then be applied to get automatic existence and convergence  theorems about wavelets. New insights into the fundamental nature  of wavelets will occur. In a reciprocal manner, the salient  features of wavelets will be reflected to produce new concepts in  abstract mathematics.  ***",
