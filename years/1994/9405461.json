 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405461  Mijovic    This award supports cooperative research between Jovan Mijovic,  Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, and Francesco Bellucci,  University of Naples, Italy.  The subject of their research is  dielectric studies of reactive polymers and polymeric glasses.   The collaboration takes advantage of the respective strengths of  the U.S. and Italian researchers. Dr. Mijovic's expertise is in  the areas of chemorheology of reactive systems and structural  relaxations in the glassy state.  Dr. Bellucci's research has  covered the fundamentals of transport of water, gas, and ions  through various media, and the use of electrochemical impedance  spectroscopy as a fundamental probe of dielectric polarization.  Current interest in dielectric properties of polymers reflects  their growing use in printed board circuitry, electronic  interconnect devices, microwave assemblies for radars, solid  state batteries and fuel cells.    The principal objective of the proposed work is to investigate  reactive systems from the moment they are formulated, through  their reactive stage, characterized by the formation of a three-  dimensional network, and during subsequent behavior of these  networks in the glassy state.  The concept of monitoring the  entire history of the network response in a system of precisely  defined chemical composition, from its inception, has not been  explored.  A comprehensive picture of dielectric properties of  reactive systems is expected to emerge from this study.  * * *",
