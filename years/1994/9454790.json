 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454790  Laffey    The Missouri Supporting Teachers (MOST) project is a nine-month grant to a consortium of  statewide stakeholders to plan a program of educational reform and technological innovation.   The consortium holds a commitment to an integrated teacher support system and network  infrastructure designed around the needs of teachers implementing an integrated math and  science curriculum through problem-based learning and computational science techniques.  The  MOST project will support the needed systemic change by planning the implementation of:         (1) a network infrastructure which creates a community of educators and leverages       knowledge and experience across the community,         (2) an electronic teacher support system designed around the practices and challenges of       teaching and learning, and         (3) a consortium of change agents with a cohesive vision and a common set of tools for       supporting teacher professionalization and school restructuring.    The planning grant will support four main activities.  The first is to extend and articulate a  powerful model of problem-based learning and computational science being developed in the  Lee's Summit School District, as well as to learn from other projects which are exploring and  advancing these key principles and methods.  Second, preliminary designs for the electronic  teacher support system and network infrastructure will be developed and prototyped, in order  to specify the requirements for implementation and maintenance.  Third, the consortium of  stakeholders will be extended and elaborated, so that a pathway is drawn for including all major  constituents.  And fourth, the planning grant will enable the development and articulation of a  strategic and tactical plan which can draw support for the long-term efforts.    The restructuring of the teaching/learning process to achieve meaningful learning of math and  science as exemplified by problem-based learning requires a radical reconceptualization of the   way teachers are developed and supported.  The MOST project is well situated to build and test  a powerful and innovative model of teacher professionalization which is implemented in the  field, supported by a community of practitioners, and enabled by a technology infrastructure.   The MOST project leverages (1) Missouri's continuing commitment to building a network  infrastructure for schools and the existing MOREnet services, (2) the exciting work and  experience of teachers in Lee's Summit, (3) a base of research and development in electronic  support systems, and (4) the commitment of key statewide stakeholders.",
