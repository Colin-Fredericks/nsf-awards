In addition,  these techniques cannot be as resource-demanding as those on  computational fluid dynamics.  This proposal concerns the  development of an approach that promises real-time performance  while providing physical authenticity in modeling the 3D  behaviors of the surface of fluids.  THe approach is based on  solving the full 2D incompressible, viscous, Navier-Stokes  equations using a staggered marker-and-cell, to yield the  pressure and 2D velocity throughout the modeled 2D finite  difference grid.  Then, the computed pressures are used to raise  the surface of fluid, thus providing the 3D effects and behaviors  pf fluid flow, without the exorbiant expense of full 3D  computation.  As our initial results show, this approach is  capable of achieving realistic real-time fluid simulation on a  commonly available workstation such as a Silicon Graphics Indigo.  Based on our promising intital results, research is proposed to  develop this appproach further.  To make this approach more  useful, we are proposing to improve its flexibility, its  stability, and its capabilities.  We are also proposing to use  the approach in developing algorithms that model blending of  different fluids, fluids, that slosh in moving containers, and  modeling liquid metals.    ***",
