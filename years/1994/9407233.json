 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407233  Roden  Anaerobic microbial processes in the decomposition of sediment organic matter , and methane is typically the dominant end-product of anaerobic metabolism in wetland sediments.  Methane is the second-most important atmospheric \"greenhouse\" gas, and it is crucial that accurate estimates of current and projected rates of methane production and emission to the atmosphere be developed for global climate change evaluations.  Factors which control regional variations in methane production and emissions are important to process-level ecological research.  Several recent studies of freshwater wetlands in the southeastern U.S. have indicated that non-methanogenic carbon mineralization processes account a large part of carbon metabolism.   The proposed research examines the hypothesis that competition by non-methanogenic anaerobic microorganisms for substrates of anaerobic metabolism can divert carbon metabolism away from methane production and thereby suppress methane release from freshwater wetland sediments.  In particular, microbial iron oxide reduction may be an important carbon decomposition pathway in the typically iron-rich, sulfate poor freshwater wetlands found throughout the southeastern U.S..  A wetland in the Talleasdega National Forest in Alabama will be used as a model system to examine this hypothesis.  Microbial iron oxide reduction and iron cycling processes will be examined in two locations, the sediment surface , where iron oxides are deposited or formed by reaction with oxygen introduced from the atmosphere or overlying water;  and the rhizosphere, where iron oxide layers form in association with transport of oxygen through aquatic plant roots (for respiratory metabolism) into the sediment.  Time course laboratory studies of gas exchange, dissolved and solid phase chemical distributions, and rates of microbial metabolism will be conducted in artificially constructed sediment cores with and without emergent aquatic plants.  The results of these laboratory studies will be  compared to analogous field measurements in order to assess the significance of iron oxide reduction in anaerobic carbon mineralization, and to quantify its influence on methane production and flux to the atmosphere directly and through emergent aquatic vegetation.  While advancing knowledge of carbon cycling pathways in the Talledega wetland, the research will also furnish a base of information to which the studies of anaerobic metabolism and regulation of methane release from different types of wetland ecosystems can be compared.",
