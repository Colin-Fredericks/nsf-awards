 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400905  Taylor       Work supported by this award will focus on mathematical  problems arising in the theory of partial differential  equationsnd their applications.  The plans include research on  three overlapping areas: applications of microlocal analysis to  nonlinear partial differential equations, inverse scattering  problems and diffraction of waves by a boundary.  The first  extends early results on the action of pseudodifferential  operators and includes further development of Morrey space  analysis and applications.  Work will also continue  in establishing that smooth solutions to various nonlinear  evolution equations do not break down, provided one has a bound  on certain Zygmund space norms.  A program to stabilize in an  optimal fashion a class of inverse obstacle problems will be  carried out. Work will be done in passing from estimates for the  linearized problem to the true inverse problem via a combination  of techniques from microlocal analysis and a variant of  Moser's method for treating hard implicit function theorems.   The research on diffraction of solutions to linear wave equations  by a boundary represents a long-running collaboration with  R. Melrose.  This work also includes investigations into  phenomena in nonlinear geometrical optics in cases involving  diffraction.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
