 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453702  Lancaster    Project Women in Computer Science (WCS) is a multi-faceted, instructional and motivational  program involving both university faculty and corporate personnel to recruit additional women  students to Bowling Green State University's undergraduate computer science program.  Project  WCS offers several instructional and motivational activities:  1) recruitment activities designed  specifically to encourage freshmen and sophomore college women to consider computer science  as a major, 2) a mentoring program which involves both faculty and business representatives  serving as mentors, 3) formal preparation for cooperative education work assignments, and 4)  workshops for computer science faculty and business representatives on gender-related issues that  impact women's success in computer science programs and computing careers.  The project  components are built upon current understanding of social, learning, and teaching factors which  facilitate the interest, motivation, and achievement of women in science fields.    Both computer science faculty and computing professionals from business and industry will be  actively involved in working with the participants in a number of ways, including both academic  and corporate mentors for each participant.  This integrated use of mentoring, cooperative  education, and university/corporate interaction to increase the participation of women in the field  is unique.  A Corporate Advisory Board (state-wide) will be directly involved with the project  co-directors in all aspects of the project.    ***",
