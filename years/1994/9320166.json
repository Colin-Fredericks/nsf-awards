 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320166  Davis  Engineers sometimes claim that their status as employees denies  them the autonomy necessary to be true professionals.  The  purpose of this research is to provide a framework for answering  the question whether and when engineers have enough autonomy in  the workplace to act as professionals.  To provide this  framework, the research will bring recent philosophical analysis  of moral autonomy to bear on the question of professional  autonomy, will draw relevant material from earlier work on the  autonomy of engineers in the workplace to examine the conditions  for professional autonomy there, and will sketch programs of  empirical research that might build on these results to answer  questions about the actual professional autonomy of engineers.   The research aims to develop a position on professions and  autonomy that can pass three tests:  It must be consistent with  working in a large organization; it must be empirically testable:  and it must be useful in evaluating whether different kinds of  work organization will impede or enhance professional autonomy.   This research contributes to three fields, the sociology of  engineering, the philosophy of professions, and engineering  ethics.  A better developed conception of professional autonomy  may help with other practical questions in the ethics of  engineering and science.  Current conceptions of moral autonomy  applied to the workplace do not help us to understand either the  moral implications of professional constraints or the general  consistency of corporate organization and professional  responsibility.  Because the proposed project would help us to  understand engineers in context, it should contribute as well to  overall understanding of what engineers do.  Results will be  disseminated through presentations and articles.    ***",
