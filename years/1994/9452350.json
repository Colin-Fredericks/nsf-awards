The organic chemistry laboratory sequence is  being remodeled to take this fact into account.  This course is  populated primarily by biology majors and chemistry majors.   Students are working individually, but sharing their results within  a group of eight students.  The research projects for this lab  sequence include the isolation and identification of secondary  plant metabolites, a study of the Claisen-Schmitt formation of  chalcones, and an investigation of substitution reactions.  These  experiments were chosen in consultation with the biology department  in order to emphasize the important of chemistry to the study of  biology.  The students working on these projects are using  instrumentation presently available in the department as well as a  GC-MS and an HPLC.  Both of these instruments are greatly enhancing  the students' laboratory experience.  In order to provide further  connections between biology and chemistry, both instruments are  also being used in the plant biology courses.",
