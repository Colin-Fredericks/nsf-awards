 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451557  Lawson  The Mathematics Department at Tulane University is integrating  computer use into its core applied mathematics and linear algebra  courses. These courses are fundamental to the science and  engineering curriculum. The applied math course is required for all  engineering and most science students, and the linear algebra  course is required for math majors and taken by many engineering  and science students. In both courses the role of the software is  to enhance understanding of the basic concepts. Students will be  able to use the software in subsequent science and engineering  courses and in the workplace. The applied math course uses phase  plane analysis to help students understand the qualitative behavior  of nonlinear systems arising from a variety of models. It also uses  Mathematica to allow symbolic and numerical analysis of  differential equations. The linear algebra course uses Mathematica  and Matlab to achieve mastery of crucial algorithms such as LU, QR,  and singular value dicompositions as well as provide numerical and  symbolic exploration of motivating examples. Both classes will make  fundamental use of computing as an integral tool in each class  meeting, involving the students more actively in the course. Group  activities will play a key role in both classes. Dissemination will  occur through publications as well as presentations at conferences.",
