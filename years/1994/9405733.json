 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405733  Kustu  The NIFA protein (nifA gene product) is required to activate transcription of the nitrogen fixation (nif)  operons in a wide variety of free-living and symbiotic bacteria belonging to the large gram-negative  division proteobacteria. To activate, NIFA binds to enhancer-like sites approximately 100 bp upstream  of nif promoters and allows RNA polymerase (alpha54-holoenzyme form) to denature the DNA strands  around a transcriptional startsite -- that is, to isomerize from closed to open complexes. We succeeded  in purifying the insoluble NIFA protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae as a fusion to the soluble  maltose-binding protein (MBP) and in demonstrating its binding to enhancer-like sites in vitro for  the first time. MBP-NIFA activated transcription by alpha54- holoenzyme in a purified system and  could be shown to catalyze the isomerization of closed complexes between this polymerase and the  nifH promoter to open complexes. Activation and open complex formation required a nucleoside  triphosphate with a hydrolyzable, beta-gamma bond but we were unable to demonstrate hydrolysis  directly because we could not remove contaminating hydrolytic activities from the preparation. We  also purified an MBP fusion to just the central catalytic domain of NIFA, in the absence of its  DNA-binding domain, and released the central domain in a soluble, active form by proteolytic  cleavage of the fusion protein . The released central domain could activate transcription from solution,  a property so far unique among enhancer-binding proteins, and had the expected ability to hydrolyze  nucleotides.  A purified renatured form of the NIFL protein, which is known to inhibit NIFA activity in vivo in  response to the presence of molecular oxygen or combined nitrogen, inhibited transcriptional  activation by both MBP-NIFA and the central domain of NIFA. Since NIFL did not inhibit nucleotide  hydrolysis by the central domain, we postulate that it interferes with protein-protein contact  between this domain  of NIFA and alpha54-holoenzyme. Our major goals for the next grant period are:  1) to obtain NIFL preparations with better activity; 2) to determine whether NIFL inhibits NIFA  activity by interacting with NIFA stoichiometrically or covalently modifying it; 3) to study  protein-protein interactions between NIFL and NIFA and between NIFA and polymerase; and 4) to  determine the mechanism by which NIFL senses molecular oxygen. The studies are of interest with  respect to understanding the interaction of enhancerbinding proteins with the* target RNA polymerases  and with regard to understanding the various forms of regulation that occur in response to molecular  oxygen. We hope that they will eventually be of use to others in increasing the efficiency of biological  nitrogen fixation.  %%%  Crop productivity is often limited by the availability of nitrogen in a fornm suitable for synthesis of  proteins and other large molecules characteristie of living organisms. (certain bacteria, eithel alone  or in partnership with plants, have the ability lo convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to  ammonia, a nitrogen fertilizer, in a process called biological nitrogen fixation.  We are studying the NIFA protein, a major regulator of biological nitrogen fixation. Characterizing  NlFA will contnbute to understanding, how organisms decode palticu ar portions of their DNA  under appropriate conditions and may help to improve the biological productivn of nitrogen  felti1izer. A major goal for the next grant period is to understand how the function of the NIFA  protein is poisoned by oxygen gas in the air.  ***",
