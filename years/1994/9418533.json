 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418533  Rajala    The North Carolina State University Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Advanced Computing and Communication is  becoming a multi-university Center with the addition of a research  site at Duke University.  Four companies are becoming part of the  Center inconjunction with Duke University becoming a research site.    The research agenda of the new multi-site Center will address high-  speed networking, reliable and fault-tolerant systems, digital  communication systems, distributed systems, and algorithms and  digital image processing algorithms.    The researchers are well qualified to perform the Center's research  program.    The Center is being co-funded with Dr. Yechelzkel Zalcstein in the  Division of Computer and Computation Research.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be  awarded $55,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.   This includes $5,000 for an evaluator for the Center.  Funding for  the second year is to be at the same level amount.  Funding for  years three through five will be at $30,000 per year (including  $5,000 for an evaluator.)    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
