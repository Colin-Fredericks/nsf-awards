 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404358  Garofalo       This award supports mathematical research on problems  arising in the field of partial differential equations.  The work  is concerned with three main projects.  The first concerns unique  continuation for a class of subelliptic operators modelled on the  Baouendi-Grushin operator and absence of embedded eigenvalues for  such operators, or for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group  or, in general, on a nilpotent homogeneous Lie group.  The second  line of investigation will study optimal regularity of solutions  of nonlinear subelliptic equations which arise as Euler equations  of the Sobolev functional in the nonquadratic case,  isoperimetric and Sobolev inequalities, reactions between  harmonic and surface measure for Lipschitz domains on the  Heisenberg group and Wieners criterion of Kolmogorov's equation.   Work will also be done on symmetry for partial differential  equations and the Pompieu problem, on a conjecture of DeGiorgi  connected with flow by mean curvature, extremal functions in the  Sobolev or the isoperimetric inequality for the Baouendi-Grushin  operator or the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg and the  generalized torsion problem.   Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
