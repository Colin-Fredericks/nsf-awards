The theme is \"Selected Topics in Field  Theory, High Energy Physics and Cosmology.\"   Its aim is to: 1) bring together some of the  brightest young physicists from the BCSPIN  countries of South Asia, 2) present the most  recent advances in their fields of research and  3) emphasize the rich and exciting frontiers  that straddle Field Theory, High Energy Physics  and Cosmology.  The topics covered include:  Introduction to Advanced Topics in Field  Theory, Anomaly and Topology in Field Theory,  Tests of the Standard Model Particle Physics,  Supersymmetry, Frontiers in  Cosmology/Astrophysics, including Structure  Formation, Black Hole Physics and Related  Areas.       Scope:  The establishment of a school of  excellence will contribute to the growth of  science in Asia and will greatly strengthen the  scientific potential of young researchers  there.    Without the opportunity given by a  school of this kind, it is unlikely that the  majority of the students would ever have  exposure to such outstanding scientists.   Previous schools have been highly regarded and  the best students will no doubt eventually  enrich American science.      ***",
