 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316625  Zinder  Our studies of the bacteriophage f1 are concentrated on two areas  of phage biology, its assembly and its interaction with its E. coli  host.  Both of these areas bring to the fore the two fundamental  biological problems for which the study of virus can be especially  useful.  These involve questions about the assembly of complex  structures and interaction of multi-protein and nucleic acid  structures, and inquiries into the basic aspects of the higher  order elements of cell metabolism.  Very little is known about the  facilitated assembly of complex structures at the molecular level  (as distinct from the self assembly of most bacteriophage and of  the ribosome).  The assembly and extrusion of this simple phage  involves five membrane associated coat proteins, a ssDNA-binding  protein complex, and two morphogenetic proteins encoded by the  phage and one (thioredoxin) encoded by the host.  We are  particularly interested in the role of the morphogenetic genes,  since we have only fragmentary information on how they carry out  their role.  One of these morphogenetic gene products induces  expression of a host operon containing five genes; a deeper  understanding of the mechanism by which this induction takes place,  and of the role of these gene products in the normal life of E.  coli, should shed light on the mechanism by which f1 pIV, the  morphogenetic protein, acts to promote phage assembly and extrusion  from the cell.  This protein is related to others found in many  species of bacteria, where it is part of a general macromolecular  transport system required for the export of other protein,  including virulence factors.  %%%  A new method, phage display, of selecting DNA sequence which encode  proteins, including immunoglobulins, that bind with high affinity  to desired target is increasingly being used.  Applications include  the generation of what are effectively human monoclonal antibodies,  catalytic antibodies, hormones that bind receptors with higher than  native a ffinity, and many other proteins of general interest.   Filamentous phage are extensively (almost exclusively) used as  carriers of both the DNA encoding these proteins and, on the same  particle, the protein itself.   Since no new method is without its  technical problems, there is keen interest in both the academic and  industrial sector in the structure, life cycle, and assembly of the  filamentous phages.  Some of the experiments in this research deal  with expanding the utility of phage display.  ***",
