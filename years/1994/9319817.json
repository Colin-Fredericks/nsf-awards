However, its use is limited unless it can be  developed as a genetic system also. It is proposed that this  project will demonstrate the feasibility of using zebra fish as  experimental genetic organisms. Mutations that increase genomic  instability, e.g. by increasing the rate of chromosome loss or  mutation, are expected to increase the frequency of loss of  heterozygosity. That loss can be used as a phenotypic screen in  that a recessive pigment mutation which can be quantitatively  assessed by screening the number of nonpigmented cells in an  otherwise pigmented retinal epithelium of three-day old unhatched  embryos can be used as a tracer. The mutant candidates can be  generated as the progeny of mutagenized gol-1+ males and non-  mutagenized gol-1(b1) females. The recessive mutant screen proposed  involves inspection under a dissecting microscope of the progeny.  Clutches of progeny yielding a potential aggregate of more than  100,000 cells will be scored in situ under a dissecting microscope  at three days. A simpler dominant screen will be evaluated in  parallel primarily with males after standard crosses.  When  possible, complementation analysis of recessive mutations,  outcrosses and quantitation of the effect of mutations will be  begun.   %%%  The feasibility of developing zebra fish as useful genetic  organisms will be determined. The strains necessary for the  projected screen for mutant progeny will be generated. Genomic  instability mutants, both dominant and recessive, will be  generated. When possible, the mutants will be characterized and  karyotyping will be attempted.  ***",
