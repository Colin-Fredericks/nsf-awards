Bose International  Centenary Meeting:  Bose and 20th Century Physics, Calcutta, Dec.  30 - Jan. 5, 1994.  The meeting will gather together some two  dozen leading physicists from the U.S. and Europe to honor one of  India's legendary scientists and one of the most prominent  scientists of this century.  The organizers are K.C. Wali,  Syracuse University and C.K. Majumdar, the National Bose Centre  for Basic Sciences.  Financial supporters include the Indian  Department of Science and Technology, the Royal Society of  London, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics,Trieste.   Bose made outstanding contributions in the development of quantum  theory, in low and high energy nuclear physics, statistical  mechanics, superconductivity/ superfluidity, quantum optics,  statistics, and organic chemistry.  The program is of very high  quality.  An eminent array of speakers will lecture on topics in  particle physics, quantum optics and quantum mechanics, general  relativity, statistics, condensed matter physics, chemistry.   Scope:  This meeting is an important international event that has  attracted scientists from diverse disciplines from all parts of  the world.  A large contingent of scientists from Europe, Japan  and the developing countries will be present, plus leading Indian  physicists, science policy makers and students.  Considering the  international standing of the invited speakers, this is an  exceptional opportunity for the exchange of ideas on topics of  current interest.  The event will be beneficial for Indian and  non-Indian participants.   ***",
