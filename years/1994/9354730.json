 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354730  Zheng      A recent survey conducted by the author indicated the need for a  data communications and networks text covering fundamental theory  and new technologies along with software project topics in a  multiplatform distributed environment for computer science and  software engineering students in undergraduate level.  Traditional  textbooks do not take advantage of recent development in multimedia  and hypertext technologies. Through the use of these technologies  students are able to interact with computers in the pursuit of  knowledge at their own rate, following their own particular  interests within the field.  Various media, digitized still and  motion images, and sounds, provide a more complete and lasting  access to the subject matter.  The techniques of hypertext and  multimedia are just beginning to be realized in education.  This  project develops a text in this format as a prototype for texts.   This project also develops a cost-effective network laboratory  prototype, to provide software and supplementary teaching materials  including a question set and project topics with sample solutions  in a multiplatform environment.  The goal of the curriculum is to  engage students actively in the learning process and, through the  projects developed, to promote critical thinking, problem solving  skills, and creativity.  ***y",
