 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mt. Hood Community College (MHCC) Mathematics Division is  developing, implementing and disseminating a comprehensive  Application-based, Technology supported, One-track Mathematics  Curriculum (ATO) for all students (baccalaureate prep and technical  prep).The four levels of study incorporate the National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics Curriculum and Evaluation Standards  (NCTM) and the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills  (SCANS) recommendations.ATO responds to the education reform  movement in mathematics while addressing: the lack of appropriate  course materials targeting community college students; the lack of  a framework to train adjunct mathematics instructors (on which the  community college heavily relies); and, the lack of articulated  curriculum for the same level of mathematics taught in middle  schools, high schools, community colleges and four-year schools.   The following are the three objectives for development and  implementation of the ATO Program.OBJECTIVE 1. Develop and publish  course materials for Levels II and III (applications oriented  algebra) of ATO: a textbook for each level that fully integrates  the use of technology; and, a hands-on activities and real-world  interdisciplinary applications supplement.OBJECTIVE 2. Develop a  framework for the ongoing staff development of community college  adjunct mathematics faculty to enable them to effectively deliver  a coherent mathematics curriculum.OBJECTIVE 3. Develop in  collaboration with middle schools and high schools in the community  college district an articulated coherent mathematics curriculum  that addresses content-based proficiency assessment strategies, and  supports uniform implementation of the NCTM Standards in  mathematics education.Methods to accomplish these objectives build  on previously-established team efforts at MHCC, partnerships with  industry, and collaborative activities with other schools including  middle schools, high schools, and four-year colleges.Northwest  Region al Educational Laboratory is instrumental in the evaluation  of the project, along with the Program Management  Evaluation/Assessment Advisory Team.",
