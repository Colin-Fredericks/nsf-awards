The  role of the ribosome and the chaperones in the folding process will  be evaluated.  Three enzymes (bacterial dihydrofolate reductase,  chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, and mammalian rhodanese) will  be synthesized by coupled transcription/translation with ribosomes,  tRNA and enzymes derived from Escherichia coli in a cell-free  system.  Folding of the nascent peptides as they are elongated by  the sequential, C-terminal addition of amino acids to peptidyl-tRNA  on ribosomes will be monitored by florescence techniques.   Acquisition of enzymatic activity will be used as a measure of  correct folding into the native conformation.  For studies  involving florescence, a fluorophore such as coumarin will be  incorporated at a specific site in the nascent peptide from the  corresponding amino acyl-tRNA derivative, such as N(coumarin)-Mer-  tRNA for incorporation of coumarin at the N-terminus of the nascent  protein.  Special emphasis will be given to testing the hypothesis,  and to a determination of what part of this folding, if any, takes  place within a tunnel or cavity in the large ribosomal subunit.   The role of chaperones in folding of the three enzymes also will be  studied.  %%%  A detailed understanding of the molecular forces and processes that  are involved in folding of a linear peptide into the specific,  three dimensional conformations of a protein in its native state is  one of the most fundamental and challenging problems currently  under intensive investigation in molecular biology.  This process  is crucial for the formation of active, soluble enzymes rather than  aggregation of newly formed proteins into insoluble, intractable  mass of denatured protein as occurs with egg white when it is  cooked.  An understanding of the process is critical for the  rational design and synthesis of new enzymes.  Understanding of the  folding  process would be a large step toward developing the theory  and procedure that will make it possible to produce new protein  catalysis for research, medicine and industry, many of which may  not occur in living cells.  Largely because of the inherent  problems and technical difficulties, most studies have focused on  refolding of proteins from their denatured state. Our approach is  fundamentally different.  Proteins are synthesized linearly on  ribosomes by the sequential addition of amino acids from their N-  terminal to C-terminal ends.  We use florescence techniques to  monitor folding of nascent proteins as they are formed.  Techniques  have been developed by which we covalently attached a fluorophore  to a specific amino acid as aminoacyl-tRNA then incorporated the  derivatized amino acid at a unique point in a nascent protein as it  is formed on a ribosome.  Fluorescence from the fluorophore is used  to monitor synthesis and folding of the nascent protein.  The role  of the ribosome itself and \"chaperone\" proteins in the folding  process will be studied.  ***",
