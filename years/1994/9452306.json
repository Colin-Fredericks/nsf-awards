What were once highly specialized procedures in  molecular biology have become standard; the polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) is utilized as often as electrophoresis and has  substituted in many cases for the CsCl DNA extraction technique for  preparation of small amounts of DNA. This project requests funding  to: 1) add the PCR protocols to the laboratory by acquiring a  thermal cycler; and 2) add computer hardware and software to design  PCR primers, to allow for entry of DNA sequences directly into the  computer with the current sequencing gel reader, and analyze and  compare sequences with those in databases such as GenBank. These  additions to the laboratory will allow women science students to  have direct experience with techniques that are becoming standard  in research laboratories, graduate school, and medicine.",
