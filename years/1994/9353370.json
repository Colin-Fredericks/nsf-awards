The teachers will be mainly  middle-school teachers (Grades 6-8), joined by some high school  teachers (Grades 9-12).  All will be selected through a highly  competitive process and will attend a two week summer program with  a follow-up during the academic year and the following summer.  All  participants are expected to carry out in-service activities.   Based upon the experience of earlier projects it is anticipated  that more than 1500 teachers will be impacted by the project.  In  addition to the teacher enhancement component the project develops  modules in oceanographic science utilizing the most up-to-date  information prepared by experts in the field.  Based upon these  teaching materials an instructional resource manual, including  classroom ready activities will be produced and distributed  directly to teachers.",
