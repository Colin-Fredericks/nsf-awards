This  equipment will allow us to modernize the laboratory for our  Genetics course and to introduce a new Molecular Genetics  Laboratory. It will also allow us to use polymerase chain reaction  experiments in courses and undergraduate research in the Biology  and Biochemistry programs at Hollins College.  The Biology and  Chemistry Departments have long and successful records of preparing  students for graduate study in biology, biochemistry, medicine and  related fields. This success is due in part to our strong emphasis  on undergraduate research. We are well equipped in many areas, but  our lack of sufficient modern equipment for biotechnology results  in serious deficiencies in our program. In order to provide our  students with instruction and research experience at a high  experimental level, we need to secure equipment for nucleic acid  manipulation. Acquisition of this equipment will allow our students  to gain experience with techniques that are central to biology,  biochemistry and molecular biology.",
