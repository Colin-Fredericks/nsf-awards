 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315821  MOPPER      Light-initiated reactions play important roles in chemical and  biological processes in the sea, including redox reactions, carbon  cycling and photoinhibition.  Despite the importance of  photochemical processes, almost nothing is known about  photochemical pathways and reaction sites within marine DOM that  are responsible for production of reactive sites within Marine DOM  that are responsible for production of reactive transients at the  sea surface.  The focus will be shifted from oceanic carbon cycling  to the study of precursors and mechanisms involved in the  photochemical formation of LMW carbonyl compounds and OH radicals  form marine DOM and DOM isolates, e.g., humic substances.  Some of  the key questions are: Are LMW carbonyl compounds and OH radicals  formed mainly by primary or by secondary photoprocesses? What is  the role of oxidants, e.g., O2, superoxide peroxides, in the  photoproduction of these species in seawater?  Is photobleaching of  DOM fluorescence (and absorbance) in seawater accompanied by an  actual loss of humic substances or only of chromophoric moieties?  Can the marine DOM pool be physically fractionated into  photoreactive (humic) and photo-unreactive fractions? What is the  nature of the chromophoric sites within marine DOM? This study will  provide new basic information on the photochemical, chemical, and  spectroscopic properties of marine DOM.",
