In Phase 1 (not  supported by NSF) of this study, conducted during the spring of  1993 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, the investigators  surveyed 50 state legislatures and received 100 percent response.   This high level of interest suggests that the issue is both  important and timely; it does not suggest that the state  legislative bodies are well supported and do not need to be  exploring affordable and practical alternatives for improving their  capabilities.  At stake is the legitimacy of state government and  the accountability of technical experts who may be advocates,  critics, or advisors.  Phase 2 involves the on-site study of 6 to  10 selected states to provide a valid basis for evaluation of the  need for S&T support and the adequacy of current resources.  A  conference will be convened to review recommendations from which  one or more model legislative-support structures will be designed.   The final stage, which the investigators will fund from non-NSf  sources, will be the implementation of the model in one or more  states.",
