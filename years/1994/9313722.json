 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Paul Dagdigian will study the   gas-phase dynamics of atoms and small molecular free radicals   in molecular beams.  Laser-induced fluorescence will be used to  determine the internal product state distributions.  Both   atom-radical and radical-radical reactions will be studied.  In   a new direction for his research program, Dagdigian will   examine the reaction of oxygen and chlorine atoms with   vibrationally excited methane isotopomers using stimulated   Raman excitation to prepare the molecular reagents.  The   reactions of excited Al atoms with H2 will be investigated   using emission and laser-induced fluorescence detection.    In this project Dagdigian will study the effect on the rate or   pathway of a chemical reaction of energizing one of the   reacting partners with a specific type of excitation.  Atoms   with a large amount of excitation will be reacted with certain   molecules, or other larger molecules with lesser amounts of   excitation will be reacted with atoms.  Such studies will   permit an understanding of the effect on reactions of exciting   these different modes in the reacting atoms and molecules.    These are very fundamental studies which could impact practical   areas such as semiconductor or materials manufacturing.",
