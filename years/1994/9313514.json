Since its construction, the university has made a commitment to faculty  research, but this building is poorly equipped to support research and research  training activities. Most faculty research labs are classrooms in which tables  have been used as lab benches. These labs lack the basic electrical power,  fume hoods, and environmental controls that are necessary for modern  biological research. The university plans an extensive renovation of Lennon Hall  which will provide an upgraded electrical system to the building, installation of  fume hoods, a building-wide replacement of the heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning system, and installation of adequate laboratory benches and  cabinetry.        The planned renovation of Lennon Hall will enable faculty and students to  pursue research projects that have previously been impossible due to building  conditions. The renovation will create safe and healthy environments for work  with chemicals and biological reagents, and will provide suitable support  systems for advanced research instrumentation. It will promote joint faculty-  student research projects, and as a result will attract students to the study of  and careers in science.  ***",
