Stereotypes have been found to become active  automatically upon the presence of the group features (e.g., skin  color, gender), and behaviors have been found to be automatically  categorized in trait terms.  The current research project expands  on these findings to investigate other direct and preconscious  effects that the social environment has on psychological  phenomena.  Specifically, we examine preconscious evaluation of  people, objects, and events, building on encouraging recent  findings of an immediate and reflexive classification of stimuli  as either good or bad.  Another preconscious effect is the  activation of one's chronic goals and motives by features of the  social situation in which they have been chosen frequently and  consistently in the past.  Thus, goals to achieve or to be  patient, and so forth may become automatically tied to certain  kinds of social situations, so that those behaviors are triggered  subsequently without conscious choice.  Finally, the special role  that power features of a situation play in automatically  triggering one's goals is examined, especially in the context of  examining the role of power-goal links in the misuse of power for  private ends.    This program of research considers the extent to which our  emotions, judgments, and even behavior may be outside of our  conscious control.  A considerable amount of thought processes  occur prior to one's conscious awareness of what is happening in  one's environment.  We know a chair is a chair without having to  think about it, but this \"given\" of our conscious experience  represents a good deal of very fast mental work.   This research  examines the influence of fast, \"preconscious\" thought processes  on emotional feelings, motivations, and behavior.  For example,  we may have immediate bad feelings just from seeing the name of a  country where we didn't ha ve a good experience, without any  intention of remembering that bad experience.  And if one always  pursues the same purpose within a type of situation, such as at a  party or a meeting with the boss, over time this goal can be  triggered just by being in that situation, without one needing to  consciously decide to pursue it.  Using an experimental technique  called \"priming\", this research investigates the influence of  preconscious thought processes, such as those triggered by  particular situations and racial groups, on behaviors, such as  task persistence and hostility, which occur without the person's  awareness of why they are behaving that way.  As such, this  research is studying the mechanism of unconscious motivations.   Among the implications of this work will be insights into the  pervasiveness of discrimination against certain groups and the  prospects for change.",
