 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in algebraic geometry.  There are  two objectives of the project.  The first is to obtain universal  realtions for the values of Donaldson polynomials on classes of  algebraic curvs of arbitrary genus and self-intersection.  The  second is to understand global properties of moduli spaces of  bector bundles on surfaces.             The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past ten years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from  algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it  is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved  itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical  computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
