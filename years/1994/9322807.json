 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322807  Kazerooni       This research investigates the use of extenders to support  material handling functions in situations where weight lifting by  workers is involved.  Extenders are computer-controlled material  handling device that are worn by workers to maneuver loads in work  places to minimize the weight intensity and exaction level felt by  the worker.  It is hypothesized that these devices, when worn by  workers to maneuver loads, do prevent back injuries.  The research  includes the analysis of maneuvers needed to lift, move, and  transfer loads, quantify the performance of extenders in terms of  workers, physiological characteristics, design a lightweight  electromagnetic actuator that behaves like Hill's model of  extenders, and develop adaptive control rules which will prevent  human induced instability in the presence of variation in human arm  dynamics.         This research focuses on providing a solution to a real and  practical problem that is felt in various sectors of our economy.   If the research goals are realized, the outcome will have a  significant impact on cost savings, especially in those industrial  segments of the economy in which significant weight lifting by  workers is involved.  Annual cost and losses in productivity due to  back injury cases in industry is staggering.  This research does  offer some potential to minimize these losses and improve  employees' working conditions and morale.",
