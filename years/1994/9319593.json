 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, a method for the characterization of ligand binding  systems using a continuous affinity distribution will be developed.   A local solution to the adsorption integral equation is used to  calculate proton affinity distributions for high surface area oxide  materials.  A detailed knowledge of proton binding sites and  distributions will be useful for the a priori design and synthesis  of oxide supported metal catalysts.  This methodology should also  find use in the characterization of various complex  substrate/liquid interfaces, including systems encountered in  immunology, drug design, and the transport and sequestering of  metals in aquatic and soil systems.    The very complex solid/liquid interface environment will be  examined in the research of this project.  A method for the  quantitative description of the adsorption of protons on complex  oxide substrates will be developed, which will allow the de novo  design of oxide supported catalysts.  If this work, supported  by the Chemistry Division, is fully successful, the approach should  also impact environmentally important areas such as heavy metal and  halocarbon transport in soil and aquatic systems.  A more complete  understanding of the complex liquid/solid interface should result  from this work.",
