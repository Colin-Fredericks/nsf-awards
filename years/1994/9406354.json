 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406354  Stark  The cuticle of higher plants functions primarily as a protective  barrier for the leaves and fruit, controlling bacterial and fungal  attack as well as the diffusion of water and chemicals.  Its major  chemical constituents are waxes that provide waterproofing and  either of two insoluble structural polymers, cutin and suberin.   Our objectives are to understand how the monomer units of cutin and  suberin are linked together, how the polymers are embedded within  wax or cell-wall matrices, and how their supramolecular  architecture is related to cuticular function. Several new  spectroscopic and biochemical initiatives are proposed: (1) the  effects of temperature stress on tomato cuticle function and  flexibility will be monitored by measuring its permeability and  conducting solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  experiments; (2) the effects of swelling on the cuticular netting  will be assessed with 13C and 2H NMR measurements on the cutin and  water, respectively; (3) oligomeric fragments of fruit cutin and  potato suberin will be produced enzymatically and identified using  high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and  solution-state NMR; (4) the development and molecular structure of  suberin within wound-healing potato tissue will be examined using  both uniform and selective 13C and 2H labelling, in conjunction with  advanced 13C and double-resonance NMR experiments.  %%%  Our overall goal is to understand the chemical structures that make  the outer cuticular skin of fruits resilient and resistant to  pathogenic attack, especially under conditions of environmental  stress.  By studying the biosynthesis and structural development of  suberin that forms on the surface of wounded plant tissue, we also  hope to design methods to enhance this protective process.  Since  polymeric mixtures are involved in both of these cuticular  membranes, our research may have future applications in the design  of synthetic coating (waterproofing) and composites  (adhesives).    ***",
