 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416480  Soong    Observed nonstructural damage during major earthquakes has played  an important role in the investigation of a wide range of  research issues dealing with seismic behavior of nonstructural  components.  These include the formulation of codes and  provisions for nonstructural components which specify safety  levels at which these components must be anchored or attached to  a primary structure and the development of seismic design  guidelines for their anchorage details and restraints.    The objectives of this research project ar to assess the impact  of the Northridge earthquake on the following two specific and  interlocking research issues:    (a)  The recently recommended 1994 NEHRP provisions for       nonstructural components.  The Northridge damage       data provides a unique opportunity for assessing       the values assigned tovarious dynamic-effect factors       contained in the force and displacement formulas.    (b)  The performance of a selected group of seismic restraints       located in the affected area, some of which were only       recently developed.  The Northridge event provides the       first opportunity for evaluating their performance under an       actual code-level earthquake.    The results of this research will lead to a better understanding  of the seismic behavior of nonstructural components under a wide  variety of conditions.  In turn, these results will leade to the  development of safer and more rational design guidelines for  operating these components in a seismic environment.    ***",
