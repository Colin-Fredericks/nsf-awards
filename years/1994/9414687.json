 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Dakota is the recipient of ARI funds for the  renovation of  infrastructural utilities and laboratory case work, in its  chemistry building, Abbott Hall.  The renovations are necessary to permit  undergraduate and graduate students to conduct their experiments in an  environment that has adequate ventilation and support systems.  In the  original design of the building, it was anticipated that fumes could be  withdrawn from the bench tops in laboratories by using small desk top hoods  to remove vapors.  This arrangement failed to remove sufficient vapors from  the laboratories over the years and has reduced the types of experiments that  can be performed in the building.  To correct the problem, 30 fume hoods,  including base cabinets and connections to water, electric, ventilation, and  other piped gases and fluids will be installed.  Accessible hoods, meeting ADA  requirements, will be placed in the renovated laboratories.  Improved  facilities will provide a safe and pleasant research training environment,  assisting the Chemistry Department in its recruitment efforts to attract new  students.",
