 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408667  Bonacina  This is a project on contraction-based distributed strategies for  automated deduction.  Since inference systems are non-  deterministic, i.e. they do not specify an order of execution of  the inferences, the computer applications of deduction, e.g.  logic programming and automated theorem proving, have been  regarded by many as natural candidates for parallel execution.  A  large amount of research has been done in the parallelization of  logic programming, functional programming (which can be viewed as  a form of equational deduction) and subgoal-reduction theorem  proving strategies, e.g. Prolog technology theorem proving.  Most  of these works adopted fine-grain parallelism in shared memory.    The concern of this project is different, because it focuses on a  different class of strategies, contraction-based theorem proving  strategies, and on a different type of parallelism, coarse-grain  parallelism in distributed memory.  The distinguishing feature of  these strategies is the use of high-priority contraction  inference rules to delete generated clauses.    This project considers four problems: partition of the search  space among concurrent processes, contraction with respect to a  distributed data base, duplication of clauses in a distributed  data base and unstability of distributed derivations.  It will  study ways to address these problems, to be designed in detail  and implemented in new distributed strategies.  The project also  comprises a theoretical part, which aims at initiating the  mathematical representation and analysis of search in theorem  proving.  ***",
