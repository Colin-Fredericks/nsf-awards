 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on three complementary issues in the study  of galaxy formation in the universe through nonlinear gravitational  collapse.  First, the Lagrangian fluid method based on the velocity  gradient and gravity gradient tensors will be used to analytically  study the nonlinear evolution of density perturbations in several  models including the effects of shears and tides during the  collapse.  Second, N-body simulation codes will be used to test the  approximation schemes used in the analytical studies and to extend  the above analytical Langrangian fluid method to more realistic  systems.  Third, the theoretical understandings gained concerning  gravitational collapse including the effects of shears and tides  will be combined with current observational data to constrain or  exclude competing models of dark matter in the universe.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate special topics  course in astrophysics; guest lecturing on aspects of particle  astrophysics in introductory and advanced physics courses at the  undergraduate level; hosting regular lunches to promote informal  interaction and develop a sense of community among women faculty  and women physics major; and meeting informally with a campus group  interested in space exploration.",
