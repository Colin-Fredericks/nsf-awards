 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Barton - 9321863      Concerns over process safety, advances in automation technology, and restrictions on venting to the atmosphere have resulted in the installation of increasingly sophisticated automatic protective devices on process equipment.  These devices enable a plant to respond quickly and accurately to emergency situations with a series of prespecified actions, without relying on the performance of the control system, or the training and reactions of operators.  Automatic protective devices range from simple mechanical devices such as a float and valve arrangement, to complicated interlock functions that define relationships amongst several items of equipment.  In modern plants these devices are usually referred to collectively as the safety interlock system (SIS), and the responsibilities of this system also includes alarms and trips.  The SIS is installed in order to keep the plant safe, not to produce a product, and has two functions: to protect the plant from equipment failures, and to protect against higher level control failures or operator errors.    This research will develop mathematical methods and software tools for the detailed quantitative analysis of a process and its safety interlock system.  It will focus on the enhancement of general purpose dynamic simulations software to cope with comprehensive models including details of both physical behavior and safety interlocks.  Several tasks will be undertaken:  1. Development of a symbolic language and user interface that will facilitate the efficient construction of models for safety interlock systems.  2. Development of a novel algorithm for the simultaneous solution of the differential-algebraic equations derived from the physico-chemical phenomena, and the classical propositional logic derived from the interlock system.  3. Implementation of these advances in a modern process modeling environment and demonstration through a series of detailed examples furnished by industrial collaborators.",
