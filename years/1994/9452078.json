 "awd_abstract_narration": "Albion College is using a Geographic Information Systems  (GIS)/Computer Aided Mapping (CAM) laboratory, located in the  Department of Geological Sciences, to incorporate digital mapping  and image analysis into the College's curriculum. Albion has a  strong program in geology, including a nationally recognized summer  geology field program. The GIS/CAM laboratory includes the  equipment necessary for the creation, manipulation, analysis, and  display of digital images using modern GIS and CAM techniques. This  laboratory allows the College to make substantial, forward-looking  improvements in both our geology field program and the on-campus  geology and environmental science curriculum. The summer geology  field program is adding an introduction to digital field mapping;  at the end of the program students return to the Albion campus for  a week-long intensive course on the creation and use of digital  maps. Secondly, two new courses on GIS and digital maps are being  developed. An introductory level course introduces the fundamentals  of GIS and CAM to a broad spectrum of students including  non-science majors. The second course allows upper-level students  to apply their GIS/CAM skills to their own geological and  environmental research projects. Finally, the new laboratory allows  the revision of traditional geology laboratory mapping exercises  and projects, including an introduction to quantitative spatial  analysis, in as many as nine existing geology courses. This  includes the high-enrollment Introductory Geology course, in which  students can apply GIS/CAM techniques to existing mapping projects.  This project is an integral part of a broader effort to develop a  more engaging research-oriented curriculum using up-to-date  equipment and techniques.",
