 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400199  Brawley    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research  in marine biology. Researchers, undergraduates and graduate  students at the University of Maine, Stockholm University and  University of Umea will conduct field and laboratory studies on  how marine organisms adapt to and invade freshwater habitats over  evolutionary time scales. By studying organisms in low-salinity  habitats, the investigators propose to extend their findings to  freshwater habitats.  The Baltic Sea is an ideal site because it  is the largest body of brackish water on Earth and has an  extensive and well-known post-glacial history.  Fucus  vesiculosus, a fucoid algae found in abundance in the Baltic, is  the focus of the study.  It has adapted gradually to brackish  waters and serves as an important spawning and nursery ground for  marine organisms including some economically important fish.    The project takes advantage of complementary expertise of U.S.  investigator, Susan Brawley, and her Swedish counterparts, Lena  Kautsky and Goran Samuelsson. Dr. Brawley brings to this  collaboration expertise in biology, physiology and genetics of  seaweeds.  This is complemented by Swedish knowledge in ecology  and ecotoxicology.  The research will advance understanding of  the geographical distribution, speciation and evolution of marine  seaweeds, particularly a species which is currently threatened by  pollution.  ***",
