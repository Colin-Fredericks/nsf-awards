 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416119  Hauksson    This research is to investigate the effect of lateral variations  in seismic velocity on the amplitude of damaging shear wave energy  within the Los Angeles basin from the 1994 Northridge earthquake in  order to resolve some of the questions of source versus structure  as a cause of the damaging motion.  A horizontal acceleration of  0.93 g was measured at Santa Monica and accelerations greater than  0.4 g were measured at other sites within the L.A. basin in phases  that followed the direct S-wave by more than 5 seconds.  These  sites were farther from the source than sites within the Santa  Monica Mountains that recorded smaller accelerations.  This  complexity in the pattern of peak accelerations may be caused by  complications of the source rupture, for example directivity of a  later sub-event, and may also be caused by waveform propagation  effects through a complicated basin structure.  This work is a step  towards the ultimate goal of creating a 3-D model for general use  for locating earthquakes within the Los Angeles basin and  predicting the ground motion from earthquake scenarios from other  source regions.  This project is a contribution to the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the  Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation.  ***",
