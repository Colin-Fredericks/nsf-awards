The model involves a  collaborative effort between private companies and schools,  and can be made a component of many different kinds of  teacher enhancement projects. Companies in the project  target area agree to provide release time for volunteer  employees, so that these employees can take over as  substitutes while the classroom teachers attend teacher  enhancement workshops during the regular school day.  The  present project has 2 components: (1) \"getting the word out\"  to potentially interested parties (e.g., PIs of SSIs and  USIs; other TE projects, etc); and (2) providing technical  assistance to those seriously interested in implementing  their own Volunteer model.  Such assistance includes:  providing a \"Handbook\" that details how such cooperative  ventures can be initiated, organized, and executed; sending  an EDC resource team to the potential implementation site;  telephone conferencing, etc.  At the end of the project,  there is a 1-day conference at EDC for those groups who are  ready to begin their implementation.      Cost sharing is 5% of the NSF contribution.",
