 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360935  Wise       Three methods are proposed for making net shape high  temperature mandrels to form chemically vapor deposited nickel  shell tooling based on solid freeform fabrication (SFF) models.   The three methods are distinguished by the number of generations or  replications the nickel shell will be from the SFF model: three,  two or one.  The three and two generation methods use chemically  bonded ceramic materials to form the mandrel because of their  compatibility with SFF models coupled with precision, quick and  easy formability, thermal stability and thermal conductivity.  The  single generation method will require the development of a high  temperature SFF model.  The shells formed from these mandrels will  be incorporated into injection molds by backing them with CBC and  mounting them in a standard mold frame.  The mold will be tested  for part precision and cycle time.       The anticipated application of the technology, as defined, is  the tooling industry and specifically the matched die molding  industry.  If successful, enhanced automation of complex mold  production could improve the worldwide competitiveness of the  United States tool and die industry and dramatically reduce costs  for any industry that relies on molded parts, particularly those  with production runs of less than 25,000 parts.",
