 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361774  Grahn       Tactile sensors are a class of robotic sensors capable of  measuring contract interaction between a robotic gripper and a  grasped object.  The use of tactile sensors will greatly enhance  the use of unmanned vehicles and robotics in both the military and  civilian sectors by making robots more able to deal with  uncertainty in the environment.  Currently, the use of tactile  sensors in real-time control applications is limited by the low  update rates available from current sensors. This research seeks to  overcome that restriction by creating a Computational Tactile  Sensor (CTS) that combines special-purpose VLSI circuitry with an  ultrasonic tactile sensor to achieve high data rates.  The  resulting CTS will lower bandwidth and wire requirements by  performing local self-scanning of the tactile array and  preprocessing of the tactile data.  The data rates achieved by the  CTS will be sufficient for applications that use tactile sensors in  real-time control applications.  The technology and algorithms  developed in this research effort will also be applicable, in  general, to all array-based tactile sensor technologies, yielding  the same reductions in bandwidth and wire count, and allowing  operation in real-time applications.",
