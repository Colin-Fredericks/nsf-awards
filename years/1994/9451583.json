Upper-level undergraduate physics  and engineering physics students are the primary target for the  Lasers course and this quarter-long (10-week) laboratory. Students  working in groups of 2 to 3 will rotate through laboratory  experiments. These experiments will be developed to reinforce the  concepts and models discussed in lecture. The Laser Laboratory  experiments will cover three basic components. First, the  experiments will provide introductory investigations to basic laser  parameters, such as laser power, beam divergence and cavity mode  structure. Second, the students will learn current optical  techniques for probing matter, in particular potential laser media.  Finally, the students will receive hands on experience in the  assembling and evaluation of modern laser systems. We will acquire  state-of-the-art light detection and laser systems which will be  utilized in essentially all laboratory components. The acquired  instrumentation will also be used in upgrading experiments for the  upper level Applied Optics Laboratory and provide further  opportunities for senior projects.",
