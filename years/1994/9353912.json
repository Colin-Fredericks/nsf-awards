Participants train on existing  software packages and in their use as classroom instructional  tools. The materials cover fundamental topics from both  difference and differential equations and how they are used to  understand problems in population dynamics and other related  biological and ecological areas. The goal is to modernize  undergraduate courses in which these topics can be a vital  part. Applications of mathematics to and from biology and  ecology are a main theme throughout the conference. Mornings  are devoted to lectures and demonstrations by the speakers.  Afternoons involve hands-on computer activities, problem  solving, modeling of biological problems, group discussions,  participant presentations and the construction of a module or  course outline. The conference is followed by class testing of  the module/outline along with models and computer activities  during the 1994-95 school year. The reports are submitted to  the project director for distribution to all participants. Each  report will include a revised copy of the module/outline/other  activity along with an evaluation of classroom success. A  selection of reports will be distributed nationally.  ***",
