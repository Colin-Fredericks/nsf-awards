 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to obtain  funding that will be used to purchase a refrigerated,  ultracentrifuge. Purchasing an ultracentrifuge will enable  Grand View College: 1) To train undergraduate students in  membrane isolation protocols and a variety of techniques  commonly used in cell biology, molecular biology, and  biochemistry laboratories. 2) To conduct research to  identify the biochemical and molecular factors associated  with ethanol-induced impairment of central nervous system  development in chicks. This research project is currently  studying how ethanol alters embryonic chick brain membranes  and how such alterations may impair cellular responses to a  number of morphogens required for neuron differentiation. 3)  To conduct further collaborative research with Dr. Norman  Paradise (lowa Methodist Medical Center, Director of  Surgical Research) and Dr. LaRhee Henderson (Drake  University, Assoc. Prof. of Chemistry). This collaborative  project is directed at identifying the biochemical  relationships between obesity and cardiac dysfunction in the  Zucker rat. We are currently characterizing Zucker rat  cardiac membrane lipids and studying how signal transduction  is impaired in Zucker rat cardiac membranes as compared to  lean rats.       Both projects described in this grant proposal are  currently underway and utilize lipid biochemistry techniques  and molecular biology protocols. The lipid biochemistry  techniques attempt to define how membranes mediate genetic  and biochemical response to stress. The purchase of a  refrigerated ultracentrifuge would enable us to fractionate  cells, isolate plasma and sarcolemma membranes, and to  measure the biochemical composition of membranes. Since  these research projects utilize undergraduate students from  Grand View College (Fall, 1993 full time enrollment =1025),  and collaborative students from Drake University and Iowa  Methodist Medical Center (the largest hospital in Des  Moines), the purchase of an ultracentrif uge would strengthen  the cell biology and biochemical education of a number of  students.",
