 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320678  Samuelson  Noncooperative game theory has become a pervasive theoretical  tool in economics.  Unfortunately, this theoretical success has  not been matched by empirical applications, and noncooperative  game theory is often dismissed with the charge that it makes no  testable predictions.  The primary difficulty in using game  theory to make empirical predictions is the equilibrium selection  problem: games typically have a multitude of equilibria, and game  theory provides very little guidance as to how to choose between  them.  The project continues the development of an approach to  the equilibrium selection problem based on evolutionary models of  games, consisting of four components.  The first is the  construction of explicit models of how boundedly rational players  learn to play games.  These models are then used to derive  dynamic processes describing the evolution of play.  Third, the  limiting outcomes of these dynamic processes are examined, with  particular interest in how these outcomes compare to common  equilibrium concepts.  Finally, the robustness of the results to  various types of trembles or noise int he learning process is  investigated.    More specifically, under the current grant the project extends  existing, preliminary models of how boundedly rational players  learn.  Best-reply learning models are extended to new classes of  games, including signaling games; and \"noisy selection\" models  are extended beyond the 2x2 symmetric games to which they are now  confined.  With these models in hand, the heart of the research  involves investigating the outcomes of evolutionary processes in  the presence of various environmental randomness or \"trembles.\"   The preliminary results indicate that such randomness can have a  profound impact on the evolutionary outcome.  The proposed  research addresses the apparent arbitrariness of evolutionary  learning models by investing the evolution of the learning rules  by which players guide their behavior.",
