It is a study of  how  emotional  displays affect how individuals construe ambiguous information in  order   to  assess  a  social  situation.   Social  psychological  experiments will be conducted in which observers will view actors  on  videotape portraying alleged criminals and victims  of  their  crimes.  By varying the emotional tone of the statements  of  the  actors,  differences  in  how experimental  subjects  assess  the  nature  of  the  criminal  situation and recommend  verdicts  and  sentences will be assessed.        Previous  attempts  to  verify  affect  control  theory  in  experimental situations have been relatively unsuccessful.   This  project  will subject predictions of that theory to more rigorous  tests.   In  addition,  this  research  should  answer  important  questions  about  how members of juries resolve  ambiguities  and  reach   decisions  in  criminal  trials.   In  addition  to   the  scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student  in  completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.  ***",
