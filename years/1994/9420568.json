Currently we are developing wide bandgap semiconductors and magneto-strictive materials for automotive device sensors.  The curriculum will develop a hands-on lecture/laboratory sequence to develop new materials using existing experimental methodology and to develop the materials into proto-type devices.  Students will learn very state-of-the-art growth techniques for developing two classes of materials- III-V wide bandgap nitride semiconductors and magnetic materials.  The students will use the class 100 clean room facilities to develop proto-type sensor devices.  Preliminary work on curriculum development in this area has been very successful (high demand) using direct study courses.  In addition to sensor         development, students will learn how to combine circuitry, for control, calibration, and pre-processing of data, on the sensor devices to make them \"smart detectors\".  A VLSI/Device Simulation laboratory will be developed for the course sequence to allow students to design and simulate the devices before they fabricate them.  An emphasis will be placed on design aspects and teamwork in completing the project.  This type of integrated technology where students are trained in device design, fabrication and integrated circuitry is what industries in the united states need to be competitive.  This type of training is suggested from direct consultations with many local high technology industries and most particularly from the automobile industry.  Sensor technology has become a priority in the automobile industry for auto emissions and control systems.  The developed material will be published as a text accompanied by a laboratory manual and associated simulation software.  The college of engineering will sponsor a workshop after completion of course dev elopment to disseminate this course to other universities and institutions.  ***",
