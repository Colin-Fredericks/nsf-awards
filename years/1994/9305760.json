 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305760  Potra       The investigator studies the computational complexity and  superlinear convergence of interior point algorithms for linear  programming, quadratic programming, linear complementarity  problems, and some classes of nonlinear programming problems.   Both problems with feasible and infeasible starting points are  considered.  In order to better characterize algorithms with good  practical performance, worst case computational aomplexity results  are complemented, whenever possible, by probabilistic complexity  results. The goal of this study is to better understand practical  performance of interior point methods and eventually to develop  new interior point algorithms with superior numerical efficiency.       The advent of interior point methods has revolutionized the  field of mathematical programming.  On the theoretical side,  interior point methods have been used to prove that some important  classes of optimization problems have polynomial complexity, which  means that such problems are computationally tractable even when a  large number of variables are involved.  On the practical side,  interior point methods have been implemented in several very  efficient codes capable of solving large scale problems arising in  economics, science, and technology that cannot be solved with  classical methods.  The purpose of the present proposal is to  extend interior point methods to new classes of problems and to  investigate their properties in a systematic way both from a  deterministic and a probabilistic point of view.  Successful  completion of the research will contribute to new advances in the  theory of interior point methods with a positive impact on the  design of efficient practical algorithms.",
