 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310576  Mahrt         The objective of this work is to analyze several new and  existing data sets toward the goal of improving our understanding  of the response of boundary-layer flow to heterogeneous surfaces  ranging from multiple, well defined, discontinuities to more  complex surface heterogeneity.  The new data include aircraft,  tower and limited remote sensing observations and allow examination  of classes of heterogeneity in detail not previously considered.         One of the goals is to examine the main influences on the area  averaged surface fluxes.  These influences include:  1) enhancement  of the momentum flux associated with pressure drag induced by  scatter trees, forest edges and other obstacles, 2) non-equilibrium  effects in transition zones downstream from changes of surface  conditions, 3) extra Reynolds terms associated with spatial  variability and the nonlinear relationship between fluxes and  gradients and 4) direct transport by mesoscale motions.  To  approach this problem, the flow observed by repeated aircraft runs  over the same track is formally decomposed into turbulence,  transient mesoscale motions and stationary mesoscale motions  (primarily associated with surface heterogeneity).  The modulation  of the turbulence flux by the two mesoscale components will be  considered in detail.         From a more practical point of view, the above influences on  the area averaged flux will be implicitly incorporated into  calculation of effective roughness lengths and exchange  coefficients corresponding to the area averaged fluxes.  These  calculations will be preceded by an analysis of flux sampling  errors which will include some research on the techniques for  estimating flux errors.  Proposed theoretical work will be limited  to interpretation of the mesoscale circulations over heterogeneous  terrain in terms of several existing linear and nonlinear  predictions.  ***",
