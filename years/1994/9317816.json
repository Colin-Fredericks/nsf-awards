 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317816  Ritman  The objective of this proposal is to fabricate and evaluate  a prototype volume imaging x-ray micro-CT scanner (augmented  by novel tomographic image reconstruction, 3D image analysis  and display software) for application to biological  specimens.  The scanner design is inspired by a unique micro-  CT scanner developed by a research group of the Exxon  company for their geological purposes.  Members of the Exxon  Research team will provide consultations needed for  duplication of important aspects of their scanner.  This new  capability has great potential for providing quantative  insights into how mechanisms at the cellular level integrate  to express themselves in the anatomy of organs at the micro  and macroscopic scale.  This proposed scanner will generate  volume images of at least 5123 cubic voxels (10 to 40m on a  side).  This scanner extends current micro-CT methods,  developed primarily for material sciences and nondestructive  testing purposes, by imaging larger volumes with greater  spatial resolution, within a reasonable period of time.  This is an improvement over optical microscopic and  conventional x-ray  magnification techniques in that the  logistics of image data analysis are greatly improved.  The  reason a computed tomographic imaging approach (which  eliminates re-assembly of one-at-the-time scanned slices)  and because we have already developed software for  quantitative analysis and display of the 3D volume images.  This software can be readily expanded to handle the huge 3D  images (e.g., up to 109 voxels) to be generated with the  proposed scanner.    Several software approaches, which we have developed in  recent  years for 3D whole body scanning CT image data,  should greatly extend the power of the x-ray micro-CT  methodology as follows:       a)    Ability to scan objects greater than the size of  the fluorescent screen because we can use the 'local'  (as  compared to the conventional 'global') reconstruction  algorithm that our collaborators Drs.  Faridani and Smith of  Oregon State University have developed.  This algorithm  needs to 'see' only the projection through the volume of  interest within a larger specimen.  Consequently organs  within the intact body of small animals can be scanned  without the need to scan the entire transverse anatomic  extent of the body, thereby greatly reducing scanner cost.       b)    Another new algorithm has been developed by Dr.  Faridani that may provide almost double the spatial  resolution \"allowed\" by the traditional relationship between  numbers of angles-of-view and numbers of samples along the  transverse x-ray absorption profile.       c)     Ability to automatically segment large and complex  3D images such as the entire arterial trees with its  thousands of branches, using an algorithm of the type  developed by Dr. Higgins of Pennsylvania State University.        d)    Ability to automatically analyze the segmented  vascular trees for segmental dimensions and branching angles  using modified versions of the algorithms and image analysis  software developed in our laboratory for analysis of  macrovascular arterial tree geometry.",
