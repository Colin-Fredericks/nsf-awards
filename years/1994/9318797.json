This equipment upgrade will enhance research in a number  of areas including the  following:                    Conformational Properties of Phorphorus-Containing Six-Membered Rings                    Molecular Structure from Automated Interpretation of INADEQUATE Spectra                    Segmental Motion in Peptides and Proteins                    Mechanistic Studies of Enzymes in the Isoprene Biosynthetic Pathway                    Structural Studies of Peptide Neurotoxins from Fish-Hunting Cone Snails        Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, charcterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in  biology.",
