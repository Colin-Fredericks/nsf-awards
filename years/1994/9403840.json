 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  9403840  Richard Masel    This is a combined experimental and theoretical study of the structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions on metal surfaces.  Ultrahigh-vacuum surface spectroscopic techniques are used to examine the interactions of simple hydrocarbon ligands with a series of platinum single crystals that expose various index planes.  The experimental observations are compared to the results of density functional calculations, and the process iterated by designing new experiments to test predictions of the theoretical calculations.  The objective is to identify the key interactions that control the reactions of hydrocarbons and describe how those interactions vary from one crystal face to another.    It has long been known that catalytic activities for various reactions on metals vary from one crystal face to another; in  many cases, the distribution of exposed planes is a predicter of selectivity.  While some extreme cases can be explained by crude steric or geometric arguments, there is no satisfactory theoretical framework to address this issue, which is critical  for many processes in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and fuel industries.  This effort addresses that need.  ***",
