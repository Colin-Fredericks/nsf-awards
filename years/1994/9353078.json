The Jacksonville USI planning grant will coordinate resources and  solicit input from a broad based constituency to accomplish the  following objectives:         conduct a comprehensive self-study of the current status       of science and mathematics education in Duval County         achieve consensus on a shared vision for science and       mathematics education         develop a comprehensive systemic plan for improvement of       mathematics and science education         establish a dynamic system to evaluate and refine systemic       reform.    A Stakeholder Steering Committee will select recognized community  leaders to chair task forces that will meet and gather data. The  planning process will produce a self-analysis based on valid  data, a shared vision, and an USI implementation proposal for the  city of Jacksonville.    Using principles adapted from total quality management as the  basis for the self-study, representatives from the major city  stakeholders will form a Stakeholder Steering Committee. This  committee will select community leaders to chair self-study task  forces, acquire additional funding and resources to support the  self-study and gather data from their constituencies.    The task forces will gather data by observation, interviews,  surveys and focus groups. This information will be used to assess  the current state of mathematics and science education in  Jacksonville and to develop a collective vision for reform.    The planning effort will result in the development of an  implementation proposal based on information gathered during the  self-study process.  ***",
