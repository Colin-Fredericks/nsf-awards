The principal  investigator will apply some of the new approaches of abelian  group theory to the theory of p-alpha-purity.  Of particular  importance are tools stemming from the increasing interplay  between set-theory and abelian groups, recent work on the  structure of the torsion product, important structure theorems  relating to the class of IT groups, the theory of valuated groups  and vector spaces, and the higher derived functors of the inverse  limit.              This project is in the general area of abelian group theory and  is concerned with the classification of abelian groups.  Although  the classification of finite abelian groups has been well  understood for a century, the classification of infinite abelian  groups remains elusive.  This research involves this old problem  of classification of the infinite abelian groups approached by  new tools from logic and topology.",
