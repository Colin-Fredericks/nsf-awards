In order for there to  be a testing of existing models and the construction of new  models, it is necessary to collect better data. The upper  Mississippi River floods of the summer of 1993 provide a special  opportunity to collect such data. This Small Grants for  Exploratory Research project is designed to collect systemmatic  samples of overbank sedimentation from unleveed areas of the  floodplain as well as an area which was inundated following a  levee breach. Samples will be collected from two sites which will  enable the investigators to map variations in the thickness and  particle size distribution of overbank deposits associated with  the flood. These data will enable the investigators to determine  the relationship of floodplain topography and vegetation to  observed patterns of scour and deposition and to compare patterns  of erosion and sedimentation on the leveed and unleveed parts of  the floodplain. Data will be organized in a geographic  information system in order to facilitate further research.       This project will provide a timely and unusual data set and  analysis that can be used to test the integrity of existing  sedimentation models and that will likely lead to new  understanding of the process of sedimentation.  ***",
