The workshop on Cognitive  Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction for Geographic Information  Systems is organized by Timothy Nyerges, University of  Washington; Robert Laurini, Universite Claude Bernard in Lyon,  France; and Sr. Maurici Ruiz, Universitat de les Illes in  Balears, Spain.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an  enabling information technology that has been developed for use  within research and applied settings.  Its effectiveness depends  upon the user interface. Research perspectives from cognitive  science, computer science, informatics, and geography are needed  to investigate cognitive aspects of the human-computer  interaction (HCI).      This workshop focuses on HCI research issues, includes  experts from the computer science community, and takes advantage  of an international interest in the topic, all lacking from  earlier, related meetings.  The workshop is designed to identify  research issues as well as intellectual linkages that will result  in research collaborations.  ***",
