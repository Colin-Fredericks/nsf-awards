 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408680  Sejnowksi    Recently a new field of engineering has emerged, referred to as neuromorphic  engineering, that is based on the design and fabrication of artificial neural systems, such  as vision chips, head-eye systems, and roving robots, whose architecture and design  principles are based on those of biological nervous systems. A two-week workshop on  neuromorphic engineering will be held to bring together young investigators and more  established researchers from academia with their counterparts in industry and national  laboratories, working on both neurobiological as well as engineering aspects of sensory  systems and sensory-motor integration. Formal lectures will be given, but the primary  focus will be hands-on experience with research tools for all participants. The workshop  will serve as a bridge between the engineering world of artificial neural systems and the  neuroscience community. The workshop will provide an environment for intensive  interactions between members of these two communities - merging engineering  principles with experimental results from neuroscience. The workshop will also serve as  a prototype for the development of a similar yearly summer workshop. The interaction  of these two disciplines should have significant impact both on the development of new  technologies (new artificial neural systems) and on our understanding of how the  nervous system is designed.***",
