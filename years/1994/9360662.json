 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360662  Bakthavachalam      During this project, fluorescent probes selective for the newly  identified D-3 dopamine receptor (DA) will be developed.  Since  its discovery, the D-3 receptor is recognized as a member of the  D-2 Like family of DA receptors and is considered to be a  possible site of action of antipsychotics.  Recently, 7-hydroxy-2-  (N,N-dipropyl)aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) was identified as a  potent and selective ligand for D-3 receptors.    Fluorescently labeled analogs of 7-OH-DPAT will be prepared by  functionalization of one of the propyl chains of 7-OH-DPAT  followed by coupling with fluorescent reagents.  The affinity of  these probes for D-3 receptors will be determined in binding  assays using membranes from CCL 1.3 fibroblasts that express  cloned D-3 receptors.  Selectivities of the probes will also be  determined by assaying their affinities D-1 and D-2 receptors.  The abilities of the most promising probes to selectively label D-  3 receptors in the CCL 1.3 fibroblasts will then be established  by fluorescence microscopic studies.    The fluorescent probes are expected to be useful tools for the  studies of D-3 DA receptors including their localization and  distribution in mammalian brain.  ***",
