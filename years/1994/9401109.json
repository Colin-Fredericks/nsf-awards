 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401108  Protter    This three-year continuing grant supports U.S.-France cooperative  research in numerical analysis of stochastic differential  equations (SDE).  The investigators are Philip Protter of Purdue  University, Thomas Kurtz of the University of Wisconsin, Denis  Talay, French National Institute for Research in Computer Science  and Applied Mathematics and Jean Jacod, University of Paris VI.   The investigators have identified six topics for exploration,  including studies of the discretization of stochastic  differential equations and their flows; applications to numerical  analysis of parabolic partial differential equations and to  mathematical finance; and numerical analysis of interacting  particle systems.    Stochastic differential equations deal with the modeling of  random dynamical systems and have been applied to models for  statistical communication theory, finance theory, control theory  among others.  With the advent of computers, it is now important  to analyze such models numerically.  The project takes advantage  of unique expertise of the INRIA researchers, who are world  leaders in stochastic differential equations. The results of this  work will further understanding of other numerical problems and  advance our understanding of the special nature of stochastic  differential equations.  SDEs could eventually replace, for  example, current financial models with more efficient and faster  computational models.  ***",
