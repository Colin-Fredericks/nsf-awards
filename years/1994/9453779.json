These activities will engage visitors in  learning how math is an integral part of daily life and a  necessary skill in many careers.  Eight math topics will be  treated: probability and statistics; relative scale; geometry;  symmetry; math puzzles; chaos and fractals; numbers,  measurements, and calculations; and estimations.  The hands-on  activities will range from involvement with  low-tech to high-  tech, computerized activities.  The target audience is people  nine and up and it will be available to the museums 500,000  annual visitors.  The mathematics activities will be distributed  throughout the museum and math will serve as a integrating theme  for all the museum's exhibits.  The topics are aligned with  Connecticut s SSI program which focuses on applied mathematics in  context of the science disciplines.  Within the state, plans are  taking shape to link with Connecticut Public Television to  broadcast electronic field trips to the museum through Knowledge  Network.  Nationally, museum staff members will make  presentations at both museum and mathematics education meetings  to other museum professionals. The concept of thematic  integration throughout the museum will be disseminated through  the state and the nation.  ***",
