For some models  this will involve explicitly assessing and improving the model  dynamics.  However, for transport models that use predetermined  wind fields a parameterization of the processes involved will be  necessary.  In order to achieve these goals, a combination of  analyses of both observations and general circulation model outputs  will be employed to study the dominant locations, seasonality, and  interannual variability of cross-equatorial transport.  Studies  will also be performed to diagnose the dynamical processes related  to the exchanged of mass between hemispheres.    The specific steps to meet these goals include analyzing previously  completed simulations of CFCl3 transport in the Community Climate  Model 2 (CCM2) forced with climatological sea surface temperatures  (SSTs) to determine the location and seasonality of the transport  between hemispheres.    The PI will also perform runs of the CCM2, with CFCl3 as the tracer,  using observed SSTs to examine the influence of the El Nino/South  Oscillation (ENSO) on interannual variability of interhemispheric  exchange.  After the parameterzation has been tested, it will be  available for general use in chemical transport models.",
