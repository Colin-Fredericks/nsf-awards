 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453422  Liu  Develop intelligent diagnostic methodologies to detect incipient  failures in power system equipment using adaptive recognition  techniques and artificial neural networks.  We will continue the  work of power system equipment diagnosis using artificial neural  networks.  The previously developed methods and experiences will  be widely tested.  An important task for failure diagnosis is to  determine the most representative parameters of equipment status,  and the most likely cause of a particular failure or performance  deterioration.  These will be achieved through sensitivity tests  of individual or a group of parameters in ANNs.  Although ANN-  based diagnosis systems are problem-dependent, some general rules  on input feature selection, ANN architecture, and training  algorithms will be developed for use as guidelines in similar  applications.      Develop dynamic contingency analysis and control algorithms using  Satellite-Based Phasor Measurement Technology.  Develop real-time  dynamic models in order to investigate the possibility of  tracking power system dynamics in real-time.    Establish research programs in characterizing harmonic noise in  power systems by developing an integrated probabilistic harmonic  flow algorithm that considers the nonlinear dependence of  harmonic voltages and currents, and random variations of  operation modes and switching status of harmonic sources.  More  effort will be devoted to develop algorithms for identifying  harmonic sources based on limited measurements for multiple  circuit nodes.    The computer animation packages for teaching difficult concepts  will be expanded and more complex field problems and concepts  will be illustrated with animation.  Multimedia tools will be  gradually added to the conventional classroom teaching.    The power engineering core course materials will be updated and  revised in order to establish an ideal knowledge mix for today's  Electrical Engineering graduates.  The Power Quality Teaching and  Research  Lab are being planned and lab equipment are being  researched.  It is planned that new lab equipment will be added  for harmonic measurements.  This will allow us to begin data  gathering and analysis.  Also, lab experiments will be developed  for students to use in the new power quality course.       ***",
