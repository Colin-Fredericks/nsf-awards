 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400123  Claiborne  This award supports Professor Alexander Claiborne, a  postdoctoral associate, and a graduate student, all from Wake  Forest University, to collaborate with three complementary  research groups in the Department of Biochemistry at Wageningen  Agricultural University in the Netherlands.   They will carry  out biophysical and structural studies on several flavoproteins  from Streptococcus bacteria, using state of the art nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) and time resolved fluorescence  techniques.  They will also carry out experiments to gain  understanding of the structure and genetics of two related  lipoamide dehydrogenases.  The U.S. group has developed  extensive experience working with the enzymes in this medically  relevant system.  The Dutch investigators have great expertise  and superb facilities for biophysical and genetic approaches to  studying flavoprotein structure and function.  The Wake Forest  group has excellent complementary facilities, but they will  obtain particular benefit from free access to the high field  NMR equipment at Wageningen.  Additional interaction with the  Netherlands Institute for Dairy Research will strengthen the  understanding of the genetics and physiology of streptococcal  oxidative metabolism.    Streptococcus has a unique defence against the leukocyte-  mediated phagocytosis of bacteria, which is dependent upon  destruction of hydrogen peroxide.  The hydrogenase and  peroxidase enzymes being studied by Dr. Claiborne and his group  control that defence.  Preliminary studies and substantial  advance planning with these Dutch experts have laid a promising  foundation for collaborative research on this important system.  The Dutch participants are heavily involved in two European  scientific networks supported by the European Union.  Their  U.S. collaborators will also benefit from links with these  other European experts.  ***",
