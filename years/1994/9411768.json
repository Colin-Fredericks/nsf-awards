The specific  purpose of the funding is directed at research developments  presented at a concurrent workshop whose focus is Wavelets in  Biomedical Engineering and Medicine.  This is a new area of  application of the wavelet theory which has the potential for  important applications to neurophysiology, speech analysis, MRI,  spectroscopy and the analysis of EEG and ECG.   The workshop will  have two parts, (1) tutorial presentations by prominent experts  in the field and (2) a series of contributed talks focusing on  new developments and applications in biology and medicine.       The workshop focuses exclusively on developments  andapplications of wavelet theory to mathematical problems  arising in biology and medicine and does not involve any research  which could be considered to be directly related to medical or  health issues.  ***",
