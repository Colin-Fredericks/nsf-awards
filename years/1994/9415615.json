A  major focal point for these investigations is W(p)(A), which is  the homotopy inverse limit of the fixed point spectra of  topological Hochschild homology of a ring A with respect to the  subgroups of the circle having order divisible by the prime p,  where the structure maps are those arising from the restriction  of equivariant maps to their fixed point subspaces.  When A is  commutative, the 0-th homotopy group of W(p)(A) consists of the  p-th Witt vectors of A, and there is a natural map from K(End(A))  to W(p)(A) which on the 0-th homotopy group is the expected map  (from work of Almkvist).  If we use W(p)(A) as a generalization  of the p-th Witt vectors, one is led to consider the homotopy  fixed point spectrum of W(p)(A) (there is a circle action) as a  possible generalization of the p-th DeRham-Witt complex.  The  composite map from K(A) to K(End(A)) (by the identity  endomorphism) to W(p)(A) factors through the homotopy orbit  spectrum of W(p)(A), and it is the investigator's hope that this  is a good modification of Bloch's crystalline chern character.       This project treats some of the algebraic apparatus that has  been developed with huge success over the past several decades  for reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation.   The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of  the difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles,  volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to  calculations, it is far different with what are known as  topological properties of geometric objects.  These are  properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study  of such properties, for example, how to tell whet her two  geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these  properties or are only superficially different, or how to  classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these  have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have  been reduced to matters of calculation.  The investigator's work  aims to understand better the relations among some of the  powerful algebraic tools now available for doing this, the  obvious hope being that with better understanding comes the  ability to perfect and sharpen them.  The potential value of  something so basic is hard to quantify, since topological  properties and questions arise in such widely varied mathematical  settings as the differential equations that govern satellite  motions and the conditions for equilibrium of models of the  ecomomy.  ***",
