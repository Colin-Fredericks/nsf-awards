In particular. AIDS, largely  restricted earlier to homosexuals, is of great concern since it  is spreading rapidly into heterosexual populations and presents  an especially serious threat to women. In societies such as  India, women are more susceptible than men to contracting sexual  diseases since their access to information is limited by lack of  education and ignorance about sexual practices and preventive  measures. Unlike their counterparts in the western world who have  sufficient access to information and medical services, rural  women in India have insufficient knowledge about sexual diseases.  Recognizing that spatial relations are gendered and that the  geographic spaces of women differ in different places, this  research project focuses on identifying those factors, especially  those related to understanding the connection between context and  gender roles, that affect the construction and use of social  networks by rural Indian women who have a sexual disease.  The  study will involve samples of women from three districts in  Haryana, India, taken over a nine month period.  Personal  interviews with infected women and health care providers will  provide the empirical base for a statistical analysis which will  define social networks and attempt to explain the structure, and  variation in the structure, of those networks.       This project will provide significant new insights into a  very important problem facing developing countries. It will  expand our understanding of both the delivery of medical services  in developing areas and the role of patriarchy in shaping the way  in which rural women seek and use medical help. Thus, this study  will contribute to a richer theoretical understanding of medical  geography, development studies, and gender as well as providing  new perspectives of immediate practi cal importance in dealing  with these growing medical problems.  As a doctoral dissertation  research improvement award, this project will also provide  support to enable a promising student to establish a strong  independent research career.  ***",
