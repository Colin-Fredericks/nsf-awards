 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408061  Ketterson         Animal species differ greatly in body-size, life span,  and numbers of offspring produced. Large-bodied species tend  to die younger but have fewer offspring, while smaller-  bodied species tend to die younger but to produce more  offspring per reproductive attempt. Patterns in which one  component of fitness is gained at the cost of another (long  life or large broods, but not both) are referred to as trade-  offs in order to strive to understand the physiological  bases for trade-offs in order to understand species  differences in aging and reproduction.       Another kind of trade-off is observed in reproduction.  Adults, particularly males, can gain in fitness either by  mating with multiple females or by behaving parentally  towards their offspring by a single female. Because time is  limiting and behavior that leads to successful mate  attraction often differs from behavior that favors offspring  survival, male animals often allocate time to parenting but  not to both simultaneously. This too is a trade-off, and  there is evidence to suggest that the male hormone  testosterone controls whether males specialize in one form  of reproduction or the other.       Birds are unusual among vertebrates in that almost all  species of birds provide some kind of parental care, and  male care of offspring is much more common among birds than  it is among other vertebrates. Presumably this is true  because males that are parental leave more offspring than  those that are not, but this needs to be tested  experimentally. It is also important to understand the  physiological underpinnings of male parental care.       To address the mechanisms of trade-offs in avian life-  histories, and how they are maintained, free-living male  dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) are treated with implants  of  testosterone. Treated males are then compared with  controls. Because hormones affect so many attributes of the  animal, some of the induced alterations may be detrimental  to fitness, othe r beneficial. Only by considering the net  effect of testosterone on an array of traits and a variety  of fitness measures can the maintenance of existing  phenotypes be understood.",
