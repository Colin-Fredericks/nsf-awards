Multilayered materials with varying degrees of interfacial order  will be prepared using both UHV electron beam evaporation and  magnetron sputtering.  The effect of structural changes on  interface sensitive transport properties such as the anisotropy  of the electron diffusion constant in non-magnetic multilayers  and the Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) effect in magnetic systems  will be studied.  Controlled changes in the structure of the  interface will be made by combining thermal annealing with in-  situ X-ray diffraction studies, and such changes will be  correlated with associated changes in the transport properties.  This project involves a collaboration between researchers at  Indiana University and the General Motors Research and  Development Center.  %%%  The behavior of electrons at interfaces between two different  materials plays an important role in technologies such as  integrated circuits, magnetic recording, and sensors.  Modern  technology makes possible the production of thin films in which  the atomic composition alternates periodically few atomic layers,  thereby providing an ideal laboratory for studying the electronic  properties of interfaces.  The large concentration of interfaces  in such \"multilayered materials\" can cause their properties to be  quite different from those of the corresponding bulk materials.  An example of this can be seen in the recently discovered Giant  Magnetoresistance effect which holds great promise for the  development of new magnetic sensor materials.  Future development  of such materials will require detailed understanding of how  their electronic properties depend on the atomic structure of the  interfaces between the individual layers.  This project, which  combines research at Indiana University and the General Motors  Research and Development Center, is dedicated to the study of  this fundamental an d technologically important question.  ***",
