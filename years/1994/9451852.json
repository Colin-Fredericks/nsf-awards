 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451852  Lemons  A significant mismatch exists between what traditional A&P courses  offer and what many non-traditional students need. As a result,  these students are not learning how systems function, but are  memorizing many facts about them. We propose innovative  laboratories which present function first in the context of a broad  organizing theme, and then introduce anatomical and physiological  details to explain the function. We begin with hands-on  investigations using physical models and then progress to computer  simulation, anatomical correlations and experiments. This reverses  the traditional order of learning, helping students move from  concrete experiences to formal thinking about dynamic physiological  processes. The centerpiece of these new laboratories are  Multi-purpose Laboratory Workstations based on the Macintosh Quadra  660AV with CD-ROM, running LabView and multi-media software, and  connected to the Virtual Scientist interface which conditions  signals from a variety of transducers and controls experiments and  models. This proposal is complementary to a CCD project entitled,  \"Developing critical thinking and content mastery in  non-traditional students: a comprehensive, technologically enhanced  approach.\" It will allow us to outfit the laboratories with  equipment necessary to implement the new A&P curriculum we are  developing.",
