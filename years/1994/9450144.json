This limited focus has commonly overlooked a large and potentially effective arena for such career development.  Nonformal science education experiences such as those offered by \"science centers\"   museums, nature centers, zoos, aquaria, parks, and visitor's centers    have been reported by scientists to have had considerable formative influences on early development of their careers.  Educators in these science centers, however, typically have not been trained to apply knowledge pertinent to work with students with disabilities.  The purpose of this project is to remedy this oversight by providing instructional materials and conferences for science center staff concerning inclusion of people with disabilities in science activities.  Major activities of the project will be to: (1) assemble, synthesize and translate information pertinent to the education of people with disabilities in nonformal science centers; (2) produce a Resource Guide presenting pertinent information emerging from a symposium on  educational and legal issues pertaining to the full inclusion of people with diverse abilities and needs; (3) conduct a conference for science center educators to disseminate the information developed from the symposium and contained in the Resource Guide to assist these educators in serving people with disabilities effectively; (4) distribute the Resource Guide to all science centers in California; and (5) negotiate with a commercial publisher for national distribution of the Resource Guide.  Project staff will convene a symposium of 15 people with complementary experience and expertise to develop a conceptual plan for the Resource Guide.  The group will include science center educators, representatives from disability related organizations, and experts in science education of students with disabilities.  The participants will recommend materials for the Resource Guide and develop a conceptual organization for the material.  The project will commission three articles for inclusion in the Resource Guide to synthesize knowledge about science education of students with disabilities into a format appropriate for science center educators.  Project staff will compile and edit the Resource Guide containing the three articles and the materials identified by the symposium participants.  The project will use three strategies to disseminate the assembled information to the target audience of science center educators: (1) a dissemination conference for 200 science center educators; (2) printing of the Resource Guide to be distributed to science centers in California; and (3) pursuit of commercial publication of the      h)          0*0*0*         Resource Guide for national distribution.  The project will undertake an extensive evaluation effort which will collect initial formative data on practices and attitudes of science center educators to guide the development and conduct of the project and summative data to assess the project's success. ***",
