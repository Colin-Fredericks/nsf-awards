 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315651  Walker  The isotopic compositions of early diagenetic carbonate cements  (marine and meteoric) will provide evidence to determine Ordovician  paleoceanography and paleoclimate and the isotopic variation  associated with pre-land plant, carbonate meteoric systems.   Careful petrographic, cathodolumenescence, and trace element  studies will allow delineation of the least altered marine cement  phases.  Least altered marine cements from two tropical, platform-  marginal buildups located in paleogeographically divergent  localities from the Llanvirn epoch will be compared with data from  later epochs in the Ordovician to determine whether the variation  in the 818O composition of Ordovician fibrous calcite reflects  either local variations in sea water temperature or secular  variation in the 818O composition of sea water.  The goal of this  part of the research is to determine the 818O composition of  meteoric cement from temperate to polar paleolatitudes, in two  paleogeographic divergent regions, which will be used to assess  Ordovician climatic equability.  Do periods of elevated pCO2, such  as the Ordovician, correspond with periods of climatic equability  as previously hypothesized?  Early meteoric cements from both  tropical and temperate platform carbonate deposits (four regions)  will provide information with regard to the variation of stable  isotopic composition (813C and 818O) associated with exposure  surfaces on a landscape lacking vascular plants.  The ultimate goal  of this part of the research is to fully develop a model for the  stable isotopic composition of pre-vascular plant meteoric  carbonate from the Ordovician that can be broadly applied to early  Paleozoic and older rocks.",
