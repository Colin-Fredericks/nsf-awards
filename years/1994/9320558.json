The theme of the research is the identification and  characterization of C60 and C70 clusters in solid-like states,  solution and supercritical fluids. The solution studies will  focus on the excited state properties of the fullerenes,  especially the discrepancy between experimental and calculated  transition probabilities for both C60 and C70. A mechanism in  which emissions from thermally populated low-lying excited  states are assumed will be evaluated by temperature and  solvent-dependent investigations. Because of low solubilities  of the fullerenes in common solvents, supercritical fluids will  be used in the solvent-dependent studies.  The introduction of  supercritical fluids into fullerene research will also identify  solvent systems in which variable solvent environments can be  created for studies of solvent effects on electron and  charge-transfer reactions of fullerenes.    Research on the photophysics of fullerenes and fullerene  clusters will advance our general understanding of the  excited-state behavior of pi-conjugated molecules and polymers  and will impact emerging technologies such as pi-conjugated  polymer-based light-emitting diodes.",
