 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves a modeling study of NOx  production by intracloud lighting and its subsequent variability in  time and space using the Storm Electrification Model (SEM)  developed at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.  The SEM  is unique in its features as it pertains to studies of cloud  dynamics and microphysics, as well as cloud electrical development,  including a parameterization of the production of lightning.       The study will include four steps.  First, NO will be treated  as an inert gas and a vertical profile will be considered.   The NO  transport within the context of cloud evolution will be evaluated  and used later on to sort out lightning enhancement of NO  concentration.  Second, NO production by lightning will be  simulated using ideas of Borucki and Chameides (1984), without any  reactive chemistry.  Several parameter studies will be performed in  order to find answers to questions such as:  how lightning-produced  NO is transported within the cloud, where the maximum NOx  concentration would most probably be located within the cloud, and  how lightning location influences the NOx distribution within the  cloud.  The third step will include chemistry that leads to the  production of NO2 following the initial production of NO by  lightning.  The last step includes reactions of NO with peroxy  radicals.       This will be the first study that investigates the production  by lightning and subsequent distribution of NOx using a  sophisticated dynamical electrical model of thunderclouds.",
