 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320378  Grier    Technical abstract:  The experimental program addresses the physics  of colloidal suspensions through a combination of digital video  microscopy, optical trapping, and laser light scattering.  Systems  to be investigated include highly charged polystyrene microspheres  and superparamagnetic ferrofluid emulsion droplets.  Areas of  particular interest include:  (1) precision measurements of the  interparticle potential; (2) analysis of structural and dynamical  processes responsible for phase transitions in supercooled  monodisperse colloidal suspensions; (3) analysis of phase  transitions in bidisperse colloidal suspensions focusing on  metastability of disordered solids; (4) effects of phase behavior  of modulated substrate potentials simulated by optical interference  patterns; (5) microscopic kinetics of phase transitions in quenced  single-layer ferrofluid emulsions.    Non-technical abstract:  The experimental program examines  colloidal suspensions on three levels:  (1) as distinct states of  matter; (2) as easily studied analogs for conventional materials  and (3) for their self-ordering properties which hold promise for  nanofabrication, nonlinear optics, and other advanced applications.   Anticipated practical benefits include (1) a method for determining  the microscale interactions in commercial colloidal suspensions;  (2) improved understanding of the \"atomic\"-scale processes  responsible for phase transitions, particularly in the  technologically important case of rapid solidification; and (3)  improved understanding of the microscopic structure, dynamics, and  phase transitions of binary alloy systems.  ***",
