 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412174  Turner       Graduate student Alan Prather, under the direction of faculty  adviser Billie Turner at the University of Texas, is conducting a  combined field and laboratory study of the tropical plant genus  Cobaea of the phlox family, Polemoniaceae.  The group is estimated  to include ca. 20 species distributed in the American tropics, with  most species occurring only in small, isolated populations  primarily on mountain slopes.  The floral morphology of these  species is diverse and often spectacular, the plants usually  producing large blossoms that are hypothesized to be bat  pollinated.  In addition to morphological study of floral, fruit,  and vegetative features, the student is analyzing pollen by  scanning electron microscopy, to acquire new characters for  taxonomic discrimination.  Also, methods of DNA sequencing of the  nuclear ribosomal regions called ITS (internal transcribed spacers)  are being employed to collect comparative nucleotide data across  all species, for estimation of mutation differences and  reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships.       The combination of molecular and morphological approaches to  the study of all extant species of a neotropical genus promises an  improved classification for these plants, insight to their  genealogical affinities, and understanding of the pathways by which  floral features have diversified in relation to pollinating agents.",
