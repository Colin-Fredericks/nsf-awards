 "awd_abstract_narration": "Edmondson  9317614  This proposal is to investigate the possible catalytic role of a  phosphoseryl residue in the catalytic mechanism of xanthine  hydroxlation to uric acid by xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase.   Previous studies have shown the phosphoseryl oxygens to be labelled  with H2180 in milk xanthine oxidase on substrate turnover.  This  line of investigation will be expanded to determine if the 190  labelled phosphoseryl residue is transferred to the substrate to  form 190 labelled uric acid when the reaction is carried out in  H2160.  The phosphoseryl peptides will be isolated from chicken  liver xanthine dehydrogenase and from milk xanthine oxidase and  sequenced.  The peptide sequence around these residues will then be  located in the known sequence of the chicken enzyme and the known  sequences of the rat or Drosophila enzymes to determine if they are  located about the Molybdenum-cofactor binding domain.  These  experiments will critically test the feasibility of the hypothesis  of a catalytic involvement of the phosphoseryl residues in this  class of molybdoenzymes.  %%%  This project addresses a hypothesis of a potentially new function  of phosphorylated amino acid residues in the detailed molecular  mechanism of molybdoenzyme catalysis.  Peptide sequence analysis of  phosphopeptides will be isolated from proteolytic digests of  chicken liver and bovine milk xanthine oxidizing enzymes, their  amino acid sequences determined, and their respective locations in  the respective amino acid sequences of known xanthine oxidizing  enzymes determined.  This information will determine if they are  located near the domains of the enzyme thought to contain the  active site molybdenum cofactor.  The pathway for H2160  incorporation into the product (uric acid) of the enzyme catalyzed  reaction will be followed by monitoring 180 labelling of the  phosphoseryl phosphate residue and the uric acid product by mass  spectrometry.  These experiments should provide definitive evidence  as to whether the  phosphoseryl residue in xanthine oxidizing  enzymes functions in a catalytic role.  If this hypothesis proves  correct, it would be the first demonstration of such a function for  enzyme phosphorylation.  ***",
