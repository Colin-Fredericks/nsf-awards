The proposed activity is to conduct research to  study and evaluate  the grinding damage to components by using the magnetic Barkhausen  effect measurements.   The Center for Grinding Research at the  University of Connecticut will be responsible for acquisition of  specimens, X-ray characterization and surface grinding.  The Center  for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University will be  responsible for performing the Barkhausen effect characterization  of the material, computer analysis of the signals from the  material, identification of relevant Barkhausen signal parameters  for evaluation of grinding damages, and correlation of results with  X-ray diffraction data.    This project is being cost shared with the Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Grinding at the University of  Connecticut.    The Program Director recommends Iowa State University be awarded  $50,000 for 24 months to conduct a \"TIE\" project with the  University of Connecticut.",
