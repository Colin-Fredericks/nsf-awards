 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interacting random systems (some of which are known as random  cellular automata) are random processes which describe the  collective behavior of many components, placed in a d-dimensional  discrete space and interacting with each other in a discrete or  continuous time.  This research will further develop the method  of branching contours in order to examine the asymptotic behavior  of interacting random systems, in which the set of states of a  single component is infinite (a line, a circle).  Computer  simulation of interacting random systems will be used as a  preliminary step for obtaining rigorous results.  Interacting random systems (some of which are known as random  cellular automata) are now often used now to simulate the  behavior and properties of those real objects whose  multi-component structure cannot be ignored.  They are used  extensively in mathematical modeling of physical, chemical,  biological and other systems.  The importance of interacting  random systems is widely acknowledged.  Computer simulations of  various kinds of interacting systems now abound around the world,  but rigorous results in this area are not so rich as in older  branches of mathematics, because straightforward application of  traditional mathematical methods brings only limited success in  this new field.  This research will investigate the mathematical  properties of interacting random systems, especially their  qualitative and asymptotic behavior using both classical methods  from different areas of mathematics and those newly developed.",
