 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408923  Ward    This  research  describes strategies for controlled heterogeneous  nucleation   and   growth  of  organic  crystals   at   molecular  interfaces,  with  emphasis on the use  of  substrates  based  on  specific  crystal faces of molecular crystals, and self-assembled  films  prepared from organosulfur and organosilane reagents.  The  proposed  work  will demonstrate that enhanced nucleation  rates,  specific  growth orientations, and polymorph selectivity  can  be  achieved through the use of properly designed substrates. In  the  case  of molecular crystal substrates, these characteristics will  be   examined   in   the  context  of  ledge-directed   epitaxial  nucleation, in which prenucleation aggregates are stabilized  and  oriented by interfacial interaction between two low energy planes  of  the  aggregate  and a geometrically similar substrate  ledge.  Organosulfur    and   organosilane   films   provide    molecular  functionality capable of specifically interacting with functional  groups of molecules in the prenucleation aggregate. Atomic  force  microscopy  of  dynamic, in situ, crystal  growth  will  also  be  examined.  It  is  anticipated that these studies  will  lead  to  greater  understanding  of the critical factors  responsible  for  nucleation  and  growth  of organic crystals,  and  the  rational  design  of  solid  substrates for controlled  crystallization  of  technologically important reagents and materials.  %%%  Molecular  crystals,  defined as solids consisting  of  molecular  components  assembled  in  the crystalline  state  by  weak,  but  numerous intermolecular interactions, exhibit numerous properties  of   fundamental  and  technological  interest.   These   include  electrical  conductivity, superconductivity  and  ferromagnetism,  nonlinear   optical   behavior,  pharmaceutical   activity,   and  photographic  sensitizers. The interest in these  materials  also  stems  from  the  ability to rationally control  bulk  properties  through  molec ular  design, a strategy commonly  referred  to  as  \"crystal  engineering.\"  While there has been considerable  study  of   the  intermolecular  interactions  that  direct  solid-state  packing in molecular crystals, investigations of their nucleation  and  growth, particularly at the molecular level, has been rather  limited.   This  research  describes  strategies  for  controlled  heterogeneous  nucleation  and  growth  of  organic  crystals  at  molecular  interfaces,  with emphasis on the  use  of  substrates  based  on  specific  crystal  faces of  molecular  crystals,  and  self-assembled films prepared from organosulfur and  organosilane  reagents.  The  proposed  work  will  demonstrate  that  enhanced  nucleation  rates,  specific growth orientations,  and  polymorph  selectivity can be achieved through the use of properly  designed  substrates.  ***",
