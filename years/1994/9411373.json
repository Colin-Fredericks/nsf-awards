Conference topics include sessions that  deal with environmentally significant issues in agricultural  waste management.  The applicant will present a paper on his  work with pollution control and energy recovery using an  anaerobic process for treatment of dairy wastes.    Agricultural wastes are a significant source of pollution to  environmental resources of land, water and air.  These  wastes are typically a diffuse, non-point source, control  over which is becoming of increasingly greater importance as  point sources become controlled by regulation, minimization  and/or treatment systems.  Results of the applicant's  participation in this conference are expected to assist in  determining the nature of research that could be applied to  addressing pollution problems posed by agricultural wastes.  ***",
