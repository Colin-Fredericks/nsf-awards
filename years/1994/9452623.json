An innovative feature of the laboratory development effort its  incorporation  with the newly legislated Rio Grand Valley Center  for Manufacturing located at the University.  The Center will  provide the oportunity for students to access local manufacturers  in support of laboratory exercises.  Manufacturers will also be  able to request that student senior design projects use the  facilities of the laboratory to address the manufacturers  engineering needs.  The faculty is committed to instruction which is based in  laboratory and industrial experience. With approximately 500  manufacturers in the Rio Grande Valley, there are a virtually  endless number of student projects available.  This project will equip the students and faculty with industrial  grade as well as educational grade equipment. Thus, basic concepts  can be demonstrated and experienced on the educational grade  equipment and the student can progress to the exact equipment which  is considered to be an industrial standard.",
