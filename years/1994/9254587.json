The goal of this project is to improve, broaden, and  deepen the scientific, pedagogical, and technological knowledge and  skills of the participating teachers and to enhance their ability  to teach all students more effectively.  It is a three year project  involving 48 Poway Schools sixth, seventh and eighth grade teachers  of science, mathematics, social science and language arts. The  objects are as follows:         o  to design 12 thematic curriculum units that integrate       state-of-the-art technologies as tools for learning that will       contribute to the acquisition of scientific literacy; and         o  to design a site-based staff development process model led       by teachers with a focus on teaching and learning strategies       and authentic ways to assess learning.         District-level directors are active participants in the  project.  Partnerships with local businesses and universities  provide resource support and bring content and process expertise to  the school sites.  Knowledge acquired from this project should  facilitate the successful implementation of science programs in  similar settings.",
