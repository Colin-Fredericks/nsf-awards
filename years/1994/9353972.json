Each of these workshops will feature lectures pertinent to the  topic by nationally recognized scientists (these lectures will  be open to general audiences). Other workshop activities will  include demonstrations, topical discussions, as well as  participation in hands-on laboratory experiments. Participants  (20 for each workshop, selected by the Coordinating Committee)  will be eligible to compete for \"minigrants\" of up to $1,000 to  develop lecture or laboratory material or methods for  incorporation of information presented into their curricula.  Workshop co-chairs will be available for follow-up visits to  institutions in the coalition. At the conclusion of the  project, a two-day Reunion Workshop will be held, at which  participants from all workshops will be invited to make  presentations or participate in discussions describing the  various ways in which information and skills learned via the  workshops have been incorporated into their curricula.  ***",
