 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316624  Willsky       A new prognostic model of the global ocean circulation is  being developed based on the Navier-Stokes equations, using  state-of-the-art parallel computers and languages with an  ultimate goal of creating a global ocean modeling/estimation tool  that can be used for climate research.  A key element of this  endeavor is the development of statistical estimation algorithms  for the assimilation of data into the forward model.  The  combined forward/estimation model could be used to estimate the  state of the ocean form observations constrained by dynamics.   The data of concern is sparse, heterogeneous and multiresolution  and the associated global ocean circulation models are of  gargantuan size, having upwards of 10 ~ 10 degrees of freedom.   The resulting estimation problem is of such a large size that  standard computational procedures become prohibitive. Novel  approaches to statistical modeling and the circulation models are  needed.  We proposed the first steps in this direction through  the establishment of a collaboration involving physical  oceanographers and probabilistic modeling and statistical  inference specialists.  The short term focal point of this  collaboration is the definition and solution of a series of  subproblems designed to foster understanding insight, and mutual  communication and in the process advance the state of the art in  both data assimilation for global ocean modeling and statistical  modeling and estimation of random fields.  ***",
