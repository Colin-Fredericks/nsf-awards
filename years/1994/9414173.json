 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414173  Walker     The objective of this work is to provide computer engineering students with a current background in algorithms and software for computer-aided design (CAD) and test of integrated systems.  An integrated set of courseware and lecture notes is used in two senior-level courses on CAD and test.  The courseware consists of small, modular CAD and test programs with facilities for algorithm visualization.  The software is designed so that students can easily modify it and observe its internal operation, to gain insight into the algorithms and data structures.  Technology transfer to other universities is achieved through cooperation with sister institutions and teaching workshops.  An electronic users group provides continuous shared learning for instructors and students.  The courseware and lecture notes are implemented for easy deployment and modification, and are suitable for in-class demonstrations.  The outcome is graduating computer engineers who have the knowledge and skills to understand the operation, capabilities, and limitations of the latest CAD and test tools, to have the background to sensibly use such tools and to develop new tools.  Such students can immediately begin productive work in the electronics and design automation industries, and keep up with their rapid advances.  ***",
