This center will be based on  a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 MIR, NIR, NIR-Raman Fourier Transfer  Spectrometer. We shall collect and develop a set of experiments  designed to instruct students on all aspects of modern vibrational  spectroscopy throughout their undergraduate education. As freshmen,  students will learn how to use MIR to  determine the identity of an  unknown. In organic chemistry, they will learn to interpret both  MIR and Raman spectra and underst and the advantages of each  technique in structure elucidation.     Experiments in physical  chemistry will instruct them on the theoretical and physical  origins of all three forms of         vibrational spectroscopy,  while our course on instrumental     analysis will expose them to  the use of NIR to predict a physic al property of a substance,  i.e., the octane of gasoline. The power of Raman spectroscopy  applied to biological systems will be  demonstrated in a study of  bilayers in our biochemistry        laboratory. Finally, students  will apply these experiences to  eal-life problems through their  undergraduate research.",
