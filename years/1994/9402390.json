 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural Language and Robot Planning, Part 2:  An Empirical Approach    This project uses a robot which has incomplete knowledge of its  environment and must acquire additional knowledge through sensors  to carry out human commands,  allowing the exploration of issues in  robotic planning and control and natural language interaction with  an active agent.  The speaker giving the directions is provided  with a three-dimensional graphic display that provides knowledge of  how the robot is positioned within the building and how it is  responding to the commands.  The approach to developing the human-  robot system will be to have humans work in pairs, with each acting  as the robot in turn.  In this way, the syntactic and semantic  aspects of the way humans react in this situation and their  interaction with the situation pragmatics can be studied.   Naturally, the directions given depend upon and will be interpreted  within the context of the robot at a given time, so the task is  designed to provide a concrete laboratory for the study of the  problems of context which are difficult enough to raise important  issues but easy enough to expect insights.",
