 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study nonparametric estimation of an  unknown survival function S (=1-F) with interval-censored data.   Suppose the survival time X has a distribution function F.  Let  (Y,Z) be the random censoring interval.  The observations are  (L1,R1),...,(Ln,Rn), which are i.i.d. random vectors from a  population (L,R), where L=R=X if X is not inside the interval  (Y,Z) and (L,R)=(Y,Z) otherwise.  Interval-censored data arise  quite naturally in medical follow-up studies or in industrial  life-testing.  To date, there is no closed form expression for  the generalized maximum likelihood estimator (GMLE).  The  investigator, jointly with Wong, is proposing an estimator  obtained by a redistribution-to-the-center method, called the  RTCE.  The RTCE has an explicit expression and is a GMLE in many  cases.  The funding of this proposal would lead to an explicit  expression of a GMLE in a more general interval censorship model  rather than these special cases, and a better understanding of  the properties of the GMLE and the RTCE.  These results then lead  to a more convenient and useful estimator than the current  procedure derived from a self-consistent algorithm.                Interval-censored data arise naturally in medical follow-up  studies or in industrial life-testing, for example, in a breast  cancer chemoprevention study in which the effect of a  chemopreventive agent is investigated.  An important question in  such a study is how long a woman can go without taking the agent  before the protective effect of the agent wears off.  Let X  denote the time interval from cessation of use of the agent to  the loss of its protective effect qualified as a return to  baseline level of an intermediate biomarker.  When the biomarker  levels are monitored in scheduled intervals, the exact value of X  is usually not known except that it lies in an interval.  The  overall technical objective in this proposal is to carry out  nonparametric estimation of the survival function, i.e., the   probability of X>t for any given time t.",
