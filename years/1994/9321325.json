The       first focuses on the effectiveness of collective choice  mechanisms in implementing policies that determine pollution in a  growth context.  At issue is whether or not the rising income  associated with the process of development will result in more  stringent environmental controls. In the process of analyzing  this issue, the consequences of the irreversibility of pollution  effects and the impact on the intergenerational distribution of  welfare are analyzed.  A related issue is the effect of free  trade both on the overall level of pollution, as well as its  allocation across countries.  Specific interest is focused on  understanding both the short-run effect of a switch to free trade  and the dynamic impact that the development process has on  \"pollution trading\"    The second topic concerns the effects of the design of systems to  protect property rights such as patents, copyrights, and trade  secret laws on the incentives to innovate and the consequences  for the overall rate of development of the economy.  The third  topic analyzes the effect of instability on the growth rate of  the economy.  Among the issues to be investigated is the impact  of volatile tax and spending policies on the average level of  growth through the effect on investment.  ***",
