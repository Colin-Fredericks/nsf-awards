 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weber  9407005   This study will investigate the genes that control the growth of localized groups of cells during the growth of organisms, to produce the final shapes and proportions of specific parts in the adult.  The project will study these genes by using many replicated measurements of the proportions of wings in Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly), combined with methods of marking and identifying chromosome regions so that the effect of each region on the adult wing shape can be distinguished from effects of other chromosome regions.  By this approach, a complete map of the chromosomes will be assembled, showing the locations of the genes which control the shape of the wing.  This information will help to guide the search for specific DNA sequences with well-defined localized effects on shape.  Since many basic genetic discoveries with applicability to humans have been made using Drosophila, this investigation may also shed light on how genes control form in humans.  The wing of the fruit fly provides ideal material for such studies, because it can easily be projected like a slide to give highly magnified image on a large computerized measuring pad.",
