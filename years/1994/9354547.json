 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354547  LaRose  The purpose of this proposal is to further develop the TEME  (Totally Enclosed Modular Environments) model as the experiential  laboratory of the Human Ecology curriculum. Expanding the TEME  model to include an oceanographic research simulation will enable  Greenfield Community College to provide both college and middle  school students with an opportunity to participate in an exciting  hands-on science education program that integrates broad scientific  content and effective group skills, providing a practical framework  for understanding ecological and social problems.  The original  TEME curriculum model features a simulated shuttle orbiter  experience as a metaphor for \"Spaceship Earth.\" The TEME model will  be adapted to the study of the oceans, using a deep sea submersible  simulation as a vehicle for exploring this vast and still  mysterious environment. We will add new content to the module  program and upgrade the technology to run the simulation. In  addition to Greenfield Community College faculty,  curriculum  specialists, and middle school teachers are involved in the  curriculum development. We will develop written curricular  materials for middle schools as well as software that can be used  on ordinary PCs in the schools.  The impact on students will  include greater motivation, improved math/science skills  development, greater clarity of career goals, and a broader  ecological awareness.   ***",
