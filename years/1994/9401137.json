 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401137     Matumoto       Matumoto will investigate analysis concerning the  representation theory of real reductive Lie groups.  Of  particular interest will be use of representation theory in the  study of automorphic forms.  He will also investigate induced  representations from drived functor modules and restrictions of  representations.  These problems arise naturally in the study of  the unitary dual of reductive groups, one of the main subjects of  the area.         The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in  twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the  representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact up  on mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number  theory, and upon the oretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics and elementary particle physics.  ***",
