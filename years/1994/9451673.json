An effort has been made to design several  experiments around recent research developments to give students  the flavor of modern inorganic chemistry. This proposal requests  funds to purchase a 200 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance spectrometer that will be utilized extensively for  characterization of reaction products in this laboratory. This  laboratory is a required course for all chemistry majors (taken by  80-100 students per year), and will serve as a vehicle for the  education of our majors on the topic of Multinuclear FT-NMR  Spectroscopy. To handle the large numbers of students involved in  our program, the NMR spectrometer will be equipped with an  automatic sample loader, automation software, and a quad probe that  will provide routine access to 1H, 31P, l9F, and 13C spectra. Although  student involvement in routine data acquisition with this  instrument will be minimal, the students will be intimately  involved in working-up their own data in the 30-station Chemistry  Department personal computer laboratory. The program that we are  establishing will serve as a model for bringing modern NMR  spectroscopy into other programs with similarly large numbers of  chemistry majors. Furthermore, this same instrumentation will be  used to enhance the educational experiences of students in other  laboratories where the numbers are reasonably small, including the  honors organic laboratory, the polymer synthesis laboratory, and  the advanced organic synthesis laboratory.",
