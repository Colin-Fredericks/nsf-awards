 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project studies combinatorial optimization, with emphasis  on problems related to commodity flow and minimum-ratio cuts.  Deeper  understanding of the combinatorial structure of these problems will result in  improved algorithms for a variety of applications, including graph bisection,  small area VLSI layout, scheduling, and routing.  All of the currently known  algorithms for finding exact solutions to multicommodity flow are very slow.  These algorithms are based on general linear programming (LP) techniques and do  not take advantage of the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem.  Applying general LP techniques to solving such problems leads to even slower  algorithms.  The main goal of this project is to find  alternative approaches to solving multicommodity flow and related   problems.  The goal is to improve both sequential and parallel complexity.    In many applications, solving a multicommodity flow is only a first step in  approximately solving an NP-complete problem; in the majority of such cases  there is no need to have an exact solution of the multicommodity flow problem.  One of the focuses of the project is to develop the design of   efficient approximation algorithms.      Another natural application of the multicommodity flow methods is  in the area of routing in distributed communication networks.  For example,  problems related to managing available bandwidth can be stated as variants of  multicommodity flow, where the information rate corresponds to flow and the  bandwidth of every link corresponds to its capacity.  The distributed,   real-time nature of communication networks presents several   challenging obstacles that do not exist in an off-line,   sequential setting.  Among them is the fact that not  all the information is known in advance, which means that the algorithms have to  work on-line.  Second, there is usually no `manager` node that has a complete  information about the network and that makes all the decisions.  Therefore, the  algorithms should work with partial information.",
