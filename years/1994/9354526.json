The course, dubbed \"The MATCH Program\" to reflect its  origins, will be offered to students who require preparatory  courses in order to succeed in college, because of deficiencies in  the their educational background or because they are returning to  their higher education several years after graduation from high  school. The impetus for the curriculum comes from a recognition  that such students, who may be very important in the composition of  the nation's technical personnel in the future, will likely do  better if these courses are combined so that mathematics and  chemistry instruction reinforce each other explicitly.  The  proposed work will be conducted over a three year period, with a  planned transition from a small developmental program through to  one that can be used at other institutions. Cooperative learning  strategies and laboratory program will be key elements of the  instructional effort. The development, evaluation, and  implementation plans all include close consultation with faculty  from other schools, who have either had experience with similar  programs or who recognize a similar need for this program for their  students. Finally, a careful and rigorously controlled assessment  program will be included.  ***",
