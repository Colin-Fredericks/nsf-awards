 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program provides   support for Professor Weber's investigations of the fundamental issues   and problems associated with the development of useful membrane sensors   for organic anions and the development of microextraction devices for   these anions.  Potentiometric sensors for cations have been successfully   implemented for a variety of species, and the results have had a dramatic   impact in the fields of bioanalytical chemistry and biotechnology.    Professor Weber proposes to create new sensors for anionic species by   synthesizing new artificial receptors for the selective extraction of   anions into plasticized polymer media.  New anion sensors for ions such   as carboxylates, glutamate and aspartate are urgently needed in such   diverse areas as neurochemistry, the food industry and biotechnology.    This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support   research into the development of practical membrane sensors for organic   anions.  The goal is to create a suite of anion sensors similar in   function to those already existing for cationic species.  The research   will involve the synthesis and characterization of artificial receptors   which will selectively extract anions into polymeric membranes.  The   sensors will be used to detect anions such as acidic neurotransmitters,   decomposition products in food, and waste products in bioreactors",
