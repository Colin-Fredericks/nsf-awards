 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452036  Drossman  The Colorado College Chemistry and Physics faculty are building a modern laboratory program to  support our strong undergraduate curriculum. Unfortunately, we do not currently study laboratory  applications of lasers in chemistry and physics. Our goal is to introduce all of our physical science  students to lasers. In this proposal, we request funds for laser and optical equipment to alleviate curricular  deficiencies in the chemistry and physics laboratories. A corridor display will be constructed in the main  entrance to the science building to capture visiting students' interest and to build familiarity with lasers.  Laser-based labs will be added to supplement current offerings in general chemistry, analytical chemistry,  physical chemistry, chemical instrumentation, modern experimental physics, modern optics and in classes  in our new interdisciplinary majors in biochemistry and environmental chemistry. Fundamentals of optical  design will be added as a laboratory topic in instrumental analysis. Student instrumentation projects  incorporating lasers will provide new opportunities for them to develop and evaluate their own  instruments. Projects in flash photolysis, thermal lens calorimetry, fast chemical lifetime measurement,  and Raman spectroscopy will be added to enhance the lab curriculum in physical and inorganic chemistry.  Experiments in phase conjugation and two photon absorption will be added for physics majors. Projects  in thermal lens and fluorescence detection, flow cytometry, ligand binding and fluorescence polarization  will be added to the new laboratories in biophysical and bioanalytical chemistry. Experiments in remote  sensing and photolysis of organic pollutants will be developed for use in the recently upgraded  environmental science program. Finally, new experiments will be developed for an experimental \"Topics  in Lasers\" class. The proposed laser equipment will also be used for senior student research projects.",
