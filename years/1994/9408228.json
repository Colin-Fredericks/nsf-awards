Although it is understood how materials are  transported among the units of plants, this process is  poorly known in colonial animals, where the transport moves  resources among units that show division of labor between  feeding, reproduction and defense. This study examines  whether the amounts and rates at which materials are moved  among the units constrain performance. In the marine  bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, defensive units are  induced by the proximity of predators and competitors. The  construction of defensive units slows growth and this  research will investigate whether construction of the  defensive units also changes transport of a radioisotpoic  marker in the colony. Although costs of defense are widely  cited as a limitation on the types of defenses organisms  deploy, in no organism has the mechanism underlying the cost  been demonstrated.  ***",
