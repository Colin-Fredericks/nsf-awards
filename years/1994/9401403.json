 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zhou  9401403          This project is concerned with mathematical research on  problems arising in the theory of nonlinear partial differential  equations.  Several topics will be addressed.  Included in them  is an analysis of the zero dispersion limit for the focusing  nonlinear Schrodinger equation.  The focusing equation and many  other integrable systems have nonself-adjoint scattering  operators.  This type of zero dispersion problem is not well  understood.  Work will also be done on a perturbation theory for  nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  This will be done through  efforts to obtain relationships between the maximal norm and a  weighted quadratic norm of the potential.  Once this is done, the  perturbed problem can be solved by a method of McKean and Shatah.    A third line of investigation will examine higher order equations  and solitons.  Equations in the Gelfand-Dikii hierarchy give rise  to isospectral deformations which can be reduced to the study of  a Riemann-Hilbert problem.  Work will be done analyzing the long  time behavior of those Gelfand-Dikii flows for which the jump  matrices are oscillatory.  The new features of this study  includes the larger size of the matrices and the jump data  exhibiting singularities of different orders at the origin; from  this shock regions can be developed.          Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.",
