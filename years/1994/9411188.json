 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pressing problem in efforts to improve numerical extended range  weather forecasts is to better predict the establishment and  breakdown of persistent weather regimes.  While much effort has  been devoted to studying the maintenance of these regimes, less is  known about their life cycles.       The principal investigator will conduct a comprehensive  diagnostic study of weather regime transitions in version 2 of the  Community Climate Model (CCM) of the National Center for  Atmospheric Research.  Specifically, the PI will attempt to  identify the dynamical and physical mechanisms responsible for  regime transitions in the midlatitudes.  The first task will be to  validate the statistics, structure and time evolution of persistent  large-scale flow anomalies occurring in extended integrations of  the CCM2.  Characteristics of the simulated events then will be  compared with observational analyses.  Using model \"data\" allows  the PI to avoid the problems inherent in observational studies as  nonconservative processes and secondary circulations which are  known explicitly in the model and there are no difficulties with  sparse or uncertain observations.  ***",
