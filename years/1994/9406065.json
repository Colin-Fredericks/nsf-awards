The  specific structures to be investigated are: (1) the \"0.3\" protein  of bacteriophage T7; (2) the RNA-binding protein L9 from the  prokaryotic ribosome.  In each case, the structural information  obtained will provide insight into the mechanism used by the  protein in performing its particular function. The 12.5 kDalton  03 gene product of bacteriophage T7 is unique in its ability to  bind to E. coli restriction enzymes and RNA polymerase. The  protein performs the task of inhibiting the E. coli restriction  system, thus permitting the T7 phage to safely inject its genome  into the host cells. There is evidence suggesting that the 0.3  protein may function by mimicking the DNA structures that are  normally recognized by the E. coli  restriction system. The  structure of the 0.3 protein will be determined by NMR methods,  providing insight into the mechanism by which it binds and  inhibits DNA-processing enzymes. L9 is a highly conserved primary  RNA-binding protein from the prokaryotic ribosome. In the  proposed research plan, NMR and x-ray data will be used to supply  structural constraints, and the protein structure will be  determined by a simultaneous refinement against both the NMR and  x-ray data, or \"joint-refinement\". This joint-refinement approach  should yield a much higher resolution structure, in which both  RNA-binding sites are well defined. This analysis will provide a  model as to how NMR and x-ray data can be practically and  logically combined to determine the structure of a single protein  molecule.  %%%  The principal goal of the proposed research is to analyze the  structures of two unusual and biologically significant protein  molecules. The specific structures to be investigated are: 1) a  protein that is unique in its ability to bind to and inhibit the  function of DNA-processing enzymes; and 2) a protein with the  ability to  recognize and bind specific sequences of ribosomal  RNA. In each case, the structural information obtained will  provide insight into the mechanism used by the protein in  performing its particular function. An additional goal of the  proposed project is to develop new methods for determining  protein structures, using the combined data from nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) experiments and x-ray diffraction experiments. It  is anticipated that these new methods will be useful in  determining protein structures with greater accuracy.  ***",
