Currently, the primary emphasis in  this course is placed on mechanical skills such as differentiation,  integration, and algebraic manipulations. However, the primary  emphasis should focus  Structured laboratory investigations,  coupled with a computer algebra system to assist with purely  mechanical aspects, are being developed so that the students will  focus more on the fundamental concepts of calculus and on the  development of high-level problem-solving skills.  Previously, this course was taught assuming that students did not  use computational tools beyond a calculator. As a result, it was  difficult for them to obtain numerical insight. However, ready  access to a computer algebra system allows new types of activities  to be used, providing a more rounded view of the subject  matter--including graphical, numerical, and analytical aspects.  Approximately 15 Maple worksheets are being developed. These  worksheets will be made available nationally through the  Interactive Mathematics Text Project and through internet services.",
