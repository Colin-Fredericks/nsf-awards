 "awd_abstract_narration": "9254922  Adams    This project explores a way of forming a link between theories of  problem solving and theories of instruction on problem solving.  A  single problem-solving framework is used to analyze the discourse  patterns of the teacher, of students in small-group problem-solving  sessions, and of individual students solving problems.  The  problem-solving framework focuses on five areas of knowledge: (a)  mathematical content, (b) problem-solving strategies, (c) beliefs  about mathematics, problem-solving and the self, (d) control of  cognition and (e) discourse knowledge.  Three instructional units  of approximately three weeks each are identified before the  beginning of the school year for two middle-school classrooms.   These instructional units are the focus of concentrated data  collection in which whole class instruction and small group problem  solving are video taped.  Additional classroom observations are  made on a regular basis throughout the school year.  Also four  students from each classroom are video taped as they complete  think-aloud problem-solving interviews once a month throughout the  year.  Problems used in the problem-solving interviews are  coordinated with the instructional units in order to from  hypotheses about the connection between classroom discourse  patterns and process used by individual students.  ***",
