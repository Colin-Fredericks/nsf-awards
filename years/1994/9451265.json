 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451265  Saltarelli  The purpose of the current project is to expand the breadth and  diversity of the laboratory component in the human physiology  offerings at Central Michigan University to meet the specific  needs of students in undergraduate and pre-professional health  science curricula. The program specific needs and individual  student needs for laboratory instruction in human physiology  require a versatile laboratory system that can serve a diverse  population of students with individualized laboratory  experiences. The proposed equipment will upgrade the laboratory  learning experience of students in health fitness, health  education, sports medicine, pre-physical therapy, pre-medicine,  nursing, and pre-dental students by offering a wider variety of  laboratory experiences which could then be tailored and chosen to  meet individual and program needs. The equipment will also  greatly expand the capacity of the university to meet the  specific laboratory needs of the non-traditional student who  requires greater flexibility and self-direction in obtaining  laboratory instruction.     The laboratory system which is being proposed is the Thorton  Modular Physiograph System. This system was chosen because of its  versatility and user friendly components. It enables the student  to directly observe a wide variety of physiological phenomena in  discrete laboratory experiences which can be specifically applied  to the various clinically oriented programs. The Thorton system  is a computer based system which allows for diversity in its  applications to specific programs (specifics are discussed in  narrative). The versatility of this system would also enable the  instructor to develop individualized and self-directed laboratory  experiences to meet the needs of the expanding population of  non-traditional students requiring instruction in the health  related professions.",
