New positions have been allocated, space has been made available in a modern building, generous start up funds have been given, and a plant biology field station has been built. Several collaborations between the new faculty members have already emerged, and the group will focus its research activities along two major lines: (1) membrane proteins and signal transduction, and (2) regulation of gene activity. The group consists of one senior faculty (Maarten J. Chrispeels), and four recently appointed faculty (Robert J. Schmidt, Nigel Crawford, Martin Yanofsky and Julian Schroeder). Although excellent functional laboratories are available for the faculty, several major pieces of equipment are required because our research groups have expanded very fast and because several pieces of shared equipment are now too old or too heavily used to satisfy our needs. The shared equipment we wish to purchase will promote the interactions between the laboratories and facilitate the training of graduate students and postdocs, besides having a vital role in research projects discussed in this proposal. The items of equipment include a patch clamp workstation, a luminometer and an ultracentrifuge.   u    ~     @                                                                                                                                                         9317648  Chrispeels  The Department of Biology of the University of California, San Diego, has made a commit ment to establish                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '           '           '                F                             \\             \\                                 ;    CG Times    Symbol  & Arial  1 Courier  0 MS LineDraw       W   W         W       U                 h     q:  q:                X         5        Deseree King, BIR Deseree King, BIR",
