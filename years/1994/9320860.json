 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320860  Hess    Technical abstract:  It is proposed to study the thermodynamic  properties of multilayer films of a number of adsorbates on uniform  surfaces of graphite and other substrates.  Ellipsometry will be  used to measure the film coverage as a function of gas pressure,  while the substrate temperature is regulated.  This will provide  direct information on microscopic wetting properties, layering,  layer critical points, and indirect evidence regarding surface  melting of the adsorbate.  Adsorbates which will be studied include  deuterium containing isotopic molecules of hydrogen, for comparison  with previous work on molecular hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon  monoxide.  Gas mixtures will be studied with emphasis on solubility  in films and displacement of pre-plated layers.  Infrared  absorption by adsorbate vibrational modes will provide additional  information on the film composition and molecular orientation.   Substrates in addition to graphite will include gold and cleaved  faces of ionic crystals of the sodium chloride structure.    Non-technical abstract:  It is proposed to study films of one to a  few molecular layers in thickness formed on an atomic smooth  crystal surface (the substrate) when it is exposed to, and in  equilibrium with, a gas (the adsorbate).  Substrates will include  graphite, magnesium oxide, and other crystals, while the adsorbates  include hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, rare gases, and  hydrocarbons.  An optical techniques is used to measure the film  thickness and its dependence on gas pressure and on temperature.   At low temperatures the film thickness typically increases in sharp  steps due to the addition of successive layers of molecules, until  the pressure is reached at which macroscopic crystals of the  adsorbate can form.  These studies provide information on the  thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional crystals, and the  ability of various adsorbates to \"wet\" the substrates, that is, to  form thick uniform films on them.  In addition,  it will be possible  to measure roughening of a layer at the surface of adsorbate  crystals at temperatures below their bulk melting temperature.  ***",
