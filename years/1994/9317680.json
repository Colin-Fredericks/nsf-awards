 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317680  Babcock    This research program explores the ways in which grain boundary  segregated elements affect the atomic structure of grain boundaries  in metals and oxides.  Characterization techniques include high  resolution, phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  imaging, high resolution Z-contrast scanning TEM imaging, high  spatial resolution x-ray and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and  high speed position-sensitive atom probe microscopy to determine:   (a) the atomic-scale distribution of the segregated solute both  parallel and perpendicular to the grain boundary, and (b) the  influence of the segregated solute on the atomic packing units of  the host grain boundary.  These studies are conducted on  bicrystalline samples of controlled grain boundary crystallography,  controlled doping, and simple, but representative, geometry.  Lead-  doped nickel oxide and gold-doped iron have been chosen for the  initial experiments.  These two alloy systems are model materials  whose behavior represent that of a broad range of compounds and  alloys.  The experimental results will be compared with  contemporary models for grain boundary structure.  The thrust of  these analyses is to determine whether or not a fundamental  structural mechanism exists by which segregated atoms influence  grain boundary properties.    %%%  Such knowledge is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms by  which grain boundary segregated solutes control a broad range of  grain boundary and, therefore, bulk properties in engineering  materials.  ***",
