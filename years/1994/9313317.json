 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313317  Corpe  This is an award to provide renewed support for a project the  objective of which is to characterize the sequestering effect of  polyphosphate bodies in picoplankton populations of aquatic  environments.  In previous research supported under NSF Grant No.  91-17165, the investigators developed an analytical technique  involving x-ray dispersive analysis in conjunction with use of  electron microscopy  to study the elemental composition of  individual cells and their intracellular components.  In this  renewal project, the investigator will focus on the various  mechanisms by which trace and heavy metals are taken up and  immobilized within the microbial consortium that makes up natural  aquatic environments.  The work is expected to result in the  isolation of numerically important, metal immobilizing species  from sediments contaminated by heavy metals and determination of  their propensity for metal uptake.    The role of microorganisms in the environmental cycling of metals  is of importance in bioleaching, biosorption and related  bioprocessing of municipal and industrial wastewaters.  Metals  are also present in sediments of streams, ponds, lakes and  estuaries where they can adversely affect water quality.  Results  of this research may be applied to modeling the diffusion,  dispersion and interactions of heavy metals of significance in  affecting the quality of environmental waters and in design of  processes and systems to decontaminate sediments and soil.  ***",
