 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, is  concerned with the synthesis, and the physical and chemical characterization of polynuclear  compounds that contain both transition elements (M) and heavy non-transition metal elements  (E) as an integral part of the cluster framework.  Synthetic strategies to be followed include 1)  substitution of E-bound halide in existing cluster compounds, 2) homolytic bismuth-carbon bond  cleavage in metallated bismuth compounds to reactive fragments for coupling reactions, 3) redox  reactions on existing stable small clusters to generate reactive fragments that may couple to give  larger fragments, 4) reactions of known Group 9 and 10 metal clusters with \"bare\" bismuth  atoms generated by thermal decomposition of bismuth hydride, 5) the reactions of bismuth and  antimony Zintl ions with transition metal compounds that have readily substituted ligands, and  6) cathodic dissolution of bismuth alloys in the presence of ligands to trap the anticipated small  anionic clusters.    It is increasingly clear that alloys and compounds that contain transition metals and non-metallic  elements have interesting and potentially technologically important electronic and magnetic  properties, and unique catalytic properties.  However, the fundamental aspects of the bonding  interactions between transition metals and heavy non-metallic elements has received little  attention so that interpretation and prediction of properties are currently impossible.  This project  has as its primary objective the acquisition of information concerning interactions of such  elements through the study of cluster compounds that contain bonds between transition metal  atoms and non-metallic elements.  Decomposition reactions of these clusters may also lead to  new alloys with useful properties.",
