 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study seeks to study the fundamental thermo-mechanical aspects of the thermal removal (with and without a setter bed) of multicomponent binders from an injection molded specimen, i.e., the melting and evaporation of multicomponent binders with suspended solid particles.  The nearly consolidated particles remaining at the end of the thermal debinding (with a typical 15% reduction in the volume) can be defect free, when during debinding the internal gas pressure and the tensile stress of the partially liquid saturated non-consolidated porous medium (i.e., suspension system) do not exceed some threshold values. It is propose here to make an in-situ measurement of several thermal and mechanical (including defect formation) characteristics and to make visual observations to identify the phenomena, mechanisms, and regimes in thermal debinding of multicomponent binders in the presence (and absence) of a setter bed.  It is also proposed to use the experimental results to model these phenomena using rigorous treatment of transport, reaction, phase change, and stress-strain in the binder-suspended particles medium and to predict the transient thermo-mechanical aspects within the specimen during debinding. The anticipated results can contribute to the fundamentals of thermal processing of materials and used in the selection of the multicomponent binder and the setter bed according to the specimen size, shape, and properties, and for the control of the gaseous ambient convective temperature and velocity to prevent defect formation (while reducing the processing time and the energy consumed).",
