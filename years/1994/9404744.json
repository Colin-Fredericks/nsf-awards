 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biggins  9404744  The research is an investigation with two related objectives on the  structure and function of the photosynthetic reaction center,  Photosystem 1.  1) The first objective is a continuation of studies on the  mechanism ofinteraction of the core heterodimer, which bears the  cofactors for charge separation and early electron transfer  acceptors, with a small subunit PsaC which carries the terminal  iron sulfur centers. This will be accomplished by creating site  directed mutations in the putative binding domain of the PsaC  subunit in the core heterodimer and on the PsaC subunit itself.  Electron transfer reactions will be followed to determine the  success of the reconstitutions of the heterodimer using PsaC, PsaD  and cluster insertion protocols in vitro.  2) The second objective is a continuation of investigations  concerning the function of phylloquinone as a transient acceptor on  the core heterodimer. The role of the secondary quinone in  Photosystem 1 remains elusive, and we propose experiments to  determine its possible function in the primary photochemistry of  the reaction center. We have shown that the binding site of the  primary quinone involved in forward electron transfer can be  inhibited. We will investigate the inhibition in more detail to  study properties of the quinone binding site and select new  inhibitors. Basic research in this area is important because of the  potential for developing herbicides selective for Photosystem 1.  The third objective on protein design proposed in the original  request will not be pursued because of a lack of sufficient funds  in the award.  %%%  This research to be continued under the auspices of the National  Science Foundation concerns the mechanism of photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is a fundamental process in plant biology whereby  solar energy is used to provide the driving force for the uptake of  carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its conversion into all the  different products needed for the plant. This is the only  form of  biosolar conversion and animal life depends upon this process for  the production of all food. We also rely on this process for the  generation of forest products for construction, paper, packaging  and countless other materials. The origin of all fossil fuels such  as oil, gas and coal now presently being expended was via a  photosynthetic conversion of solar energy by prehistoric plants.  The process of photosynthesis in plants occurs in biological  membranes in the leaf tissue and it is possible to isolate the  solar conversion enzyme systems called reaction centers in the  laboratory. Progress is now being made on details of the atomic  structure of these reaction centers and their chemical function.  The specific work in this project focuses on structure-function  aspects using biochemical techniques to dissociate the reaction  centers into the individual proteins and molecules actively  involved in the solar conversion process so they can be identified  and characterized. Molecular genetic methods are used to make  alterations in these proteins to provide information on their  function.  The justification of research in photosynthesis is that when a  complete understanding of the mechanism of reaction center function  has been elucidated it will lead to:   increased yields of food and biomass for fiber, construction  materials andliquid fuels such as ethyl alcohol which is presently  being used in mixtures with gasoline for cleaner automobile use.   the engineering of devices that would be competitive with  photovoltaic cell for the direct conversion of sunlight into  electricity. the photo-production of hydrogen as a fuel.   the design of selective herbicides for the control of crops and  fores productivity.",
