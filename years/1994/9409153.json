 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409153  Austen-Smith    This research is to continue the investigation on the  informational role of interest groups and its connection to the  giving of campaign contributions on the policy process.    During the initial stages of the research, the investigator  developed a framework that explicitly integrates both campaign  contributions and lobbying, considered in informational terms.   The key idea is that lobbying is predominantly an informational  activity.  Legislators have to make decisions (set agendas, vote,  and so forth) on issues about which they often know relatively  little.  Interest groups, however, are frequently well-informed  about the consequences of particular legislation for their  particular interests; consequently, legislators would like to  become informed by listening to lobbyists.  A principal  implication of the framework was that campaign contributions per  se do not constitute sufficient incentives for a legislator to  grant access to a group that wishes to influence the legislator's  decision by providing salient information.  The reason is that  the legislator has an incentive to listen to those groups who  share his or her policy preferences, irrespective of any monies  they may have given.    This finding suggests the correlation between money and access is  indirect.  Rather than \"buy\" access, groups give money to  candidates whose policy preferences reflect their own so that the  resulting legislature will consist of legislators who will seek  them out on informational grounds, irrespective of any campaign  contributions.  From this perspective, the issues then concern  how groups decide to whom to contribute and how campaign  expenditures influence voting behavior within the electorate.   The research to be undertaken addresses both of these concerns,  focusing on the (indirect) access motivation for contributing and  on the advertising role of campaign expenditures.",
