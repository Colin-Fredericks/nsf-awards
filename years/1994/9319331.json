This  infrastructure is widely available in university, research, and  government institutions.  The Internet and related initiatives  are a key part of the emerging National Research and Education  Network.  While the network is already in place there is considerable work  to be done to make large data archives available over this  infrastructure.   This project investigates techniques by which  the government can make large archives available to the public  over the Internet.  A key goal of the project is to provide an  example for agencies from which they can learn to directly  provide information to the Internet in a cost-effective manner.  This project will develop and demonstrate ways to post large  government data archives on the Internet for access by  researchers and the general public.  The two-year project will  use the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR Database  as a test database and will develop and implement techniques to  provide the low-cost management and dissemination of these data  archives.  The goal of the project is to develop techniques that  can be used directly by government agencies another information  providers, giving these organizations the tools and knowledge to  allow them to place government information on the Internet for  direct access by researchers and the general public.  Secondary  goals o the project are to make key financial archives from the  SEC available to researchers and the general public who would not  otherwise have access to the information.",
