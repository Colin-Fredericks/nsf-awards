 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316040 Gorelick  Understanding and describing subsurface heterogeneity is an important problem in hydrology.  Typically, data are sparse and yet aquifers have properties that vary tremendously in space.  By simultaneously using different tyes of data to delineate aquifer heterogeneities and determine hydraulic parameter values, maps of aquifer properties can be determined that are far more accurate than maps developed based on analysis of each type of data by itself.  In fact, individual analysis of data sets may lead to maps of aquifer properties that are inconsistent with each other.  In order to develop a consistent imate of spatially variable aquifer properties we propose to develop a coupled approach in which cross well seismic tomography is combined with hydraulic head data and solute tracer data.  Measurements from the three independently collected data sets are incorporated into the inverse method through numerical solutions to the equations governing seismic wave propagation, groundwater flow, and solute transport.  We match simulated values to measured values using a \"coupled model\" inverse approach.  Two pilot studies are presented to indicate the logical starting point for this proposed research effort.  We will develop two estimation approaches for aquifer property delineation and apply them to the Savannah River Site, which is well characterized.  Cross well seismic traveltime data, tracer test data, and hydraulic head data have all been collected at this site.  A unified approach will be developed based upon the relative success of our two approaches.",
