This project focuses on the transport of long-chain fatty  acids into cells followed by their enzymatic conversion to  coenzyme A thioesters prior to metabolic utilization.  In  Escherichia coli, these two processes are postulated to be  linked such that the esterification of long-chain fatty  acids provides the driving force for transport.  These  compounds traverse the bacterial cell envelope by a high  affinity, saturable, energy-dependent process that requires  the outer membrane-bound fatty acid binding and transport  protein FadL (product of the fadL gene) and the inner  membrane associated acyl CoA synthetase (product of the fadD  gene).  Acyl CoA synthetase activates fatty acids  concomitant with transport, thereby resulting in their net  accumulation within the cell against a concentration  gradient.  The fadL and fadD genes have been cloned and  sequenced and their respective gene products purified and  characterized.  In this work, the topology of FadL will be  defined using partial proteolysis in isolated outer  membranes and peptide purification and sequencing.  Specific  amino acid residues within FadL involved in fatty acid  binding will be determined using chemical modification and  site-directed mutagenesis.  Amino acid residues within the  fatty acid binding pocket within FadL will be modified using  affinity labeling followed by proteolysis, peptide  purification, and identification of the labeled amino acids.  This will specifically define amino acids within FadL that  comprise the fatty acid binding pocket and thus lay the  groundwork for more detailed studies employing mutagenesis  of the fadL gene.  Collectively, these studies will define  how FadL spans the outer membrane, and which specific amino  acid residues sit within the fatty acid binding pocket.  The  role of acyl CoA synthetase in the transport of exogenous  long-chain fatty acids will al so be further evaluated.  Acyl  CoA synthetase from E. coli has considerable similarity with  its eukaryotic counterparts, particularly in a region of the  enzyme postulated to bind ATP.  Site-directed mutageneis of  the acyl CoA synthetase structural gene will be used to  define whether this region of the enzyme represents the ATP  binding domain.  %%%  Fatty acids are the molecular building blocks of lipids.  As  such, they are essential components of cellular membranes,  as well as important sources of metabolic energy.  Depending  on the cell type, the fatty acids needed by a cell may be  either syntehsized by the cell itself, and/or taken up from  the surrounding milieu.  This project seeks to understand  the biochemical mechanism whereby cells specifically take up  fatty acids from their surroundings, using the  common model  bacterium, Escherichia coli, as a model system.  A  combination of genetic and biochemical approaches will be  used.  The results of these experiments are expected to  expand our understanding of how fatty acids, and large  molecules in general, are specifically transported across  cell membranes.  This kind of information is of fundamental  importance to understanding how cells function.  It is not  difficult to see how this kind of information may have  downstream application to a number of diverse areas of  special interest; examples might include  microbial  physiological ecology, pharmacology, and animal or human  nutrition.  ***",
