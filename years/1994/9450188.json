 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Anne Milbrooke will conduct research and write a biography.   Her topic is Frederick B. Rentschler (1887-1956), an influential  manufacturer of aviation equipment from 1919 to 1956.  She will  investigate what Rentschler did, the environment in which he acted,  the people with whom he interacted, the reasons given for his  actions, and the effects of his actions.  Among the themes she will  explore are the relationships among individual and institution,  management and manufacturing, engineering and innovation,  corporation and Congress, and aviation and American society.      Rentschler's story begins with his early industrial background in  Hamilton, Ohio, and his transition to aviation through Army  assignments during World War I and subsequent appointments at the  Wright Aeronautical Corporation.  In 1925 he founded the Pratt &  Whitney Aircraft Company, and a few years later he joined William  E. Boeing in organizing United Aircraft & Transport Corporation.   In 1934 Rentschler organized United Aircraft Corporation.  From  corporate headquarters he managed the Pratt & Whitney, Chance  Vought, Hamilton Standard, and Sikorsky manufacturing divisions.   He dealt with military customers and the Congress that also had  commercial customers.  Rentschler was chairman of United Aircraft  Corporation until his death in 1956.    Interactive activities over a two-year period include:  teaching  courses entitled \"Women in Science and Technology,\" \"The American  Century of Science and Technology,\" and \"Made in the USA - a  History of Manufacturing.  Dr. Milbrooke will present seminars on  her research.",
