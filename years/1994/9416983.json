 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416983  Gupta    This is a \"TIE\" project on the topic of \"Assessment of Barkhausen  Effect Measurement for Evaluation of Ground Steel Components,\" to  be conducted by the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  for Grinding at the University of Connecticut and Iowa State  University's  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Non-Destructive Evaluation.    The proposed activity is to conduct research to  study and evaluate  the grinding damage to components by using the magnetic Barkhausen  effect measurements.   The Center for Grinding Research at the  University of Connecticut will be responsible for acquisition of  specimens, X-ray characterization and surface grinding.  The Center  for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University will be  responsible for performing the Barkhausen effect characterization  of the material, computer analysis of the signals from the  material, identification of relevant Barkhausen signal parameters  for evaluation of grinding damages, and correlation of results with  X-ray diffraction data.    This project is being cost shared with the Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa  State University.    The Program Director recommends the University of Connecticut be  awarded $50,000 for 24 months to conduct a \"TIE\" project with Iowa  State University.",
