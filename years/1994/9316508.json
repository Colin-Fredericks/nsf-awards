 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316508  Fulton       Intermediate filaments in cells are associated with  mechanical strain and the ability to resist forces.  The  mRNA for vimentin is localized, changes position during  development and in fibroblasts remains around the centrosome  during wound healing.  The driving hypothesis behind this  proposal is that correct mRNA location is required for the  assembly and location of the vimentin filaments.  The  proposal addresses three questions:  1) Is the 3' UTR of  vimentin mRNA sufficient to direct mRNA to the centrosomal  region?  2) Does vimentin mRNA need to be in the centrosomal  region to produce vimentin filaments that permit cellular  orientation and movement?  3) Do cells under mechanical  stress have greater requirements for properly located  vimentin mRNA and protein?.  Appropriate plasmids will be constructed and transfected  into fibroblasts and the location of mRNA will be shown by  in situ hybridization.  Monolayers of transfected cells will  be wounded and cell behavior during orientation and  migration will be measured, either with or without  mechanical stress.  The mRNA's of several cytoskeletal proteins are localized,  suggesting  that synthesis of these proteins may occur at  sites appropriate for function or assembly.  The function of  location for cytoskeletal proteins will only be known when  cytoskeletal mRNA's are mislocalized.  The mechanically  demanding behavior of fibroblasts during cell orientation  and movement offers a strong test of the functional  significance for mRNA location.  %%%    The messages for several cytoskeletal proteins are  concentrated in parts of the cell, suggesting that these  proteins may need to be made at the right place for them to  function or assemble.  The function for message location for  cytoskeletal proteins will only be known when cytoskeletal  mRNAs are mislocalized.  Cells pointing and moving offer a  good opportunity to see the functional significance of  message location.    ***",
