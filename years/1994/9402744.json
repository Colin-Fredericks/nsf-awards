 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the purchase of a scanning tunneling  microscope (STM) with electrochemical STM and atomic force  microscopic (AFM) capabilities. The primary use of the  instrument will be for STM and AFM measurements at  semiconductor/liquid interfaces, although other groups at  the University will use the AFM for topological  characterization of nanostructured materials such as  nanoclusters. Scanning tunneling microscopy at metal/liquid  interfaces has resulted in significant advances in the  understanding of surfaces in processes ranging from  electrodeposition to catalysis. In contrast, very little  attention has been given to semiconductor/liquid junctions.  In this work, the semiconductor/electrolyte interface will  be used as a means to both characterize and modify silicon  surfaces. The ability to resolve and manipulate  semiconductor surfaces on an atomistic scale offers a number  of unique opportunities for both the fundamental study of  semiconductor surfaces and for surface processing and  microfabrication at atmospheric pressure and ambient  temperatures. Specific areas of fundamental interest  include: characterization of the surface structure of  chemically etched silicon surfaces in an electrolyte, the  chemistry of hydrogen passivation layers, and the initiation  of porous layers in silicon. Areas of technological interest  include: in situ microfabrication at the silicon/liquid  interface and electrochemical deposition of epitaxial layers  onto semiconductor surfaces. This work will complement  existing work at the University on silicon surfaces  supported by NSF. The instrument will provide unique  measurement capabilities previously unavailable to the  investigators involved in the above projects.",
