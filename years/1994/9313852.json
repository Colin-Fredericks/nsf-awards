 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No:  9312852    This project will develop a new measurement technology for low-frequency NMR and NQR measurements in which a SQUID detector functions as a high-sensitivity broadband detection system for stochastic NMR measurements.  The inherent sensitivity of a SQUID sensor and its wide bandwidth make it the ideal detection device for low-frequency magnetic resonance experiments.  The bandwidth of the SQUID system also offers a unique match to the broadband nature of the rf excitation used in stochastic NMR.  In addition, experiments at the University of California, Berkeley and Phase I measurements have shown that SQUID systems can be used in low-frequency pulsed experiments.  The combination of both wideband and pulsed measurement capabilities in a single instrument offers the promise of a unique and powerful new tool in NMR and NQR studies of modern materials.  Potential applications for this measurement technology include NQR and zero-field NMR studies of amorphous and polycrystalline solids, NQR measurements of deuterium for studies of solid organic compounds and polymers, and the investigation of a wide variety of biologically-significant molecules through NQR measurements on 14 {superscript}N.  By providing highly resolved spectra in polycrystalline and other disordered systems, it is likely that such a system will become a research tool in a variety of scientific disciplines.",
