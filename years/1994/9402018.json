 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402018  Mifflin    The proposed research concerns developing a way to combine  polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly  convergent algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of  several variables.  The idea is to combine bundle and proximal  point methods to determine a space decomposition such that on one  subspace the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works well and on  the other subspace a quasi-Newton approximation of a certain  reduced Hessian can be employed.    This research can be applied in many practical decision-making  situations. These include decomposition of large or complicated  models such as those occurring in resource allocation,  manufacturing, logistics and civil infrastructure design.  For  example, a water pressure control problem of finding values for  flow rates and pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost  subject to maintaining water pressures in allowable ranges at all  points in a pipe network can be solved via decomposition.  If the  flow rates are fixed then the subproblem of finding optimal  values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to-solve linear  minimization problem.  With this separation of variables approach  the outer problem of finding optimal values for the flow  variables is a nonsmooth problem whose solution can be found  efficiently via the techniques of this proposal.",
