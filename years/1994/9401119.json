 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401119  Overton  This proposal addresses the goal of NSF's Research Opportunity  Award program: to enable researchers at institutions with limited  research opportunities to work with NSF-funded investigators at  better known institutions.  This project will bring a colleague  on the faculty of Fordham University (Bronx, NY) to New York  University to develop a collaborative working relationship with  the principal investigator.  The work concerns a nonsmooth  quasiconvex optimization problem.  The minimization objective is  linear, but the constraints are Hermitian matrix inequalities,  either linear or nonlinear.  An equivalent formulation is the  minimization of the largest eigenvalue of a Hermitian definite  matrix pencil, which is a pair of matrices (A, B) with B positive  definite.  This specific problem is of great importance in modern  methods for robust control.  The goal is the development of fast,  reliable numerical algorithms to solve this problem, together  with analysis of theoretical questions concerning optimality  conditions and algorithm convergence.  Software will be developed  and made available to the general scientific community over the  Internet (using Netlib).  Applications in robust control will be  emphasized.  ***",
