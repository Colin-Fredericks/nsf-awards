 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316887  Hannah  The allosteric properties of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase are  critical in controlling the amount of glucose polymers in organisms  ranging from E. coli to potato.  The maize transposable element,  dissociation Ds, was placed within the coding region of the site of  a gene encoding the maize endosperm enzyme.  Ds excisions are  imprecise, thus revertants represent a series of closely-related  mutations arising from one position in the gene.  This form of in-  vivo, site-specific mutagenesis was used to create wild type  variants that differ in DNA sequence, enzyme levels, allosteric  properties and seed weight.  Since starch comprises 70% of seed  weight, starch content likely has been altered.    This research will further characterize revertants at DNA, enzyme  and physiological levels.  Additional excision events will identify  changes at this site not only restoring gene function, but those  not restoring gene function.  Integration of studies at the gene,  enzyme and physiological levels of the isogenic maize lines will  help define the structure/function relationships of a important  region of a critical enzyme and how these changes affect starch  content.    Secondly, these studies are providing new insight into the  mechanism of Ds transposition.  Unexpectedly some revertants do not  easily fit current models of transposition.  Additional excision  events should lead to modification of existing models or to  development of new ones.    In summary, a series of integrated experiments are proposed to more  clearly understand how this region of the enzyme affects its  allosteric properties and, in turn, how changes affect starch  biosynthesis.  Coupled with this will be a better understanding of  how Ds acts as a mutagen.  ***",
