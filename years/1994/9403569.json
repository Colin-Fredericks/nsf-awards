 "awd_abstract_narration": "Watkins         The investigator studies improved algorithms that are  suitable for high-performance parallel computing for solving  eigenvalue and invariant subspace problems.  New parallelizable  formulations of the QR algorithm are investigated through both  numerical experiments and theoretical analysis.  New shift  strategies that allow many iterations to proceed at once are  implemented, and the process of propagation of shifts in  iterations of the QR algorithm is studied in detail.  An  additional aim is to study the relationships between various  eigensystem algorithms, the related areas of classical real  analysis and approximation theory, and applications in signal  processing and control.  The point of this activity is to clarify  and unify the theory.       Eigensystem computations --- the calculation of eigenvalues  and invariant subspaces of matrices --- lie at the heart of  numerous problems in diverse areas, including vibrations and  stability of structures (buildings, bridges, aircraft, etc.),  control systems of all types (robots, factories, automobiles,  aircraft), and signal processing (communications, seismic oil  exploration).  It is therefore vital to have at hand a variety of  reliable, efficient methods for computing eigensystems.  The aim  of this project is to study and develop new computational methods  for analyzing eigensystems.  The high-performance computers of  today and the near future are organized very differently from  older computers and require that new methods be devised and old  methods be reorganized to make efficient use of the processing  power of the new machines.  The investigator studies and develops  suitable methods.  An additional aim is to organize and unify the  theory behind eigensystem computations for the benefit of the  computational scientists and engineers of tomorrow.",
