Of particular concern have been analyses of the respective roles  of natural and human factors on changes in vegetation,  particularly the succession of species in forests.  This doctoral  dissertation research project will conduct a case study of forest  succession in the serpentine \"barrens\" of southeastern  Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland.  The bedrock underlying  these areas makes its soils low in nutrients and higher in  toxins, thereby inhibiting development of vegetative combinations  like those found in surrounding areas.  As a result, a complex  mix of grasses and trees exists along with a number of endemic  and rare plant species.  Two different hypotheses have been  formulated to explain the persistence of the distinctive plant  communities associated with the serpentine barrens.  The first  posits multiple stable states, with each of the plant communities  perpetuating itself in association with local soil  characteristics and other factors.  The second hypothesis holds  that the vegetative landscape is primarily the result of  stochastic factors, including fires (whether started natural or  by human activity) and fire suppression.  Of special interest in  assessing the latter hypothesis is the way that plants regenerate  immediately after a fire.  In order to assess the validity of  these hypotheses, this project will include analyses of the  historical and human-induced disturbances in promoting the  diversity of plant communities on serpentine bedrock,  descriptions of the current composition and structure of  serpentine vegetation and how it has responded to disturbances,  and analyses of short- and longer-term responses of serpentine  forests to fires.  In addition to analyzing historical documents  and aerial photos, intensive analyses will be made of vegetation  bef ore and after controlled burns at two sites.       This project will contribute to understandings of the  processes and effects of human-induced and natural change,  including better knowledge of the different spatial and temporal  scales at which different factors are important.  The project  also will generate useful data, and it will contribute to  knowledge about strategies that can be used to maintain  populations of rare species in these areas.  As a doctoral  dissertation improvement award, this award also will provide  support to enable a promising student to establish a strong  independent research career.",
