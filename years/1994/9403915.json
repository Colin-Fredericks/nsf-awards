 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403915  Bona         This project comprises a broadly-based investigation of some  fundamental aspects of mechanics, including the development of  some of the relevant mathematical techniques and tools. Included  within its auspices are theoretical and experimental studies of  various fluid flows, studies of water waves and formation of sand  structures in the near- shore zone of large bodies of water, and  theoretical and experimental studies of liquid crystals. One of  the larger investigations will be concerned with the modelling of  water waves with an eye toward a better understanding of the  interaction of waves travelling in opposite directions. Another  interesting study is concerned with flows in which there is a  balance between dissipative effects and surface tension. Still  another sub-project will reconsider some classical flows such as  flow past a sphere in a pipe, Taylor-Couette flow and the related  issues of stability and vortex breakdown. The complex  mathematical modelling needed to describe exotic materials like  liquid crystals will also be high on the agenda. Allied to all of  these investigations will be the development of specific  theoretical results in partial differential equations and in  numerical analysis. Especially important in the latter area will  be work on highly efficient methods for the solution of large  linear systems arising in the algorithms for the solution of  complicated nonlinear differential equations. The resulting  computer codes will be used in conjunction with experimental work  on all the forementioned topics and the outcomes interpreted  within the relevant theoretical framework.  This work is exciting  for several reasons. First, many of the issues being addressed  are not only of fundamental theoretical importance, but they also  have potential to provide new insights into engineering and  technological design and processing. Secondly, because of the  presence of the fluid mechanics laboratory sited within the  mathematics department at Pe nn State, the group has the ability  to combine theoretical, numerical and experimental work in a  rarely realized close collaboration. In addition, some of the  work on development of optimal numerical techniques will have  impact in a much broader arena of science and engineering  activity than just the confines of the present study.",
