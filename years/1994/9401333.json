 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ni  9401333          Work supported by this award focuses on the mathematical  analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, systems and  their applications.  The research continues several projects such  as the study of spike-layers in mathematical biology.  These  arise in mathematical descriptions of the chemotactic aggregation  stage of cellular slime molds.  One is interested in solutions of  the relevant equations which exhibit spiky patterns dependent on  the equation coefficients.  Such patterns have been observed  experimentally.  A second line of investigation concerns cross-  diffusion in population dynamics.  The primary question to be  studied here is one of determining and understanding the steady  states of such systems.  Work will also be done measuring the  stability of steady states of a class of semilinear heat  equations in n-dimensional space and on the inhomogeneous  semilinear elliptic or parabolic equations arising in infinite  particle systems in probability.           Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.",
