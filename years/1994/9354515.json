 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354515  Caffery  The goal of this project is to develop materials which will  integrate molecular modeling into the chemistry curriculum as a  means of understanding chemical structure and as a tool for  developing critical thinking skills. The plan will involve students  in using this tool while emphasizing thinking skills from simple  analysis and comparison through inference and finally, synthesis of  results and evaluation of findings. The approach is innovative in  that it calls for integration of the techniques across the major  program rather than use in isolated experiments and exercises  developed and used by individual faculty members. It provides a  creative means of explicitly developing thinking skills and for  fostering team work.  This project will focus primarily on courses  taken by first and second year chemistry and biology majors and  will include selected upper division courses in which the technique  has significant applications. We also believe that non-science  majors can learn to model simple molecules and have included them  in our design. They will learn science by \"doing what scientists  do.\"  ***y",
