 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314660  Hilbish    This award supports a U.S.-France workshop on the evolutionary  genetics of marine bivalves to take place at two locations in  France:  La Tremblade and Sete, July 17-24, 1994.  The organizers  are Thomas J. Hilbish, University of South Carolina, Francois  Bonhomme, University of Montpellier and Andre Gerard, IFREMER  (The French National Institute for Research in Oceans and Marine  Sciences).  The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) acquaint  U.S. researchers with the facilities and resources available at  La Tremblade and Sete; (2) discuss the cataloging and  establishment of living genetic resources; and (3) explore topics  for collaborative research projects.  The specific topics for  discussion are: living genetic resources; molecular genetic  resources and questions related to molecular techniques;  genotype-environment interaction; and the breeding biology of  bivalves and its role in quantitative genetic analysis.    Bivalves are important model systems for the study of fundamental  issues in evolutionary biology.  They are particularly good  models of high gene flow systems.  The project brings together  U.S. and French investigators of complementary expertise. The  advantages to the U.S. investigators are significant. They will  have access to excellent French facilities in bivalve genetic  research and in molecular biology and to significant living  genetic resources.  ***",
