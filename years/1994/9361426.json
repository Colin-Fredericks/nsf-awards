 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361795  Lee       Metal matrix composites (MMC), with their high thermal   conductivity, light weight, EMI shielding, and tailorable   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are the emerging materials   of choice for heat sink, constraining core and packaging   applications.  Affordable and timely manufacturing methods are   desired for small lots of electronic packaging applications such as   microwave T/R module and multichip modules (MCM's).                      In this research the purpose is to combine composite  processing and the tooling fabrication to develop flexible  manufacturing methods for small production runs of high performance  MMC electronic packages.  A prototype MMC MCM's will be designed to   test the feasibility of using solid freeform fabrication (SFF)   models to generate tooling for rapid prototyping of MMC packages.   Near-net-shape manufacturing of the composite packages will be   demonstrated.  Properties of MMC packages such as CTE, thermal   conductivity, modulus, density, surface finish and dimensional   tolerance will be characterized.  In addition to the high   performance electronic packaging applications, metal matrix  composites  will have commercial applications as heat exchangers,  engine components, and possible applications in sport equipments.",
