 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321048  Heckman    This project has four interrelated objectives: (1) To complete an  evaluation of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) begun under  the previous NSF grant.  The project studies the self-selection  bias (if any) that characterizes the differences in earnings,  employment and wages between participants and non-participants  with an eye toward developing rigorously, economically motivated  program evaluation strategies using readily available non-  experimental data.  (2)  The study exploits unique data to  develop empirically-based models of incentives in organizations  and the responses of organizations to externally mandated  performance standards.  This portion of the project provides new  information on the economics of bureaucracies and the responses  of program managers to incentives. (3)  The study develops and  applies econometric methods for estimating dynamic models of  choices among alternative possibilities, and the rewards from  these choices. (4)  The study considers the empirical, economic  and econometric foundations of the case for social experiments.   Both theoretical and empirical studies will be conducted on the  benefits and limitations of social experiments.  The responses of  training centers to randomization will be investigated.   One  goal of the project is to produce a book on the rigorous  evaluation of social programs with an emphasis on manpower  training programs.",
