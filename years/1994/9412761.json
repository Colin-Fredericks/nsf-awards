 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral  Dissertation  Research  program.  It is a  study  of  changes  in  ethnic identification among white ethnic groups and the impact of  such  identification on the labor force participation  of  women.  Census  data  from the 1910, 1940, 1950, 1970, and 1980  censuses  will  be  used,  with  a focus on English, Italian,  Polish,  and  Jewish  women.   Census data from 137 different  American  cities  will  be  examined through time to see how features of the  local  economy  and  population  composition  affect  the  labor   force  participation of women in the chosen ethnic groups.        Previous  research has viewed the ethnic identification  of  immigrants  as  gradually  receding  as  a  result  of  prolonged  exposure  to the American melting pot.  More recently researchers  have  recognized that ethnic identification and distinctive forms  of  behavior  associated with that identification can  be  either  strengthened  or weakened, depending upon features of  the  local  social  structure in which members of a group live.  Yet to  date  few  studies  have  rigorously investigated  how  this  \"emergent  ethnicity\"  works,  and by doing so, this project  will  make  an  important contribution.  In addition to the scientific  gains  to  be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist  a  highly  promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social scientists.",
