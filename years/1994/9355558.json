 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355558  Koopman    The American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) in 1990  initiated a program to enhance U.S. high school science education,  establish new links between high schools and biomedical  investigators, and attract more students into scientific careers.   High school science teachers are provided a stipend to work in the  laboratory of an ASCI sponsor for 1-2 summers, during which they  receive instruction in state-of-the-art techniques in the context  of hands-on participation in a research project.  Continued  interaction throughout the school year with ASCI sponsors,  accomplished physician-scientists who are excited about their work,  is a central feature of the program.  In addition, teachers will  attend workshops directed toward translating the summer research  experience into effective classroom activities and to train  teachers to become a training resource for their peers, especially  minority teachers working in schools with primarily  minority/disadvantaged/underrepresented students.  Applications are  judged upon the scientific merits of the proposal, the motivation,  leadership skills and qualifications of the teacher and ASCI  sponsor, support of the high school administration for the program,  and the impact that the teacher's participation is anticipated to  have upon science education at the local level.  Follow-up reports  are required from program participants, and an external evaluation  component has been established for ongoing evaluation of the  program.  The ASCI funded the program itself in 1991 and is  committed to providing ongoing support.  In addition to seeking NSF  funding, the ASCI has secured and continues to seek funding from  industry.",
