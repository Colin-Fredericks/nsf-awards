Biological conditions in the Arabian Sea vary from  extreme oligotrophy to extreme eutrophy.  Primary production and  concentrations of chlorophyll a, for example, change by one to two  orders of magnitude over space and time.  We propose to study the  effects of the seasonally varying physical forcing on the  phytoplankton community as a whole and on individual populations of  microalgae, using primarily pigment-based methods.  We will test  the hypothesis, suggested by data from other environments, that  phytoplankton community structure and growth rates during most of  the year.  The exception is the area off Oman during the SW monsoon  when oceanic upwelling occurs.  At this time the community is  expected to be dominated by diatoms growing at high rates.   Phytoplankton community structure will be monitored by measuring  the concentration of taxon-specific chlorophylls and carotenoids by  high-pressure liquid chromatography.  It is proposed to carry out  theqe analyses as part of the JGOFS core measurements.  Using the  pigment 14c-labeling method we propose to measure phytoplankton  carbon-biomass, phytoplankton growth rates and taxon-specific  growth rates to study the physiological response of the  phytoplanton community to the seasonally varying physical forcing.   Carbon to Chl a ratios will be calculated from phytoplankton  biomass and chl a and used to calculated seasonal maps of  phytoplankton carbon-biomass for the Arabian Sea from remotely  sensed ocean and biomass will allow us to  determine factors which  control the growth and abundance of the individual phytoplankton  population, such as coccolithophores or prochlorophytes, and their  contribution to carbon cycling in this environment.",
