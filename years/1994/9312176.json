 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312176  Acrivos    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in  solid state chemistry between Juana Acrivos of San Jose State  University and W.Y. Liang of the Interdisciplinary Research  Center in Superconductivity, Cambridge University.  The objective  of their research is to determine how electronic properties of a  layer solid are controlled by intercalation.  Intercalation  compounds are formed by insertion of various elements.  These  compounds are used in the synthesis of LDS (low dimensional  solid) conductors and superconductors, materials for high duty  batteries, catalysts, and solid lubricants.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in  the preparation of LDS and intercalated compounds and the  evaluation of their properties through magnetic resonance  techniques (NMR), diffraction techniques and optical  spectroscopy.  This is complemented by the British Center's  considerable expertise in high temperature superconductivity and  synthesis of new superconductors.  In this effort, the Center  will supply and characterize crystals for intercalation. The  project will advance our understanding of intercalation, an  increasingly important, efficient and novel method for  synthesizing new superconductors.  ***",
