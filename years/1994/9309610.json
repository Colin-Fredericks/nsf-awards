 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309610  Heal    This research will further develop the issue raised in the  investigator's paper \"International Negotiations on Emission  Control.\"  That paper studies the incentives that countries have to  join and to remain in international agreements on the abatement of  global pollution.  It develops the concept of a critical abatement  coalition, one with the property that all members are net gainers  from membership.  There will be a smallest critical coalition  because of certain threshold effects.    One of the earlier paper's results is to identify as very important  in the stability of coalitions the extent of cross effects on net  benefits between countries that join a coalition.  These will be  referred to as \"reinforcement mechanisms.\"  In particular, the  stability of agreements is increased by the extent to which  abatement by country i increases the marginal net benefit of  country j from abatement by j.  This research will identify and  model ways in which the introduction of abatement policies by one  country could reduce the abatement costs of another and provide  reinforcement mechanisms.    The research will then take two initial steps towards empirically  implementing the ideas of critical coalitions and reinforcement  mechanisms.  One will be a preliminary attempt to identify  alternative minimum critical coalitions for the avoidance of global  climate change.  The second will be a preliminary identification of  reinforcement mechanisms.    ***",
