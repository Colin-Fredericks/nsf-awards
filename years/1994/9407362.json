 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407362  Strauss/Conner       The main goal of this work is to  examine how damage by  herbivores affects both male plant fitness (number of seeds sired)  and female fitness (number of seeds produced) simultaneously.   Results from these experiments will contribute to several areas of  cmntroversy, and will provide a new angle to examining the  relationships between plants, herbivores and pollinators.  One  controversy is how some plants seem to be able to compensate  completely for herbivory in terms of plant fitness.  Fitness has  classically been estimated through seed production in plants, but  the approach taken here will examine total plant fitness.   Preliminary data suggest that plants may shift allocation from  aspects of male fitness (pollen, nectar and petal production) to  female fitness (seed production).  Because of these shifts, plants  may not truly compensate for leaf damage, since the number of seeds  sired by damaged plants may be reduced, even if total seed number  remains the same.  This proposal also contributes to current theory  by linking the processes involved with pollination to those with  herbivory.  For example, if damaged plants have lower fitness  because they are less attractive to pollinators, then natural  selection may act on plant response to damage.  In particular, the  needs of pollinators, either through rewards or through required  cues, may shape how plants allocate resources for damage.  The  kinds of effective pollinator species and their needs may determine  whether damaged plants produce fewer flowers of equal quality, or  whether they produce as many flowers as undamaged plants, but some  of lower quality (i.e., smaller, with fewer rewards).  These are  exciting new areas that merit further investigation.       One goal of this work is to determine the degree to which male  versus female fitness in plants is affected by herbivory to leaves.   Many crop plants suffer reduced yield as a result of leaf damage.   It is generally assumed that reduced yie ld in herbaceous crops is  a result of fewer resources available to plants (through loss of  leaf area) rather than the result of diminished pollination  (although orchard growers have known for years of the importance of  good pollination).  results from this work may elucidate more  clearly the mechanisms through which herbivory reduces yield.  This  research may indicate that for a given level of damage, crop  quantity or quality could be better improved by increasing  pollinator visitation rather than by reducing leaf area lost to  herbivores.  Spraying plants with pollinator attractants (e.g.,  products like \"Bee Scent\") may improve yield more than by spraying  with pesticides, especially since pesticides can be toxic to  beneficial insects.  This research may suggest an alternative or  supplement to pesticides.",
