The  existence of a very complex and unusual phase  diagram for this material was made clear by  measurements of the magnetization that showed a  series of steps at 4.3 and 5.5K, but which left  much of the interesting region of the phase  diagram undetermined.  The proposed research  will define the phase diagram associated with  these steps from the lowest temperatures of  interest to TN =7.5K, and through the entire  range of magnetic fields of interest.  The  results will permit a detailed comparison with  magnetic structures, which are being determined  by neutron diffraction, and with the theory of  the steps; and thus contribute to a fundamental  understanding of the relations among magnetic  interactions, magnetic structures, and the  properties of magnetic materials.    Scope:  Dr. P. Radhakrishna of Jawaharlal Nehru  Centre for Advanced Scientific Studies,  Bangalore, India, will play a key role in the  project by bringing his expertise in neutron  diffraction and magnetic structures to bear on  the design and interpretation of the  experiments.       ***",
