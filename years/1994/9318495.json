 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments have dramatically increased the importance  of  ultra-reliable parallel computing.  First, parallel processing  has moved  from a specialized scientific computation tool to an  instrument for  general-purpose computing.  At the same time,  computers have begun to control  virtually every aspect of human  life and are, therefore, increasingly relied  upon to provide  continuous service.  These trends make the development of  general  but practical techniques for fault-tolerant multiprocessing a  necessity.    This project focuses on loosely-coupled parallel  computers.  These systems are ideally suited for ultra-reliable  applications  due to their built-in hardware redundancy that can  be used to achieve fault  tolerance.  The project has both basic  and applied research components.  The  basic research component studies new models and algorithms for the problems  of  multiprocessor system fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant routing.  The  applied research component involves the development of an  experimental testbed  for fault-tolerant multicomputer systems.  A  Transputer-based MIMD  multicomputer system provides the  testbed hardware and low-level operating  system.  Special-purpose  software is developed to provide a system-level  fault  tolerance framework, a fault simulator, and a data collection  tool for  the testbed.  The testbed allows experimental  evaluation of the  system-level fault tolerance mechanisms  developed in the basic research  component and is also made  available to other research groups working on  multiprocessor  system fault tolerance.",
