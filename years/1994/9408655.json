 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408655  Skinner       This project involves the dissertation research of a  cultural anthropology student from the University of California-  Davis.  The student will study polygynous marriages in Ghana in  order to understand the division of labor in work and capital  accumulation.  The standard theory of polygyny accounts for it as  due to resource accumulation of men, by controlling the labor  power of several wives.  This case study will show how polygyny  works in a society where spouses are economically independent,  and men can not appropriate women's labor.  Using ethnographic  methods and analysis of divorce cases, the student will try make  an analytic model of polygyny that could be used cross-culturally  to explain the existence of alternative forms of marriage in  other areas of the world.       This research is important because the understanding of how  alternative marriage forms work in relation to the distribution  of resources between men and women will help us understand how to  design programs to strengthen the family and maintain it as the  primary unit of socialization.  This can have implications for  divorce and childrearing as well as for the transmission of STDs.",
