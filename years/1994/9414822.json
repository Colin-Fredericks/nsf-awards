 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fruedenberg  9414822    The objectives of this proposal are to advance the current state  of sampled-data and periodic control systems.  Contributions will  be made to theory, applications, and pedagogy.  A theory of  inherent design limitations for sampled-data and periodic  feedback systems will be developed to describe robustness and  performance tradeoffs due to nonminimum phase zeros, unstable  poles, and time delays in the analog plant.  Various  methodologies have been proposed for circumventing design  limitations present in linear time invariant systems by purposely  introducing sampling or other forms of periodic control.  The  theory to be developed will be used to critique these  methodologies.  The theory of design limitations takes  intersample behavior into account, and shows that some of the  purported advantages of sampling for overcoming design  limitations are illusory because they only consider behavior at  sampling instants.  The techniques to be used in developing the  results are the Bode and Poisson integrals from complex variable  theory in conjunction with methods developed in the early 1950's  for computing the response of an analog signal in a sampled-data  system to a sinusoidal input.  Particular emphasis is placed upon  the fact that the discrete frequency response depends on aliased  high frequency components of the analog response.  This  dependence is responsible for sensitivity and robustness  difficulties due to high frequency model error.  The theoretical  portion of the proposed research will be carried out in  collaboration with Rick Middleton of the University of Newcastle,  Australia.  Contributions to applications will be made in two  areas.  First, analysis techniques will be developed for  assessing the quality of a sampled-data control design using  frequency response plots instead of simulations.  Second, models  of inherently hybrid will be constructed for the purpose of  assessing their bandwidth limitations and degree of design  difficulty.  Such  systems are found in automotive applications,  where the engine firing event is inherently discrete, and in  sensing devices such as CCD cameras and Optical Multichannel  Analyzers which are used in plasma processing.  This work  supports ongoing applications projects at the University  of Michigan in the areas of automotive emission control and  semiconductor manufacturing.  Contributions to pedagogy arise  from the used of techniques taught in standard textbooks to  analyze inherent limitations and intersample behavior.  The  theory to be developed fills a gap in pedagogy that currently  exists between the theory of analog and of sampled-data feedback  systems.  ***",
