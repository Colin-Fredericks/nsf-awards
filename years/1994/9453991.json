 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is ideally  suited for an integrative and multidisciplinary graduate training  program in coastal ocean processes.  Ten faculty including 4  physical/optical oceanographers, 4 biological oceanographers and 2  chemical/paleooceanographers who already have an established record  of productive collaboration are seeking support for 5 graduate  traineeships.  A sixth student will be supported by matching funds  from the University.  The training program will emphasize two  highly interdisciplinary areas crucial to our understanding of the  coastal ocean made possible by UCSB's unique location and research  expertise; 1) bio-optics, photoadaptation, and remote sensing of  coastal primary production and water column optical properties (5  faculty) and 2) spatial and temporal variability in coastal  hydrography and water column processes and their impact on the  long-term climate record deposited in the sediments (8 faculty).   Students will be co-sponsored by two faculty to foster  interdisciplinary thesis projects and will received training in  state-of-the-art technologies including satellite imaging and  remote sensing, ocean mooring instrumentation, bio-optics, computer  modeling, and modern isotope geochemical, microbiological and  chemical techniques.  Recruitment of women and minority students  will be facilitated by liaisons with 2 feeder institutions, (Moss  Landing Marine Lab, California State University at Long Beach) and  by the availability of 3 women mentors among the participating  faculty.",
