 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kristin Krantzman is supported  by a Research Planning Grant from the   Special Projects Program in the Chemistry Division to perform theoretical   studies of the Eley-Rideal mechanism for reactions between atomic   hydrogen and adsorbates on silicon surfaces.  The Eley-Rideal mechanism,   which involves a direct reaction between an incoming gas atom and an   equilibrated adsorbate, is quite distinct from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood   mechanism, in which a reaction occurs between equilibrated adsorbates.    Krantzman will attempt to elucidate the mechanism using a combination of   classical trajectory simulations and density functional theory.  The   specific objectives of her research are: 1) to perform molecular dynamics   simulations related to the Eley-Rideal mechanism; 2) to use density   functional theory to calculate energies of configurations important to   elucidation the mechanism; and 3) to use density functional theory to   generate accurate potential energy surfaces for further simulations.    Recently the goal of surface chemistry has advanced beyond traditional   heterogeneous catalysis toward microengineering on the atomic scale.  For   example, in the microelectronics industry, integrated circuits are   fabricated by the deposition of epitaxial silicon films and etching them   with plasmas.  In order to make our dream of building materials atom by   atom a reality, a picture of the mechanisms underlying these gas-surface   processes is essential.  A fundamental atomic level understanding of the   Eley-Rideal mechanism will help to achieve this goal for processes which   require low substrate temperatures so that side reactions with the   surface are minimized.",
