 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sodium channels are large proteins that traverse the membranes of nerves. They are responsible for controlling the motion of sodium ions into the nerve cell and thereby play a major role in generation of nerve signals. With adequate, sophisticated, apparatus, one can take recordings of the successive passages of a ionic channel into open or closed position. Stochastic models have been suggested to explain the pattern of open and closed periods. They contain a number of adjustable parameters, which can be varied to obtain a good fit to experimental data. The methods of fit used up to now require extensive computer use. Also, they are unstable. We intend to taylor to this problem a simpler method described in 1990 by L. Le Cam and G.L. Yang The problem of assessing the uncertainty in the fitted equations is part of a general problem on which we are making some progress. The project has two parts. One is a detailed study of certain integrals that occur naturally in the evaluation of the performance of statistical estimates when one uses quadratic los functions. The integrals involve a denominator that is a convex combination of the probability measures attached to the experiment. One will study how the integrals vary when these convex combinations change. The second part is about statistical procedures to be used for the study of sodium channel in nerves. Various stochastic models for the functioning of these channels have been proposed. Standard statistical analyses proceed through the method of maximum likelihood, which, in this case is computationally cumbersome and unstable. Another procedure, due to Le Cam, is just as efficient and computationally much simpler. It is proposed to taylor it to the sodium channels situation and study what it can achieve there.",
