 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361115  Boyers  The objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of developing a high intensity UV excimer source for the demanding requirements of the semiconductor manufacturing and materials processing industry.  Emerging processing technologies not requiring a coherent source including UV wafer cleaning and photo CVD will require very high UV intensities over large areas (100mW/cm@) currently only available from excimer lasers.  Conventional UV lamps are inadequate for the task.  Excimer lasers cannot conveniently illuminate a large field size, are often difficult to integrate into a production tool, and have a very high cost of ownership.  The phase I research will be directed toward establishing the feasibility of developing a UV excimer lamp and excitation source with the required performance : 1)  A lamp and excitation source will be designed and fabricated.  2) The spectrum and UV efficiency will be measured with pure Xe (172 nm). 3) A preliminary full scale design and cost estimate will be prepared.  The Phase II research will be directed toward the construction of a full scale prototype for operation with other excimer gas mixtures such as ArFl*(193 nm), KrCL* (222 nm), KrF* (249 nm), and XeCl* (351 nm). If successful, this program will lead to the development of a critical manufacturing resource for use in the fabrication of the next generation of semiconductor devices.    ***",
