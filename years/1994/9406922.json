 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406922  Javidi  Matched filter functions and optimum processors derived under the  spatially overlapping input signal and scene noise assumption may  not perform well in the presence of spatially disjoint input signal  and scene noise, and could lead to very poor system performance.   The purpose of this work is to design new optimum processors for  spatially disjoint signal and scene noise.  The principal  investigator will consider a general model of a target in non-  overlapping input scene noise where the target may include  distortions such as unknown illumination, scale, rotation, etc.   Overlapping noise on the target due to detector noise or other  statistical fluctuations will be included in this model.  It is  intended to conduct theoretical, numerical, and experimental  investigation of the optical pattern recognition systems which are  designed in the presence of scene noise that is spatially disjoint  with the target.  ***",
