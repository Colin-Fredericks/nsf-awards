 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314426  Allara    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in  surface science between David L. Allara of Pennsylvania State  University and Francis Rondelez of the Institut Curie, Paris,  France.  The objective of their research is to investigate the  quantitative correlations between molecular structures in  monolayer assemblies of alkysiloxane films and conditions for  preparation of these films.  The correlations will be used to  determine film properties, in particular, surface wetting.   Parallel, independent experiments at Penn State and the Institut  Curie are aimed at determining the temperature for film  preparation; the role of substrate/film bonding in film ordering;  and the role of water in film formation.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration considerable  expertise in organic thin films and molecular characterization of  their structure.  This is complemented by French skills in  synthesis and characterization of monolayer films.  Development  of stable molecular films with minimal defects is the ultimate  goal.  Such advances are important to scientific and  technological applications cutting across the disciplines of  physics, chemistry, biology and materials science.   Semiconductors, nanoscale lithography and optoelectronic devices  are among the leading technologies that would benefit from  improvements in structure of molecular films.  ***",
