 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mertzman    Franklin and Marshall College is an independent coeducational  college with a long history of distinction in science education.  In order to sustain its record of producing quality students in  the sciences, the college is undertaking a major renovation of  the Pfeiffer Science Building, a 25 year old facility that houses  the departments of geosciences, physics, chemistry and astronomy.  This represents the first step in a more comprehensive $8 million  renovation for the entire science complex.  Students actively  engage in the research enterprise by participating in the  student-faculty research program.  The program has been a  valuable and productive effort, one of the largest in the  country.  However,  despite the breath of scientific endeavors,  the basic requirements of the research programs exceed the  current limitations of the building in terms of temperature and  humidity control, operable fume hoods, and the accessibility to  distilled water.    This award will provide the funds required to modernize 30,214  square feet of research and research training space.  Renovations  will include:  modifying electrical and plumbing systems,  installing a distilled water system and an effective ventilation  and air conditioning system, and improving the fume hood system  to comply with EPA standards.  These renovations will provide a  safe, physical environment conducive to quality faculty and  student-faculty research.  Engaging undergraduate students in  science by allowing them to do research has been and will  continue to be a fundamental strength of Franklin and Marshall  College.  ***",
