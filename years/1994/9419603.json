Showing the plausibility of using microwave  synthesis for the preparation of additional solid-state nitrides  is the goal of this research.  Reactions to be studied include  the direct combination of a binary metal nitride, such as those  of gallium, aluminum, or silicon, with a transition metal to  produce a binary or ternary transition metal nitride at milder  synthetic conditions.  Two types of reactions will be studied:  reactions carried out in closed systems; and reactions carried  out in flowing systems.  %%%  Even though nitrides are an important class of industrial  materials, only a few hundred are known to exist.  The focus of  this research will be on a class of transition metal nitrides  that are increasingly recognized as important industrial  materials because they are hard and strong, and are good  conductors of heat and electricity.  In addition, some exhibit  superconductivity, and others have catalytic properties.  Transition metal nitrides are finding utility in diverse areas  such as structural materials, corrosion and scratch resistant  coatings, and as packaging materials in the semiconductor  industry.  ***",
