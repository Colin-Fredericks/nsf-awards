 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318701  Kintigh    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Keith Kintigh will  analyze museum collections and associated documentation located  in institutions in New York city, Boston and Cambridge England..  These data will be integrated with materials in hand and  published in a monograph which traces changes in Zuni Native  American settlement pattern and social organization between ca.  1240 and 1540 AD. In the late 19th and early 20th century major  archaeological excavations were conducted at three prehistoric  Zuni towns: Heshotauthla, Halona and Kechipawan. Work proceeded  at a scale which would be impossible today and at all sites large  areas were exposed. While extensive field notes were taken, at  none of the sites were the materials fully analyzed and published  and Dr. Kintigh wishes to examine these data and incorporate them  into his own broad scale analysis of Zuni prehistory.         The Zuni case is particularly significant because the area  is one of the very few in the United States where a fertile  archaeological record documents 1000 years of cultural continuity  with a modern group having a strong traditional culture and rich  ethnographic record. The 1240-1540 AD period marks a particularly  important interval because during this time Zuni first aggregated  into a few large settlements, then relocated into a larger number  of planned towns and then finally established the villages which  were occupied when Spanish entered the region. Thus this record  allows one to trace the development of complex society and the  subsequent social shifts which accompanied the change to smaller  settlements. The result will contribute to understanding of the  underlying processes involved in population aggregation and  increasing organizational complexity.         This research is important for several reasons. It will  provide data of interest to many regional archaeologists. It will  also shed new light on the effects of European invasion on Native  American peoples. Because la te prehistoric social and political  changes throughout the U.S. Southwest appear to be inter-related,  a refined understanding of the Zuni situation will benefit  broader archaeological inquiries.   ***",
