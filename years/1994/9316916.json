The transport direction is  toward the NE and this has been used to help reconstruct a large  part of the SW Cordillera during Cretaceous times.  Recent work has  shown that several sections of this major fault zone, including the  Chocolate Mts. thrust, may have been reactivated and that they  therefore may represent exhumation rather than subduction and  burial tectonism.   This project will resolve the controversy by  detailed field work with structural and metamorphic petrology.  The  results will allow meaningful plate reconstructions for the  Mesozoic to Tertiary in the SW Cordillera, and will have  implications for similar tectonic settings in other major orogenic  belts.",
