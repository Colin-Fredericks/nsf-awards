Dr. Leighton received his  doctoral degree form Harvard University under the supervision  of Professor David Evans.  Dr. Leighton will continue research  at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor Eric  Jacobsen. His postdoctoral research will focus on the  development of methodology for the rapid and efficient  evaluation of ligands for asymmetric catalytic processes,  specifically the (salen) Mn(III)- catalyzed epoxidation of  olefins.  Longer term he plans to apply his expertise in  asymmetric catalysis to stereoselective rhodium-catalyzed  hydroformylation processes.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.",
