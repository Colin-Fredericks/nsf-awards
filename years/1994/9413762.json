 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT          The Biological Sciences Electron Microscope Laboratory  is a teaching and research  facility in the Department of Biological Sciences at the  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee  (UWM). Currently, the electron microscopes in this facility  are being used by students and staff  in Biological Sciences, Physics, and the Materials,  Mechanical and Civil Engineering departments as well as the  Center for Great Lakes Studies and the Laboratory for  Surface Studies. Researchers in each of these groups have  expressed a need for quantitative and qualitative elemental  analysis in conjunction with the structural studies  currently being conducted.          The Biological Sciences Electron Microscopy (BSEM)  Laboratory and the Laboratory for  Surface Studies (LSS) at the University of Wisconsin-  Milwaukee (UWM) are requesting a system  of instruments to upgrade the existing electron microscopes  in order to meet this need. This  instrumentation falls into 3 equipment groupings:  analytical, biological specimen preparation and  materials specimen preparation. The analytical needs of the  researchers will be met through the  acquisition of energy dispersive x-ray spectrometers (EDS)  for the existing scanning electron  microscope (SEM) and transmissions electron microscope (TEM)  both of which are located in the BSEM lab. The preparation  of biological specimens for elemental analysis is not  compatible  with conventional chemical fixation, but requires  specialized techniques and instrumentation.  Therefore, we are requesting cryogenic equipment for  processing biological samples for elemental analysis for  both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Finally,  for inorganic  materials, specialized equipment is needed for the  preparation of plan-view and cross-sectional  specimens to allow the imaging, diffraction and elemental  analysis of surfaces, interfaces and  small particles in TEM. The requested equipment will  complement the existing instrumentation  for SEM materials pr eparation. This system of instruments  will be used as an integral part of the  research and graduate training programs at UWM.          The requested instrumentation will open up new  possibilities for research in the biological  sciences as well as in materials and engineering research  benefiting both ongoing projects and  future planned research. Cryofixation combined with  elemental mapping will enable researchers  in the department of Biological Sciences and the Center for  Great Lakes Studies to gain a better  understanding of the mechanisms and impact of prokaryotic  and eukaryotic organisms in  biogeochemical cycling in aquatic environments. In addition,  the cryo-preparation  instrumentation will greatly enhance the capacity for  immunolocalization studies.          The cutting and thinning equipment requested for  materials specimen processing is  required for TEM analysis of brittle and ductile materials.  This instrumentation will be used for the preparation of  thin cross-sectional and plane-view specimens for elemental  analysis and imaging with the existing TEM; it will also be  required for the preparation of specimens for an atomic  resolution 200kV field emission TEM, for which separate  funding is being sought (NSF/DMR 9406752; the  Instrumentation for Materials Research Program). Finally,  the cutting and polishing tools will aid in the preparation  of suitable flat surfaces for elemental analysis of bulk  specimens in the SEM.",
