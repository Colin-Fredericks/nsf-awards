 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel computers have the potential to significantly  outperform current computer systems.  In order to exploit  this potential,  techniques for creating and  evaluating efficient parallel programs are needed.   Current parallel computers have significant overheads and  latencies for messages and this will continue for at least  several years.  Thus  it is essential that programs for  parallel computers be designed with these  overheads in mind.  Parallel computers are complex systems, so it is often  difficult to predict the performance of programs based  only on analytic  models. Thus, it is important to evaluate  parallel programs using both  simulations and  implementations.    Networks of workstations are already widely  available and  they are likely to become even more prevalent.  They provide  an  easy way to integrate the latest workstation  technology into a parallel  system, and they provide a cost effective parallel computer.   Thus  programs developed  for a network of workstations have the potential to have a  significant impact.    This research focuses on developing and evaluating  programs  for networks of workstations.  It results in  effective algorithms for both  basic problems such as load  balancing, median finding, and simple graph  algorithms, as  well as for more complex applications such as modeling air  or  fluid flows.  It also results in improved network  support for algorithms on  networks of workstations.  As  indicated, the performance of these programs is  evaluated using simulations, so that the performance can be  predicted for a  range of settings, and by measurements of  actual implications.    A second  focus of this research is to model cache-coherent shared memory systems,  and to develop algorithms  with good locality to help improve performance.  Since  algorithms for networks of workstations often exploit  data  locality, some of the algorithms developed for the  network of workstations  settings will also be effective on  cache-coherent shared memory machines.  Simulations and  tests help determine which of the network algorithms   perform well in this setting.",
