The target organic compounds this investigator plans to work on  are diaryl ethers, compounds that as a class include the dioxins,  substances of great pollutional significance.  The organism the  investigator plans to use, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, has  been found to degrade diaryl ethers, a property attributable to  its containing genes for enzymes that cleave these compound's  ether bond.      Results of this research are expected to include the substrate  range for this organism and its enzymes, the conditions that are  appropriate for its use in field-scale operations and the  stability of its genes for degradation of the target substances.   This research is expected to provide guidance for the conditions  under which microorganisms may be evaluated for their use in   decontamination of soils and provide the basis for engineering  design of systems to remove the target contaminants from soil.  ***",
