 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 9408366  Timberlake    The present research attempts to use the concept of \"behavior systems\" to combine the ethological study of \"instinctive\" behavior with laboratory research demonstrating the importance of learning in determining purposive behavior.  A \"behavior system\" refers to stimulus filtering, preorganized response components, and motivational states organized around a specific function, such as foraging for food.  Dr. Timberlake assumes that learning mechanisms evolved to alter behavior within the context of such a functional system.  He also assumes that the examples of learning produced by familiar laboratory procedures, such as Pavlovian and operant conditioning, can be profitably studied within a functional system.  His experiments use prior knowledge of the feeding-foraging systems of rats and pigeons to predict the form of conditioned responding and the ease of learning under laboratory procedures.  At the same time, these experiments use the analytic power of the laboratory manipulations to further develop and refine our knowledge of the feeding-foraging system.  The experiments focus on characteristics of the sequence of motivational states related to foraging:  the control of the general search state, as measured by locomotor search of maze environments; the control of the focal search state, especially as it relates to the conditioning of \"superstitious\" behavior; and the relation of learned chains of behavior to transitions between general and focal search states.  The results should clarify the contribution of learning to behavior in both the laboratory and natural environments.",
