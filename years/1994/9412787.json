 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412787  Koen    During a four month research visit to Japan,  Professor Koen will work with Professor  Yasutaka Shimizu, Director of the Center for  Research and Development of Educational  Technology (CRADLE), Tokyo Institute of  Technology, to investigate the use of  engineering heuristics in engineering design  and engineering design education in Japan.  An  heuristic is defined as anything that provides  a plausible aid or direction in the solution of  a problem but is in the final analysis  unjustified, incapable of justification, and  potentially fallible.  A convenient, informal  near-synonym for heuristic is the engineering  concept of rule-of-thumb.    Japanese engineers are among the most effective  in the world.  This project seeks to validate  the use of heuristics in Japan, to evaluate the  acceptance and recognition of heuristics in  that country, to find examples of heuristics  used in engineering design in Japan, to  determine the ease of discovering heuristics in  a different culture and, finally, to  demonstrate the use of design heuristics in a  course of artificial intelligence.  The results  of this research have the potential for  radically changing the way engineering design  is taught and practiced.  ***",
