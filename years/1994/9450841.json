Specifically, the number of X-terminals and the number of CPU's are  increased.  The three-fourfold increase in power and access permits  the inclusion of computational tools into the general physics  curriculum -- in parallel with the Computational Physics class--  and eliminates bottlenecks when the entire class works on  numerically-intensive projects. All the high performance  workstations in the physics department are being connected with the  two new ones, and then the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) software  will run on all machines. This will create a powerful, distributed  memory parallel computer which gives students needed experience in  message passing and synchronization primitives.  The additional  facility has also permitted the extension of the Computational  Physics course to an extra term, and thus continue the development  of projects which can be used throughout the physics curriculum.   Finally, the equipment strengthens and broadens the Physics  Department's computing resources as a means to assist in the  development of an interdisciplinary Computational Science program.",
