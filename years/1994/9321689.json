 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321689  Goodnight       Inbreeding depression is potentially one of the most serious  genetic consequences of reduced population size.  This research is  an empirical study on selection for reduced inbreeding depression  among a subdivided population, using Tribolium castaneum as the  model system.  It will involve a comparison of two migration  schemes, random and differential, among a set of fifteen inbred  lineages derived from the same outbred stock population.  In the  differential migration scheme, migrants will be sent from lineages  suffering from less inbreeding depression to lineages suffering  from more inbreeding depression.  In the random migration scheme,  the rate of migration will be the same but migrants will be sent at  random with respect to levels of inbreeding depression.  A  significant response to selection will be evident by a significant  decrease in the level of inbreeding depression in the differential  migration scheme, relative to the random migration scheme.%%%       The significance of the research lies in its insight into the  quantitative aspects of gene flow within and between small,  subdivided populations, an issue of considerable significance to  basic population and conservation biology.***",
