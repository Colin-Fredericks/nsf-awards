 "awd_abstract_narration": "Man  9404484          This project has the following two objectives: (A)  To  study  the  well-posedness  of the  boundary  value  problem  pertaining to using the hole-drilling strain-gage method for  the  measurement  of residual stress in a thin  plate.  This  boundary value problem will be formulated in the context  of  the general theory of linear elasticity with initial stress.  Particular  attention will be paid to examining whether  the  size  of the drilled hole would have any effect on the well-  posedness.  (B)  To  develop a mathematical  theory  on  the  radiation,  focusing, and multiple arrival of SHo  waves  in  anisotropic  thin  sheets. Accurate determination  of  phase  velocities  at different propagation directions is  required  when we use SHO waves for the evaluation of stress, texture,  and elastic constants of anisotropic sheets. Measurement  of  time  delay of signals by cross correlation does not deliver  phase  velocity. The present study will lay the  theoretical  groundwork  for  the determination of phase velocities  from  measured  data.  With  applications  to  composite  laminate  plates  in mind, provisions will be made to allow for strong  anisotropy of the sheets.          This  project comprises two studies: (A)  Mathematical  foundations of the hole-drilling strain-gage method for  the  evaluation of residual stress. The general theory of  linear  elasticity   with  initial  stress,  which   studies   small  deformations  from a prestressed configuration,  provides  a  natural setting for the analysis of the hole-drilling  test.  The  present analysis will be conducted in its context.  The  current  standard procedure for conducting the hole-drilling  test  will  be  reexamined  in light  of  findings  in  this  mathematical  study. (B) . The present study  will  lay  the  theoretical  groundwork  for  the  determination  of   phase  velocities   from   measured  data.
