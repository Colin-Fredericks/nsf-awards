 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT -- CTS-9405237  Howell     The proposed research requests funds to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of fluids at or near the critical point.  Four tasks have been proposed:  first to gather available data on heat transfer to supercritical water and other fluids and evaluate these data; second, to investigate predictive techniques for heat exchange at supercritical conditions; third, to apply a newly developed technique to one fluid other than supercritical water; and fourth, to report the results and analyze the applicability of the results for application to other fluids.  The proposal was submitted as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of conversations between the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program Director.  The qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform fundamental work in this area are excellent.  The relevance of the proposal, the fact that the subject area is one of increasing importance, and the uncertainty of the outcome make this particular proposal an excellent candidate for the SGER program.",
