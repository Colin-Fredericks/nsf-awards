 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pressing crisis in environmental biology today is that the  accelerating loss of biodiversity, globally and nationally, has  outrun our fundamental knowledge of its causes and consequences.   We are little able to predict or manage the future of most  ecosystems and populations largely because our understanding of  the complex environmental processes that generate and govern  biodiversity is grossly incomplete and depends on a number of  interacting taxonomic, temporal, and spatial scales.  We focus  our proposal for graduate training in environmental regulation of  biodiversity on three major components of biodiversity:  genetic  diversity, species diversity, and habitat diversity.  The  University of Chicago's CEB provides and integrated,  interdisciplinary PhD training program with participation arising  from every Division of the University and three major non-  academic Chicago research and educational institutions, the Field  Museum, Brookfield Zoo, and Argonne National Laboratories.  The  environmental biodiversity training program will capitalize on  our quantitative, empirical and theoretical strengths in ecology,  biogeography, systematics, genetics, paleontology, behavior, and  function.  It will produce the next generation of leaders who can  address the complexity and intrinsically interdisciplinary  problems in this priority area.  The CEB's deep-seated commitment  to increasing recruitment and maintaining participation of  underrepresented populations into environmental biology is  represented by a range of innovative initiatives that utilize our  unique structure and are based on personal, individualized  efforts.",
