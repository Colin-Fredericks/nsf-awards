 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Professors J. Ewbank and L. Schafer of the Chemistry Department   of the University of Arkansas will continue the development and   application of real-time gas electron diffraction (GED) using a pulsed   electron beam synchronous with photoexcitation.  The technique will be   applied primarily to the study of the conformation and structure of   short-lived chemical species, namely those in highly excited electronic   states where the structure and conformation differ significantly from   those in the ground and low-lying excited states, or species undergoing   dynamical changes as the result of unimolecular reactions.    Traditional GED has relied on the use of the photographic plate to record   and store the information generated by the diffraction of electrons by   molecules.  This method was therefore limited to studying the structures   of stable molecules.  Current research in molecular dynamics concerns   itself with how the structure and conformation of a molecular system   evolves during a reaction process.  Experimental  information about such   processes can only be obtained by means of techniques in which the time   plays an essential role.  The methods of pico- and femtosecond   spectroscopy have been very successful in this regard but also have their   limitations owing to the difficulty in interpreting often extremely   complex spectral patterns.  The method of real-time GED developed by the   principal investigators has shown great promise in making important   contribution to the understanding of the properties of short-lived   species.  The aim of this project is to capitalize on this potential and   contribute to our understanding of the basic aspects of molecular   dynamics.",
