 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops an  operating system called SPIN that provides fine-grained control to  applications over physical resources in ways  that are safe, predictable and  efficient.  The SPIN system is structured around an extensible microkernel  architecture.  The  system is extensible in the sense that application programs  can  dynamically install restricted program sequences that execute in  the  kernel in response to a set of pre-defined events allowing  for flexible and  rapid response.  For example, an application  program could install a scheduling  filter that runs each time a  thread from that program's address space is  preempted.    The notion of event filtering can be applied to a wide class of  events and services, including virtual memory, scheduling,  network  communication, local interprocess communication and disk  management.  By  viewing system resource management as a process  by which physical resources are  reassigned across applications,  and interpreting each reassignment as a  discreet event, SPIN defines critical control points for application  feedback, enabling  dynamic resource allocation policies.  By associating  application-defined control sequences with these control points, SPIN   enforces a wide range of policies at each event, enabling a single  operating  system to work well across many types of applications.  By executing the control  sequences within the kernel, the dynamic  control is achieved with very low  overhead.",
