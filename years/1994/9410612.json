 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410612  ANSELIN       The available methodology to carry out an \"exploratory\"  analysis of geographic data is limited, especially for the  analysis of large data sets that combine information from several  points in time with large amounts of geographic detail.  In such  instances, which are often characterized as data rich but theory  poor, the discovery of significant patterns of association  (across space, over time, and between multiple variables) is a  crucial aspect of the initial phase of scientific inquiry (i.e.,  the formulation of hypotheses).  This situation is increasingly  encountered in empirical research as large computerized data  bases become available to researchers studying such topics as  global change, the spread of contagious diseases, and socio-  economic dynamics.  The research proposed here will remove these  impediments to the exploratory analysis of geographical data by  developing a set of new methods to assess association in space-  time, with special emphasis placed on categorical variables.  The  new methods will be developed as an extension of the idea of a  general class of Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)  developed earlier by the principal investigator. The proposed  research consists of a rigorous assessment of the statistical  properties of the new methods by means of a series of carefully  designed simulation experiments.  The new techniques will be  disseminated to the research community in the form of a software  toolbox for exploratory data analysis, based on an object  oriented design. The potential of the new methods for providing  new insights in the analysis of large geographical data bases  will be illustrated in a case study of the human impacts of  global change.       This project will provide much needed new statistical tools  for exploring relationships throughout space and over time and  thus taking better advantage of the large data bases that are  being constructed and organized in geographic information  systems.  The project  will result in a set of new software tools  that will be made accessible to, and have a significant impact  on, the large research and business community who use such data  bases.",
