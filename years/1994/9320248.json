Providing such  an understanding is one of the tasks given to the National Science  Foundation.  This dissertation aims to study one way that  scientists attempt to communicate to the general public the results  of their research:  i.e. exhibits in science and natural history  museums.  Steven Allison, under the direction of Dr. Lewenstein, is  exploring the relationships between scientific research and the  public representation of natural knowledge.  He is investigating  how scientists in four different museums have attempted to  communicate to the public their understanding of the ecology of  tropical rain forests.    The major case for Mr. Allison's study is at the Smithsonian.  He  is following how a tropical rain forest exhibit which began in 1960  with plans for a Hall of Botany was transformed in the late 1960's  into an exhibit hall on ecosystems and was finally built in 1974 as  a temporary exhibit motivated by the environmental movement.  His  preliminary research has shown that changes in the definition of  \"ecology,\" professionalization of the exhibit development process,  and the rise of the environmentalist movement all shaped the  changing form and content of the exhibit.    Two exhibitions at the British Museum (Natural History) offer the  opportunity for comparison to the Smithsonian case.  The 1961  botany hall provides an example of more didactic exhibits than the  Smithsonian botanists planned for their hall, while the 1989  exhibition \"Ecology\" deploys visual and verbal presentations that  are very similar to the final Smithsonian exhibit in the 1970's.   He is also making less detailed comparisons of exhibition practice  at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Denver  Museum of Natural History, and the 1992 \"Amazonia\" exhibit at the  National Zoologica l Park.  These individual cases promise to make  significant contributions not only to the history of natural  history research but to broader issues of concern for public  understanding of science.  Parallels between the historical and  contemporary exhibitions raise questions about the role of museums  in the public communication of science, especially environmental  issues.  ***",
