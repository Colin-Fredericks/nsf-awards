 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414557  Lu  This proposal addresses the design and fabrication of polarization  and phase sensitive normal incidence multiple quantum well light  modulator array.  The device is based on the anisotropic excitonic  and concomitant light polarization rotation to achieve high  contrast ratios.  The anisotropic excitonic absorption and  birefringence are created by the in-plane anisotropic strain in  multiple quantum well structures.  The modulator utilizes the  quantum confined stark effect (QCSE) to electrically tune the phase  retardation and polarization rotation.    This proposal represents a two-year collaboration project between  the Microelectronics Research Laboratory (MERL) at Rutgers  University and the Electronics and Power Sources Directorate (EPSD)  of the Army Research Laboratory.  We Have been working closely at  the preliminary stage of the project, and have demonstrated the  single modulator device based on electrically tunable polarization  rotation and phase retardation in uniaxially strained (100) MQW,  which exhibits an exceedingly high contrast ratio of 5000:1.  The  proposed work will further develop the modulator array (at least  4x4) to demonstrate its capability as a spatial light modulator.   The work at Rutgers will focus on processing development,  structural characterization, and theoretical modeling.  In  addition, a graduate student from Rutgers will spend a majority of  his time at EPSD, performing the optical studies for this project.   The National Science Foundation's support will greatly enhance our  joint efforts in this area.  ***",
