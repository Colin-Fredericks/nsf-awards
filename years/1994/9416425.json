The study  will involve the analysis of data collected by such organizations  as  the  California Department of Insurance on  insurance  losses  sustained  in the earthquake.  Analysis of this information  will  permit more accurate determination of the effects of deductibles,  and  of the relation of building shake loss to other losses, such  as  fire,  inland  marine,  and workers  compensation.   Analyses  involving statistical and GIS techniques will include examination  of  such  questions  as: What is the distribution  of  losses  by  geographical  area, and by soil type?  To what  extent  did  poor  soils  play a role in damage?  What is the distribution of losses  by structural age and type?  What is the relative contribution of  structural  damage  to  overall losses, as  opposed  to  contents  damage and loss of use? How did ultimate insurance claims compare  against initial building inspector estimates of damage?  ***",
