Students from the St. Regis Mohawk  Reservation at Akwesasne will take courses in Science, Mathematics,  Environmental Studies, and Writing Across the Curriculum.  Classes,  field studies, and visits by Native American scientists and  educators and other consultants will emphasize hands-on experiences  with practical applications of scientific and mathematical  concepts.  The program has been designed in conjunction with Mohawk  educators, parents, and students.  Potsdam College is the host  institution of the Northern Consortium of the State university of  New York (SUNY) Native American Initiative.  The summer residential  camp will be directed through the office of Native American  Affairs, within the College's office of Diversity.  The Native  Science Foundations Summer Science Camp will take Mohawk 7th, 8th,  and 9th grade students to the college's Adirondack mountain campus  at Star Lake for a four week exploration of Plants, Water, Earth,  and Air.  ***",
