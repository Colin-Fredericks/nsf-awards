 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401079  Huang       The proposer has classified up to flow equivalence all 2-  component shifts of finite type. He has recently classified   n-component shifts of finite type when 1 is not an eigenvalue of  the defining matrix. The project is to complete the  classification for general n-component shifts of finite type by   proving a crucial \"two-sided\" realization theorem which may also   have a new implication to C*-algebras. Moreover, based on the   existing results, the proposer intends to study (almost) flow   equivalence of sofic shifts, of stochastic Markov shifts and of  the more general setting of Laurent polynomial matrices.  Especially, he plans to explore more interesting relations  between flow equivalence and C*-algebras, including a conjecture  he made for the classification of non-simple Cuntz-Krieger  algebras associated to 2-component shifts of finite type.       This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic  theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of  systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be  followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading of \"dynamics\"  can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract  transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory  makes contact with geometry and algebra in their quests to  clasify flows and algebraic structures.  ***",
