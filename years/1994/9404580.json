 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404580  Coleman       A study will be made of the governing equations of a nonlinear  theory of the dynamics of elastic rods that is complete to within  an error of order 2 in a rod's thickness, curvature, twist, and  stretch. As the theory does not presuppose that displacements and  rotations are small, its governing equations are not linear. Recent  numerical experiments have indicated that these equations are  approximately but not completely integrable in the sense of the  theory of solitons. As a first step toward the development of a  theory of the vibrations of structures whose elements obey the  nonlinear theory, information will be sought about the qualitative  properties of solutions for boundary data appropriate to such  single elements as cantilever beams. Other problems under  investigation in rod theory bear on issues that arise in theories  of the tertiary structure of DNA molecules. To have a theory of the  dynamics of rods that accounts for internal dissipation, the theory  of elastic rods will be generalized to one appropriate to nonlinear  viscoelastic materials. In a separate area of research, a study  will be made of the role of nonlinear effects in the theory of the  stability of solid bodies against changes of shape caused by  surface diffusion. Recent research has shown that a familiar result  in the linearized thery of the stability of circular cylinders  against surface diffusion, to the effect that a cylinder is stable  against all sinusoidal perturbations of wavelength less than the  circumference of the unperturbed cylinder, must be modified when  nonlinear terms in the governing equations are taken into  account.The research to be performed under the project on the  mechanics of rods is expected to have implications for the design  of methods of controlling the vibration of structures, for  understanding factors that affect the stability of motions of  helicopter rotor blades, for obtaining an understanding of the  phenomenon of supercoiling in DNA, and for finding  the mechanisms  of the action of the enzymes called topoisomerases. The work on the  stability of bodies against surface diffusion bears on several  important problems concerning the durability of ohmic conductors in  micro-electronic devices and the design of micro-electromechanical  devices.",
