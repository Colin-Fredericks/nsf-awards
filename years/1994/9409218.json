 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Supercomputer Computations Research Institute (SCRI) at the Florida  State University is organizing a conference entitled \"The Third International  Conference on Bioinformatics and Genome Research\", to be held at the  Augustus B. Turnbull III Florida State Conference Center, Tallahassee Florida,  from June 1-4, 1994.  This conference is the third biennial conference since it  was started by SCRI in 1990.  The aim of the Third Conference is to provide a  forum in which experts from both the academic and industrial sectors,  including young researchers and students, can gather to interact.  It is hoped  that this will afford them an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the  scope, direction, and future prospects of informatics, computing and analysis  techniques in genome related areas.    Speakers and participants will be computational experts, experimentalists and  technologists from around the world.  The interdisciplinary nature of the  conference is designed to:         o foster an exchange of ideas and information among disciplines; and       o lead to a transfer of technologies, especially from the academic sector            to the private sector.           The focus of the conference will be on the computational and            experimental aspects of genome and genome-related analyses.             The subject areas cover:         o Nucleic acid and protein sequence research (Chairperson: Andrzej            Konopka)       o Computational/theoretical integrative approaches to gene regulation            and metabolism (Chairperson: Collado Vidas)       o Genome rearrangement (Chairperson: Pavel Pevzner)       o Database integration/interoperability (Chairperson: Hwa Lim)       o Molecular informatics of HIV (Chairperson: Hans Sieburg)       o Linguistics approaches (Chairperson: Sarah Barron)       o Methods for understanding genetic data through graphic displays            (Chairperson: Janan Eppig)       o Visualization of biological processes (Chairperson: Heinrich Giese n).              Leading experts in the field have committed to participate, and four            publishing companies have expressed interest in publishing the            conference proceedings.         This is a proposal to seek funding to help support conference speakers,            post-doctoral fellows and students.",
