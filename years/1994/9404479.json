 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finite mixture models are increasingly popular in the social and  medical sciences for analyzing data thought to arise from a  population consisting of categorical types. This research project  considers Bayesian methods for analyzing data using finite  mixture models. The application of classical methods to such  models is difficult because the likelihoods for such models are  nonstandard:  they are inherently multimodal due to symmetries in  the labeling of the mixture components, may be multimodal even  for a single fixed labeling of the components, and fail to  satisfy the regularity conditions required for classical  likelihood ratio tests. The principal scientific questions of  interest concern drawing inferences about model parameters,  determining the number of mixture components, and stochastically  classifying sampling units into the mixture components. Modern  advances in statistical computing, such as the EM and ECM  algorithms, data augmentation, and Gibbs sampling, are used to  obtain inferences about the posterior distribution of model  parameters; however special care is needed in applying these  methods because of the difficulties mentioned above. This  research describes methods for distinguishing between the two  types of modes described above, and for carrying out the data  analysis given the existence of multiple modes. Draws from the  posterior distribution of the model parameters can be used to  obtain draws from the posterior predictive distribution of  replicate experiments similar to the current experiment. The  posterior predictive distribution of test statistics, or of other  discrepancy measures, can be used to evaluate the fit of a model,  e.g., comparing two component and three component mixture models  even though the problem is irregular. Additionally, averaging  over a prior distribution on plausible alternatives to the  existing model can be used to estimate the sample size required  to assess the appropriateness of the existing model against such  alternatives  and therefore can be used to inform design  decisions.    It is not uncommon to consider a particular class of statistical  models, called mixture models, that assume the population of  interest consists of a number of relatively homogeneous  subpopulations. Mixture models are useful when a relatively  complex model would be required to describe the pattern of data  that is observed within the entire population, whereas a  relatively simple model applies within each subpopulation.  Classical approaches are of limited use in such cases, e.g.,  classical methods do not apply to the crucial question of  determining whether and how many subpopulations are in evidence.  This research proposal aims to develop new methods for analyzing  data using mixture models and for assessing the adequacy of such  models. These new methods take advantage of recent theoretical  and computational advances to draw accurate inferences about the  important features of the mixture models. The basic approach is  to average over all descriptions of the population that are  supported by the data and thereby provide an accurate assessment  of the variation and patterns to be expected in the population.",
