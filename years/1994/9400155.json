The focus of this project is on  the social and cultural aspects of the location of this large  center of high technology outside of the industrialized world,a nd  its relation to the small multiethnic society surrounding it on the  edge of the South American rainforest.  Two interrelated questions  guide the investigation:  First, what is the significance of  geographic and social location within a technical system, and the  relationship of technology to issues of development?  Second, what  are the symbolic roles of technology in the cultural evaluation of  development.  Through an ethnographic and historical examination of  interactions between international technology and a particular  place, the project seeks to compliment recent exchanges between  anthropology and social studies of science and technology by  presenting within a local frame a specific case study of one  extension of modern technology beyond the West.  This grant  provides support for ethnographic fieldwork in French Guiana as  well as archival research in France.  ***",
