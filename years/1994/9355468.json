The conference will be held at Montgomery Community  College, Blue Bell, PA and service participants from that area.   Participants will receive a conference proceedings and must commit  to part of an e-mail network with regular contributions coming from  conference leaders, participants and technical support staff.     The Conference will provide a graphing calculator to the 200  participants, and a project kit for each school from which teachers  attend.  Texas Instruments, Inc. has made the calculators and  projector kits available to the conference project at discount  prices.  Participation in the conference requires a signed  agreement of understanding from the teacher and building principal  to provide local access to the network and regular contributions by  the teacher.    The project evaluation will be carried out through participant  questionnaires at the completion of the conference, after 0.5  years, and after 1 year.  These will focus on the value of the  conference in involving the teacher's involvement of participants  in using technology in their instruction.  A log of e-mail use will  be studied in relation to getting teachers into electronic dialog.  ***",
