The Boundary Element Method (BEM) has now reached a stage in its development where it is no longer purely a research tool used by academics but a viable analytical technique for engineering analysis and design.  Indeed, the BEM is making inroads with industrial users.  There exists a need for an international forum for researchers to exchange ideas and expose industrial users to their developments and conversely for industrial users to expose researchers to novel issues arising form their experience in using the BEM.   The ninth Boundary Element Technology Conference to be held in Orlando will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between, industrial users, boundary element researchers, and commercial and research code developers.  It is co-organized by the Wessex Institute of Technology which is part of the Florida State University System.  There is much local industrial interest in the BEM as is evidenced by the letters provided by the industrial members of the Local Organizing Committee.  Further, the Florida Section of the ASME has sponsored the conference and will be instrumental in publicizing and supporting the Conference.  The International Society for Boundary Elements (ISBE) will sponsor the Conference and will publicize it in its newsletter.  The Proceedings of the Conference will be published by Computational Mechanics and Elsevier Press, will be distributed to all delegates, and will serve as an important source of reference in the applications of the BEM. The proceeding will be disseminated worldwide by the publishers.  ***",
