 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400672  Hosmane  Southern Methodist Univ.  Dr. Narayan Hosmane, Chemistry Department, Southern Methodist University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for an investigation into the preparation and chemistry of complexes of small carborane ligands. Coordinately unsaturated lanthanacarboranes will be prepared and utilized as precursors to 14-electron metal alkyl derivatives. The reactivity patterns of \"carbon separated\" six-atom carboranes will be established with main group, early transition, and lanthanide metals and comparisons will be drawn with related \"carbon apart\" derivatives. Neutral, zwitterionic, and/or ionic, 14-electron carborane and mixed ligand complexes will be prepared and evaluated as Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalysts.   In order to utilize metal ions in many important applications, it is often necessary to contain them in molecular assemblages which permit them to interact with other species in a controlled fashion. A common way of achieving this goal is to utilize groups (ligands) which may be attached to a metal in order to create a specific desired environment about the metal. In this project compounds a relatively unstudied class of \"ligands\", the six atom carboranes, will be studied to learn their ability to stabilize electron poor metals so that they may form valuable catalysts.",
