They are revising the  mathematics curriculum, beginning with the calculus, to emphasize  conceptual understanding and problem solving. Initially, the  project is impacting 1,100 students per year with the potential of  serving more than 3,000 Calculus, Differential Equations,  Statistics, and Precalculus students per year. A laboratory  component is an essential part of the plan. This mathematics  initiative is designed to motivate students for success and  stimulate an interest in calculus by emphasizing collaborative team  learning, discovery-based learning, and practical application  models. The laboratory component is providing visual reinforcement  of mathematical concepts and encouraging student exploration and  experimentation through open-ended exercises. Instruction  emphasizes solution strategies, modeling skills, and mathematical  reasoning. They are also promoting the development of students'  verbal and written communications skills through laboratory  reports. These student writings foster the ability to explain the  practical significance of application problems and their solutions.  An ongoing formative evaluation is an integral part of the  development process and is guiding them throughout the  implementation of the grant. They are collecting and analyzing data  on the effectiveness of the laboratory team approach. Participating  faculty are developing computer-interactive laboratory assignments.",
