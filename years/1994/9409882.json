 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409882  Peck  This research will explore the impact of demand uncertainity-  -uncertainty about the number and types of customers-- on  the workings of markets. The study is divided into two  parts. The first part will demonstrate that, under suitable  conditions, the only firms who survive competition are those  who commit to sell at a fixed price. If demand is higher  than expected, firms ration some of their customers rather  than increase their prices. This \"price competition\" has  been assumed by previous authors; this study attempts to  explain it. The second part of the study will show how the  nature of demand uncertainty can effect the efficiency of  manufacturer-retailer relationships. Specifically, it will  compare resale price maintenance, where the retail price is  set by the manufacturer, to a perfectly competitive retail  market. Conditions will be derived under which resale price  maintenance provides higher profits to the manufacturer and  higher utility to the customers than a perfectly competitive  retail market. Under these conditions, perfect retail  competition is \"destructive\" in the sense of yielding lower  economic welfare than resale price maintenance.  The project is important because it attempts to explian the  organization of retail markets. The results from the study  promise to give us a better understanding of pricing  \"processes\" beyond the traditional view of price  competition.",
