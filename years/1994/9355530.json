 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355530  Hackbarth    The Milwaukee Public Museum will develop two test stations: A  Wetland/Wood Station and a Mobile Testing Station that will be used  to evaluation how hands-on activities that incorporate scientific  tools and methods can be applied to supplement the educational  experience of traditional natural history museum dioramas.  As a  result of the MPM's work, visitors will become engaged in a \"field  experience\" by means of techniques to encourage observing,  recording of data, and hypothesizing using tools that a scientists  might use to study the natural environment such as a hand lens,  radio telemetry receiver, scales, rulers, and/or calipers.   Visitors will also have the opportunity to investigate further in  the \"lab\".  Here visitors will use such tools as a computer,  microscope, measuring grid, and they will be encouraged to  experiment, infer, predict, and classify.  The intent is to have  the visitor discover how scientific information is used to support  decisions in every day life.  The development of these stations  will be accompanied by considerable formative and summative  evaluation studies.  The results will be disseminated in order that  other natural history museums with dioramas may replicate these  ideas in order that visitors might move beyond the primary \"animal  identification\" phase in their examination and enjoyment of  dioramas.",
