The proposed work is  focussed on the scattering of alkali ions from copper surfaces as  model systems to study these dynamics.  Both the energy and angular  distributions of scattered positive ions and neutrals are measured.   Trajectory simulations will be used to test scattering models and  potentials, and determine energy transfer and trapping mechanisms.   Energy spectra peak widths will be used to study surface atom  binding forces.  Additional techniques, including Auger Electron  Spectroscopy, will be used to study trends in the trapping  probabilities as a function of ion and surface species, energy, and  geometry.  New simulation capabilities will be developed to  determine trapping mechanisms.  Comparisons of scattered neutral  and ion fluxes will be used to determine neutralization  probabilities and investigate the role of charge transfer in the  collision and trapping dynamics.  New experimental and simulation  capabilities are proposed to enable the study of the collision,  charge transfer and trapping dynamics of reactive ion-surface  collisions.  Trapping trends and overlayer deposition will be  studied with Auger and scanning tunneling microscopy.  The  information obtained from these studies will be useful for modeling  the interactions that occur in surface processing and thin film  deposition.  Such information could also be used to optimize these  techniques.  ***",
