These phospholipids will be  incorporated into monolayer vesicles as specific analytical reagents  designed to sequester nonelectrolyte solutes in a controlled  environment, for subsequent characterization by fluorescence  spectroscopy.  The vesicles constructed from these bipolar lipids will  be studied using steady state, lifetime, and polarization luminescence  spectroscopy, as well as classical and dynamic light scattering.  With  these techniques, the location of the solute within the vesicle will be  elucidated.  By varying the nature of the bipolar lipid used to make  the vesicles, the effect of pocket size and vesicle capacity will be  determined.  The long term goal of this research is the development of  analytical methodology that is sufficiently selective to accomplish the  analysis of complex, biologically relevant samples through selective  complexation within vesicles using multiparametric, microenvironment-  sensitive spectroscopy.  %%%  This research aims to design new lipid molecules that will enable a  particular analyte to be trapped for subsequent analysis.  These  bipolar lipids consist of two polar ends, and a nonpolar interior.   These molecules spontaneously assemble into spherical assemblies,  called vesicles.  The chemical characteristics of the lipids are  tailored to enclose specific molecules within the vesicle.  This will  provide a highly selective analysis method for compounds of biological  or environmental significance.  One difficulty in trying to identify  and quantify chemical compounds in many real systems is that the  responses obtained from the instrument are susceptible to interferences  from numerous interfering compounds.  The research undertaken by  Professor Neal shows real promise for solving t his fundamental analysis  problem.  ***",
