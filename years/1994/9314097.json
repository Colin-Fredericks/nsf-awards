 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314097  Ting       The behavior of the atmosphere in midlatitudes is strongly  influenced the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific,  particularly during the periods of anomalous sea surface warming  known as El Nino.  The purpose of this research project to  understand what mechanisms are at work during these periods which  act to organize the higher frequency atmospheric motions,  particularly the role of the time mean flow.  A dry primitive  equation model, derived from a full general circulation model, will  be used for this study.  An idealized tropical heating anomaly,  representing the tropical signal during an El Nino event, will be  imposed on the time mean climatology.  Sensitivity of the  extratropical response will be tested by varying the location of  the tropical heating anomaly and by changing the time mean basic  states to which the anomaly is applied.  The results should provide  insights into the what determines the organization of the  transients.  This research may provide a basis for improving  weather forecasting during El Nino events.  ***",
