 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific advancement in Environmental Physical and Mathematical  Sciences and Engineering, and Geosciences require comprehensive  multidisciplinary education and research at the cutting edge of  science and technology.  The requested program at the University of  Missouri-Columbia addresses the related critical need for human  resources by providing PhD level education to five NSF Trainees in  the multidisciplinary investigation of Particulate Systems, both  natural and engineered.    NSF Trainees will be recruited through vigorous advertising  throughout the nation.  MU has a history of successful recruiting  and nurturing of talented undergraduate students (~70; a major  portion of whom are from groups underrepresented in science and  engineering) through the NSF-REU in Particulate Systems Engineering  program.  The requested Traineeships will allow significant  opportunities to the brightest of these students, as well as others  to be recruited for the awards.    The program will provide Trainees with a challenging yet supportive  environment.  Students will receive both the MS and PhD degrees  from the participating academic disciplines in engineering and the  sciences, and the program faculty will carefully plan and monitor  the students' teaching and research development.  Curricula for the  GRA Trainees will include classes in thermodynamics, fluid  dynamics, particulate systems, atmospheric dynamics, atomic and  molecular physics and chemistry, computational chemistry and  climatology.  Experimental research will focus on characterizations  and measurements of particle-vapor (gas) and particle-particle  interactions, dry and wet disposition of particles and gases, trace  gas emissions and transformations, and radiative properties of  particles.  Theoretical and computationally intensive projects will  focus on sulfur chemistry, particle dynamics and general  circulation models.  The education and training of students  emphasize integrated approaches to complex environmental problems.    Professional development opportunities for the Trainees will  include internships at the national laboratories and industrial  research centers in the U.S., and possibly at prestigious  universities/institutions in the U.S., Germany, Japan, and Russia  that conducts relevant particulate systems investigations.    The University of Missouri system educational mission charges MU  with special responsibilities for graduate education.  The College  of Engineering specifically has made major investments in  infrastructure (new building, renovations, equipment, computing).   The project faculty are dedicated to the success of the program,  and funding will lead to truly unique, interdisciplinary  opportunities for the Trainees.",
