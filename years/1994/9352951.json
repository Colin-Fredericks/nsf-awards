 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352951  Snyder    The State University College at Buffalo will initiate a five week  summer residential program in environmental science for 24 students  entering the 11th and 12th grades.  Special emphasis is given to  those scientific concepts that relate to Great Lakes research.  The  major goal of the program is to increase awareness of and heighten  interest in environmental science as a career choice.Environmental  science concepts and research methodologies as they relate to Great  Lakes research will be explored through lectures and hands on  laboratory activities.  Students carry out independent research  projects and present their findings at a closing day program.   Information on careers in environmental science, careers in pre-  college math/ science teaching and college planning is provided  using discussion groups, panels of experts and field trips.  A  Great lakes education module outlining ways that high school  teachers can use Great Lakes environmental matters in their biology  courses will be developed by YSP faculty.  Research projects based  on approaches suggested in this module will be submitted to state  or regional science fair competitions.  ***",
