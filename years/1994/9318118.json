 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a multi-user confocal microscope and  supporting instrumentation.  The core user group at Duke  University include faculty in the Department of Chemistry,  Zoology, Cell Biology, Immunology, and the Section of Cell  Growth, Regulation and Cancer.    In 1994, a new building, the Science Resource Center, now  being built as a multidisciplinary science facility, will be  occupied.  The building will house the School of the  Environment, and components of the Schools of Engineering,  Arts and Sciences, and Medicine.  One of the core facilities  in that building will be an microscopic Imaging Center.  The  intent for that facility, and all other shared-user  technologies in the building, is to keep the hardware and  software at the leading edge of biotechnology and to find  ways to interface these technologies with advances in other  emerging areas.  Also being planned for the new building are  an NMR center, X-ray crystallography and protein modeling  Center, and the University's transgenic mouse Center.  Each  of these Centers will be shared user operations which will  complement one another and will interface with the  Microscopic Imaging Center.  These Centers will foster new  developments as the chemists, biophysicists, physicists,  biochemists, biologists, and computer scientists interact  with one another in the continuing development of these  technologies.  This application for a confocal microscope  brings together seven faculty from five departments as the  core users.  Each of us has used confocal microscopes,  either at other institutions (four of us are new faculty at  Duke), or at Duke.  At present the Center has one confocal  microscope that has been getting increasingly heavier use.  That microscope is in need of an upgrade, and it is no  longer, by itself, capable of supporting many of the  applications that are proposed.  Therefore, this request is  for partial support of an effort to upgrade the existing  microscope and to purchase a newer generation of confoc al  microscope plus support hardware and software.  Our projects  are quite varied.  New innovations, plus the increase in  traffic of users will require a new microscopic platform and  newly available laser sources, plus they will be facilitated  by the networking capabilities that will be build into the  new building.",
