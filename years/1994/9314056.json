 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314056  Amer       Motivated in particular by multimedia applications, a Partial  Order Connection (POC) service/protocol is proposed for end-to-end  communication.  Unlike classic transport services that deliver  objects either in the exact order transmitted or according to no  particular order, POC provides a service that requires some, but  not all objects to be received in the order transmitted.  Two  versions of POC are proposed: reliable, which requires that all  transmitted objects are eventually delivered, and unreliable, which  permits the service to control the loss of a subset of the objects.   In the unreliable version, objects are more finely categorized into  one of three reliability classes depending on their temporal value.   Further understanding of POC is accomplished by using Estelle (ISO  Standard 9074) and Estelle development tools to formally specify a  protocol that provides POC service.  The expected performance gains  of a POC service will be studied both analytically and with an  OPNET simulation.  To be studied are the expected  memory/bandwidth/delay performance improvements using POC when  compared with an ordered service for various combinations of: (1)  different partial orders and loss tolerances, (2) different  distributions of disorder and loss supplied by the underlying  service and (3) different sized sender-receiver buffers.  ***",
