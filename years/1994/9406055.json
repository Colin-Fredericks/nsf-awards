 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9406055  A long-term objective of this project is to understand the effects of  individual plant mitochondrial genes on organelle biogenesis and  overall cellular function. The genetic analysis of plant mitochondrial  genomes has been limited due to the fact that only a few mutations with  known progenitors have been described. We have focused on a set of  lethal maize mutations (Nonchromosomal stripe; NCS) that survive in  heteroplasmic plants. Different NCS mutants are associated with  distinct phenotypes and the mutations have been shown to be deletions  affecting the expression of at least three different mitochondrial  genes (cox2, nad4 and the co-transcribed S3 an L16 ribosomal protein  genes. The major goal of the current proposal is to transform  mitochondria that are homoplasmic for a deletion of the 5' end and  promoter sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 with a  distinguishable, functional copy of cox2. This would open up higher  plant mitochondria to genetic manipulations that cannot otherwise be  performed. Normal and mutant promoter constructs will be tested in  vivo. We propose to continue our analyses of new mitochondrial  mutations, particularly the partially characterized NCS4 mutation. The  NCS4 mutant rearrangement involves S2-plasmid sequences that have  incorporated into the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we propose to  continue our genetic approach to analyzing the roles of mitochondria  during plant development. The mutants in different steps of oxidative  phosphorylation have distinguishable effects on chlorophyll levels and  the production of nuclear-coded products for chloroplast function. We  will also use the mutants to determine when mitochondrial function is  essential for the survival of cells, tissues and organs.  %%%  The long-term objective of this project is to understand the effects of  individual plant mitochondrial genes on organelle biogenesis and  overall cellular function.  During the tenure of this award, the focus  will be on: (1) devel oping procedures for transforming higher plant  mitochondria (2) continuing the analysis of existing mitochondrial  mutations and (3) continuing to genetically analyze the role(s) of  mitochondria during plant development.  ***",
