Moreover, there is a strong  emphasis on interconnection and interoperability.  This is a  proposal for a computer science course in computer networks which:          1.     takes a top down approach;         2.     focuses on the performance of upper layers of computer                network architecture, on routing, and on routing                protocols; and         3.     requires implementation, experimentation, and                mathematical analysis.  Part of the project includes upgrading existing software, for the  implementation of and experimentation with a simple internet.  It  also includes the development of other software to run experiments  on routing protocols.  Interconnection and interoperability is gained at layers above the  data-link layer.  A course which requires implementation,  experimentation, and mathematical analysis, and which focuses on  the performance of those layers will much better prepare computer  science students than one which surveys the field of data  communications.",
