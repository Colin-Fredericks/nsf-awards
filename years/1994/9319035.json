 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wedler  9319035  Aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) of E. coli, a classical  allosteric enzyme, catalyzes the first step of pyrimidine  biosynthesis.  Inhibitors (CTP & UTP) and activator (ATP) bind at  r-chain sites and transmit conformational signals to separate   c-chain catalytic sites over 60A away.  In the past decade, high  resolution x-ray structures of T- and R-state enzyme have vastly  enhanced our ability to address complex structure-function  questions with this complex system.  Site-specific mutation of  potentially important residues has yielded over 50 different  species.  With careful selection of mutants for certain types of  intriguing changes in kinetic properties, one can address specific  mechanistic questions and test current hypotheses for ATCase  regulation.  Dynamic behavior of ATCase will be investigated  primarily by isotopic exchange kinetics at chemical equilibrium  (EIEK), proven to be powerful and insightful for defining changes  in specific rate constants caused by bound modifiers or site-  specific mutations.  Two new methods have been developed recently  that permit rapid, in-depth kinetic screening of a variety of  ATCase mutants: (a) a faster, more user-friendly version of the  ISOBI methods, and (b) a faster, more facile exchange reaction,  {14C}CP-CAsp, used in place of the laborious {32P}-CP - P, method.   To cross-check and validate EIEK data with this complex system,  results from other kinetic methods will be used, including stopped-  flow kinetics (with K.A. Johnson) to determine specific rate  constants, and kinetic isotope effects (in collaboration with M.H.  O'Leary).  %%%  Enzymes are biological catalysts that regulate the biosynthesis and  degradation of all biomolecules.  A detailed knowledge of the  structure-function of key regulatory enzymes is essential for  understanding disease states and in designing rational therapies.   One means of stressing such enzymes is the introduction of site  specific mutations at selected amino acid residues.  O nce this is  done, the mutant enzymes must be characterized in-depth by kinetic  methods.  The kinetic approach in which this laboratory specializes  is isotope exchange at chemical equilibrium.  Due to its ability to  observe the fast and slow steps in both directions simultaneously,  this method is uniquely suited for defining exactly which kinetic  steps are altered by a mutation.  Data fitting is accomplished by  new, user-friendly computer simulation programs.  Ultimately, the  dynamic changes must be correlated with structural data derived  from x-ray crystal studies and molecular modeling of protein  conformational changes.",
