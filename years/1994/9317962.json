 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317962  Teintze  The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry needs a new preparative ultracentrifuge which would be located in Gaines Hall. There is at present only one functional ultracentrifuge in the Department, a 19 year old L3 50 instrument belonging to Dr. Dratz, which is incapable of meeting the Department's present and future needs. This obsolete machine has been derated by the manufacturer (Beckman Instruments) and can no longer be used with many rotors, such as the SW60 Ti rotor, which Dr.Teintze brought with him and needs for his work. Furthermore, one ultracentrifuge cannot handle the increased use resulting from Dr. Teintze's arrival in the Department in the fall of 1992 and that of Dr. Dooley in June of 1993. Two additional investigators in the Department, Drs. Hapner and Jackson, also need ultracentrifuges for their research.    The Department also lacks a large capacity fixed angle rotor. The Type 30 rotor that it owns has been derated to a maximum of 10,000rpm because of its age (21 years) and amount of use, which makes it useless for the required applications. We are therefore applying for matching funds to purchase a new ultracentrifuge and funds for a preparative rotor.    Ultracentrifuges are essential equipment for all researchers in biochemistry and molecular biology. The new ultracentrifuge will be used primarily by the labs of Drs. Teintze, Dratz and Dooley, so the proposal contains descriptions of their projects that require its use. These projects are all funded by ongoing NIH or NSF research grants. The instrument will be used for density gradient analysis of proteoliposomes, membrane puri fication, cell fractionation, and DNA purification.    Project 1, entitled \"The Mechanism of Protein Insertion into Lipid Bilayers\", requires the most centrifugation time. It involves isolating the DNA coding for a bacterial membrane protein, making site specific mutations in the gene, and determining the effect of the resulting amino acid changes on the ability of the protein to insert into a membrane, both in the bacterium and in vitro using purified protein and phospholipid vesicles. The membrane protein and DNA purifications use ultracentrifugation, and the analysis for insertion in to lipid vesicles requires it also. This is done using density gradients that take 18 hours using the SW60 Ti rotor, but require centrifugation for 2 or 3 days using the rotors that can be used in the old L3 50 centrifuge. These long runs tie up the centrifuge for long periods of time, interfering with their use for preparative work for this and other projects.    Project 2, which involves purification of the human membrane CFTR and its insertion into phospholipid vesicles for the purpose of developing a therapy for cystic fibrosis, also utilizes similar techniques requiring the new ultracentrifuge.    Drs. Dratz and Dooley (Projects 3 and 4, respectively) would also be primary users of the requested instrument for membrane and protein purification. Project 3 involves isolation of rod outer segment membranes and rhodopsin; project 4 requires the isolation and purification of a number of bacterial membrane enzymes. All of these procedures would require ultracentrifugation using a preparative rotor such as the Type 45Ti we are requesting funds to purchase.      r                       r       *                 -                 2   J           9       :   J   ;   O   ;       G   j                   X       Z   G           _       `       k          _     u        WV F    ^     F ;F t      +  F  ~  u    j    V   W v j j j j j9317962  Teintze  The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry needs a new preparative ultra centrifuge which would be located in            r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <   >   #   %                   p   r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !         !         !         !         !         !
