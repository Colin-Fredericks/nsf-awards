 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419528  Heckman  The research proposed in this application concerns a quantitative  understanding of the dynamics of skeletal muscle.  The project  has two major objectives: (1) to continue the development of a  model of muscle firmly based on biophysics and biochemistry, and  (2) to test and validate the model in carefully controlled animal  experiments.  The model is a mathematical approximation to A.F.  Huxley's biophysical cross-bridge theory of contraction.  Current  models for a most important element of the neuromuscular control  system-its actuator, skeletal muscle-have tended to be rather  crude viscoelastic analogies with only the most tenuous  connection to modern biological concepts about how the muscle  works.  A state-variable model of a skeletal muscle fiber as a  direct mathematical approximation to biophysical cross-bridge  models of the type introduced by A.F. Huxley will continue to be  developed in this project.  This model is call the Distributed-  Moment Model of muscle because it emphasizes the important role  of the moments of the actin-myosin bond-distribution function.  These moments have macroscopic interpretations as muscle  stiffness, force, and elastic energy.  Thus it is of particular  significance that this model establishes a direct connection  between the macroscopic behavior of muscle and contractile  mechanisms believed to be operating at the molecular level.  The  project is a joint effort with Heckman at Northwestern University  (grant number 9318631).  ***",
