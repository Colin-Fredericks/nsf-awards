 "awd_abstract_narration": "Williams  9317733    The current paradigm explaining how coral reefs maintain high  biomass of organisms and extremely high rates of gross primary  productivity is that tight recycling of nutrients and organic  matter occurs within the reef resulting in zones of net autotrophy  alternating with zones of net heterotrophy.  Autotrophic upstream  communities are thought to support downstream heterotrophic  assemblages with the overall balance resulting in ecosystem P/R  ratios near unity. According to this paradigm, coral reefs are not  coupled significantly to the surrounding oligotrophic ocean.     Recent studies suggest that coral reefs may be much more dependent  on hydrodynamic processes than currently believed.  Although  nutrient concentrations of tropical waters are very low, an  enormous volume of water is advected across the reef and could  result in a large flux of nutrients to benthic primary producers.   The major upstream autotrophic zone is the reef flat where algal  turf assemblages are responsible for the majority of primary  productivity. Previous work has demonstrated that rates of primary  productivity and nitrogen fixation of algal turf are affected  significantly by water flow speed. Furthermore, flow measurements  on one reef suggest that algal canopy height significantly alters  the local hydrodynamic regime and as a result, metabolic processes  of algal turfs may be diffusion-limited for a significant  proportion of time.    This project will test the hypothesis that rates of primary  productivity and nitrogen fixation of coral reef algal turfs are  diffusion-limited.  Measurements of the flow environment on a reef  flat will be made and used to estimate the degree to which algal  turfs varying in canopy height are diffusion-limited. The project  will then move on to test hypotheses about the specific factors  that result in diffusion-limitation.  The results of this project  should fill a gap on empirical measurements of water flow in coral  reef environments and how water  flow affects algal metabolism.    The results of this research may lead to a significant paradigm  shift in understanding how coral reefs function.  Demonstration  that reefs are open ecosystems that are strongly coupled to the  surrounding ocean environment would have important implications for  predictions of the effects of global climate change on these unique  ecosystems.  ***",
