This is a very versatile system which  demonstrates modern techniques in spectroscopy and allows a wide  range of chemical and physical phenomena to be explored. A nitrogen  laser will provide very short ultraviolet light pulses suitable for  initiating spectroscopic and kinetics studies. The electronics will  permit students to follow process on the nanosecond and microsecond  time scale. A dye laser accessory extends the output throughout the  visible range. The primary use will be in an upper level integrated  Analytical-Physical Chemistry laboratory course. The students will  study the lifetime of excited states through fluorescence. They  will observe short lived reaction intermediates and will study the  kinetics of the quenching of fluorescence. The apparatus will  enhance current student work; for example, we will use Raman  spectra to complement the current Infrared spectroscopy module.  Several experiments are directed at areas of Materials Science  including time resolved studies of photoconductivity in  polyacetylene, the luminescence of microporous silicon, and the  study of quantum size effects in the fluorescence of metal sulfide  clusters.",
