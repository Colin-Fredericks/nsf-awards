The first concerns higher order elliptic  operators on non-smooth domains.  Although considerable work has  already been done on equations defined on non-smooth domains, it  remains to understand the optimal spaces for prescribing boundary  data and obtaining unique solutions.  The second set of questions  lies in second order elliptic theory, motivated partially by  examples connected with the square root problem of Kato.   The question of solving the regularity problem, which is the  essential goal, for certain complex elliptic equations has  only been completely solved for the one-dimensional equation.   In general, without heavy symmetry assumptions, not much is know.   The third project concerns operators invariant under  a multiparameter family of dilations.  These operators may  be viewed as product-type operators.  To obtain sharp estimates  and bounds for the operators on functions which are  simply integrable, one needs a different point of view.  While  some work has been accomplished on restricted families of  dilations, the issue of understanding the boundedness of such  operators with general k-parameter dilations.       Partial differential equations form a basis formathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
