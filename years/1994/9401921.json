 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401921  Wang       This award supports mathematical research on the regularity  theory of partial differential equations and problems of crystal  growth.  Level surfaces, surfaces where functions are of constant  value, are the central subject in studies of phase transition,  geometric evolution and free boundary problems.  The work follows  the spirit of geometric measure theory and incorporates recent  work of Caffarelli on free boundaries.  Special level surfaces  appear as the boundary of crystals and the wave fronts of shock  waves in many mathematical models of the physical world.   This work seeks to understand the nature, stability and  mathematical properties of them.  Work will also be done on  crystal growth with Gibbs-Thomson effects.  Large-time existence  of these processes is established using variational methods,  which give the most reasonable physical solutions to this  long-standing problem.  Work will be done on the evolution of  crystalline surfaces and crystalline surface energies.  The long  range goal of the work is to understand the mechanical, chemical,  electrical and optical properties associated with solidification.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  Those equations often  develop as a result of some minimizing process which takes  the mathematical form of a variational problem.  The minimizer  then must satisfy a corresponding partial differential equation  which arises as a solution to this problem.  ***",
