INSTITUTION:  FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will aid in the  development of FT-ICR-Mass Spectrometry Facility in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  at Florida State University.  The research to be performed with this instrumentation include the  following:  direct sequencing, chemical reactivity, and shape analysis of gas-phase proteins up to  antibody size (150,000 Da); direct optical absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance  of mass-selected trapped ions; and routine direct identification of unseparated components of mixtures  as complex as crude oil.  This Facility will have the highest-field ICR mass spectrometers in the world.   The technological development in FT-ICR will have major impact in biological and analytical chemistry,  and the NSF center will enhance the spread of these development to a broad community of users.   Methods Development at the facility will include research on:        a)  internal and external ionization techniques,      b)  ion Sources for thermolabile and/or solid compounds,      c)  IR laser desorption (LD) and      d)  vaporization of high boiling point mixtures.    In-house core group research will be concerned with applications of FT-ICR-mass spectrometry  to:         a)  peptide and protein sequencing,       b)  hydrogen-deuterium exchange in proteins,       c)  phospholipid identification and structural analysis,       d)  EPR spectroscopy of mass-selected trapped ions       e)  glow discharge FT-ICR for elemental analysis and depth profiling in semiconductors, and       f)  optical spectroscopy of trapped ions.    User Facility:  In the first year 50% of instrument time will be available to users outside Florida State  University, increasing to 80% in subsequent years.    Education Outreach:  The facility will provide an outstanding training ground for st udents and other  scientists in academic and industry.  The program will include a large number of graduate and  postdoctoral student, and visiting professors and industrial scientists.  Intern programs will reach high  school and undergraduate students and teachers.  Representation by female and minority groups are  specifically included.    Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry is the most versatile technique  for unscrambling and quantifying ion-molecule reaction kinetics and equilibria in the absence of solvent  (i.e., the gas phase).  Applications, range from protein structure to crude oil.",
