 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418362  Hutchison  This starter grant award to the University of Oregon will  support the research of Professor James E. Hutchison. The theme  of the research will be the synthesis of functional ion channel  models based on polypeptide-supported poly(crown ethers). The  polypeptide serves to align stacks of crown ethers that form  the pore. The unique property of this ion-channel model is the  ease with which the model's structure can be systematically  varied to probe the dependence of ion transport through the  channel with the structure of the channel. The channel's inside  diameter, the molecular composition of the channel's lining,  the length of the channel, and the separation between crown  ethers within the polymer will be varied to give structurally  well-defined ion channel models. The nature of the ion  transport through these ion channels will be tested by  imbedding them in planar lipid bilayers and measuring the ion  fluxes through them as a function of ions in solution and  transmembrane potential.    Ion channels selectively mediate ionic transport through cell  membranes and play a major role in shaping biological  electrical impulses. This research will advance the fundamental  understanding of the structure/function relationship.",
