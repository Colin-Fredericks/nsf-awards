The defining feature of the  RGI has been the integration of researchers, graduate students,  undergraduates, and high school teachers in a structured  environment that allow all members to attain deeper understanding  of the mathematical sciences enterprise as a whole.  The project  is designed to increase mutual respect and understanding among  the groups, while advancing scholarship and learning.  In a  supportive setting where education at all levels is the explicit  concern, participants can make connections that are difficult or  impossible to achieve in their home locations.   The RGI is  managed by a small, decentralized group of mathematical  scientists and educators.  The Institute for Advanced Study  proposes to become the institutional leader of this program,   called the Park City/IAS Mathematics Institute.  The site for the  activity for the summer of 1994 will be at Park City, Utah.  ***",
