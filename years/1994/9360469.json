 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360469 Becker  There is an urgent, growing need for Tactual (Paperless Braille) Display Units (TDSUs) that serve the blind the way Visual Display Units (VDUs) serve sighted computer users.  But today's \"dot\" technology is complex, expensive, limited to single display lines and inherently unable to furnish the MULTILINE, realtime, \"monitor screens\" needed to provide the blind access equality with the sighted.  TACTILICS new and different dot technology can provide multiline monitors of any practical size that can simultaneously communicate with the sighted.  Screens of individually addressable \"cells\" will make editing fast and easy.  Dramatically reduced costs, will allow TACTILICS realtime, multiline, braille monitors to be made and sold at prices far below today's prohibitive (singleline) levels.  The research performed by this project will lead to cost effective, one on one teaching systems that provide the blind with direct access to data bases, bulletin boards, CD ROMs and other low cost sources of information.  The elimination of Braille/sightprint \"barriers\" will open many doors.  Being able to work directly with the sighted will create new employment opportunities.  Consequently, the tasks of learning, growing, and gaining independence will be made easier. ***",
