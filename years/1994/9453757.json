 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453757  Krakauer    The Museum of Life and Science will use this planning grant to  bring together zoo, botanical garden, and science center  professionals to a) assess the feasibility of an \"interactive zoo,\"  b) identify animals species that exhibit behaviors in a zoo  environment that provide natural opportunities for related  interactive exhibits, and c) generate a White Paper reviewing  relevant exhibits in zoos and science centers and proposing design  criteria for the interactive exhibits.    The planning activities include: the development of a \"White Paper\"  that will include a review of key research findings in  developmental psychology and visitor behavior as they apply to  playgrounds, zoos, and interactive exhibit environments, an  overview of relevant exhibit techniques and technologies, and case  studies of existing exhibits; a 2-day meeting to discuss the  issues; and travel to exemplary museums, zoos, aquaria, and  botanical gardens.    These results will be used in the development of interactive  exhibits in an outdoor setting included in the museum's Master Plan  2000.  They have proposed the analogy of a field research station  in their approach to learning in an outdoor setting.  They envision  three thematic \"field stations\": \"Down to Earth,\" \"Watery Worlds,\"  and \"Catch the Wind.\"  The specific exhibit plans will be finalized  after the completion of the planning grant.    Although the Museum of Life and Science will be the primary  beneficiary of this planning activity, the background information  gathered, the issues discussed, and the critical appraisals will be  relevant to other museums with and interested in developing  exhibits in an out-of-door setting.  The results will be broadly  disseminated by means of publications and presentations at  professional meetings.",
