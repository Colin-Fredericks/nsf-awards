 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a postdoctoral investigator to               assist in implementing state-of-the-art models of Crater Lake which             couple the observed atmospheric forcing with the heat budget, lake              circulation, and the hydrologic budget.  Crater Lake, the deepest               lake in the United States, is a closed-basin caldera lake, located              at an elevation of 1882 meters in the Cascade mountains of south-               central Oregon. Ongoing Limnological studies funded by the National             Park Service will be expanded by a new six-year study of climatic               control on the hydrologic budget, the heat budget, and on the                   circulation of the lake.  This program, will be funded by the Park              Service as part of the new \"Integrated Studies of National Park                 Ecosystems\" and will be tied in with other elements of the Olympic              Peninsula Biogeographic Area.  As part of this project, we have                 deployed a permanent thermistor mooring covering the full water                 column.  This continuous data set is also supported by CTD                      (conductivity, temperature, depth) data collected whenever the lake             is accessible ( 3 months/year).  Meteorological data is also being              collected on the lake from a buoy and from instrumentation                      elsewhere within the Park.  Precipitation data are collected  from              several locations and lake level is continuously monitored from a               USGS gauging station.                                                           The primary effort will be the application of various one                       dimensional vertical models of mixing and heat fluxes in the system             using the meteorological data sets to determine surficial fluxes                and the thermistor data set for model parameterization and                      validation.  Long-term goals for the modelling effort include the               eventual development of a biological model of primary and secondary             production for  this  ultra-oligotrophic system which must include              a proper description of lake physics.  The post-doctoral                        investigator will work closely with R. Collier (OSU Oceanography)               and with G. Larson (NPS and OSU Forestry) to integrate the model(s)             with on-going data collection and experimental design.",
