 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319099  Thompson  The development of optoelectronic switching and storage devices  based on planar bacteriorhodopsin films has been the focus of  intense international research efforts.  Utilization of these  devices is envisioned in a variety of pattern recognition systems  where rapid storage of high densities of optical information with  long storage lifetimes (> 1 ms) is required.  Although device  prototypes using bacteriorhopsin have been built that achieve this,  their design is limited by the stability, photophysical and  absorption characteristics of the multiple excited states, and poor  directional control of bacteriorhdopsin in planar arrays.  The  objective of the proposed research is to synthesize and  characterize a new class of materials that will couple  photochemically induced electron and ion transport reactions in  oriented, thin membrane films for application in optoelectronic  devices.  Immobilization of these materials onto optically  transparent electrode surfaces will provide a degree of  photochemical and electrochemical tunability in these materials  that is currently lacking in the bacteriorhopsin-based devices.  %%%  Gramicidin A-porphyrin-quinone (GAPQ triads, patterned in concept  after the membrane-bound reaction centers of photosynthetic  bacteria and plants, will be synthesized and incorporated into  vesicles composed of model archaebacterial bipolar membrane lipids  (bolalipids).  These materials will complement each other in a  composite triad/bolalipid photochemical system by: 1) vectorially  orienting the porphyrin and quinone within the membrane to produce  an asymmetric membrane structure having both oxidizing and reducing  surfaces, 2) inhibiting self-annihilation of the initially charge-  separated pair by placing terminal donor and acceptor moieties at  opposing membrane interfaces, 3) increasing the rate of  transmembrane electron transfer by reducing the donor-acceptor  separation distance, and 4) compensating for membrane polarization  resulting fro m transmembrane electron transfer by incorporating a  monovalent ion channel to dissipate the buildup of potential  gradients.  This proposal describes preparative chemistry,  structural and photochemical characterization, and sodium ion  conductance measurements aimed at optimizing vectorial electron and  ion transfer rates across bipolar lipid membranes.  The materials  aspects of the proposal are focused on developing modular bolalipid  and GAPQ synthetic pathways such that facile system integration  with respect to interfacial reactivity, efficient transmembrane  charge separation, and immobilization on solid support materials  can be achieved.  Experiments designed to probe the triad  orientation, ion channel properties, photochemical kinetics, and  electron/ion coupling in various GAPQ/bolalipid composite membrane  configurations using laser flash photolysis, differential scanning  calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy  techniques are also proposed.  The results of these investigations  will then be used to devise a suitable system for testing on  microporous and ITO supports.  ***",
