 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409049  Smith    This project uses a variety of time-resolved spectroscopic  techniques to shed some light on the dynamics of the exchange  interactions in II-VI semiconductors between electrons, holes and  magnetic impurities, as well as among the impurities themselves.   The goals of this research are the following:  (1) to study the  dynamics of formation and decay of exciton magnetic polarons in  different dimensional configurations, (2) to measure the relative  strength and spatial scale of the Manganese-Iron interaction in  Manganese doped Zinc-Selenium and Iron doped Zinc-Selenium  structure, (3) to measure optically the spatial diffusion of a  local perturbation of the magnetic spins in order to gain new  information on exchange interaction between the magnetic  impurities, and (4) to measure directly the effect of valence band  mixing on spin-relaxation rate.    %  %  %  %    The recent development of blue solid state lasers using Zinc-  Selenide has increased the need for understanding the basic physics  of elementary interactions in these materials.  In particular, the  basic relaxation mechanisms of highly excited electronic states in  these materials is directly applicable to the engineering of new  higher-efficiency laser-diodes.  This project will use a variety of  novel time-resolved optical spectroscopies to study the interaction  between electrons holes and magnetic impurities in wide-gap Zinc-  Selenide-based semiconductors.  In particular, we hope to gain  understanding on how the spins in these materials lose energy and  eventually form new confined states, as well as how the magnetic  interactions in these materials affect the transport properties of  electrons and holes.  ***",
