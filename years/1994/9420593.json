The curriculum will be part of a newly established New York Center for Biomedical Engineering (CBE).  The five institutions in the CBE consortium are the City College (CCNY) of the City University of New York (CUNY), the CUNY Medical School, the Hospital for Joint Diseases of the New York University School of Medicine (HJD), the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) of the Cornell University Medical College (CUMC) and the Graduate School of CUMC.  The core curriculum will enable beginning graduate engineering students to take an organized ancillary program, beyond their own engineering specialty, in biomedical engineering, and it will enable graduate students to obtain the Ph.D degree in a traditional engineering discipline with biomedical emphasis.  Five courses of an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional (based at the City College) core program on cell and tissue engineering are to be developed.  The five course set will include cell and tissue-material interaction, cell and tissue mechanics, cell and tissue transport, cell and tissue imaging and cell and tissue signal processing and instrumentation.  The research expertise of the biomedical researchers in the consortium lies in biomaterials, biomechanics, biotransport, instrumentations, imaging and signal processing.  ***",
