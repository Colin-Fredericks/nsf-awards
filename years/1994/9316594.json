The instrument makes use of the bright, tuneable undulator source at the X1A beamline. It uses zone plates fabricated under a Lawrence Berkeley Lab./IBM collaboration to form a 50 nm beam spot. The microscope is in routine operation, and is used by several groups to image wet biological specimens at the resolution set by the spot size.    New  imaging  modes  are  being  developed  that  extend  the applicability of the technique to map particular chemical states using  the  resonances  present  near  elemental  absorption  edges (XANES),  and using the detection of visible light  excited in fluorescent labels by the x ray beam.    In addition to continuing the operation of the microscope, support  is  requested  to  extend  the  XANES  contrast  imaging capability,  to  improve  substantially  the  stability  and  the resolution of the instrument, and to explore the possibilities in x ray microscopy at higher energies.    The team welcomes inquiries by investigators interested in using the instrument to solve biological problems matched to its unique capabilities.       u    ~ s &t &9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R   S T U V W X Y Z \\ K   _   ` a b c d e f g h i j k r m   o       I t u v w x y   { |   ~                                                                                                                                     9316594  Kirz  A scanning soft x ray microscope has been built and put into operation at the National Synchrot ron Light Source,     b   p                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   v   x                   ^   `   b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !         !         !         !
