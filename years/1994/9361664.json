 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361664  Swedlund  The goal of this project is to develop a tissue culture system  for the neem tree, Azadirachta indica, to provide a source of  pure secondary metabolites.  The best known product from this  plant is the insecticide azadirachtin.  This compound is  effective, even though it has a very low toxicity.  Production of  azadirachtin in tissue culture would provide a constant supply  year round, while eliminating the large quantities of solvents  that are required when this compound is obtained by extraction  from seed material.  The phase I research objectives include: (1)  the determination of the effects of various hormones on the  initiation and maintenance of cultures, and the production of  azadirachtin by cells of the neem tree; (2) the use of the best  cultures in further experiments designed to increase the levels  of azadirachtin; and (3) to determine the location within neem  seeds where azadirachtin is produced in order to develop better  cell types for tissue culture.  ***",
