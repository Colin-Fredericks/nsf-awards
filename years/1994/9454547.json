 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a partnership between the York County Area  Vocational-Technical School, the York City Schools, Penn State  University (at its York, Harrisburg and University Park Campuses),  regional industry and the Pennsylvania Department of Education.   The partnership is developing a comprehensive model for  technological education for 11th grade through the associate degree  level with possible extension to the baccalaureate level.  The  model focuses on manufacturing curriculum and educational  processes.  It will produce integrated and interdisciplinary  topical modules, teaching materials and resources for seven  courses. The modules will be developed collaboratively by teachers  and faculty.  The modules, which will focus on technical topics,  will be developed within the context of teacher/faculty workshops  on enhanced pedagogical techniques.  Use of the modules will  reinforce technical topics within the high school curriculum and  bring enhanced teaching techniques to the college curriculum.  All  educational levels will see better integration of topics and  clearly understand the interdependence of mathematics, science, and  technology.The project anticipates substantial dissemination to  secondary and postsecondary faculty at other Penn State locations,  and then to faculty across the state and nation.  The project plan  will capitalize on and integrate a variety of current efforts to  coordinate technological education in the state and region.",
