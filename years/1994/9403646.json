The investigators are  electrical engineers who propose to solve the problems  involved in end-to-end modeling and analysis for admission  control in ATM networks.  The project will advance the  technology so that an appropriate admission control  algorithm can be designed based on model predictions.   The  investigators (Drs. Ian Akyildiz from the Georgia Institute  of Technology and Erdal Arikan from Bilkent University) will  study the efficacy of the call admission algorithms while  utilizing results from the end-to-end models.  They intend  to exploit the special control features that can be provided  by an ATM network.  Using these control features, they can  allow a higher layer application to adapt to the state of  the network.  Project funding will enable Dr. Akyildiz to  work jointly with Dr. Arikan in the laboratory facilities at  Bilkent University for two months per year over the course  of this three-year study.    This project in computer science and engineering fulfills  the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by  enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to  combine complementary talents and conduct research in areas  of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
