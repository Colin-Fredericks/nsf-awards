 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409089  Mehdy  Little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms regulating mRNA  stability in plants although direct and indirect evidence indicates  that it is an important determinant in the expression of many  genes.  The plant defense response is characterized by a rapid loss  of mRNAs encoding the bean proline-rich protein, PvPRP1, an  extensin, Beta-tubulin as well as a number of unknown proteins.   Among these mRNAs, the PvPRP1 mRNA down-regulation is currently the  best characterized mechanistically.  The PvPRP1 mRNA is  destabilized after elicitor treatment and a protein which  specifically binds this transcript has been identified (PRP-BP).   Purification of the RNA binding protein will be a major goal in  order to define its biochemical properties including apparent post-  translational activation by elicitor treatment and interaction with  the PvPRP1 mRNA.  In addition, availability of the purified protein  will allow cloning of its encoding gene and production of PRP-BP-  specific antibodies for immunocytochemical localization of the  protein.    One of the most rapid processes triggered by exposure to pathogens  is the striking release of active oxygen species (AOS) which is  termed the oxidative burst.  The possibility that AOS serve as  signal intermediates which induce phytoalexin biosynthesis has  received considerable attention.  However, the mechanism(s) of AOS  regulation of phytoalexin accumulation and other intracellular  defense-related changes is unknown.  This research will use  biochemical and molecular approaches to clarify the roles of AOS  and changes in cellular glutathione levels in elicitor-induced  signalling pathways leading to regulation of PvPRP1 and phytoalexin  pathway mRNA levels.  The experimental system being studied is the  interaction between the fungal pathogen and the host plant (bean).   At a more general level, the results of these studies will  contribute to our understanding of oxidative stress regulation of  gene expression.   ***",
