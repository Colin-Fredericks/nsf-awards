Conferees include PIs, former participants of  TE projects, and, to broaden the perspective, several  representatives from elementary science.  Issues addressed  by the conference include: how best to effect teacher,  school, and district change; how such change ultimately  affects students; the resources (financial and human)  available to effect systemic change; and assessing the  impact of TE programs.  A Proceedings of the conference will  be published and will include 5 invited papers identifying  major issues, and a set of conference recommendations to  help guide NSF's upcoming massive, national teacher  enhancement efforts.",
