The Commander,  Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is the designated coordinating  agency for all matters dealing with the procurement and maintenance  of the LC-130 aircraft owned by NSF and operated by VXE-6, the Navy  Squadron which provides Antarctic support.  Mr. John C. Papuchis is  the NAVAIR individual responsible for financial matters associated  with support for the NSF LC-130s under provisions of the Memorandum  of Agreement (DPP-76-10886) between the DoD and the NSF.    The aircraft support provided by the DoD includes, but is not  limited to, contracting for the procurement of new aircraft,  overhaul and upgrades to existing aircraft, integrated logistic  aircraft parts support, aircraft configuration control, and  publication support.    Congress authorized the procurement of an LC-130 for the USAP in  1993.  NAVAIR will coordinate the purchase of this aircraft with a  budget of $49,360,000, all of which was provided in an earlier  transfer.  This action calls for the transfer of $1,500,000 from  NAVAIR to the NSF to support the purchase of GFE by the Air Force  Systems Command (ASC) for that new aircraft.",
