The PFF Program was established at the request of the  President of the United States to recognize and support the  scholarly activities of some of the Nation's most outstanding  science and engineering faculty members early in their careers.   Awards are intended to allow Fellows to undertake self-designed,  innovative research and teaching projects, to establish research  and teaching programs, and to pursue other academic related  activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in  psycholinguistics.  Three areas will be pursued:  (1) the  structure in language and how the human language processor  assigns syntactic structure to incoming language; (2) memory  retrieval in language understanding and the role of sentence  level constraints on recognition processes; and (3) development  of computational memory retrieval systems in order to mimic human  lexical/semantic memory.     This research is important to understanding the dynamics of human  memory retrieval, and how humans integrate new knowledge into an  existing mental representation.  In addition, it will result in a  better specification of the higher-level neural processes  involved in language comprehension, and a better understanding of  how people recover from making errors of lexical or syntactic  misassignment during the comprehension process.  Ultimately, this  knowledge can assist in more applied problems such as reading  impairment and language rehabilitation after stroke.  This five  year award will also enable Dr. Burgess to train undergraduate  and graduate students in interdisciplinary research areas  spanning psycholinguistics, cognitive neuropsychology, and  modeling with neural networks.",
