 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316142 Wahl      The Research Grants Program of the Geological Society of America is a major source of funding for graduate student research in the earth sciences.  Begun in 1933, awards to date have been made to more than 5000 geoscientists in the total among of nearly five million dollars.  In 1989 the Geological Society of America received a three-year grant of $300,000 from the Earth Sciences Division of the National Science Foundation.  The grant was awarded to increase the amount of funding available to ensure the support of more high quality research, to increase substantially the average grant amount of each award from the level at that time, and to increase the number of awards made to women and minorities in the earth sciences.  GSA will continue to administer the program as it has for the past sixty-one years.  All NSF funds will go to program awards, with GSA bearing all costs of administration.  Award funding will be matched on a two-to-one basis by GSA up to $100,000 per year of NSF funding.  Annual reports will show the progress made in meeting the objectives of this program.",
