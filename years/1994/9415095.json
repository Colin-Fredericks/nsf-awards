 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center of Reproduction of Endangered Species (CRES) is located in a 900 square meter  facility on the grounds of the San Diego Zoo.  The Center is the multidisciplinary research and  conservation branch of the Zoological Society of San Diego.  The mission of CRES is to broadly  examine, through bench and field endeavors, the requirements for self-sustaining populations of  animals, especially those now critically threatened with extinction.  Eight general disciplines are  represented at CRES:  behavior, comparative physiology, endocrinology, genetics, infectious  diseases, pathology, reproductive physiology, and virology and immunology.  Research is  conducted in the main CRES building that was last renovated in 1964.  Although structurally  sound, the current configuration of laboratory space impedes faculty from conducting modern  research.  The existing cabinetry and work stations that were originally installed are inefficient  with respect to utilization of available space. Because the laboratories were designed for initially  designed for diagnostic purposes, most of the laboratory areas use space poorly.  ARI funds will  be used to renovate support facilities and reconfigurate space for three laboratories:   endocrinology, cytogenetics, and recombinant DNA studies.  Each laboratory will have new  casework, and workstations that will dramatically increase the productivity of research activities .   The renovated facility will accommodate more visiting scholars, and students at all academic  levels, enhancing the quality of the research and research training programs.",
