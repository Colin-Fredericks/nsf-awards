Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other non-federal financing.  The focus of this Phase I project is to develop the technology of a new kind of CDMA which uses only one common code for all users of the network. It would replace or work with the three different types of multiple access protocols which are used in most wireless data networks today - TDMA, CDMA and ALOHA.   The protocol is called Spread ALOHA CDMA, and could simplify the implementation of CDMA while increasing the overall efficiency of the multiple access protocol.",
