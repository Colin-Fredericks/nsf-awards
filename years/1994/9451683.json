The biology  curriculum of PSU is currently undergoing a major restructuring,  one that will result in the creation of new introductory level and  three 200-level biology courses. Laboratory instruction for these  new courses will focus primarily on the scientific method as a \"way  of learning.\" In addition, the new 200-level courses have been  designated as \"writing across the curriculum\" courses, part of a  university-wide requirement that each major area of study  incorporate writing skills into its curriculum. This \"back to  basics\" approach will: 1) emphasize scientific experiment  procedures; 2) enhance computer literacy; 3) introduce technical  writing skills; 4) encourage an exchange of scientific ideas. Our  goal is to lay a solid foundation from which the student will be  able to ask more challenging questions later in their research or  professional careers.",
