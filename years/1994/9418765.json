 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418765  Trivedi    The North Carolina State University Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Advanced Computing and Communication is  becoming a multi-university Center with the addition of a research  site at Duke University.  Four companies are becoming part of the  Center inconjunction with Duke University becoming a research site.    The research agenda of the new multi-site Center will address high-  speed networking, reliable and fault-tolerant systems, digital  communication systems, distributed systems, and algorithms and  digital image processing algorithms.    Additional funding to augment the ongoing research program and to  obtain a membership in the Center is being provided by the U.S.  Department of Army and National Security Agency.    The researchers are well qualified to perform the Center's research  program.    The Center is being co-funded with Dr. Yechelzkel Zalcstein in the  Division of Computer and Computation Research (CCR).    The Program Manager recommends Duke University be awarded:   $100,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award (cost  shared with the I/UCRC Program and the CCR Division); $30,023 for  one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Army; and  $30,074 for one year with funds provided by the National Security  Agency.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period od this continuing award.",
