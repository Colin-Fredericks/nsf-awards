 "awd_abstract_narration": "9456040  Maki  This proposal seeks funding for a planning proposal to implement a restructuring of  undergraduate mathematics education. The planning involves curriculum restructuring, creation  of a general academic infrastructure for undergraduates, and creation of a new institutional  infrastructure. The curriculum restructuring will engage mathematicians and their colleagues  from other disciplines in the development of three types of new interdisciplinary courses, all  aimed at underscoring the way mathematics is used in other academic disciplines and in the non-  academic world: (1.) Courses based on real problems in a different area where mathematics is  used in the solution. Students will work in teams using technology to implement mathematical  tools developed in class for the projects. (2.) Courses designed to give a mathematics major a  basic understanding of a subject which is a current or potential area of application for  mathematics. (3 .) Courses developed in collaboration with the professional schools to introduce  mathematics majors to the possibility of using their education in one of these areas. General  academic infrastructure for students. The second component of the implementation of the general  philosophy involves the manner in which the students relate to their academic programs.  Institutional Infrastructure. The implementation of our general philosophy of undergraduate  mathematics instruction requires a degree of collaboration and coordination across departments  and disciplines that far exceeds what is commonly found on any campus. As the means of  accomplishing this, we propose that the preparation and the design of classes and activities will  take place in an Institute for Undergraduate Education.",
