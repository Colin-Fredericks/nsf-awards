 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's general aim is to bring the tools and techniques of  modern statistics to bear on a variety of problems from genetics  and molecular biology. The specific objectives of this project  are (i) to develop a suitable statistical model and method of  analysis for determining which of a given set of DNA markers come  from the same chromosome, based on data obtained from scoring  hybrid cell lines; (ii) to extend and refine statistical methods  designed to ascertain overlap of cloned DNA fragments; (iii) to  develop accurate statistical methods for recognizing the  resemblance of a new protein to a known structure or structural  motif, on the basis of its amino acid sequence; (iv) to extend  the theory of linear invariants for use in general phylogenetic  inference; (v) to derive statistical models for the evolution of  viral genomes; and (vi) to develop a statistical model for the  evolution of certain repetitive DNA elements in human  populations.    The aim of this project is to develop and use statistical methods  for analysing a variety of forms of molecular genetic data.  Included in the scope will be data collected on individuals, on  single chromosomes, on small cloned DNA fragments, on amino acid  sequences of proteins, and on DNA sequences of genes. Such data  invariably exhibits some form of randomness, arising from its  manner of collection, the location of the DNA in the genome, and  the evolutionary history of the molecules. Statistical methods  are needed to cope with this randomness, and to permit inferences  to be made concerning questions such as the relative or absolute  location of genetic or other markers on the chromosomes, and the  nature of the evolution of the genes or genomes.",
