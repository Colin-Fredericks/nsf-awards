 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, which treats three specific computational methods   in molecular electronic structure theory, is supported by the NSF   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  Topic (1) extends   Pulay's current Unrestricted Natural Orbital Complete Active Space method   (UNO-CAS) to large molecules (e.g. molecules with 24 nonhydrogen atoms)   and provides a more accurate description of excited electronic states.    Topic (2) effectively includes higher-order corrections in low-order   Generalized Moller Plesset perturbation theory by relaxing the reference   function.  Topic (3) employs gauge-invariant atomic orbitals for ab   initio quantum mechanical calculation of NMR properties, and explores the   use of similar techniques in density functional theory.    Laboratory experiments and theoretical predictions, using computer models   based on the quantum mechanical equations of motion of the electrons,   today contribute as equal partners to the understanding of chemical   behavior. The evolution of modern  methods for molecular electronic   structure computation has had a major impact on virtually every field of   chemistry from the study of small molecules in the earth's atmosphere to   large molecules of biochemical importance.   The development of these   mathematical methods and their implementation into large scale computer   programs is the result of hundreds of man years of effort.  This project   continues this tradition of developing practical, widely applicable,   theoretical tools.  The goal of this project is to improve the speed and   accuracy of molecular electronic structure computations, to extend these   to larger molecules, to treat excited electronic states (important for   optical properties and certain classes of chemical reactions), and to   better understand fundamental relationships between molecular structure   and observed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.",
