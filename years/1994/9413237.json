 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413237  Eichele  This award will support a training program for undergraduate and graduate students that focuses on the use of invertebrate model systems to inform investigation of vertebrate development, and vice versa.  The relatively recent and surprising discovery that a series of genes that control development in drosophila have homologues with similar structure, function and organization in vertebrates has set the stage for this type of approach.  The 18 faculty associated with the program have basic research programs that study the development of a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, including drosophila, nematode, slime mold, mouse, chicken and ferret; the group includes a few individuals at nearby institutions whose participation is expected to broaden the impact of the program.  The training will include existing, expanded and new course offerings, as well as lab rotations aimed at helping students become conversant with principles of vertebrate and invertebrate studies.  An annual two-day retreat will help build the program.  Students will be encouraged to undertake research that includes study of two organisms, one vertebrate and the other invertebrate.  This project represents a modern approach to training in one of the most exciting areas of modern biology.  ***",
