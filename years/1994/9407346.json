 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407346  Allen    This is a Research Planning Grant.  The proposed research  to be conducted during the planning period is the cloning,  overexpression and crystallization of the enzyme proline  racemase.  The research following the proposed planning  period is the determination of the structure of proline  racemase by X-ray crystallography in the native state and in  the presence of substrates, substrate analogs and transition  state analogs.  Proline racemase has been shown to induce  strain/destabilization of substrate, one of four mechanisms  by which enzymes bring about rate accelarations. The induced  strain is relieved in the enzyme-transition state complex.  Of the modes of catalysis, the least understood is  strain/destabilization since it is difficult to devise  experiments for its evaluation.  The comparison of the X-ray  crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-  transition state analog complexes of proline racemase will  allow direct observation of the structural and chemical  means by which this enzyme achieves strain/destabilization  of the substrate.  %%%  There are few cases in which enzymes have been proven to  undergo strain/destabilization in the enzyme-substrate  complex.  Proline racemase is the sole example in which  transition state and substrate analogs exist and which is  amenable to study by X-ray crystallography.   The structure  of these complexes will provide the basis by which we can  understand the strain/destabilization mode of catalysis.  ***",
