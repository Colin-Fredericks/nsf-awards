 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent work a new and widely applicable approach to the theory  of large deviations has been developed by Paul Dupuis of Brown  University and this investigator.  In this approach many aspects  of the theory of large deviations are reduced to the theory of  weak convergence of probability measures.  This research treats  new applications of this weak convergence approach to a number of  important problems.  The method also gives rise to several  computational questions that are currently under investigation.   Areas of application include a general class of queuing networks  and several models in statistical mechanics.  The theory of large deviations is an important area of  probabilistic research having applications to a number of areas  including statistics, statistical mechanics, and queuing theory.   In recent work a new and widely applicable approach to the theory  of large deviations has been developed by Paul Dupuis of Brown  University and this investigator.  This approach may give new  insight into large deviation phenomena and allow researchers to  determine computationally the accuracy of the theory.  A main  area of application of will be to queuing systems, which arise in  the modeling of computer networks.",
