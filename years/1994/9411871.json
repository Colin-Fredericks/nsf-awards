 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411871  Lang  This research project will result in a documented analysis of the  history of telecommunication and the Deaf community, with  particular emphasis on the invention of the telephone coupler.   This invention has had significant impact on the quality of living  conditions for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.  Developed nearly  a century after Alexander Graham Bell's invention, this form of  technology expanded employment opportunities and developed  independence for deaf members of society.  One of the objectives of  the study is to describe the historical struggle of deaf and hard  of hearing people to gain access to the telephone, culminating in  the development of the acoustic coupler in the 1960s and the  subsequent collaboration in the 1970s of organizations serving deaf  people and major telephone corporations to bring the technology  into the homes and businesses of deaf people.  The research  involves an exhaustive review of archival records and extensive  correspondence and inquiry among those who pioneered the  development and spread of use of the telephone-teletypewriter units  which preceded the more recent electronic devices.  Information  will also be collected from major telecommunications corporations  that played important roles, especially Western Union and American  Telephone and Telegraph companies.  Results will be published in a  manner of interest to historians of science, the Deaf community,  and general readers who wish to learn about the positive  applications of science and technology to enhancing people's lives.  ***",
