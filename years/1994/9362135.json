 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362135  Duraiswami       Optimization in ship system design is a problem which,  if properly formulated and solved, would have great economic  impact.  However, the problem cannot be easily cast  mathematically as a classical single objective optimization  problem.  In ship system design a considerable number of  criteria must be satisfied of which some can only be  formulated in fuzzy terms.  This is particularly true in  modeling/simulating ship maneuverability, where the  adequateness of a simulator can only be judged by consulting  a ship master/pilot.       To build a successful ship simulator, the equations of  ship motion must be identified.  This systems identification  problem is ill-posed.  In the proposed research we tackle  the problem of developing a framework for optimizing design,  by incorporating in the procedure the mathematical  simulation and identification of ship dynamics in real time.  The ill-posed problem will be formulated using multiple  physical constraints/objectives, and solved via pareto-  optimization.  Efficient computer programs implementing our  theory and algorithms will be developed.       Phase I research will develop an inexpensive prototype  ship maneuvering simulator, based on simple PC  architectures.  In future phases the developed tools will be  used to develop procedures for optimal ship system design,  and in assisting shipboard decision making.",
