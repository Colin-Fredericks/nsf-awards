Title: Effects of Urban Heat Islands and A Refined Surface Database  for China    Utilizing the archived primary datasets the PI will construct  distinct time series of urban and rural surface temperatures for  each climatic region in China, and will adjust the urban  temperatures to remove the heat island biases.  These regional time  series will constitute a refined climatological database, which the  PI will document and make available to the general climate research  community through a national data center.  The PI will also compare  the variations in time series of urban and rural temperatures  averaged for all of China with those in some other time series of  large-scale regional, hemispheric, and global average temperatures.    Quality assurance of the surface data from China is not readily  ascertained by use of conventional methods, such as those that  reply on abundant station history information. Results of this  research will therefore provide an important basis for further  assessment of potential inhomogeneities and urban heat island  effects in surface data from China and other parts of the  developing world.    This research is important because it evolves methods of producing  clean and quality research datasets for global change studies.     This grant is funded under USGCRP GEOSYSTEM DATABASE program.",
