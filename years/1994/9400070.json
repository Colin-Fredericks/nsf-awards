 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400070  McKeever  This award supports Professor Stephen McKeever of Oklahoma  State University to initiate collaborative research with Dr.  Lars Boetter-Jensen of the Nuclear Safety Research Department  of Riso National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark.  The ultimate  objective of their research is to develop techniques for the  application of Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) in  retrospective radiation dosimetry.  Their current research is  investigating the mechanisms of OSL sensitivity variations in  natural materials such as quartz and feldspar.  Recent  developments pioneered at Riso during studies at Chernobyl in  the Ukraine suggest that the silicate minerals found in common  house bricks could potentially be employed as local dosimeters.   Collaboration with Dr. McKeever brings expertise in computer  modeling of materials physics to the unique experimental  facilities of the Danish group.  A better understanding of the  sensitivity variations which occur among samples as a result of  thermal history, or other factors, will enable them to develop  techniques to enhance the sensitivity of these measurements.   Further enhancements seem likely as a result of the  collaboration with Dr. McKeever.    This is an unusual fundamental study in radiation physics which  could have very valuable practical applications in the  measurement of radiation exposures.  The development of a  better local dosimeter is important to both the U.S. and the  world at large since the measurement of radiation exposure  history to local environments is of major concern.  If  successful, the simplicity of methods using natural local  materials would allow rapid radial mapping of the extent and  degree of radioactive contamination.  ***",
