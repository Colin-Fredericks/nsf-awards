 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412906  Pincheira  Precast construction using double-Tee members is common in  parking garages, commercial and industrial buildings across  the United States and has had wide success because of its  proven efficiency an economy.  the double-Tee's are used as  walls and diaphragms. Unfortunately the systems were  developed primarily for vertical load resistance.  New  areas of the country have recently been designated as  seismically active and building codes have tightened their  seismic design requirements.  These changes have cast doubt  on the use and capacity of precast structural systems, and  lack of thorough evidence to the contrary will likely  result in more conservative design required by future  codes.  The goal of this project to establish a proven  physical basis for connection capacities between thin  concrete flange sections such as joint between double-Tee's  used as wall or diaphragm panels to improve design methods  for seismic resistance.    To achieve the objective extensive cyclic connection  testing will be carried out. The connection test results  will be used to develop nonlinear analysis methods and to  suggest code changes such as: rational methods of selecting  flange or diaphragm thickness and topping thickness if  needed, means of estimating appropriate load reduction  factors for precast double-Tee shear walls, steps in  designing ductile  flange connections between members, and examples showing non  linear design procedures for jointed precast prestressed  diaphragms and walls.    This is a PRESSS project.  ***",
