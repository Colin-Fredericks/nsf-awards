 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses upon the creation of an interactive physical  sciences computer lab at Trident's Main Campus, as well as the  incorporation of computers into the physics labs for data  acquisition and analysis.  The use of the interactive physical  sciences computer lab, which supports both chemistry and physics,  has been integrated with assignments in the chemistry and physics  wet labs to reinforce concepts and provide students a more  comprehensive understanding of entry-level and college transfer  physical sciences. This approach encourages further exploration and  practice on the part of the students so they can proceed to more  complicated experiments in a safe environment.  A computer  interfaced with traditional laboratory equipment in the physics  labs enables the student to store, manipulate, and retrieve data  from any particular experiment.  Through the use of innovative and  integrated course delivery between the existing wet labs and the  proposed interactive lab, students become more involved in  sciences, develop a better knowledge base from which to progress to  upper level courses, and they become more confident in pursuing a  science-related career path. The proposed approach of combining  lecture, wet lab, and computer lab in the teaching of physical  sciences provides the student with an integrated learning  environment.",
