 "awd_abstract_narration": "9212452  GILSON    The long term objective of this project is to understand the  mechanisms involved in establishing a bacterial/animal symbiosis.   Vibrio fischeri exists both as a free-living marine bacteria and as  a bioluminescent inhabitant of the light organ of sepiolid squid  and monocentrid fish. The association of V. fischeri and the small  squid, Euprymna scolopes, offers a model mutualistic relationship  and has already proven to be amenable to laboratory and molecular  genetic methodologies.  This project is directed at identifying the  genes and gene products that are expressed as V. fischeri senses  and responds to the conditions within the host.    Genes that are expressed only when the bacteria is in association  with the squid will be identified by fusions with a gene whose  expression is essential for bacterial survival within the host,  but, under selective conditions, is lethal outside the host.  Protein gels (2-D) will be used to identify proteins that are  preferentially synthesized in these two different environments.   And since bioluminescence is preferentially exhibited under  symbiotic conditions and is controlled by a density-dependent,  pheromone-like molecule, other genes that are also part of this  regulon will be identified through mudlac fusion technology.    The relationship between V. fischeri and E. scolopes is apparently  a mutualistic one, however its establishment and maintenance is  evolutionarily related to commensal, parasitic and pathogenic  associations.  Information of the genetic basis for mechanisms of  cell-cell communications, signal transduction and gene activation  will be applicable to all of these systems.  ***",
