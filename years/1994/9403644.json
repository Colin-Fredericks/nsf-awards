 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403644:  Neuhauser Abstract.  The first two parts of the research concern the investigation of several multispecies models from ecology and  population biology.  These models are formulated as complex  spatial systems on the  integer lattice in which each site is in  one of a finite number of states indicating whether a certain  species is present on that site.  These systems evolve over time  according to non-deterministic local rules which describe the  dynamics of each species and how they interact with each other in  this spatial environment.  Models to be considered include host-parasitoid associations and a model for the study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat in which local  extinctions are frequent.  These investigations are theoretical  and experimental  (computer simulations).  The main goal is to  study how the spatial component affects survival/coexistence of  the species involved.  In the third part, problems concerning DNA  sequence comparisons are addressed.    One project is to construct  a statistical test that takes all types of mutations into account  in order to assess the statistical significance of such  comparisons.  The other project is to investigate what happens  when the sequences involved in the comparisons are very  different.  Current tests always assume that the frequencies with  which letters in the  sequences appear, are not too different.   In the first two parts, the investigator will study  several multispecies models from ecology and population biology.  These models are formulated as complex spatial systems that  evolve in time according to non-deterministic local rules.  Examples include host-parasitoid associations and models for the  study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat  in which  local extinctions are frequent.  Some of the proposed  work is done in  collaboration with researchers from the biology  department at the  University of Wisconsin - Madison and the USDA  Forest Service.  The main goal is to st udy ho w the spatial  component affects survival/coexistence. In the third part,  problems arising in DNA sequence comparisons are addressed. Such  comparisons have revealed some unexpected sequence similarities  and there is the need for statistical tests to assess statistical  significance to such comparisons.  Currently, there is no test available that takes all types of mutations into account that  occur in DNA sequences.  Furthermore, all available tests require  the composition of the sequences (i.e., the frequencies with  which the letters in the sequences appear) not to be too  different.  The proposed research addresses both problems.",
