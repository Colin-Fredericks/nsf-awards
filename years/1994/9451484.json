 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will reform the two-semester introductory Laboratory  Astronomy course sequence at Arizona State University by  dramatically upgrading the instrumentation and by employing  improved pedagogical methods. The laboratory course is offered for  general studies credit in conjunction with the Introductory  Astronomy lecture course, and the two course sequences together  fulfill the laboratory science requirements for undergraduate  students (4 credit hours each semester). The enrollment, over 600  students in Laboratory Astronomy each year, is presently capped by  limited instrumentation and TA resources. Arizona State University,  located in the Phoenix metropolitan area with 300 clear nights a  year, is an ideal setting for developing a model laboratory  astronomy course based on charge coupled device (CCD) technology.   The equipment consists of two PC-controlled 10-inch telescopes and  CCD systems plus a grating spectrograph, and ten PC's for  image/spectral processing and analysis. The CCD instrumentation on  student telescopes will greatly increase the scope of projects due  to the increased detection limits over current visual or  photographic techniques. Thus lab projects encompassing all aspects  of astronomy from planets to stars to galaxies and quasars can be  developed in a teaching environment where students learn to do  science the way it is actually done.  The two-semester course  sequence will be taught in student-centered, hands-on,  critical-inquiry environments.  The course instructor will assume  the role of coach, facilitating students' exploration and discovery  of scientific principles and laws themselves. The laboratory  courses will be coordinated with the lecture courses, so that  concepts are introduced in the laboratory before students encounter  the concepts in lecture. the reformed lab course will be piloted  while the CCD-based labs are being developed, and then the reforms  in the general studies astronomy curriculum will be implemented,  thereby institution alizing the course reform.  The project will  produce a laboratory manual containing exercises based entirely on  CCD observations using small telescopes will be produced, and will  create a computer data base which will become a laboratory  astronomy archive containing CCD data (images and spectra) actually  collected by students for the projects that are developed. The  manual and the CCD data archive will be available for distribution  over the Internet, and in hard-copy form, as well as in digital  form on a CD-ROM disk for wide dissemination. The project will  design an evaluation instrument to test the effectiveness of the  course reforms.",
