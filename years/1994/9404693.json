 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404693  Langdon    This award supports the foreign travel expenses  for Professor Terence G. Langdon, Department of  Materials Science and Engineering at the  University of Southern California, to  enable him to make two visits, each of three  months duration, in 1994 and 1995, to conduct  collaborative research with Professor Minoru  Nemoto of the Kyoto University Faculty of  Engineering. The research program is designed  to focus on the role of interface phenomena in  determining the type and extent  of polycrystalline plasticity at elevated  temperatures.    Two areas have been identified for the initial  stages of this research. Work will be conducted  on the importance of grain boundaries in the  deformation of metallic alloys with very small  grain sizes. These materials have superplastic  capabilities, but the precise roles of the  interfaces are not yet understood. The  researchers will also investigate the nature  and significance of the interfaces in metallic  composites between there inforcement and the  matrix using an aluminum-based alloy. This  collaborative effort combines the mechanical  testing expertise of Dr. Langdon and his  colleagues at USC with high resolution  electron microscopy work at Kyoto University  where Dr. Nemoto serves as the Director of the  High Voltage Electron Microscope Laboratory.  The research will expose both teams of  investigators to new and important areas and  therefore will serve to strengthen  the research activity in both locations.    The award is funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
