 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403392  Allgower         Many problems in science display symmetries with respect to  a group of transformations.  The equations describing such  problems are then said to be `equivariant' with respect to this  symmetry group.  The focus of this project is to continue to  study systematic techniques for exploiting symmetry in the  numerical solution of such equivariant equations.  This  exploitation leads to more stable solution methods and to a  greatly increased numerical efficiency.  One of the methods  studied by the investigators (the symmetry reduction method) can  be viewed as a generalization of Fourier Transform methods (which  exploit symmetry under a cyclic group).  Among other projects,  the investigators further develop the symmetry reduction method  and study hidden symmetries, optimal equivariant preconditioners  for problems that are only `nearly'equivariant, domain reduction  via symmetries, the numerical solution of nonlinear equivariant  equations and bifurcation phenomena.  Preliminary numerical codes  are further developed into a collection of codes for a range of  important applications.         Geometric symmetries have always played an important role in  theoretical physics and some branches of applied mathematics.  However, exploiting these symmetries has only lately been  developed in the areas of numerical analysis and computational  mathematics.  The aim of this project is to use geometric and  algebraic techniques to give efficient algorithms for solving  large numerical problems that enjoy such symmetries.  Very large  problems are broken down (via symmetry considerations) into  smaller problems that can be handled independently and more  efficiently on modern architectures of high-performance  computing. Problems that are only `nearly' equivariant (i.e.,  where certain symmetry structures have imperfections) occur quite  frequently in engineering (e.g., in elasticity or flow problems,  or in structural mechanics).  An efficient exploitation of these  imperfect sym metries would reduce the computational effort for  solving such problems.  This has two direct benefits: firstly,  one can solve moderately sized problems much faster, possibly in  real time; secondly, very large problems that are inaccessible  via standard methods can be solved with this symmetry reduction  method.",
