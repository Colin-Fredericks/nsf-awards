The ultimate desired result is an increase in the number of  American Indian students matriculating in college in mathematics,  science, and engineering, and persisting in these majors through to  graduation so that they can enter careers in these fields.    The M3 Summer Camp and subsequent academic year program includes  three interrelated components:  1) St. Norbet College.  The summer  program brings together 42 rising American Indian eighth grade  students from tribes in three geographic regions of the country--  Great Lakes, Southwest, and Southeast.  Fourteen students will come  from each region, in teams of two or three from schools/school  districts in their respective regions.  The students will work  together for fifteen days at St. Norbert College in DePere,  Wisconsin.  2)Regional Summer Follow-up.  Following the fifteen-day  experience, students will participate in a five-day summer program  held concurrently in each of the three regions.  This  component  links the students, their respective schools, designated mentors,  and industry/corporate sites and is designed to significantly  impact the interest and skill level of the participating students  in the fields of mathematics and the sciences.  The five-day  program sites are:  Great Lakes: St. Norbert College, DePere  Wisconsin, Southwest:  Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque,  New Mexico, and Southeast:  Pembroke State University, Pembroke  North Carolina.  3) Academic Year Follow-up.  The third component  is AISES' implementation of academic year follow-up to help ensure  that  the participants' interest and skill level is maintained and  strengthened.  The follow-up will be conducted through network  linkages between the student participants, their respective mentors  and schools, the regional sites, and AISES.      The M3 project will operate for three consecutive years.  ***",
