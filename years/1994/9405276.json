 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zheng  This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   The research studies coordination mechanisms for a manipulator to  work cooperatively with a human operator's arm.  By coordinating a  robot manipulator with the operator's arm, unstructured  environments can be approached through the intelligence of the  human operator, while the load of the object can be shared by the  manipulator and the human operator. A three-step approach is taken  to study the arm-manipulator coordination problem relative to  compliant motion, reflexive motion, and motion learning.  A  compliant motion approach is applied to the interaction of a robot  with a human operator in order to make the robot move in accordance  with motion of the human operator.  Reflexive motion is a new  mechanism to be developed in this research.  The purpose is for the  manipulator to respond appropriately to the intention of the human  operator when the operator applies a cueing force to the  manipulator via the object being cooperatively handled.  The result  is that the manipulator will move actively and the human operator  will not need not to apply continuous cueing forces to the  manipulator.  Another new mechanism being explored is motion  learning.  This allows a manipulator to learn a trajectory that  best coordinates with the human operator during the compliant and  reflexive motion stages.  As a result, when the  same manipulation  task is repeated, the manipulator can use the learned trajectory,  further reducing the load on the human arm.  This research will  lead to a theoretical foundation for the development of human arm-  manipulator coordination technologies which could greatly extend  the range of robotic applications with benefit to manufacturing,  service, and construction industries.",
