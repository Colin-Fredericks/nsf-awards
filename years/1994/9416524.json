 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416524  Rihal    The performance and behavior of non-structural components in  instrumented buildings during the Northridge earthquake of  January 17, 1994 is investigated.  The focus is placed on the  seismic design implictions/lessons learned.  The proposed  research on the influence of the interior as well as exterior  building components on the overall seismic behavior of building  systems is analyzed.  Included is also an investigation of the  contribution of non-structural wall components to the overall  earthquake resistance of building systems as well as their  influence on the inter-story drift behavior.    All available data on damage of interior as well as exterior  building components, including shelving and contents, will be  screened, categorized and analyzed.  Available data on the costs  of repair and retrofit of non-structural building components will  also be studied.  Case-studies of two buildings that suffered  significant non-structural damage in addition to structural  damage will be constructed.  The first one is a instrumentedd  seven story hotel building suffered not only severe structural  damage but also significant non-structural damage.  A second case-  study will be cladding and connections in steel framed buildings,  especially with moment-resisting frames.  The results and final  products of this research will be improved understanding of the  contribution of non-structural component to the overall  earthquake resistance of building systems. The quantitative  results obtained will help develop improved seismic design  criteria for non-structural components including guidelines for  their repair and retrofit.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
