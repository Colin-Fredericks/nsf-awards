 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419532  Prentice  This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative project  with Russian and Swedish glacial geologists to test the existence  of an hypothesized Holocene ice dome centered on the Kara Sea.   This hypothesized dome could account for a maximum of 17 meters of  sea level rise and so the question of its existence has important  implications for models of Holocene climate.  However, its  existence is a highly contentious question.  The goal of the  project is to produce well constrained radiocarbon ages of the  northernmost terrestrial moraine complex along the margin of the  Kara Sea.  The work will specifically focus on the area east of  Dikson, Russia, where the Leneevaya River intersects the northern  Taimyr moraine.  Accurate ages of the moraines are required in  order to determine if an ice dome is likely to have existed in the  Kara Sea region during the last ice age.  If the existence of the  ice dome is supported, then this work would also be key to  formulating further work to fully characterize the dome.  The  results of this project are expected to help resolve an important  and contentious question about the nature and extent of ice sheets  during the last ice age.",
