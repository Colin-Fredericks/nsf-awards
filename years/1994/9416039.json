How this exquisite level of cellular differentiation  is achieved, such that the same physical stimulus from the  environment elicits completely opposite ion transport  processes in the two cell types, is the focus of this  proposal.  Experiments will utilize refinement of microscale  (single cell) techniques of laser-assisted electrophysiology  and molecular biology to analyze cellular function and gene  expression.  In guard cells, light activates a H+ ATPase  which extrudes H+, thereby creating an electrical gradient  for passive uptake of K+ through K+ selective ion channels.  Guard cell and subsidiary cell protoplasts of maize will be  patch-clamped, and their K+ and H+ ATPase currents will be  analyzed and tested for light regulation.  Techniques of  differential display, and of cDNA synthesis within an  individual living cell by reagents introduced via the patch-  clamp pipette in whole cell configuration will be used to  produce probes for genes that are differentially expressed  in the two cell types.  Probes will be used to screen  libraries to obtain full length sequences.  For all  experiments guard cell and subsidiary cell protoplasts will  be released using a recently developed microsurgery  technique, in which a laser is used to burn a hole in the  cell wall, and the protoplast is ten released through the  hole.  The laser microsurgery method obviates the use of  cell-wall digesting enzymes to release protoplasts, which  may induce gene expression and alter cell physiology and  viability.  Methods developed in this research should allow  the patch-clamp and molecular study of single cells that  have been inaccessible by previous approaches.  %%%  Plants take up CO2 from the atmosphere and use the sun's  energy to fix CO2 into carbohydrates.  CO2 enters plant  leaves through tiny pores  in the leaf surface called  stomata.  Water also exits the leaf through stomata.  It is  therefore important that stomatal apertures are tightly  controlled, so that plants neither starve because of  inadequate CO2 uptake, nor wilt because of excessive water  loss.  Stomatal apertures are regulated by pairs of guard  cells which define and border each stomatal pore.  Guard  cell regulation of pore aperture requires uptake and loss of  K+ from the guard cells.  In corn, when K+ is not needed by  the guard cells, it is stored in neighboring cells called  subsidiary cells.  The same environmental signals that cause  guard cells to take up K+ trigger subsidiary cells to lose  this ion, which the guard cells then have access to.  How  this exquisite level of cellular specialization is achieved  is the purpose of t his study.  An electrophysiological  technique called patch-clamping will be used to study how  light regulates the fluxes of K+ and other ions across the  cell membranes of guard cells and subsidiary cells.  Techniques of molecular biology will be applied o study how  these two cell types differ in which genes they express.  Understanding the mechanism of stomatal control is  important, in order to learn which responses to target , in  breeding or molecular genetic manipulations, to increase  plant productivity or decrease plant sensitivity to draught.  Such knowledge may also be important in deciding what the  best conditions are for growing crop plants in space to  support a manned space station.  ***",
