 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the renovation of biology research and research training  laboratories on the campus of La Sierra University.  The Department of Biology is housed in  Palmer Hall, a 41 year old structure that has never been renovated.  Current research facilities are  inadequate to support research and research training activities conducted by faculty and students.   Poor environmental control in rooms often jeopardizes the integrity of experiments, and the lack  of ample electrical service overloads circuits.  Because the building has never been remodeled,  much of the facility does not meet electrical and plumbing codes.  The plumbing system does not  have backflow protection and many of the research laboratories are not equipped for the delivery  of distilled water.  Installation of fixed equipment such as fume hoods and reinforced cabinets,  provide for the capability of storing hazardous chemicals, mandated for a safe working  atmosphere.  Improvements to air quality and climate control will enhance the ability to do  research in a controlled environment and will eliminate much loss of time and experiments due  to contamination.  In addition to providing a better and safer area for faculty to pursue their  research, upgrading of these facilities will increase the number of students, giving them more  access to research training.",
