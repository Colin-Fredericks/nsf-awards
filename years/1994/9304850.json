 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304850  Hendrickx    Unstable wetting fronts are the least understood physical  phenomenon in soils.  They start out as horizontal wetting fronts  that under certain conditions break into \"fingers\" or \"preferential  flow paths\" as the front moves downward, much like rain running off  a sheet of glass breaking into streams.  These fingers facilitate  the transport of contaminants to the groundwater at velocities many  times those calculated if a stable horizontal front is assumed.   The investigators describe theoretical, experimental, and field  evidence that confirm the occurrence of unstable wetting fronts in  field soils. The research objectives are: (1) Verify the  hydrodynamic stability by applying Richard's flow equation for a  wide range of field soils with lysimeter and field experiments; (2)  Apply theory to derive   the relations between soil physical  characteristics, initial water content, infiltration flux, and the  occurrence of unstable wetting fronts; (3) expand the theory and  experiments  to include heterogeneous soils and boundary  conditions. The main experimental difficulty of this study is the  labor intensive nature of the lysimeter and field work.  The  researchers propose to fill large lysimeters (volume 1.2 m3,  diameter 1.0 m) with different soil types to study fingers with  large diameters that have not been studied before.  They will take   about 500 volumetric water content  samples at each sites for a  precise description of the wetting patterns in field soils.  Better  understanding of the mechanism of unstable wetting fronts will lead  to better risk assessments for groundwater contamination, allow  construction of more effective landfills and storage ponds, and  help in the design of more efficient groundwater recharge systems.   ***",
