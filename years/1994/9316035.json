 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316035  Gowing  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short, but  intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in many  Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early in the  season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  The focus of this proposal is the role of  microzooplankton in controlling the production and fate of carbon  during the two types of blooms.  Objectives are: 1) to determine  biomass, abundance, size and selected species composition of  primary producer assemblages, 2) to determine similar features of  nano- and microplanktonic heterotrophic assemblages, 3) to measure  total community grazing on heterotrophic bacteria and  phytoplankton, 4) to examine which grazers are the major herbivores  and bacterivores, and 5) to measure the contribution of  microzooplankton and mesozooplankton egesta, sinking of algal cells  and colonies, and sinking of protozoan assemblages associated with  detritus to the total carbon flux from the euphotic zone through  250 m depth.  Water samples for abundance and biomass  determinations will be taken and samples will be examined with  epifluorescence microscopy.  Grazing rates will be measured using  the dilution grazing technique and the dual-isotope radiolabeling  single cell method.  Carbon fluxes will be determined on sinking  material collected with particle interceptor traps at the base of  the euphotic zone and two deeper depths, using microscopical  analysis .  An understanding of these processes and other  fundamental processes studied by collaborating investigators will  contribute to the understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean  in present, past and predicted future sequestration of carbon, as  well as in other global elemental cycles.",
