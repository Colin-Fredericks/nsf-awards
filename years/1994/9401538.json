 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401538  Boyle       Boyle will work on problems involving automorphisms of  a shift of finite type, good maps betwen Markov processes,  expansive Z^n actions, finite presentations of dynamical systems,  topological orbit equivalence and ordered cohomology, inverse  problems for nonnegative matrices, and general symbolic dynamics.   As specific examples in the last three categories, he hopes with  collaborators and students to --characterize the ordered groups  which arise as the ordered first Cech cohomology group of a  homeomorphism of a zero dimensional dynamical  system --characterize the nonzero spectra of integral  nonnonegative matrices by solving an associated factorization  problem in the ring of formal power series with integral  coefficients --extend the definition of residual entropy to  smooth dynamical systems and determine whether in that case it is  a nontrivial invariant (as it can be in the zero dimensional  case). Among the topics proposed by Rudolph for study in  measurable dynamics are restricted orbit equivalence and  characteristic factors for generalized ergodic theorems.       The notion of restricted orbit equivalence is intended as a  method to investigate the nature of a dynamical system  by considering the perturbations of its orbit structure.   The choice of restriction one places on the kind of  perturbation allowed controls the type of structure observed. --  In investigating the convergence of various kinds of  generalized ergodic theorems, one searches for natural splittings  into parts converging to zero, and parts with  nontrivial convergence, but very limiting, usually algebraic  structure. This latter \"characteristic factor\" of the averaging  method not only controls the convergence, but also gives  insight into the dynamics of the underlying system.         This is pure mathematical research in the general areas of  dynamical systems  and  matrix  theory.  The dynamical  parts   largely involve theoretical  problems  in symbolic dynamics;   this  abstract s ubject is involved  in practical problems of  encoding data in magnetic media, and  it  has  a  finite  aspect  which  has  lent  itself  to applicability. (Abstract   classficiation schemes gave rise to an  algorithm which is  now   part of an IBM product.) The matrix research  is  a continuation  of  a  successful,  novel application of  symbolic  dynamics  techniques and viewpoint  to  some  old, basic and  difficult   problems  in another subject, the   theory   of   nonnegative   matrices.  The   underlying philosophy of measurable dynamics is  to use observations  of the  behavior of a system over time to  gain insight into the structure of the system.  In this one can  loosen the  notion of  \"time\" to include the spatial dimensions  of a crystal or the linear dimension of a DNA molecule.  Such  simple changes of  perspective can lead to deep and fruitful  insights  into how  the  structure of the system is encoded in  its temporal behavior.  A central theme of the work is to use  such simple real-world   models  to  obtain  deeper    understanding   of dynamical systems.  ***",
