Each machine  connected to the network may be suitable for a different class of  parallel computations.  Such an organization will exploit the  current advances in parallel hardware architectures,  interconnection technologies, and programming paradigms to  provide a cost-effective environment for high performance  parallel computing.    Efficient utilization of such an environment depends on a number  of issues to be addressed including techniques to partition  application tasks and map the subtasks onto various machines in  the network.  This research addresses several key issues in using  a heterogeneous computing environment.  The work will focus on  modeling the Heterogeneous Computing paradigm for algorithm  development,  addressing the computational issues involved in  using such a paradigm, design of partitioning and mapping  strategies, and integrating these strategies into existing  programming systems to solve computationally demanding problems  in image understanding.  ***",
