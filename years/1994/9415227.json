 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415227  Thomson    This dissertation enhancement award supports  three research visits in Japan over a three-  year period for Neal Williams, a graduate  student at the State University of New York at  Stonybrook, who works under the direction of  Professor James Thomson, Department of Ecology  and Evolution.  This is a collaborative project  with Professor Izumi Washitani, Institute of  Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba.     Attempts to conserve rare plants often involve  the establishment of small natural reserves  surrounded by inimical habitat.  In principle,  such plants may risk reproductive failure due  to the decline of pollinators.  However, there  have been few if any thorough studies, and  management plans for plants seldom consider  pollinator management.  This project is a  collaboration between a Japanese botanist and  American bee ecologists to investigate such a  situation in a wild native primrose, Primula  seiboldii.  This plant experiences seed-set  failure in an urban reserve north of Tokyo, and  a variety of evidence suggests that this is  because native bumble bees have disappeared  from the area.  The project is expected to  solve a particular problem and also to draw the  attention of conservationists to such problems  and their solubility.  It is hoped that this  project will be come a demonstration project  for native bee recovery.  Exploiting this  special opportunity is important to improving  conservation plans worldwide and for  emphasizing the interdependence of species in  nature.  ***",
