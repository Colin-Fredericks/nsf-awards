 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402136  Lindner    During a four-month research visit to Japan,  Dr. Bernhard L. Lindner, Staff Scientist,  Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.,  Cambridge, Massachusetts, will work with  Japanese scientists at universities in Kyoto  and Kyushu and at the Kwasan Observatory in  Kyoto to investigate a 20-year historical  database on the seasonal regression of the  martial polar caps.  The project will analyze  these observations with an existing theoretical  model.  The principal collaborator will be  Professor Kyosuki Iwasaki, Lecturer, Kyoto  Gakuen University.    The specific objectives are to understand (1)  ice behavior on regional scales such as the  Mountains of Mitchel, (2) interannual  variations observed in polar-cap regression,  (3) the temporary halt observed in the  regression of the north polar cap at latitude  65N from L(S) = 20 degrees-50 degrees, and (4)  the observed variations in the regression of  both polar caps with longitude.  This analysis  should assist in planning future ground-based  observations and should also assist in  intercomparison of these observations with  those of future Mars missions, such as the  planned Planet-B mission, a 1996 launch of the  Japanese Mars Mission.    In addition to Professor Iwasaki, the other  Japanese investigators involved in this project  are Professor Tokuhide Akabane, Lecturer, Hida  Observatory, University of Kyoto; Professor  Yasunori Narumi, Kyushu Tokai University; and  Professor M. Makita, Director of the Kwasan  Observatory.  ***",
