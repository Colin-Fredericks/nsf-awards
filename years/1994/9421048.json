 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hounshell is convening a workshop of  natural scientists, policy makers, historians, social and behavioral scientists to establish the dimensions of the impact of the Cold War on science and technology.  With an understanding of how the Cold War shaped the development and institutions of science and technology, the participants will then turn to formulation of realistic science and technology policies for the post-Cold War era.  This workshop will be held at the Santa Fe Institute near to Las Alamos, the site where the first atomic bomb was developed and one of the premier Cold War institutions.  The workshop will be held from September 19-20, 1994.    The Cold War altered the course of science and technology (S&T) in both the United States and the Soviet Union.  The pursuit of knowledge became an instrument for ensuring national security.  Government policies for funding S&T  shifted dramatically as did the methods of producing new knowledge.  National security establishments burgeoned and brought into being new institutions for the manipulation of knowledge.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, the rationale for the existence of many of the institutions, structures, patterns of thought, habits, culture and mentalities collapsed as well.  As we move to a post-Cold War S&T policy, a full understanding of the development of these patterns is essential in order most effectively to replace them with policies to meet the new situation.   This workshop will provide the background for the construction of these new policies.",
