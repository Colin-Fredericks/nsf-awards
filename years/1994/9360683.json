 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360683  Eraslan      MELTER-ISV Simulator will be developed as the industry-standard computational model for simulating in-situ vitrification (ISV) process that are currently being considered as alternative remedation technologies for hazard-waste sited.  The advanced state-of-the-art computational model will be able to simulate the transient, three-dimensional, chemically reacting, multi-constituent-material, multi-phase  solid, liquid, gas (vapor)  convection-flow and heat-transfer conditions in the melt and in the surrounding ground, during ISV processes.  Therefore, it will be able to predict, accurately, the detailed geometry of the molten ground-material, that can be generated during a site-specific ISV process, and consequently, whether or not, the planned site-specific remedial action program can actually stabilize and immobilize, by encapsulation, the contaminants at the hazardous-waste site.  MELTER-ISV Simulator will establish the urgently needed computational analysis capability  for the emerging ISV technology, which can be used by the regulatory agencies, in industry, in the engineering-design and planning of site-specific ISV systems, that can be implemented, costs effective, as remedial action programs for hazardous waste sites in the USA and around the world.  ***",
