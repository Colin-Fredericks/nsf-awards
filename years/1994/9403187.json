 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403187  McKenzie       The principal investigator recently proved that the problem  of determining whether a finite algebraic system has a finite  equational basis is algorithmically unsolvable, and he is  attempting to extend this result to quasi-equations.  Results  showing that some natural problem is algorithmically unsolvable,  as in Godel's proof  1931 , are very fundamental, because they  reveal inherent limitations both to practical and to theoretical  computation.  The unsolvability of Tarski's finite equational  basis problem is solid but unsurprising evidence that finite  algebras can exhibit complexity of a kind that is not found in  the classical algebras, i.e. in finite groups, rings or  semigroups.       The name \"algorithm\" means a general procedure for solving a  problem or performing a calculation.  Godel's proof was  essentially a demonstration that there can be no algorithm to  determine all true arithmetic properties of the natural numbers.   Ideas implicit in his proof were developed by others into the  modern mathematical theory of algorithms (recursive functions,  Turing machines), which led as well, through the work of Alan  Turing and John von Neumann, to the later development of the  stored program computer.  Algebra is a rich source of algorithms,  many of which easily exceed the capabilities of modern computers.   In fact, some of the deepest results of modern mathematics are  centered on algorithmic problems in algebra, and this continues  to be a lively area of research.  It is not illogical to suggest  that important breakthroughs in practical computation may  eventually derive from this theoretical work, although nobody  today can foresee in detail how this would come about.  ***",
