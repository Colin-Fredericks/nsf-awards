 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322834  Kay       The objective of this research is to develop a system to  control multiple free-ranging automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) by  monitoring the travel areas of the vehicles in a facility.  The  monitoring process is to be achieved through the use of overhead  cameras to cover large areas of heavy traffic and other types of  sensors for areas where the use of cameras is considered to be  uneconomical.  Travel area monitoring can fully exploit the  potential capabilities of these vehicles to provide low-cost,  flexible, and safe long distance materials handling in a dynamic  indoor environment.  Area monitoring will ensure the identification  of short travel time routes for vehicles moving between points.       The research addresses a problem that has significant  implications in material handling and the operation of the  factories of the future.  It is particularly useful in environments  where the aisles are shared by different mobile devices, including  operating personnel.  The use of free-ranging AGVs offers some  flexibility that wire-guided AGVs do not offer.  Their control in  the work area is more challenging, data intensive, and taxing in  terms of computational requirements.",
