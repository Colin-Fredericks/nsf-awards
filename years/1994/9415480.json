 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415480  Rauch    This research will develop a theoretical  model of  bureaucratic institutions. The project is based on the idea  that the creation of salaried professional bureaucrats  changes the way government functions, because it changes the  incentive mechanisms facing bureaucrats. Governments which  have this kind of bureauractic structure tend to take a  longer view of the benefits from public expenditures  decisions. This means that they will tend at the margin to  allocate a greater proportion of government resources to  infrastructure projects that have a more distant payoff. The  theoretical model is developed in which city government is  modelled in a principal-agent framework. The principal is  the elected official and the agents are the civil servants.  Then the  model is extended to bureaucratic institutions in  less developed countries, in which it can be shown that  merit-based promotion policies tend to reduce corruption and  enhance the efficiency of government. The models are tested  using data for U.S. cities in the early part of this century  that experienced a wave of muinicipal reform. Next the  theory is put to a more direct test to ascertain whether  less-developed countries with merit-based promotion systems  will exhibit higher growth rates, all else equal, than those  that do not. Data on growth rates of the less-developed  countries are used.       This project is of significant interest because it  attempts to link bureauratic structure with efficiency in  the provision of governmental goods and services. The  results from the study promise to give us an understanding  of the relationship between bureaucratic performance and  economic growth.",
