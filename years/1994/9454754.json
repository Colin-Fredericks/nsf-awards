Advanced computer technologies represent the best hope of  leveling the educational playing field for these students.  The use of various forms of  telecommunications and of computers at the local level can help bring information, counseling,  and the best educational and training resources into these highly disadvantaged communities.    Statement of Objectives - This project will formulate a plan for using technology to (1) enhance  the ability of seven existing Community Service Centers (CSC) on the campuses of  predominantly minority institutions to address the mathematics and science education needs of  students and families residing in neighboring low-income public housing; and (2) create an  electronic mentoring network that will provide these students with easy access to mentors who  will include MSE professionals from the respective communities and states as well as across the  country.  The Centers, located in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York (2), and  Virginia, are prototypes for a planned network of CSCs on the campuses of at least 25  predominantly minority institutions near low-income public housing.    Methods to be Employed - Under the leadership of existing local steering committees for each  of the seven CSCs, the knowledge of, attitude towards, and interest in the electronic delivery  of educational services, including electronic mentoring, by residents and participating campus  faculty and students will be formally assessed.  Different instruments will be developed to assist  in this assessment as well as to determine the technological resources and capabilities of the  participating colleges, universities, and communities that can be utilized for the short- and long-  term purposes of this project.  This process will prov ide important information on existing  electronic capabilities as well as on the degree of awareness and acceptance by higher education  institutions and residential communities of the potential of technology to deliver quality  mathematics and science education, particularly to communities that do not now, and will not  in the near future, have such access.    A Project Steering Committee that includes representatives from each of the local steering  committees, with the assistance of a telecommunications consultant and the Project Staff, will  develop a plan to achieve the stated objectives above.  Participating communities and other  interested individuals and groups will be kept informed throughout the planning year through a  quarterly newsletter, an electronic bulletin board, conferences, and QEM affiliates.    Significance of the Proposed Activity to the Advancement of Knowledge or Education -   Developing a plan for the proposed telecommunications network is consistent with the national  goal of universal access to the \"information superhighway,\" the mathematics and science goal  of Goals 2000, and NSF's respective goal of supporting work that assists in the solution of  societal problems and of broadening the Nation's education and human resource base.  When  implemented, the network will open a wide new world of communications in mathematics and  science education to communities that have historically been underserved.  These technological  advancements will enable college-bound and non-college-bound students from low-income  families to be successful in a work place transformed by science and technology.  The electronic  media and electronic mentoring network will help to increase the number of minority students  along the educational pipeline who are well-prepared to enter and succeed in MSE fields.",
