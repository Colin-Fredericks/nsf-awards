To do this, the researchers will  measure crack-growth rates in specially prepared bicrystals of  Fe-Si alloys as a function of direction in the grain boundary.   This will be done because the rate of diffusion along a boundary  can vary greatly with direction.  Results are expected to yield  and validate a model useful in calculating the rate of crack  advance.  In the process, the researchers also hope to establish  a general method of inhibiting this type of cracking.  Success  should contribute to our knowledge of problems associated with  stress-relief cracking in welds in alloy-steel components and in  various types of hot-deformation processing.    This project in materials research fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the  United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents  and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest  and competence.    ***",
