Iridium and platinum  clusters of systematically varied sizes on metal-oxide (magnesia or  alumina) supports are made from polynuclear organometallic  precursors on the supports; the carbonyl-cluster precursors are  treated under conditions that yield, as nearly as possible,  decarbonylated metal clusters with the same numbers of metal atoms  and the same metal framework structures as the precursors.  The  structures of the decarbonylated clusters, such as tetrairidium or  hexairidium, are determined using extended X-ray absorption fine  structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, hydrogen chemisorption, electron  microscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), and atomic force  microscopy (AFM).  The samples are tested as catalysts for  hydrogenation of cyclohexene, hydrogenation of benzene,  hydrogenolysis of n-butane, and dehydrocyclization of   n-hexane.  Relationships between catalytic properties and cluster  structures are attempted.    Very small (less than a nanometer) particles (clusters) of metal on  supports offer high reproducibility and very efficient use of  expensive precious metals; they may also provide unique catalytic  properties.  This is a continuation of the seminal and pioneering  effort in this area and offers the promise of improved performance  and higher efficiency in a variety of chemical, petrochemical, and  fuel refining operations.         ***",
