 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400570  Stickney    Fundamental research studies to investigate thin-layer  electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy(ECALE) of compound  semiconductor materials will be conducted. In ECALE the  substrate's electrochemical potential is used to control the  deposition process.  The phenomenon of underpotential deposition,  whereby an atomic layer of an element forms at an electrochemical  potential lower than that needed to deposit the element on  itself, is exploited and used to deposit compound semiconductor  materials atomic layer by layer.  Each deposition cycle consists  of a sequence involving solution introduction, potential changes,  and rinsing.  The current research effort involves detailed  studies to determine and assess the mechanism of the process  through studies of the dependence of deposit composition and  structure on the individual steps in the cycle.  Sophisticated  surface science tools are used to follow surface coverages,  composition and stoichiometry.  Crystallographic structure,  orientation, and quality of electrodeposited films as well as  luminescent properties of the films are also routinely  characterized.  %%%  Electrodeposition methodologies offer new pathways to the  synthesis and processing of compound semiconductors used in  applications such as solar cells, telecommunications, and  computing, and provide several potential advantages over existing  technologies such as lower temperature deposition, and  lower  cost processing because of the known capabilities to scale  electrochemical processes to large areas once the underlying  fundamental parameters have been identified and understood.  ***",
