 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355630  Murphy    The Exploratorium proposes to develop, publish, and distribute  nationally a Family Science Snackbook, a collection of up to 36  hands-on science activities, for use by parents/caregivers with  their children, age 11 and under.  The Family Science Snackbook,  building on the Exploratorium's successful Science Snackbook for  teachers, will serve the needs of parents/caregivers who lack a  background in science but wish to experiment and learn with their  children.  It will link experiments to everyday activities, such as  cooking, cleaning, watching the rain, or driving a car.  The  Exploratorium will develop the book with the direct input of more  than 375 family members and educators from community groups.   Through this broad-based research with families and community  groups, the Exploratorium will be able to experiment with form,  design, and content, and to assure that the final product serves an  ethnically diverse, multigenerational audience.  The research  process will also put focus on girls.",
