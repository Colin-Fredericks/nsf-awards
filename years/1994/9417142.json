This seminar will be addressing the critical issues of  voltage phenomena in large interconnected systems.  These  phenomena are emerging as one of the most important problems  associated with the maintenance of reliable electric service in  the U.S. The objectives of this grant are to allow a significant  number of U.S. academic researchers to actively participate in  this major international event.  The first two seminars on this  topic have produced the leading literature and primary references  for voltage collapse problems.  The first two seminars were  scheduled in the U.S. in September 1988 (Potosi, Missouri) and  August 1991 (Deep Creek Lake, Maryland).  In an effort to promote  more international exchange of ideas, this seminar has been  scheduled in Europe.  It is essential for the U.S. researchers to  continue their active involvement in this critical area of power  system analysis.  ***",
