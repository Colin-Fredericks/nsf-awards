 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406577  Gaber       The PI, Dr. Richard Gaber, proposes to conduct genetic  and molecular analyses of K+ transporters in the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The proposal has four aims.  These are to investigate by molecular and genetic methods:  1)  the potassium transporting glucose transporters.  A  detailed analysis of potassium uptake by one of these  transporters, HXT3, will be carried out.  An extensive  collection of spontaneous suppressor mutations in HXT3 will  be obtained and the nature of each suppressor mutation will  be determined.  Their effects on potassium/glucose  stoichiometry, glucose transport kinetics and substrate  specificity will be determined.  2)  Genetic and molecular  analysis of potassium transporting amino acid transporters  will be carried out.  Some trk1d trk2d suppressors do not  show dependency on glucose.  DNA sequence analysis of one of  these, RPD4-1, revealed that it encodes a new member of a  family of genes  that encode amino acid  transporters.  Further experiments will determine whether  this mutant  transporter mediates potassium uptake, and if so, whether  potassium uptake is dependent  on co-transport of the  permeant amino acid.  3)  Genetic and molecular analysis of  additional trk1d and trk2d suppressors will be carried out.  Genetic analysis of the collection of these suppressors will  be completed and a representative of each genetically  distinct locus will be cloned and sequenced.  The collection  contains at least two more suppressors of interest, RPD7,  represented by 10 independent dominant alleles, and rpd6-1,  which is allelic to VPS16, a gene encoding a vacuolar  sorting protein.  4)  Suppressor mutations will be targeted  to specific transporters.  %%%  Simple mutations in sugar transporters can confer upon these  proteins the ability to transport potassium ions thus  suppress the potassium-uptake-defective phenotype of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deleted for their normal  potassium transporters.  These suppressor mutations alter   single amino acids within putative membrane spanning domains  to confer potassium/sugar co-transport.  A similar  suppressor mutation in a putative amino acid transporter has  also been found.  These novel transporters offer a unique  opportunity to study the molecular basis of solute  transport.  ***",
