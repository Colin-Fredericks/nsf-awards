 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412724  Magee    This project involves a collaboration between French scientists  from the (French Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  (I/UCRC)) Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA-Lyon)   and the University Claude Bernard, and American engineers from  I/UCRC for Hazardous Substance Management Research at New Jersey  Institute of Technology and Rutgers University.   The objective of  this research is to establish a scientific methodology that brings  together in a more comprehensive way the microbial, physico-  chemical, and engineering considerations needed to understand,  plan, and diagnose in-situ bioremediation projects.  This project  involves (1) selection of various soil matrices from both the U.S.  and Europe; (2) addition od substituted aromatic compounds as model  pollutants to the soils; (3) adsorption/desorption measurements;  (4) description of the microbial ecology; (5) investigation of the  impact of chemotaxis; (6) determination of the biokinetic rates and  parameters in batch flask and soil columns under aerobic and  denitrifying conditions; and (7) selection of suitable sites in  both the U.S. and France for field tests of the laboratory  conclusions and methodologies.  The researchers of both I/UCRCs are  well qualified to perform this joint research project.  An  evaluator is funded to study the international industry/university  interaction occurring during this project.    The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute of  Technology be awarded $264,000 for 36 months ($240,000 for the  project and $24,000  for the evaluation study).",
