 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317244  Long    Saline ground-water seeps have been recently found entering Lake  Ontario.  Although stable isotope and geochemical analyses indicate  that the saline ground water is from regional saline formation  water, the source for the formation water is not well constrained.   Geochemical and isotopic evidence indicates that high Cl values in  the water of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron may be in part caused by the  direct discharge to the bay of saline ground water from saline  formation water from the Michigan basin.  Since the source and  hydrogeology of the Saginaw Bay area is better constrained than in  Lake Ontario, Saginaw Bay is an excellent site to study the  interaction of saline-formation water, near-surface ground water,  and large lakes.  The objectives of this research are to 1)  document the occurrence and source of saline water in the sediments  of Saginaw Bay by geochemical and isotopic determinations;  (2)  relate the occurrence of the saline water in the bay sediments to  the surrounding ground-water chemistry by comparing spatial iso-  chemical trends in the pore waters of the bay with that of the  ground water; and (3)  determine the effect of the saline water on  pore-water chemistry by chemical modeling.  This will be  accomplished by examining geochemical and isotopic characteristics  of pore water in sediments of Saginaw Bay and in water of the  streams in the major watershed entering the bay.  The data will be  studied in the context of the hydrogeochemistry of the regional as  well as local ground-water systems.  Results from this study will  be important in understanding the importance of direct ground-water  discharge to large lakes and the interaction of large lakes and  regional ground-water flow particularly that part of the flow that  involves deep saline formation water.  ***",
