Fluorescence microscopy is the principle  technique used to carry out these studies.  Membrane proteins of  special interest are the class II molecules of the major  histocompatibility complex (MHC).  These proteins are  incorporated in lipid monolayers.  The interaction between MHC-  peptide complexes and peptide specific, MHC restricted T-cell  hybridomas is studied by fluorescence microscopic observations of  suitably labeled protein/peptide/lipid, taking advantage of  recently developed knowledge concerning physical properties of  lipid monolayers.  Apposition of T-cells to the monolayers is  carefully controlled using cell suspension methods.  Detection of  the binding of specific MHC-peptide complexes in monolayers to a  population of T-cells is a potential novel technique leading to  the identification of reactive T-cells clones, and to the  eventual sequencing of T-cell receptor genes.  %%%  The surface of the earth is approximately 75% air-water  interface.  In spite of the potential ecological and  environmental significance of this interface, remarkably little  is known about physical and chemical events that are interfacial.   This is simply because so few molecules are present at this  interface at any one time.  Research in the laboratory of Harden  McConnell at Stanford has brought about a breakthrough in  technique for observing chemical, physical and biological events  at this interface.  This technique has involved the application  of fluorescent molecular probes that bind only to the  interface--they are not soluble in water, nor do they vaporize  into the air.  These probes permit the observation of events at  the interface using a simple fluorescence optical microscope.   Many phenomena (phase transitions, chemical reactions, and  bacterial motion) can be observed at the air-water interface by  their eff ects on the spatial distribution of these fluorescent  molecules.  Literally dozens of new observations have been  reported in the scientific  literature using these techniques.  A  study currently being initiated in this laboratory concerns the  effects of electrical fields on biological cells.  ***",
