This two and one-half day conference builds on the  Initiatives for Children efforts to develop ties among researchers,  practitioners and policy makers working for systemic reforms in  education.  Although not exclusively tied to mathematics and  science, the conference has the purpose of improving the quality of  teaching and instruction in secondary schools.  The expectation is  that the stature and expertise of the assembled group will result  in recommendations of national import and that the stature of the  Academy will insure wide interest in the dissemination of the  findings.      Fifteen to twenty participants drawn form all regions and related  interests are expected to attend.  A document representing the  consensus of the participants will be available to all groups  concerned with secondary education ranging from policy-setting  agencies to individual classroom teachers.     Although some expenses are absorbed by the center, there is no  specific commitment to cost sharing.  ***",
