 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400930  Damon       Professor Damon has been developing analogues of  infinitesimal methods introduced by Mather for answering  questions about the structure of nonlinear mappings and the  topological structure of special but important classes of highly  nonisolated singularities, such as occur in discriminants of  mappings.  In quite different circumstances, he has also  discovered how to modify these infinitesimal methods for  understanding the generic behavior of \"pixel intensity functions\"  under Gaussian blurring used in computer vision.  He intends to  build on his earlier results and derive general algebraic  formulae for certain fundamental topological invariants for  highly singular spaces.  Second, he will further develop methods  for determining the generic properties of solutions to partial  differential equations and, in particular, apply them to recent  nonlinear versions of Gaussian blurring.  Third, he will apply  the results on the topology of singular spaces to understand how  the qualitative behavior of the solutions can be deduced from the  singularities which occur.       This research project will investigate certain qualitative  properties of the set of solutions of systems of nonlinear  equations.  Such properties will be applied to generally  appearing solutions of partial differential equations.  Professor  Damon has been developing methods for determining such  qualitative properties.  Moreover, he has begun applying them to  understand the effects of Gaussian blurring applied to \"pixel  intensity functions\" for analyzing images in computer vision.  He  intends to develop these methods further so that they apply to  general partial differential equations.  This will include the  investigation of relations between certain invariants of the  solutions and their qualitative properties.  One  particularapplication will be to the increasingly sophisticated  nonlinear blurring schemes which are being developed for  identifying essential features and properties of images suc h as  edges, ridges, etc.  ***",
