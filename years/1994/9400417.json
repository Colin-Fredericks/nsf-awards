The MRSEC contains two strongly  focused interdisciplinary research groups.    The  group  investigating chemically tailored materials  for  automobile  control  and diagnostics integrates  efforts  in  chemistry,  physics  and engineering to  develop  chemically  tailored  materials  that  can provide  engineers  with  new  devices  and  techniques  for the  development  of  improved  automobiles.    The   research  targets   specific   sensing  applications related to engine performance, which is largely  determined  by the fuel composition entering the engine  and  its  turbulent  mixing in the cylinder.  A  newly  developed  technique, LIPA (laser induced photochemical anemometry)  is  used to provide real-time maps of cylinder gas flows in test  chambers   or   actual  engines.   The  group  investigating  materials   used   for  physical  sensing   in   automobiles  concentrates  their studies on materials  that  are  rugged,  perform well in extremely variable and harsh conditions, and  can be manufactured reliably and efficiently.    The  MRSEC supports a variety of shared facilities including  a  lithographic facility, space and services in a  chemistry  laser laboratory, space in the engine research and turbulent  mixing    laboratories,   and   the   engineering   research  laboratories  for  film growth and fabrication.    There  is  active   industrial  collaboration  with  Ford  and  General  Motors.    Educational  plans for  the  MRSEC  involve  K-12  students in urban and rural schools, science and engineering  undergraduates  on  campus,  and interdisciplinary  research  participation  by  advanced degree  candidates.  The  center  currently  supports 13 senior investigators, 2  postdocto ral  research  associates, 2 technical staff members, 12 graduate  students,   and 4 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed  by  Professor Brage Golding.  ***",
