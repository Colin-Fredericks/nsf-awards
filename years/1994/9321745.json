Pregnancy and lactation  place especially high energy and nutrient demands on the female,  which may increase her susceptibility to starvation or disease.   Thus, energy devoted to pregnancy and lactation must be  counterbalanced against the female's future reproductive potential.   Compromise must also be reached in balancing length of gestation  against duration of lactation.  Gestation is relatively inexpensive  compared to lactation, as nutrients can be  transferred directly to  the developing young and thermoregulatory costs are minimal.   However, transport of the growing fetus can impede normal daily  activities and increase risk of predation.  Patterns of energy  expenditure during pregnancy and lactation should thus reflect the  costs of maintaining and transporting a fetus versus feeding and  caring for developing young.%%%       The goal of the proposed research is to conduct a series of  field and laboratory experiments to measure the cost associated  with pregnancy in an omnivorous tropical  bat, Phyllostomus  hastatus.  Daily energy expenditure and allocation will be  quantified by measuring field metabolic rate (using doubly-labeled  water) and body composition (through isotope dilution) of females  at progressive stages of pregnancy.  Nocturnal time-budgets of  foraging females will be constructed using radio-telemetry to test  the hypothesis that foraging time is a trade-off between supplying  the growing needs of the fetus and minimizing the cost of  transporting a developing embryo.  Diet composition and nutritional  content will be analyzed to determine how diet composition  correlates with the cost imposed by pregnancy.  Completion of these  projects will be integrated with comparable data in the same  species to provide important insights into the costs and  compromises associated with reproduc tion in an omnivorous volant  mammal.***",
