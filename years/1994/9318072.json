 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318072  Allen       In eukaryotes, tyrosine protein kinases occupy key  positions in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell  growth, development, and malignant transformation.  Although  protein phosphorylation is important in prokaryotes,  phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is rare.  It was shown  that Pseudomonas solanacearum, an economically important  plant pathogen, has tyrosine protein kinase activity that  phosphorylates a 90 kD membrane protein.  This protein  substrate has been partially purified and kinetic  experiments suggest that it is itself a tyrosine kinase.  Molecular genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to  investigate the role of this phosphoprotein in plant  pathogenesis.  P. solanacearum has an array of virulence  factors that contribute to bacterial wilt disease, this  include polygalacturonase production and motility.  Recent  evidence suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved  in the regulation of these traits.  Strains that overproduce  a positive regulator of polygalacturonase production have no  detectable phosphorylation of the 90 kD protein.  Preliminary results also indicate that flagellin, the  flagellar filament protein, is phosphorylated on tyrosine.  Thus, the kinase activity may also affect bacterial  motility.  The objectives of this research are to determine  the functions of the kinase activity and its protein  substrates, and to characterize these proteins.  A  combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches  will be used.  Oligonucleotide probes derived from  an amino  acid sequence of the purified  tyrosine phosphoprotein will  be used to clone the cognate tpp gene from a P. solanacearum  gene library.  The DNA sequence of tpp will be compared to  eukaryotic tyrosine kinase genes.  The hypothesis that tpp  is part of the regulatory pathway for plant-inducible genes  will be tested by phenotypic analysis of tpp and  polygalacturonase regulatory mutants.  Site specific  mutagenesis and biochemical methods will be  used to identify  and characterize functional domains with the 90 kD  phosphoprotein.  %%%  Pseudomonas solanacearum causes wilt disease on a wide range  of important crop plants, including potatoes, tomatoes,  bananas, pepper and eggplant.  These diseases cause severe  economic losses in the Southeastern US and many developing  countries.  Effective control of this pathogen requires that  we understand the mechanism by which it causes disease.  The  proposal addresses research on the activity of a specific  enzyme, a protein kinase, that regulates the growth of this  organism, and that also plays a major role in cancer  development.  ***",
