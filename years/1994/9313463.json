The  project will renovate the basic electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection  systems of the two research floors of  Gilmer Hall.  It will also help renovate the  research labs of five faculty members and provide for construction of common  support facilities on each floor, including cold rooms, equipment rooms and media  kitchens.  Research in the targeted spaces will be multidisciplinary, addressing  fundamental questions in the areas of molecular and cellular biology, developmental  biology, and population and evolutionary biology.  All of the laboratories will be  training centers for postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students.   The improvements will result in increased efficiency in space utilization, will provide  for laboratory facilities appropriate for current research activities and will bring the  affected areas of the building into compliance with current fire safety and handicapped  access codes, thereby establishing a safer, healthier, more productive work  environment for all occupants.",
