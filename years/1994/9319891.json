 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319891  SLAUGHTER    As the economy shifts from a heavy emphasis on defense science and  technology (S&T) to a focus on civilian S&T and the application of  innovation to commercial markets, decision makers within  universities, businesses and government agencies are eager to learn  how to shape successful partnerships to develop technology that is  beneficial to all participants and contributes to social and  economic progress.  Since 1980, the numbers of business-university  partnerships have increased dramatically.  Several authors have  identified the problems and barriers that must be overcome and many  have described the primary characteristics of university-industry  relationships.  However, few studies have investigated empirically  the factors that influence organizations to become involved with  each other and, as a possible result, increasingly share similar  perspectives and interests.  Given that the trend is toward greater  numbers of partnerships, it would be useful to understand and  identify empirically any compelling factors and normative behaviors  that might exist between institutions and corporations,  particularly those related to possible conflicts.  This project  investigates whether scientists and administrators involved in  university-industry cooperation in corporations and universities  share similar perspective and mutual interests, and, if so, to  determine the implications for the two sets of institutions and for  federal policy toward these institutions.  The study seeks to  understand the factors influencing university-industry  relationships in order to provide decision makers with insight into  issues and recommendations that might address this phenomenon.    The research project consists of a survey instrument that will  establish an empirical understanding of university and industry  perceptions related to benefits, conflicts, and mutual interests.   It will include universities and colleges from all the major  Carnegie classifications as well as both small,  medium, and large  companies, delineated by Business Week (1993) and Inc. (Mangelsdorf  1992).  Within these organizations, individuals from a variety of  university administrative, academic, industry management, and  scientific levels will be asked to participate.  Also, persons  involved in cooperative activities as well as those who are not  will be included.  The study focuses on potential conflicts and  provides insight into possible implications of potential  organizational transformations that may be occurring and  experiences and  mechanisms used to pursue mutually beneficiary  cooperation while ameliorating potential conflicts.",
