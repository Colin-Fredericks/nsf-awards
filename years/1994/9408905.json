 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408905  Leibler  The cytoskeleton is a polymer structure made out of protein  fibers essential for intracellular transport, cell locomotion and  division.  This structure is dynamical and highly regulated  through the cell cycle.  Assembly and disassembly of the fibers  and the action of associated motor proteins are out-of-  equilibrium processes.  The necessary free energy is provided by  the hydrolysis of nucleotides (ATP, GTP) bound to the proteins.  A Study will be initiated from a physics point of view - of the  following aspects of this organization:  o    the dynamics of rigid and semiflexible protein fibers.  The  large persistence length of f-actin and microtubules allows  direct visualization and study of their individual and collective  behavior.  o    the non-equilibrium nature of the fiber assembly.  It leads,  for example, to a unique dynamic behavior of microtubules, called  dynamic instability, in which the length fluctuations are of the  order of the mean length.  o    the regulation of the fiber assembly.  The dynamic  instability, when regulated, is the basis of \"trial and error\",  self-correcting architecture.  Despite progress in the  biochemistry if the assembly regulation, the spatio-temporal  aspects (characteristic time and length scales) are poorly  understood.  o    the transduction of chemical to mechanical energy.  Both  cytoskeleton fibers and associated motor proteins can be viewed  as Brownian machines which are chemical-mechanical transducers.  The understanding of these noisy machines must involve the  methods of biochemistry and statistical mechanics.  The approach is both experimental and theoretical.  It involves  physics and molecular biology departments, and the expertise of  two industrial laboratories.  Given the complexity of the  problems involved, this multi-disciplinary approach seems  necessary.  ***",
