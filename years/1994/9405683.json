 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405683  Gray  The main goal of this project is to elucidate the tyrosyl  contributions to the CD spectrum of the fd g5p, a model single-  strand DNA-binding protein of 87 residues whose crystal structure  has recently been redetermined.  The protein is a  -sheet protein,  and the five tyrosines of the protein dominate its CD spectrum.   The tyrosyl 229 nm CD band changes when the protein binds to  polynucleotides.  Two of the tyrosines are known to have important  functions, one being involved in DNA-binding and at least one other  being involved in cooperative dimer-dimer contacts that are formed  as the protein binds to DNA.  Since all five tyrosines tend to be  conserved among the ssDNA-binding proteins, they all may be  functionally important, although the functions are not all known.   Our objective will be to study mutant proteins in which the  tyrosines have been conservatively replaced.  Differences between  the spectra of the mutant proteins, and changes in the protein  spectra upon forming complexes with DNA, will be used to determine  the location of each tyrosine CD contribution.  The results of the  study should provide a benchmark for calculating and understanding  the contributions of tyrosines to the CD spectra of other proteins.  A second goal is to study the ssDNA-binding protein from Pf3 phage,  which belongs to a different structural class of filamentous  viruses.  The Pf3 is a smaller protein of 78 residues, of which  only three are tyrosines.  A study of this protein should add to a  more general understanding of the spectral and binding properties  of the filamentous phage ssDNA-binding proteins.  Finally, the  complexes formed by the fd and Pf3 proteins with ssDNA will be  investigated in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering  techniques.  %%%  Some bacterial viruses, called filamentous viruses, mature by first  forming a long, thin helical structure.  This intermediate helical  structure contains the newly-made viral DNA genome encased in a  protein shell made of a s ingle type of protein.  This special virus  protein (DNA-binding protein) from one virus (fd virus) has been  very well-studied by many techniques, and it is considered to be a   model protein in its class.  Many mutant variants of this protein  are available from collaborator Dr. T. Terwilliger at Los Alamos  National Laboratory.  The mutant proteins and the structures they  form with DNA exhibit interesting interactions with ultraviolet  light beams they are polarized in a certain way (circularly  polarized).  The interactions of many mutant proteins with this  type of polarized light can now be studied, which will allow an  exceptionally complete interpretation of which protein components  have the optical phenomenon.  A similar study will be undertaken on  the analogous protein from a different virus (Pf3 virus).  Finally,  the helical structures of the protein-encased DNA genomes will be  defined by the manner in which they scatter X-rays.  The latter  work will be done with another collaborator at Los Alamos National          Laboratory, Dr. J. Trewhella.  In total, the study of these  proteins and mutant proteins should help explain the properties of  other DNA-binding proteins and how they act during the replication  of the filamentous viruses.  ***",
