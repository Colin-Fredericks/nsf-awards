 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405539  Oruc       A formidable problem in constructing high speed networks is  the control and routing of a heterogeneous mix and multirate of  signals.  in general, the speed of a network is determined by (a)  the clock rate at which its nodes operate, (b) the bandwidth of the  links between its nodes, (c) the amount of congestion at its nodes,  (d) the depth of the network, and (e) the time to compute the  routes between its nodes.  the first two of these factors are  technology dependent where clock rates are reaching a point of  saturation.  Assuming that, in a network of 10^9 nodes, each node  can process 10^8 cycles/sec), even without any congestion, it would  take several seconds to send a packet between two nodes that are  separated by a distance proportional to the number of nodes in the  network.  Likewise, it would take seconds to send a packet between  two nodes on a network whose routing time is linear in the number  of its nodes.  Obviously, any congestion at the nodes in both cases  will aggravate the travel time of packets so that both the diameter  (depth) and routing time of any high performance network with a  very large number of nodes ought to increase at less than a linear  rate with its number of nodes.  In constructing low cost,  congestion free (nonblocking) networks with logarithmic orders of  depths and routing times.  While some low-cost nonblocking networks  with logarithmic or polylogarithmic depths such as Clos, Cantor and  Bassalygo-Pinsker have been reported, these networks cannot be used  for broadband networking unless they exhibit efficient and fast  routing schemes.  Moreover, in the case of latter two networks, it  is also open whether they can realize multicast and conference  assignments.  this project will attempt to resolve these problems  by using recursive network construction techniques, and parallel  and distributed computation methods.  ***",
