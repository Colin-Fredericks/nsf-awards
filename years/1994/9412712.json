Probabilistic production cost and reliability  evaluation are two interrelated areas of probabilistic modeling  of power systems.  Some recent advancements in multi-area  reliability analysis methods will contribute to the proposed  solution of problems in production costing, and similarly the  solution of some problems in production cost calculation in the  proposed research will lead to enhancement of the capability of  multi-area reliability analysis techniques.  The end product is  expected to be an integrated approach for production cost,  marginal cost, and reliability indices.       Several problems have been identifies whose solution will  provide significant advancement of the probabilistic production  cost modeling of interconnected power systems and to lead to  viable solutions.  These problems are:          Find a decomposition-simulation procedure which,       considering all loads states, can find indices after       each unit addition by single decomposition.         Find efficient techniques for determining production       cost and geographically differentiated marginal cost.         Develop methods for more accurate modeling of       correlated area loads in an interconnected power       system.         Develop a methodology for incorporating load dependent       transmission model in the decomposition process.         Develop a methodology for incorporating time dependent       interchanges in the decomposition process.         Investigate DC Flow vs Network Flow model.         Find solutions to problems associated with area-wide       dispatch.         Develop the concept of equivalent assistance for a       looped network.         Investigate the use of continuous distributions.         Find an algorithm for parallelization of the decomposition-       simulation p rocess    ***",
