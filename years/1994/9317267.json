 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317267  Felten  Prior NSF support and an extraordinary arrangement between the  Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, native Canadian  hunters, the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center  R,D,T, and E Division (NRaD) have permitted these investigators to  obtain fresh tissue specimens from beluga whales, Delphinapterus  leucas, taken during sanctioned hunts.  These tissues were  collected at a relatively short postmortem interval with excellent  preservation of antigens for immunocytochemical localization of  neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in these organs.  These tissues  have been used for the first detailed study of the general  morphology of Beluga lymphoid organs, providing the foundation for  investigating neural-immune interactions in these mammals.  The  next goals of this research are to continue to obtain fresh tissue  specimens of the immune and nervous systems from beluga whales and  to use cells dissociated from fresh thymus, spleen and lymph nodes  to carry out in vitro immunological assays to test the hypothesis  that norepinephrine and neuropeptides found in these nerves in  beluga lymphoid organs can influence functional characteristics and  responses of cells of the immune system.  Monoclonal antibodies  against cetacean lymphocyte antigens will be generated to identify  cellular compartments in lymphoid organs according to specific  subsets of cells, and compare overall organization with that of  other mammals.  The monoclonal antibodies will be used with flow  cytometry to monitor percentages of lymphocyte subsets and to  separate populations of cells for functional assays.  A number of  in vitro functional assays will be developed and used to study the  effects of noradrenergic agonists, antagonists, or neuropeptides on  lymphocytes and leukocytes from beluga peripheral blood, thymus,  lymph nodes, and spleen.    %%%  The long term goal of this research is to understand the structure  and function of the immune system in a marine mammal, the beluga   whale, and to determine how the nervous system and immune system  may interact in regulating the normal health and well being of  these unique animals.  Prior NSF support and special arrangements  with the Canadian government, native Canadian hunters, and the US  Navy have enabled these investigators to obtain tissue samples from  whales killed by native Canadian hunters in sanctioned hunts.   Using these samples, the structure of the major lymphoid organs was  described and it was demonstrated that the sympathetic nervous  system has  nerve branches which contact major lymphocyte-  containing areas of these organs.  This suggests that the nervous  system may be involved in regulating immune function in these  animals as has been suggested for other mammals.  The next goals of  this research are to define more precisely the cell types involved  in the whale immune response, and to develop the technical tools  needed to study how neurotransmitters may affect their function.   The results of these studies will provide the groundwork of basic  knowledge that should make it possible, in the longer term, to  develop rational approaches to promote optimum health of marine  mammals in captivity and for conservation of these unique species.  ***",
