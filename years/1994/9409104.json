Linear time has not received nearly as much  attention as the concept of polynomial time, and has been  considered to lack a good machine model.  Previous work has  developed the \"Block Move\" (BM) model, which is a significant  extension of the \"Block Transfer\" (BT) model of Aggarwal,  Chandra, and Snir, and showed the BM to have good properties of  robustness and universal simulation for linear time, and to  characterize some of the low-level circuit classes.  The present  work will use new tools given by the BM for nonlinear lower  bounds on time and for deeper analysis of low-level complexity  classes.  The BM treats \"random\" access to data as having  tangible cost, as observed with real machines, and quantifies  memory latency and tangible cost, as observed with real machines,  and quantifies memory latency and communication delays between  processors and data.  The question of how much random access is  needed to solve a problem is related to older classic problems of  determinism versus nondeterminism.  A new approach to lower  bounds is to be pursued further, this work will analyze  computational problems in terms of information structures apart  from particular machine models.  ***",
