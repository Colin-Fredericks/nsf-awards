 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9317853  Tschinkel    Important basic insights into the evolution of social  behavior have resulted from studies of the social  organization of insects such as bees and ants in which  colony members are closely related.  A fundamental question  in these cases concerns the relationship between the  behavior of individuals and the success of the social unit,  the hive or colony.  This research will address an important  component of colony organization, the dynamics of the  feeding of the young (larvae) in highly social fire ants.  The nutrition received by developing larvae probably affects  the social role and size of individuals, the labor they can  perform within the colony and the success of the colony as a  reproductive unit.    Dr. Tschinkel will study the quantitative patterns and  \"rules\" that determine how ants feed larvae.  The research  will provide detailed description of feeding behavior with  both liquid and solid foods, information on the sensitivity  of adults to the hunger levels of the larvae and data on the  effects of different feeding regimens on the role and sexual  development of the larvae when grown.  The research will  provide the first full description of the rules of food  distribution by individuals, will link individual behavior  to characteristics of the colony as a whole, and will  provide a possible mechanism for the developmental changes  that occur as the colony grows.  These results will make  fundamental contributions to our understanding of the  dynamics of social insect colonies and, therefore, to our  understanding of the evolution of sociality.  In addition,  the fire ant is an introduced species that causes  significant economic damage, and this research has the  potential to further efforts to control it.",
