 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360764  Zachary       Computerization of work, particularly information-based work  which has been traditionally performed by manual methods, has  created many problems for new computer users.  As computer systems  grow more complex, their human users have increasingly difficulty  in successfully or efficiently applying the underlying system  functionality.  Research has begun to focus on using the human-  computer interface to solve such problems by creating components of  the user interface, called `agents' or `interface agents', that  cooperatively support the human in a variety of ways.  To date,  however, these interface agents have been the custom-built products  of individual research or system-development efforts.  For the  concept and benefit of interface agents to reach its broader  potential, more powerful tools are needed for their development and  maintenance.  This research proposes to assess the feasibility of  creating such a Generator of INterface Agents (GINA).  The proposed  tool is developed around an interface agent-building methodology  called COGNET, that was created, successfully applied and  behaviorally validated by the Principal Investigator in prior  research.  The proposed research develops and analyzes a detailed  GINA architecture, then implements and tests a skeletal version of  the underlying agent-execution engine.",
