The middle school teachers will be  trained in two four week workshops in both content, pedagogy and  leadership.  The training will include much immersion in hands on  science.  The elementary teachers will have only one four week  workshop but they already have had considerable in service work.   An average of 4 elementary teachers for each of the 18 elementary  schools will be trained.  Principals and other personnel from each  of the 32 elementary and middle schools totaling 58, will also be  involved in the training in order to maximize the likelihood of  systemic change.  The project will begin in 1994 and run through  1997 academic year.  The cost share is approximately 12% of the  amount funded by the Foundation.  ***",
