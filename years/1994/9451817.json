The plan  requires modification of existing courses and introduction of new  courses and laboratories. The objective is to prepare our  engineering graduates to design dynamic physical systems which  include intelligent sensors and actuators and embedded control  systems. The changes needed to reach this objective are:  1. Strengthen the electrical engineering science component of our  curriculum to provide more instruction in applied electronics and  computer circuits.  2. Strengthen the dynamic systems modeling and analysis component  of our curriculum to provide analytical and experimental methods in  modeling, analysis and simulation of dynamic physical systems.  3. Strengthen the automatic control system design technical  elective component of our curriculum to provide both analog and  digital control system design, analysis and implementation.  This project is creating a new integrated dynamics and control  laboratory which will serve the two new courses and one of the  modified courses.  The laboratory incorporates seven different  types of experiments (torsional mass, mass/spring/damper system,  inverted pendulum, 3-D robot, heat transfer, electronic cooling,  and mixing).  The detailed design and manufacture of the  experimental apparatus is being performed by teams of honors  research students.",
