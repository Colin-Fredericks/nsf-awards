Such complexes are called  shellable.  Shellability has proved to be an important tool in  the combinatorics of convex polytopes.  The focus will be on a  combinatorial invariant called the toric h-vector, which in  certain cases is simply a fixed linear transformation of the  vector of face-numbers of the given complex.  Until recently the  only known interpretation of the toric h-vector of an arbitrary  rational polytope came from toric variety theory, but recently  McMullen discovered a combinatorial meaning involving the  polytope algebra, in the case of simplicial polytopes.    McMullen's famous g-theorem says that the toric hvectors of  simplicial polytopes are characterized by the Macaulay  inequalities.  An attempt will be made to determine whether  the same (or stronger) inequalities hold for toric h-vectors of  other shellable complexes.  Aside from shelling techniques, it  might be possible to use the polytope algebra, which will also be  studied.  Of special interest to the investigator and  collaborators will be zonotopes, which are orthogonal projections  of higher dimensional cubes.  ***",
