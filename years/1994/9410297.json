 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410297  Kats    Cannibalism has been documented in a wide variety of kinds of animals.  However,   given recent emphasis on predator-prey interactions, few studies have examined   mechanisms that mediate predation on members of the same species.  Adult   California newts prey on both eggs and larvae of the same species.  Dr. Kats has   demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments that newt larvae respond to   chemical cues from adults by increasing the amount of time they spend in refuge.    On 2 November 1993, a wildfire burned Dr. Kats's primary study site near Malibu,   California.  There are virtually no studies on the effects of major fire disturbances on   animal behavior.  To determine the effects of fire on chemically mediated newt   cannibalism, Dr. Kats and his students will test two hypotheses:  (1)  Changes in   stream water caused by runoff from recently burned hillsides will interfere with the   detection of intraspecific predator cues by California newt larvae, and (2)  changes   in stream water caused by runoff from recently burned hillsides will interfere with   the egg-eating behavior of adult California newts.    These hypotheses are particularly exploratory in nature because no previous study   has attempted to examine the effects of wildfire on chemically mediated animal   behavior.  Results from the experiments to be conducted by Dr. Kats and his   students could make significant contributions to understanding the effects of   unpredictable environmental disturbances and perturbations (wildfire in this case) on   behavioral interactions.",
