 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403636  Ulrickson        Many times weather of interest to the public are controlled by  factors that are very local in nature.  The researchers will study  the climatology and dynamics of a low-level easterly flow in the  Spokane, Washington vicinity that occurs beneath a regional  westerly flow at least a few days each month and in all seasons of  the year.  Synoptic-scale analyses of weather observations indicate  that the environmental flow should be westerly at all levels;  therefore, the factors controlling this reverse flow  must exist  locally, or on the mesoscale.       These winds are of more than academic interest.  The  significance lies in several effects: (1) the easterlies modify  temperatures and dew points; (2) when mountain fogs form, the  easterlies transport them into the Spokane area; (3) the area's  frequent surfaced-based inversions, which strongly influence  regional air quality and controls, are modified; (4) because of  their diurnal occurrence, the easterlies affect air traffic  control; (5) these winds influence the transport of suspended  particles and airborne chemicals.       The Principal Investigators will attack this problem using  climatological and diagnostic studies as well as a mesoscale  numerical model.  They also will collaborate with forecasters at  the local National Weather Service Office with the intent of  formulating methods for improved prediction of these episodes.  ***",
