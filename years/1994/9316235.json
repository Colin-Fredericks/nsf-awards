 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316235  Platz  The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry, an annual   conference for the discussion of topics that span from   biorganic chemistry to gas-phase reactions, will be convened   for the next three years. Although the range of topics is   wide, all have the methodology used by physical organic   chemists. Attendance will be limited to about twenty   persons, all of whom present informal talks on new,   unpublished results. Conferences will be held at remote   sites in order to minimize distractions and encourage   informal discussion. Strong efforts will be made, as in the   past, to include minorities and females. In keeping with   past tradition, there will be a large number of younger   investigators along with some senior investigators.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing meeting of Workshops on Physical Organic   Chemistry, which is organized by Professor Matthew S. Platz   at Ohio State University. These workshops will provide   opportunities for the generation of new ideas, to facilitate   collaborate, and to introduce young investigators to their   senior peers. The number of attendees and location of the   meetings are designed to facilitate these goals. The   workshop also benefits the Organic Dynamics Program by   identifying imaginative research projects and young   investigators that will strengthen the Program as new   awardees and reviewers.  ***",
