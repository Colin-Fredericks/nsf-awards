Genetic and biochemical studies of these  mutations will include (1) site-specific mutagenesis to introduce  compensatory changes, (2) analysis of chemical and enzymatic  probing of mutant rRNA with and without the appropriate ribosomal  protein bound, and (3) characterization of the expression of the  mutations under conditions in which one or more chromosomal rRNA  operons have been inactivated.  The goal of this work is to  elucidate the role of specific nucleotides in the structure and  function of 16S ribosomal RNA.  %%%  The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the  molecular mechanism of protein synthesis.  The focus of our work  is an RNA molecule found in the ribosome, the site of protein  synthesis in all living organisms.  The general approach outlined  in this proposal involves the use of genetic and biochemical  techniques to investigate the structure and function of 16S  ribosomal RNA from bacteria.  Genetic studies involve the  introduction of mutations at each of seven positions in 16S rRNA  and the characterization of the effects of these mutations on  protein synthesis in bacteria.  Biochemical studies include  experiments designed to test the ability of mutant 16S rRNA to  bind purified ribosomal proteins.  The goal of this work is to  understand the importance of specific 16S rRNA nucleotides in the  structure and function of the ribosome.  ***",
