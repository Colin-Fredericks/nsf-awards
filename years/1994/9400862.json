 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400862  Weiss  An ionomer blended with another polymer represents a special  class of copolymer/homopolymer blends in which one of the  components carries a charge.  The presence of the ionic species  may permit very strong, attractive intermolecular interactions  with another polymer and/or strong intramolecular repulsions  within the ionomer.  Either phenomena may induce miscibility of  two otherwise immiscible polymers.  This research is directed at  the characterization of the interactions and phase behavior of  ionomer/homopolymer blends and specifically the following three  objectives:  1. to understand the macrophase and microphase  behavior of blends in which miscibility results from attractive  intermolecular interactions or respulsive intramolecular  interactions; 2. to define the role of the ionomer counterion,  ionic concentration and polymer molecular weight on the phase  behavior and properties of the blends; 3. to determine the effect  of strong attractive or repulsive interactions on the spinodal  decomposition kinetics and the resulting morphology of critical  mixtures.  Two systems will be investigated: (1) blends of  lightly sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) and a methylated polyamide  and (2) SPS and bisphenol A polycarbonate.  The former is an  example of a blend with specific attractive intermolecular  interactions, and the latter is a blend for which miscibility  occurs due to intramolecular repulsive effects.  Model systems  using low molecular weight compounds will also be used.  The  specific experimental techniques that will be employed include  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy, light scattering, small angle  neutron scattering, small angle x-ray scattering, differential  scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis.  %%%  The work in this proposal will advance the field of polymer  blends.  This will lead to tougher, stronger plastics for use in  aerospace, automotive, and household applications.",
