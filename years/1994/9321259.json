Nanocrystals of the  semiconducting lead chalcogenides provide unique access to the  strong-confinement regime.  The electronic structure, the  vibrational properties, and the coupling of the electronic and  vibrational states of these nanocrystals will be investigated with  Raman and far-infrared spectroscopies as well as continuous wave,  nanosecond and femtosecond optical techniques.  This research will  provide detailed information about the importance of Coulomb  interactions under conditions of strong confinement of charge  carriers.    Non-technical abstract:  Solid structures which confine electrons  to dimensions on the order of atomic sized dimensions have  properties which differ drastically from those of the corresponding  bulk crystals.  The goal of this project is to determine the  electronic and optical properties of nanostructures made of the  lead salts (such as lead sulfide), where the effects of confinement  should be greater than in most other materials.  The unique  features of the lead salts are expected to lead to nonlinear  optical properties approximately 1000 times stronger than those of  previously investigated nanostructures.  The potential applications  of such strongly optically nonlinear materials is in optical  information processing.  ***",
