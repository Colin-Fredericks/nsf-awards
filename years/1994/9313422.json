 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313422  Beitz  This award will provide funding for the renovation of research and research training space in  the Cleaveland Chemistry Building on the campus of Bowdoin College.  The institution has a  long tradition in  graduating students in the natural sciences, although they work toward  those degrees in antiquated science facilities.  Constructed in 1952,  present conditions within  Cleaveland Hall are inadequate to support research activities in chemistry.  Laboratories lack   proper ventilation, plumbing and electrical systems, preventing researchers from getting full  use of sophisticated equipment.  Renovations will consist of upgrading the existing research  space by  improving the electrical, mechanical and ventilation systems, as well as replacing  casework, lighting, and fume hood.  Several laboratories will be reconfigured to make more  efficient use of space and to provide increased access for disabled persons.  A renovated  building will provide increased access to science for all who use the facility, and enhance the  research experiences gained by students.  The renovation project will not only help the  college attract and retain students, but it will assist Bowdoin in laying the foundation for  continued excellence in research and research training in chemistry for the future.",
