Yet despite the increasing magnitude of this  problem, the genetic basis for the response of an insect population  to insecticides is not clearly understood.  Insect populations  exhibit different genetic responses under field and laboratory  conditions.  Furthermore, the effects of insecticide exposure on  closely related species are unknown.  The research will address the  evolution of insecticide resistance in field populations of two  closely related species of the fruitfly, Drosophila, which have a  20 year history of exposure to the insecticide malathion.  Despite  the close relationship of these species, one population is an  average of 10 times more resistant than the other.%%%       The immediate goal of the research is to determine the genetic  basis for the difference in resistance levels between these two  populations.  Classical genetic procedure will be coupled with  biochemical analysis of known detoxification systems to identify  major genes contributing to malathion resistance.  The basis of  resistance in these populations will thus be compared with those  from geographically distinct populations of both species to  determine the significance of the differences between the species.   This work will be of a direct benefit to agricultural pest  management strategies by determining the effect of insecticide  exposure on closely related species.  This knowledge may then be  directly used to influence the development of future pest  management programs.***",
