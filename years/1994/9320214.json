 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320214  Allen  Working under the direction of Professor Marc Bekoff of the  University of Colorado, Dr. Allen is focusing on the impact of  philosophy of mind and cognitive ethology on each other.  Dr. Allen  is a philosopher; Professor Bekoff is an ethologist.  Dr. Allen is  studying under Professor Bekoff's direction the empirical  techniques appropriate to ethology and the explanatory objectives  of ethologists.  Dr. Allen's research objectives are to improve our  understanding of the extent to which philosophy of mind can help  advance empirical objectives of cognitive ethologists and the  extent to which ethological data bear on philosophical theories of  mind.  During the course of the year that he is spending working in  Colorado, Dr. Allen is participating in Professor Bekoff's study of  antipredator vigilance in birds.  These two have already jointly  authored articles on conceptual issues in cognitive ethology.  They  are using this experience working together in order to develop an  extended treatment of cognitive ethology and its relationship to  philosophy of mind.  This study promises to be of significance to  specialists in both fields as well as to the wider societal  interest in the nature and origins of mentality in humans and other  animals.  ***",
