 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453243  Kenkel      This planning grant is enabling a working group of chemistry  educators from community colleges, high schools, and a university,  along with laboratory technicians and supervisors from industry and  government, to develop a comprehensive plan for creating and  operating a National Center of Excellence for Chemistry-Based  Technician Education (\"NCE\").  The center, which will be based at  the Southeast Community College in Lincoln Nebraska, will serve as  a national model for program and materials development, and will  serve as a clearinghouse for information critical to  chemistry-based technician education.  The working group for the  proposed NCE builds on the broad experience and national leadership  of its members and is comprehensively considering issues related to  the Center's development, including:  curriculum reform and  implementation, alliances with industry, direct transfer of credit  to four-year institutions, and \"2+2+2\" articulation.  During the planning period, the working group will be developing  the structural and programmatic basis to create a National Center  of Excellence at Southeast Community College which can take the  national lead in the development of a dynamic and cooperative  approach to chemistry-based technician education.  ***",
