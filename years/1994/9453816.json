The host,  Bill Nye, joins viewers and guests as they explore science topics  in his laboratories and in field locations.  Children also will  perform on-camera experiments in a home setting.  In most shows,  guest scientists and celebrities, selected to ensure a diverse  representation, will be featured.  Segments in the programs  include:           \"Check it Out\"             a small experiment performed in the                           lab or at home by child actors.    \"Try This at Home\"         an experiment viewers may attempt                           at home after receiving instructions on                           the air.    \"Way Cool Scientist\"       a scientist demonstrating his or                           her work as it relates to the topic of                           the program.    \"Music Video Parody\"       video tailored to popular music                           genres such as rap or \"grunge\" or pop                           music.    \"Consider the Following\" Bill presents a concept to the viewer                           in a one on one segment.    \"Big Demonstration\"        Bill, in the laboratory, uses                           equipment to demonstrate an element of                           the theme.    \"Celebrity Cameos\"         featuring both teen and adult                           celebrities with a high recognition                           factor.    \"Fake commercials\"         like the music videos, humor ous                           parodies of advertising.                                         Outreach for the second season will include a quarterly  newsletter to be mailed to viewers homes.  This eight page  newsletter will include regular columns such as \"Ask Bill\" and  \"Try this at Home.\"  It will be designed to appeal to children  ages 8 to 12 and will contain a column for parents.  During the  second season, at-home science kits will again be available to  viewers.  These free kits will enable children and their families  to perform scientific experiments together at home.              The video series will be produced by McKenna/Gottlieb  Producers Inc. and KCTS Television and will be syndicated for  broadcast by Buena Vista Television (the syndication division of  Disney Productions).  The second season also will be broadcast  daily on PBS.  This will give the series a presence on both  public broadcasting and on commercial television in many markets.  Buena Vista Television will provide $3,000,000 toward the  production budget and PBS will provide $2,000,000 for production.  KCTS is seeking a corporate underwriter to provide $1,000,000 for  additional outreach and promotion.         Elizabeth Brock of KCTS will be Executive in Charge of the  project.  Bill Nye is the principal science writer for the series  as well as host of the series.  The series producers will be  Erren Gottlieb and James E. McKenna.  These four people will  serve as Co-PI's of the project. The advisory committee consists  of scientists, science educators, evaluators, and curriculum  developers.  Members include:  H. Prentice Baptiste, Arthur B.  Ellis, Caroline Herzenberg, Gilbert S. Omenn, Senta A. Raizen,  Matthew H. Schneps, Paul H. Williams, Carole Ann Kubota, and  Sally Luttrell-Montes.",
