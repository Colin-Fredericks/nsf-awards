The results gained from the study are expected  to be useful for future predictions of MJO and related climate  variations.       Three interrelated research projects will be undertaken.       1. Interaction of TIDS and mean tropical circulations       A three-layer tropical atmospheric model describing both the  moist equatorial waves and time-mean flows will be used to  investigate the effects of a three-dimensional mean flow on wave  development and propagation, and the change of mean flow caused by  momentum and heat transports (or E-P flux) associated with wave  activities.       2. Interaction of MJO and tropical ocean       To understand the nature of atmosphere-ocean interaction on  intraseasonal time scales, the PI will (a) perform numerical  experiments with an intermediate tropical ocean model to access the  possible influences of an ensemble of intraseasonal forcing on the  ENSO cycle, (b) conduct an empirical study of the relation between  intraseasonal variation of SST and MJO to access the degree of the  coupling between SST and MJO, and c) analyze coupled instability  possibly arising from the thermodynamic coupling of the atmosphere  and ocean relevant to warm ocean regions.       3. Multi-scale structure of MJO and higher-frequency  disturbances       The PI will investigate the multi-scale temporal and spatial  structure of the MJO and its relation to cloud clusters, tropical  cyclones, and extratropical forcing, using wavelet analysis and  other effective means.       A strategy of combining theoretical, numerical, and empirical  analyses is adopted.  Empirical analysis is used for revealing new  facts and formulating hypotheses, while theoretical and numerical  modeling are used to explain the phenomenon and te st the  hypotheses.       This research is important because it seeks to understand  variability on intraseasonal time scales.",
