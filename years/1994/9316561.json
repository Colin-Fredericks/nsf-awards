Wasson,  Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of  California, Los Angeles, to pursue with Professor Kaset  Pitakpaivan, Retired Director, Geological Survey Division,  Department of Mineral Resources, Thailand, for a period of 18  months, a program of research to locate and identify craters in  northeast Thailand associated with the formation of the  Australasian tektites.  Field work will be conducted by  collaborating U.S. and Thai teams of about five members each.   Theory holds that tektites, glasses with high silicon dioxide  (60-80%) and high aluminum oxide (10-15-%) contents, are produced  by the melting of a well-mixed continental sediment such as shale  or soil during the impact of an asteroid or comet with the Earth.   Small tektites, usually weighing less than 300 g and in the shape  of disks, dumbbells, and teardrops, are believed to have been  formed by the solidification of a liquid while spinning in the  atmosphere.  Larger layered tektites are believed to have been  formed on the ground from puddles of silicate melt.  Promising  research sites will be identified from remote sensing data  provided by the Thai collaborators.  Rock samples returned from  the field will be examined for shocked quartz by optical  microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and by other techniques  to search for evidence of shock effects.    Confirmation of the impact origin of tektites requires the  identification of the crater or craters, but none has been found.   While most researchers are of the opinion that the tektites were  produced in a single crater with a diameter of about 10 km or  more, the PI has proposed that additional smaller craters are  required to account for the layered tektites which are found  across a 1,200 km distance from Hainan Island through Cambodia to  Thailand.  The highest density of Australasian tektites is found  in the southeast corner of northeast Thailand.  The research  problem is  of great interest to geologists, and the present  project may do much to resolve the uncertainty in this field  regarding the formation of these tektites.  The PI and his  collaborators are highly respected researchers in the field of  this proposal.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the  East Asia and Pacific Program which seeks to increase the level  of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and their  counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  ***",
