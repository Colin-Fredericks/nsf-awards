The objective of their  research is to use newly developed methods of optical microscopy  to study the deposition and adsorption of colloid particles on  various surfaces, for example, melamine particles on silica  surfaces.  They plan experiments on particle deposition, kinetic  theory, the radial distribution function, and especially, the  fluctuation of particle density over surfaces.    The U.S. investigator brings to this project considerable  expertise in theoretical chemistry, especially in the area of  colloid particles.  This is complemented by the French  experimentalist who developed a method to measure fluctuation  density. They will be involved with theoretical aspects of the  project as well.  The deposition of particles and fluctuation of  particle density are of considerable importance in science and  technology, and of particular interest to the biochemistry field,  where the focus has been on the adsorption of proteins on  surfaces.  ***",
