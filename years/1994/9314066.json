 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Rossky is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in the area of   quantum simulation of chemical dynamics in solution.  This research   focuses on both the development and application of mixed quantum and   classical mechanical simulation methods for the description of chemical   processes in solution.  Emphasis is placed on the simulation of   nonadiabatic quantum dynamics.  The work will address in detail: 1) The   fundamental molecular level description of the solvent modes associated   with the non-radiative relaxation of solute excited electronic states in   liquid solution; 2) New applications of algorithms for quantum   nonadiabatic simulation to the dynamics of molecular photoionization and   to intramolecular charge transfer dynamics in both aqueous and   non-aqueous solution; 3) The development and implementation of new   algorithms for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics; and 4) Generalization and   testing of current nonadiabatic algorithms with emphasis on an analysis   of the role of quantum coherence in the results obtained in the condensed   phase.    The majority of chemical reactions occur in solution.  This fact has   stimulated a tremendous research effort to elucidate a set of unifying   principles describing chemical dynamics in liquids.  To fully address   this issue requires a detailed understanding of both the molecular   motions that occur during the course of a chemical event and the energy   flow within the solute and between the solute and the solvent.    Exceptional recent progress in clarifying these aspects has been made.    Advances in laser technology enable direct experimental measurement of   dynamical behavior of chemical systems on the time scale of the   fundamental events.  At the same time, significant advances have been   made in theoretical methods and models used in describing solution   chemistry.  Rossky's research in the development of new computational   algorithms will allow for both cl assical and quantum mechanical dynamical   simulations of phenomena on time scales accessible by these new   experimental techniques.",
