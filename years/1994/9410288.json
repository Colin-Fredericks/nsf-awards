The   experimental variations involve the sequencing   and grouping of decision alternatives into subsets to  structure the decision process into \"Open\" (all alternatives   considered simultaneously), \"Tournament\" (alternatives   pitted against one another in sequence with the ultimate   choice determined by the final \"winner\"), \"Optional   Stopping\" (accept-reject decisions for a sequence of   alternatives considered one at a time), and other agenda   structures.  Individual preferences will be manipulated  in two ways:  (a) induced preference manipulations by   making individual monetary payoffs contingent on the   group choice and (b) attitudinal manipulations whereby   choice options are made more or less attractive by   varying their attributes and measuring individual   preferences.  Individual and group choices, information   pooling during discussion, individual judgments of the   group choice, reports of individual decision strategies,   and other dependent measures will be assessed to   describe the choice process.            The decisions reached by committees, juries, and  other important small groups are affected, sometimes   dramatically, by the manner in which the group   structures its decision process.  The present research   studies small groups attempting to solve practical,  political, and legal problems.  Specifically, we study the   effects on group decisions of variations in the order of   consideration and the pattern of direct comparisons of   decision alternatives; we call these variations   manipulations of the group \"agenda.\"  A second   experimental variable, the distribution of information   across group members at the start of discussion, is also   studied in most of the experiments because it also has   been shown to have large, subtle effects on group  decision processes and outcomes.  ***",
