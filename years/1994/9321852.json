 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321852  SPOHN  The issue of whether racial discrimination occurs in criminal  sentencing has not yet been resolved.  Some studies have found  that blacks are sentenced more harshly than whites, but others  have found either that there are no differences or that blacks  are sentenced more leniently than whites.  Critics of this  research have suggested that these inconsistent findings reflect  an overly simplistic view of the relationship between race and  sentencing.  They have called for research designed to delineate  more precisely the conditions under which defendants' race  influences judges' sentencing decisions.  The proposed research  responds to this call for substantive and methodological  improvements in research on race and sentencing.    The PIs will conduct a multi-site study that (1) probes for  indirect as well as direct racial effects; (2) tests for  interactions between defendants' race, legal and extralegal  variables, and sentencing severity; (3) examines decisions made  prior to sentencing for evidence of racial bias; and (4) employs  qualitative as well as quantitative techniques.  They will  collect detailed data on defendant, victim and case  characteristics for a random sample of defendants convicted of  felonies in Cook County (Chicago) Circuit Court, Harris County  (Houston) District Court, and Douglas County (Omaha) District  Court.  In addition, interviews will be conducted with criminal  justice officials in each jurisdiction.    ***",
