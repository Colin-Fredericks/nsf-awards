 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314708  CHAN    Lithium isotopic compositions of hydrothermally altered sediments  of DSDP site 477/477A, as well as high temperature vent fluids of  the Guaymas Basin, have determined to gain an understanding of Li  exchange during fluid-sediment interaction at this sediment-covered  spreading center.  Unaltered turbidite of the basin has a 6Li value  of -10 0/100, 5 to 7 0/100 heavier than fresh oceanic basalts.   Contact metamorphism induced by a shallow sill intrusion results in  a decrease of Li content of the sediment and a lighter isotopic  value (- 8 0/100).  Below the sill, sediments altered by a deep-  seated hydrothermal system show strong depletions in Li, while  isotopic compositions vary greatly, ranging from -11 to +1 0/100.   The shift to lighter composition is the result of preferential  retention of the lighter isotope in recrystallized phases after  destruction of the primary minerals.  The complexity of the isotope  profile is attributed to inhomogeneity in mineral composition, the  tortuous pathway of fluids and the temperature effect on isotopic  fractionation.      The range of Li concentration and 6Li values for the vent fluids  sampled in 1982 and 1985 overlaps with that of the sediment-free  mid-ocean ridge systems.  The lack of a distinct expression of  sediment input is explained in terms of a flow-through system with  continuous water recharge.    Observations on the natural system agree well with the results of  a laboratory hydrothermal experiment.  The ready mobility of Li in  the sediment under elevated temperature and pressure conditions has  important implications for its hydrothermal flux at spreading  centers and Li cycling in subduction zones.",
