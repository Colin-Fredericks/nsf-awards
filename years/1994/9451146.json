 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students today seem less skilled and have less interest in  interacting with the physical world than those of earlier  generations. It is the thesis of the author that this is not due to  the cultural and societal factors, (e.g. too much T.V.) but rather  due to the advanced state of integration and complexity in advanced  technological products, both in the everyday world as well as in  laboratories. This discourages tinkering and experimentation which  are crucial in attracting young people to engineering.  It is  proposed to address this issue by modifying a digital circuit  laboratory in electrical engineering so that students can look  inside of and tinker with integrated circuits. Conventionally,  students make digital logic gates in lab by wiring up invisible  transistors which are inside black-box I.C.'s. In the proposed  labs, the students will have access to the inside of a real I.C.  through the use of needle probes to physically contact and connect  to individual transistors and circuits on a specially designed I.C.  They will be able to directly relate transistor and circuit  performance to the physical parameters of the transistors and  circuits, which they can see by visual inspection and change by  physically contacting different circuits. This is analogous to  examining auto engines by attacking them with wrenches and playing  inside of them, rather than trying to learn about them with the  hood of the car closed and the engine inaccessible.",
