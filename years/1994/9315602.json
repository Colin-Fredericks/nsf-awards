 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mehta  9315602  The Wind Engineering Research Center (WERC) and the Institute for  Disaster Research at texas Tech University have pursued intensive  wind-related research for over twenty-three years.  Besides  extensive wind-storm-induced damage documentation and research  regarding wind effects on buildings and structures, these research  centers have excelled through accomplishments such as development  of a full scale building field test facility, a missile impact test  facility, and a wind engineering library containing close to 3,000  wind-related documents.  The WERC is currently involved in an NSF  sponsored cooperative wind engineering project with Colorado State  University that involves faculty and students from the departments  of Civil, Chemical and Mechanical Engineering, as well as  atmospheric sciences.  In the present grant, the results of these  research accomplishments will be transferred to the curriculum of  these and other departments.  Visual aids such as instructional  video modules, color slide sets and detailed notes on pertinent  topics will be prepared.  These materials will then be integrated  into different courses offered in the courses both in the  undergraduate and graduate levels.  These instructional aids can  also be used by other universities offering similar courses.   ***",
