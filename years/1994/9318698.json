Tim White   SBR- 9318698    Some time ago, paleontological work in southern Africa established Australopithecus as an ancestor of the human family and also revealed extensive diversity in the early human fossil record.  Subsequent  work in eastern Africa at Olduvai Gorge (the Leakey's) and elsewhere, including Hadar (Johansen), extended the known geographic and temporal distributions of early hominids and led to the recognition of even greater diversity and complexity.    The Middle Awash in Ethiopia, with rocks spanning the Late Miocene through Late Pleistocene, is the continent's most important natural laboratory for the study of human origins and evolution.  Data from here bear on issues as wide-ranging as the tempo and mode of hominid evolution across the last five million years, the origins and evolution of stone tool technology and subsistence patterns, and the relationships between global climate change and events in hominid evolution.     The earlier work of this outstanding team has shown that the Awash basin provides 'snapshots' of life through time rather than a continuous succession of fossil bearing sediments.  They have discovered a variety of new archaeological occurrences and fossil vertebrates, including early hominid remains from six separate time horizons spanning 3.5 million years.  The survey phase of the research is drawing to a close, and it is now possible to match ongoing problems in human evolutionary studies with the resources of this rich and complex repository.    The work to be supported by this grant will work on three sets of hominid-bearing Pliocene deposits, whic h have already yielded some very interesting early hominid fossils.  The fieldwork will contribute critical data on key issues - 1) the earliest known hominids, 2) the skeletal biology of Australopithecus afarensis, and the origin of the genus Homo.  To date, paleontologists have been unable to resolve these issues because of inadequate fossil and contextual data sets, which this site will provide.    This project also has an unparalleled record of training of, and collaboration with, professionals from an  undeveloped country.  ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9318698.abs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       r   t   U   W                           '   )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             !         !         !         !
