 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hargraves  9400669   With scientific, political and public concern about effects of coastal pollution and global climate change on marine species biodiversity, there is an urgent need for accurate identification of phytoplakton.  Currently used manuals for identification of plankton diatoms of the northeast U.S. coast are inadequate to fill this need for several reasons:  outdated taxonomy; inadequate inclusiveness of taxa; insufficient descriptors and/or illustrations; and limited geographic applicability.  This research will permit completion of an identification manual for plankton diatoms, to include general aspects of diatom biology (habit, ecology, life cycles, morphology, biogeography) and a complete flora of and key to verified species (taxonomic history, detailed illustrations of morphology, interspecies comparisons and regional distribution).  New and recent samples (Bay of Fundy to Chesapeake Bay; estuarine to continental shelf) will be collected to supplement an existing data base of about 1100 microscope slides and 1600 liquid preserved samples.  There is currently no such manual in existence for the northeast U.S..  In addition to a printed manual information will be incorporated into the Linnaeus computerized identification program.  The data will also be entered into a suitable data management system compatible with those at the ANSP (Philadelphia) and the CAS (San Francisco), and as much as feasible with the ARC/INFO GIS system at the University of Rhode Island.  It is expected that the manual and data will be:  usable by non-specialists; stimulating and adjunct to a variety of marine biological/oceanographic studies; accessible via printed and electronic media; and able to maintain its usefulness on a decadal scale.",
