SFM offers several advantages over other microscopies as a tool for the structural characterization of biological samples because: i) It has resolution roughly comparable to the electron microscope (EM); ii) imaging can be done under physiologically relevant conditions, i.e. in air and in liquids; iii) It produces topographic images which are harder to obtain with other microscopes of equivalent resolution; and iv) It uses methods of sample deposition which are significantly gentler than those required in EM.    During the last two years our efforts have been concentrated in establishing Scanning Force Microscopy as a method of direct visualization capable of imaging biological structures at high resolution and in conditions preserving their native state. In this period we have: i) Developed reliable methods of deposition of nucleic acids and protein/DNA complexes on mica and image them in air, under controlled humidity; ii) Improved the spatial resolution of SFM with biomolecules in air through the use of sharp carbon \"supertips\"; and iii) Obtained some of the first images of biological macromolecules in aqueous and other liquid environments. Party as, a result of these efforts, SFM imaging of biological samples in air is now routine and reliable, and various laboratories including our own are now involved in several applications of SFM to structural biology.    However, it is apparent that the ultimate technical limitations of SFM have not yet been reached and that a dditional technical developments will be necessary before the potential of SFM in structural biology can be fully realized. These developments must occur in three main areas: spatial resolution, control of tip-sample interactions, and imaging under physiological buffers.    This application has two parts. In part A we propose experiments designed to address each of these important technical issues based on preliminary data obtained in our laboratory during the last two years. The specific objectives of this effort are: i) Development and test of new ultra sharp tips for SFM; ii) Use of non contact modes of operation; and iii) Design and test of new electrochemical methods of sample deposition for imaging under liquids. Part B describes the application of successful technical developments of part A we the structural characterization of E. coli RNA polymerase DNA complexes during initiation and elongation.     u    ~     @ This proposal describes a program to develop the applications of Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) as a struc        &   ?
