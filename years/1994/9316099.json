Further, the degree to  which the geometry of natural fracture systems can be accurately  simulated directly affects our ability to deal with such important  problems as waste isolation, ore deposit genesis, natural resource  recovery and aquifer remediation.       This proposal seeks to increase our understanding of the  parameters which control the geometric characteristics of natural  fracture networks by incorporating well established physical  principles into models for the generation of natural fracture  networks.  Previous investigations have demonstrated that  physically-based fracture network simulators (PBNSs) can accurately  predict the evolution of experimentally generated fracture sets.   This proposal seeks to identify appropriate values for the  parameters which control the growth of natural fracture networks by  comparing simulated networks to those observed on outcrops.   Knowledge of the appropriate values for these growth parameters is  essential for accurate simulation of natural fracture network  geometries.       This proposal also seeks to apply the PBNS in an analyses of  the conductivity of simulated networks in order to discern the  critical geometric parameters controlling fluid flow within  fractured formations.  The identification of these geometric  parameters, when combined with the appropriate growth parameter  values, will result in more accurate interpretation of, and for,  fluid migration through fractured formations.        Models for natural fracture networks which result from this  work will improve our understanding of how fracture systems are  created by, and influence other, geologic features and processes.   This understanding will enhance our ability to accurately model  many important sub-sur face processes and, as such, has application  to many problems in earth science.  Such problems include, but are  not limited to, seismic inversion, natural resource recovery and  structural mechanics of the earth's crust.",
