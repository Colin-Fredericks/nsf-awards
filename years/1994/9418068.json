 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418068  DeFanti  This Metacenter Regional Alliance will tie together three complementary organizations: the Metacenter, the Software Technologies Research Center (STRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and the Chicago Manufacturing Center (CMC). The organizing principle is the provision of a high-end testbed for virtual reality applied to manufacturing product design and rapid prototyping, to both large companies and consortia of small ones.     The proposal will create and transfer the technology of virtual reality within the National Information Infrastructure.  The software and advanced human interface technology for remote virtual prototyping and its supercomputing support will be developed with regional metacenter partners and small businesses.  The proposed link to the vBNS is a vital part of this proposal.    The STRC has demonstrated over a twenty year history that it can apply visualization technology to many areas, e.g., education, manufacturing, and training.  It has provided the expertise that culminated in the CAVE virtual reality theater at the SIGGRAPH and Supercomputing conferences.  CMC manages one of the newest NIST regional manufacturing Centers whose aim is to assist small and medium sized businesses modernize operations and improve competitiveness.     Through its partnership with STRC, CMC, and NCSA this Alliance has the opportunity to provide leadership in areas of HPCC technology deployment to the Chicago region, and create a paradigm that can be replicated by other urban research institutions.",
