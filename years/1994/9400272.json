The program  will bring 13 undergraduate students (all but one or two from  other colleges and universities) to Stony Brook each summer for  participation in forefront physics research in the laboratories  of Stony Brook faculty members.  Approximately six Stony Brook  undergraduate students, funded from other sources, will also take  part.  The aim of the program is to foster interest in, and  appreciation of, scientific research in physics, through doing  research in a collegial setting, site visits to research  laboratories weekly lectures on current problems in physics and  presentation of results in a formal symposium at the conclusion  of the program.  The Physics program is part of a larger REU effort at Stony  Brook, encompassing nine other departments and supporting a total  of over 70 REU students each summer.  Recruiting efforts  concentrate on colleges in which research opportunities are  limited, and particular efforts are made to attract women and  students from under-representated minorities.  ***",
