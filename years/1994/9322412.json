 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322412  Drabold  This is a new award for computationally-intensive theoretical  research to study tetrahedral amorphous carbon.  It has recently  been demonstrated that a fourfold-coordinated form of amorphous  carbon, tetrahedral amorphous carbon, is a semiconductor; can be  doped both positive and negative; shows photoconductivity and has  been employed to make simple devices.  A theoretical research  program will be undertaken to determine the properties of this  material.  The research will provide detailed studies of the atomic  scale structure and electrical properties using first principles  methods.  Defects in the amorphous network will be identified and  their effects on carrier transport will be examined.  The  properties of several impurities, but especially the demonstrated  shallow donors, will be explored.  A limited study of the effects  of hydrogen on material properties will be performed.  The surface  structure of the material will be determined with a view to  producing surface structural models that will be useful to future  atomistic or Monte Carlo growth studies.  The vibrational  properties and stability of the material will also be investigated.   A complementary effort will be directed toward improvement of the  efficiency of existing computational techniques for first  principles simulations of tetrahedral amorphous carbon and other  chemically bonded materials.  %%%  This is a compuational research project to study the properties of  an amorphous form of carbon.  This material has been shown to have  many interesting properties which may have significant impact on  microelectronics - not the least of which is that it is a  semiconductor.  Thus, the material seems to have many of the  desirable electronic properties of diamond.  The research will  provide one of the first comprehensive theoretical studies of this  new material.  ***",
