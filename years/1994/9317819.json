 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317819  Grodzicker  There has been a significant amount of new information on the role  of heat shock proteins and molecular chaperons in the process of  protein transport and protein folding since the 1991 Cold Spring  Harbor meeting on Stress Proteins.  Due to their newly discovered  fundamental roles in essential processes involving protein   biogenesis, heat shock proteins and molecular chaperons have drawn  interest from a number of traditional scientific disciplines in the  basic sciences as well as numerous medical specialties including  infectious diseases, cancer and heart disease.  Therefore, this  meeting, in the tradition of Cold Spring Harbor meetings will  emphasize many of these new  discoveries.  The organizers for the  1994 meeting are Richard I. Morimoto, Susan Lindquist and Costa  Georgopoulos all of whom have been previous organizers of this and  other international meetings on the heat shock response.  The  meeting will have eight lecture and two poster sessions.  The  working outline for the sessions includes: I-The Regulation of Heat  Shock Gene Expression, II-Molecular Chaperons - Structure and  Biochemical Properties III-Molecular Chaperons - Protein Folding  and Intracellular Transport, IV-Other Functions for Molecular  Chaperons, V-Recognition Properties of Molecular Chaperones, VI-  Proteins Modification and Proteolysis, VII-Protection from Stress -  From Cells to Organisms, and VIII-Immunobiology, Infectious  Diseases and Pathophysiology.  Each session will be chaired by an  invited speaker and be comprised of eight to nine talks,  corresponding to four to five invited speakers with the remaining  speakers for each session selected from submitted abstracts.   Particular attention will be paid to encourage participation in the  lecture or poster sessions by graduate students and postdoctoral  fellows in addition to attendance and presentations by senior  investigators.%%%  What have been called heat shock proteins or stress response  proteins are essential for the no rmal life of cells as well as  protecting them under many types of adverse conditions.  Some of  these proteins are involved in guiding other important cellular  proteins to their proper location in the cell.  Their protective  role in helping cells to adapt to rapid changes in the environment  has also been of interest to those studying abnormal or diseased  states of the organism.  Much progress has been made in the study  of heat shock proteins.  The purpose of the 1994 Cold Spring Harbor  Conference on Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperone is to  bring together scientists to discuss the latest results of their  research.  The meeting has a format to encourage younger scientists  graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, as  well as senior investigators to present their latest work.  Each  session will be chaired by an invited speaker and be comprised of   eight to nine talks, corresponding to four to five invited speakers  with the remaining speakers for each session selected from  submitted abstracts.  Particular attention will be paid to  encourage participation in the lecture of poster sessions by  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in addition attendance  and presentations by senior investigators.  ***",
