 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354626  Martin  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a plan and materials for  integrating social impact and ethics topics across the computer  science curriculum.  It will address the two major problems that  hamper the implementation of an across-the-board curricular change:  The lack of materials that can be adapted or adopted into the  existing CS curriculum and the lack of awareness and expertise on  the part of most CS faculty regarding the need and methodology for  presenting such material in their courses.  The project is  comprised of three interrelated tasks: 1) define the content of  teaching modules to be developed that will facilitate the  presentation of these topics; 2) develop the actual modules that  can be disseminated as a teaching kit to interested CS departments  and faculty members; and 3) develop a pilot faculty enhancement  seminar that can be presented for interested CS faculty members to  prepare them to use the materials.  The first task will be  implemented as follows:  a two-day working conference of experts in  ethics, social impact, and computer science curriculum will be  convened to determine the appropriate content for the teaching  modules.  They will discuss possible topics for a freshman  computers-and-society course, the traditional computer science core  courses, and the senior design course.  The expected outcome of  this conference will be consensus from this group regarding which  topics, how much time, and the level of such topics that should be  included in the CS curriculum.  The second task will be implemented  as follows:  Based upon the recommendation of the working  conference, teaching modules will be developed that can be used  together as a single course or independently within a number of  courses across the curriculum.  These modules will include  scenarios, exercises for discussion and written comment, and  teaching strategies for presenting the topics.  The modules will be  developed for a freshman course, use in computer science cor e  courses, and use in a senior design course.  These modules will be  sent out for comment and pilot testing by computer science  professors.  A kit of teaching modules will be developed for  general dissemination.  The third task will be implemented as  follows:  Based upon the materials developed, a pilot two-day  faculty enhancement seminar will be developed and conducted to  provide guidance to computer science professors regarding how to  effectively use the materials.  Based upon results from the pilot  seminar, a kit for faculty enhancement seminars will also be  developed for general dissemination.  ***y",
