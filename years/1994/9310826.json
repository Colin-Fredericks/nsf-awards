S. and international institutions a field research facility with access to a wide range of biological communities and a great diversity of species.  The primary objective of the Station research.  Support facilities for field research projects are extremely important.  This project addresses three areas of acute facilities' needs at SWRS in an integrated plan.  The first goal is to provide a climate controlled building for temporarily housing experimental animals in isolated units, for  different experimental/care needs.  This facility would meet room wing onto the laboratories to provide a winterized space for housing scientific collections and the research library.  In addition, the roofing of the entire laboratory would be insulated and refurbished.  The third goal is to renovate the outdated animal room into a computer room and an office.  Achieving these goals would, in addition, significantly increase space for researchers and improve conditions in the main laboratory facility.",
