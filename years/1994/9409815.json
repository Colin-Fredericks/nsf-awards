 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research planning grant (RPG) addresses the problem of risk analysis for the reengineering of organizational processes.  Reengineering is a popular new method of re-designing work in organizations.  Reengineering involves:  1) the combination of previously fragmented functional tasks into integrated processes, 2) the use of information technology within the processes to increase efficiency, and 3) a reliance on deferred methods of control to decrease supervisory costs.  Proponents of reengineering cite several examples of firms significantly decreasing their costs while simultaneously increasing the efficiency with which their work gets done.    This study regards reengineering from the perspective of Perrow's theory of \"normal accidents.\"  Perrow states that as systems become more complex and tightly coupled, the likelihood of minor \"incidents,\" turning into major \"accidents,\" increases significantly.  Perrow argues that such systems require built in control systems that immediately make human operators aware of the location of the incident.    This study proposes that, given the complex, tightly coupled nature of integrated processes, reengineering is likely to create organizational systems more vulnerable to accidents.  Furthermore, because of the deferred control methods, managers may not be aware of accidents for longer periods of time, exacerbating the damage.  Finally, the information technology used in reengineering may be a source of new, damaging incidents.  This research argues that these risks must be weighed against the potential benefits od reengineering.    The goal of the planning stage of this research is a comprehensive literature review in the areas of:  reengineering, risk management, risk analysis involving various forms of information technology, risk impacts related to increased spans of control, and systems theory.  The literature should provide a full understanding of the dimensions of reengineering related risk and provide the basis for developing a longer-term res earch program to test the relationships between reengineering and risk empirically.",
