 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411787  Watts  Challenges to the received view that the human immuno-deficiency  virus (HIV) is the primary cause of the epidemic of AIDS have  arisen from 'heretics' within the biosciences, and from academics,  authors and treatment organizations outside of institutionalized  science.  Some of this response can be attributed to the failure of  Western researchers to characterize the virus's action completely  and to advance effective therapies.  This dissertation project will  seek to provide a more comprehensive explanation for this increase  in the production and dissemination of alternative knowledge on the  AIDS epidemic.  The thesis is that understanding national  structural differences in the political organization of dissidents  and their access to scientific forums and the mass media is  necessary to explain the different degrees to which dissidents in  the United States and England have succeeded in deconstructing  'expert' discourse and orthodox knowledge on the epidemic and  engaged the 'AIDS establishment' in serious dialogue on the  cause(s) and treatment of the disease and the appropriate direction  for public health policies regarding the epidemic. This research  will 1) explore the sites and content of alternative knowledge on  acquired immune-deficiency syndrome and AIDS in the United States  and England, and 2) explain the structural differences in the  access that dissidents have to forums for disseminating their views  in each country.  Methodologically, the research will involve semi-  structured interviews with dissidents, participant observation of  dissidents during the 2nd Alternative AIDS Conference and dissident  meetings, and archival research on dissident publications and  media. It will involve analysis of dissident claims as presented by  individuals, in archives, audio and video-tapes, and science  journals.  Representatives of media who have aired dissident views  as well as science reporters working for several English and U.S.  newspapers who have restricted  dissident debates will be  interviewed, as will persons who have sought to limit dissident  access to international scientific and medical forums on AIDS.    ***",
