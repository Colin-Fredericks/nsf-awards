The  planning will focus on extension of a new teaching model, Workshop  Chemistry, piloted at the College with NSF support.  The model  emphasizes collaborative learning and creates more active roles for  students in the teaching and learning processes, moving away from  the passive learning of the lecture mode.  The preliminary design  of course modules that will form the basis of the Workshop  Chemistry curriculum is a key aspect of the planning process.  The  modules can include any combination of laboratory, computer and  problem solving work.  The project directors will work with faculty  collaborators from the senior and community college levels to  translate their ideas into module outlines.  The outcome of the  planning phase will be a detailed plan for specification of the  course modules and how they will be integrated into the curriculum.  The planning process as well as the final project will involve as  partners faculty in other science disciplines, engineering, health   sciences, architecture and education, as well as individuals from  industry; this will facilitate the design of a curriculum which  promotes students' ability to apply chemistry concepts to other  fields.",
