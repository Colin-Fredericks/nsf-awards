 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for purchasing a multinuclear 500 MHz  nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to be shared by  twelve research groups in various biochemical, biological  and chemical research projects.  These users represent  various departments on campus (Biochemistry and Biophysics,  Chemistry, Agricultural Chemistry, and Pharmacy), making the  requested instrument a truly interdisciplinary resource.  The research groups are divided into two groups:  (1) Major  Users (six) who have research projects that require a  commitment of instrument time on a 500 MHz spectrometer to  study aspects of solution-state dynamics, kinetics and /or  structure function relationships of biologically interesting  molecules; (2) Minor Users (six) who have research projects  in which NMR spectroscopy is not a primary research tool,  but can be used to provided valuable data and insight that  is not easily obtainable by other methods.  The projects  that require this new instrumentation include:  structural  and dynamics studies of DNA-binding proteins and their  interactions with DNA; determining the solution structures  of DNA uracil glycosylase, its inhibitor, and the enzyme-  inhibitor complex; detailed structural studies of marine  natural products and antibiotics; identifying specific sites  of covalent modification of enzymes by highly specific  inactivators; and using oxygen isotope- induced carbon  resonance frequency shifts to study the extent of repair in  aging proteins.    The 500 MHz instrument requested in this proposal will  complement the existing equipment in the Departments of  Biochemistry and Biophysics, Chemistry, Agricultural  Chemistry, and Pharmacy.  As a physical method used to  characterize molecular structure and dynamics, NMR  spectroscopy is uniquely suited for the detailed study of  biomacromolecules.  The availability of a 500 MHz  spectrometer at OSU, as well as the expertise to train users  in the collection and analysis of NMR data, represents an  important resource and opport unity for researchers to pursue  an exciting, state-of-the-art method vital to biophysical  research.",
