PI's from current NSF funded projects who have significant Native American  population will be invited to attend. ( about 30)  In addition there will be another 16 Native  Americans who have special expertise in this subject who will be participant leaders.  The  conference will generate guidelines to address cultural needs of Native Americans.  A document  describing the outcomes, guidelines and recommendations will be published to assist future PI's,   teachers, and other interested parties as they develop their teaching strategies and curriculum  materials.  The conference is to take place on May 19 through May 22 at the University of  Colorado in Boulder, CO.",
