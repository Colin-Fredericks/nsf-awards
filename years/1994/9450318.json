Three years of  programs are proposed, each with a different theme: environmental  sciences; space and atmospheric sciences; and plants, genetics, and  food.  It is anticipated that this three-year program will serve as  a prototype for the development of many more camps which will serve  students throughout the city of Atlanta.  Three major conceptual  components guide the design of camp activities: (1) collaborative  social interactions in science, engineering, and mathematics; (2)  the relationship between science, engineering, and mathematics and  the quality of human life; and (3) student authentic inquiry.   Instructional activities will emphasize: cooperative learning;  interactions with scientist in their work places; student design  and implementation of investigations; field and outdoor  experiences; \"real world\" contexts for learning; and supportive  scaffolds.  Students will participate in a variety of projects in  which they learn to ask questions, make predictions, design  studies, analyze data, and reflect on results.  Instruction on  technology as a tool for science and engineering will be included.   Career exploration will be integrated with field trips and  projects.  A special feature of this camp is the provision for  comprehensive teacher education in cooperative learning, authentic  investigation, constructivism, technology, and authentic  assessment.  This project is being sponsored by the Aslant  Math/Science Collaborative Leadership Team including members from  the city of Atlanta, Atlanta Public Schools, Georgia State  University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Clark Atlanta  University, and Jimmy Carter's Atlanta Project.",
