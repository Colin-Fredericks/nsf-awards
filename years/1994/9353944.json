 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353944  Wyman  \"Technology Strategies: Tutorials and Projects\" involves 120  participants in one of four two-week workshops offered at The  Ohio State University in Summer 1994 and 1995. The workshops  include tutorials in mathematical topics, calculator use, and  software packages, but they emphasize extensive participant  projects that incorporate new technologies and teaching  methodologies culminating in presentations during the workshops  and at followup meetings.  These workshops build on the highly  successful Technology Strategies Workshops offered at Ohio  State with N.S.F. support in 1992 and 1993. Faculty from two-  year and community colleges, four year colleges, and  universities are actively recruited.  Also, alumni from the  previous workshops are invited to attend the Tutorials and  Projects workshops. The Participants take home new insights on  the national curricular reforms that have developed in the past  five years, as well as renewed excitement and enhanced  technical skills.  As a result of the workshop, they will be  able to communicate this excitement to their students.   Proceedings volumes will be widely distributed and participants  are invited to submit papers for a refereed publication for  national dissemination.  ***",
