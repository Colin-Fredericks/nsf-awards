 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407617  Bandurski  This investigator has cloned and sequenced a gene for the enzyme  catalyzing the reaction: IAA+UDPG ----- 1-0-IAA-glucose+UDP.  This  gene is important because the synthesis of IAA-glucose is the first  step in the biosynthesis of the conjugates of indole-3-acetic acid  (IAA) in Zea mays and because this is the first higher plant gene  of IAA metabolism to be cloned and sequenced.  Homologous sequences  are present in Arabidopsis and tobacco and in all the  monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants tested to date.  The  overall goal of this work is to control the size of the endogenous  pools of the plant growth hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA,  auxin), by genetic means.  All plants examined contain most of  their IAA in a conjugated, and presumably, inactive form.  It is  the free acid which appears to be the active hormone.  The ability  to regulate the concentrations of free, versus conjugated, growth  hormone levels, will be of value in understanding how IAA levels  are regulated in plants; will possible provide information  concerning how the tip of the shoot regulates shoot elongation; and  will be of possible agronomic value in promoting or reducing plant  growth without application of growth-regulating chemicals.  During  this granting period, the cDNA and genomic homologs of the corn  cDNA encoding for IAGlu synthetase will be identifed and sequenced  from Arabidopsis or tobacco; transgenic Arabidopsis and/or tobacco  plants will be constructed with the IAGIu synthetase gene placed  under a promoter in an antisense orientation to block expression of  mRNA involved in synthesis of IAGlu synthetase; reported gene  constructs will be prepared in Arabidopsis to study the time and  localization of expression of the IAGlu synthetase gene; and, two  different cDNA clones believed to encode genes controlling  hydrolysis of 1-0-IAGlu and 6-0-IAGlu will be sequenced and their  enzymatic activity characterized in an E. coli expression system.  ***",
