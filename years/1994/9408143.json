 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408143  Fincke                              Abstract    A major assumption in biology is that over evolutionary  time, males that obtain the greatest number of matings  (i.e., fertilizations) make the greatest contribution to the  next generation.  In contrast, females are thought to be  limited, not by the number of matings they obtain, but by  the number of eggs or embryos they can physically produce.  These basic assumptions have rarely been tested for animals  that do not have parental care (i.e., the majority of  species) because it is usually impossible to follow the  survivorship of offspring of known parents under natural  conditions.    In the New World tropics, males of an unusual damselfly  defend water-filled tree holes where females lay their eggs.  The offspring of known adults will be determined using a DNA-  fingerprinting technique.  Survivorship of offspring to  emergence (adulthood) will be measured for all males and  females using a given tree hole.  Although mosquito larvae  are the major source of food for larval damselflies, larger  damselflies readily cannibalize smaller ones.  Females lay  many more eggs in a given hole than the number of  individuals that emerge there.  Experiments are designed to  determine whether a female that lays an excess of eggs in  one hole, thereby promoting cannibalism among sibs, produces  larger or faster-developing offspring than a female that  lays a few eggs in many holes.  Other experiments test  whether or not an adult male stops defending a particular  hole once the chances of cannibalism of younger offspring by  older siblings become high.    Dr. Fincke's research will determine the extent to which  male and female behavior has been shaped by evolution to  produce few, high-quality offspring at the expense of  producing numerous offspring.  Because this damselfly is the  major predator of forest mosquito larvae, the research is  directly relevant to understanding the biological control  mechanisms of several mosquito species that are  vectors of  human diseases in the New World tropics.",
