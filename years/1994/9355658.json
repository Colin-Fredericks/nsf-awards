Specifically, it will:         create ongoing relationships between researchers and teachers       through research and inservice experiences and computer       networks; and         promote the adoption of K-12 national standards through       activities developed collaboratively by teachers and       researchers.    These goals will be met via 1) the Summer Research in Physiology  Program; and 2) the Joint Teacher-Researcher Physiology Inservice  Program.  During the Summer Research Program, teachers conduct  research in physiology laboratories and participate in additional  professional activities.  In the Inservice Program, teachers and  researchers develop lab/lessons for physiology inservice workshops,  focusing on effective pedagogical techniques.  Teachers will be  involved in project activities over a full academic year.  More  than 500 teachers, nationwide, will participate in the three-year  project.    Special features of the program include: connecting teachers to  global resources via computer networks; producing a videotape  modeling effective pedagogical techniques; developing an INTERNET-  accessible databank of physiology lessons; and focusing throughout  the project on gender and racial/ethnic equity.    The project will serve as a model for professional organizations  and provide materials and methods for inservice providers (e.g.,  State Systemic and Urban Initiatives).  Most significantly, it will  provide a model for building long-term relationships between  teachers and researchers, thus building the research community into  the support infrastructure for K-12 science education.",
