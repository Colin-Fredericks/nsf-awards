With the Industrial Advisory Board serving as the overseer, the program targets graduate students in engineering and computer science departments, with participation from mathematics.  Using state-of-the-art computer facilities, it emphasizes cross-disciplinary development of computer simulation skills and requires summer residency by the students hosted by industrial partners.  It also interacts with regional institutions to recruit women and underrepresented minorities into the program.  ***",
