 "awd_abstract_narration": "Byrne:    Richard Stockton College of New Jersey is one of only two 4-year undergraduate institutions  located in Southern New Jersey.  The institution is one of the few undergraduate institutions  in the United States with a degree program in Marine Science, serving approximately 100  degree majors.  To sustain this growth, the college plans to renovated and modernize the  marine laboratory on Nactoe Creek, a part of the intercoastal lagoon system in southern New  Jersey.  Present conditions at the facility are inadequate and severely limit research activities.   Space dedicated to research and research training is not properly partitioned and does not  meet safety requirements.  No seawater system exists and the greenhouse facility in its  present state is unusable.  The heating and cooling systems are antiquated and cannot support  the level of use in the building.  Funds have been requested to renovate 1,678 square feet  (156.1 square meters) of research and research training space.  In addition to modernizing  space, renovations will include:  the installation of fume hoods, casework, emergency  eyewash showers and a seawater system.  HVAC and fire protection systems will be  upgraded and the greenhouse will be reglazed.  Once completed, the renovated facilities will  support research projects that cannot be conducted at the moment.  Redesigned space will  promote more collaborative activities with other institutions in proximity to the marine field  station and will allow for more student involvement.  Opportunities for students to engage in  the research enterprise early in their undergraduate careers will increase the probability that  the students will continue in their pursuit of marine science.",
