Instrumented research aircraft have been invaluable in  providing these observations over the last four decades.  The need  for such aircraft will be great over the next few years for  research covering a broad range of research problems including  atmospheric chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud physics.  These areas of atmospheric science are high priority research areas  for the next decade.       This award makes available to  the entire atmospheric sciences  community the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft. The  Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other atmospheric sciences  community facilities with allocation being made by an NSF Facility  Advisory Council based on a community peer-review process. The  University of Wyoming personnel are experienced in airborne  research and the King Air is a state-of-the-technology research  platform.  During a previous three year award, the University  demonstrated exceptional performance in servicing the community  needs.  This award also helps maintain an active program in  airborne research at the University of Wyoming and extends this  educational benefit to other institutions through emerging  agreements with other universities.  The University of Wyoming  produced many excellent airborne research scientists over the last  three years.     ***",
