 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406636  Schmid       A great number of turbulent fluid flows show the presence of  streak-like elements in the near-wall region. These coherent  fluid patterns, and in particular their persistence and  flow-independent scales, have stimulated a great deal of interest  and investigations among the fluid dynamic community.  Although  it has been found that their appearance and dynamics play a  crucial role in the transition to turbulence and in fully  developed turbulence, our knowledge about streaks in wall-bounded  shear flows is rather limited despite remarkable progress over  the past years. The present proposal aims at investigating the  dynamics of streaks as well as their role in the production and  sustainment of turbulent fluid motion by a nonlinear stability  analysis.  Owing to experimental and computational evidence,  special emphasis will be directed toward the important phase of  the breakdown of streak-like structure.         A combined theoretical and numerical approach will be taken,  employing a Floquet stability analysis where the primary  finite-amplitude disturbance state will consist of a (slowly  decaying) streamwise vortex. The resulting stability equations  for three-dimensional secondary disturbances will then be treated  within a temporal and spatial framework using both asymptotic,  eigenvalue-based tools and transient, initial-value-based  techniques. Direct numerical simulations will be conducted to  complement and scrutinize the theoretical results. The emphasis  of this project will be on the influence of flow parameters on  the overall stability behavior and on the complete  description  of the dynamics of the breakdown process.",
