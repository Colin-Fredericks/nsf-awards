 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317598  Asper  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short,  but intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  This component will focus on the  collection of vertical flux samples which will be analyzed for  carbon, nitrogen and total mass flux and also provided to the  other investigators for their specific analyses.  Profiles of the  abundance of large aggregates in the water column using a non-  contact photographic method will be made.  These data will be  used to complement other particle determinations, to investigate  the role of these aggregates in particle flux and to determine  the mechanisms of particle export as a function of season and  phytoplankton species.  The end result will be a better  understanding of the bloom processes and significant  contributions to the data base on aggregates and export  mechanisms in this environment.",
