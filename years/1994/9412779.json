 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Simulation and Modeling Group at AT&T Bell Laboratories has  recently created a circuit simulator for dc simulation of their in-  house integrated circuits.  This simulator, called SFRAME has a  number of advantages over Newton-Raphson-based simulation programs  such as SPICE.  These advantages include global convergence, the  ability to find more than one or sometimes even all of a circuit's  operating points, and the ability to incorporate the sophisticated  bipolar junction transistor models used at Bell Laboratories;  running SPICE on circuits incorporating these models has led to  severe convergence problems.    This research will affect major enhancements to SFRAME, including  initialization capability, ability to simulate circuits containing  MOS transistors, and identification of the stability of operating  points found.  It is expected that the work proposed herein will be  a starting point for a long and productive industry-university  collaboration.",
