 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404557  Trotter    Echinoderms possess the apparently unique capacity to  modulate the mechanical properties of their collagenous  tissues by means of neurally regulated secretions.  Their  collagenous tissues, like those of other animals, are  composed of collagen fibrils and a non-fibrillar matrix.  The collagen fibrils are short and symmetrically spindle-  shaped.  They are extensively cross-linked and are  chemically and physically stable over long periods of time.  The physiological changes in tissue mechanics are not  produced by changes in the molecular structure of the  collagen fibrils by changes in the capacity of the  interfibrillar matrix to transfer stress between the short  fibrils.  A principal component of the echinoderm  interfibrillar matrix is proteoglycan (PG), including fibril  surface-associated PG.  The mechanical modulations that are  produced in echinoderm collagenous tissues by changing the  ionic environment have suggested that the electrochemical  properties of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are important  determinants of the tensile properties of the tissues.  However, no experiments have yet been done to directly test  this hypothesis.  The experiments proposed here are designed  to test it using biochemical and biophysical analyses on  isolated components.  Native collagen fibrils with their  surface associated PGs will be isolated from the deep dermis  of sea cucumbers and the spine ligaments of sea urchins.  Their interactions will be studied using light scattering  and viscometric analyses.  The PGs and their GAG moieties  will also be isolated and purified, and the interactions of  these molecules will be analyzed.  The associations of  fibrils and molecules will be studied as a function of the  specific ion composition of the medium in order to define  their electrochemical properties.  The hypothesis that  organic molecules is secreted by effector cells modulate  matrix interactions by modifying GAG-GAG interactions will  be tested by identifying \"plasticizer\" an d \"stiffener\"  molecules.  Their ability to modify the interactions of  fibrils, PGs and GAGs, will be determined.  These studies  should yield significant new information on the role of  echinoderm PGs and GAGs in transferring stress between  collagen fibrils and thereby determining tissue mechanical  properties.  They should further lead to the identification  of the physiological modulators of tissue mechanics, and to  a definition of their modes of action.  ***",
