 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    9353033  Clark    The Human Genome Project has brought to the public view the  importance and excitement of genetics in our society.  This  videodisc project focuses on that project and especially  bioethics to motivate the study of the fundamentals of  molecular and cell biology and genetics.  The nine-week  curriculum is issues oriented since increasingly individuals  will be faced with making family, career and medical  decisions based upon this knowledge.  The modules are  entitled Fundamental Concepts, The Human Genome,  Developmental Genetics, Human Genetics, Population and  Evolutionary Genetics.  Themes are developed in each area  relative to the human organism, with focus on modern  molecular mechanisms of inheritance, DNA, RNA, genes and  their variable expression, congenital defects, the human  genome, and bioethical considerations of genetic  technologies, etc.  Critical thinking and problem-solving  abilities are emphasized to create students who will  continue to understand the issues related to genetics.  The  videodisc-based materials are coordinated with biology  courses developed under NSF funding.  Appropriate role  models from groups under-represented in science, as well as  career information will be provided.  In addition to the  videodiscs, the materials include a textual encyclopedia of  modern genetics, computer software to control and search the  disc and the encyclopedia, and lesson plans.  The materials  are pilot tested in diverse locations.  Teacher workshops  are available as is an on-line bulletin board.",
