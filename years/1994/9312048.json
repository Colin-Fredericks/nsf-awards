 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312048  Starnes    This research will be directed toward the elucidation of the  detailed structures and polymerization mechanisms of poly(vinyl  acetate), various vinylidene chloride polymers, and poly(vinyl  chloride).  All of these polymers have great technological  significance, and all of them are made commercially by free-radical  polymerization.  Much of the effort will relate to the  identification and quantification of structural defects in the  polymers such as long and short branches, long-chain ends,  adventitious unsaturation, adventitious structures containing  oxygen, and groups derived from solvents.  The principal analytical  tool will be high-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and both the  poly(vinyl chloride) and the  vinylidence chloride polymers will  first be converted chemically into the corresponding  \"polyethylenes\" in order to facilitate the analyses.  Resonance  assignments will be confirmed by comparing the polymer spectra with  those of reference models that are to be synthesized during the  course of the project.  In the case of poly(vinyl acetate), a major  goal will be to understand fully the striking effects of aromatic  solvents on the polymerization chemistry and kinetics.  The work  with poly(vinyl chloride) and the polymers of vinylidene chloride  will be concerned especially with the structural defects that  contribute to the thermal instability of these materials.  Results  obtained from the project should suggest ways of modifying the  polymerization processes in order to form polymers with improved  properties.  ***",
