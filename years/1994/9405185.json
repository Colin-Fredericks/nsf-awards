 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405185  Brooks    In the past, Russian natural resources have been developed in some  areas of the country without giving due consideration to  significant environmental effects.  As companies of the United  States now seek to invest in some of these areas of Russia,  environmental issues need to be addressed before development  occurs.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Russian Environmental and Natural Resources can utilize Russian  researchers to study the environmental problems that need to be  addressed for development to occur.    This award provides funding for Texas A&M University to hold a  planning meeting with potential industry members to determine if  there is enough potential support from American companies to  support an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Russian Environmental and Natural Resources.    The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are recognized  experts in their fields and well qualified to perform this study.    The Program Manager recommends Texas A&M University be awarded  $10,000 for one year.",
