 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317299  O'Farrell    Cells develop in accord with their position within an  embryo. To do so, they either read position by communicating  with neighbors (regulative control), or inherit information  about position through lineage (determination). Typically,  embryonic cells go through a transition from regulative  control to determination. In Drosophila, we know many of the  genes that direct the fates of cells. The transition from  regulative control to determination should be associated  with a change in the regulation of these genes. One of these  genes, engrailed, directs cells to form the posterior parts  of segments. There is a multistepped transition in the  control of engrailed expression that appears to represent a  transition from regulative control to determination. Dr.  O'Farrell has defined four tiers of engrailed control:  initial patterning by localized transcription factors,  maintenance by the wingless signal, autoregulation and  control by Polycomb group genes. Dr. O'Farrell will  precisely define the relationship between the type of  control of engrailed and developmental determination. This  will involve the use of new lineage tracing methods and the  development of a method to follow gene expression in real  time. Additionally, he will begin biochemical analysis of  the involvement  of  Polycomb regulators in stable control  of engrailed expression.  ***",
