 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405929  Wanner  This proposal is to continue studies on \"cross regulation\" in  central metabolic pathways of Escherichia coli.  Cross regulation  refers to the control of a response regulator of one two-component  regulatory system by a different regulatory system.  Two such  controls act on the phosphate (PHO) regulon.  One involves the CreC  sensor kinase (which is encoded together with its partner response  regulator CreB by catabolite regulatory creABCD operon); the other  involves acetyl phosphate.  Both of these controls appear to be  important, for each provides a way to couple control of the PHO  regulon (by the level of extracellular Pi) to pathways of central  metabolism for the incorporation of intracellular Pi into ATP (the  primary phosphoryl donor in metabolism).  Specific aims of this  proposal are: (i) to identify genes regulated by the CreB-CreC two-  component regulatory system; (ii) to examine acetyl phosphate  synthesis in normal and mutant cells; and (iii) to conduct gene  regulation studies to assess the importance of cross regulation in  cell physiology.  %%%  Cells undergo numerous adjustments of central pathways of  metabolism in response to the carbon and energy sources.  These  adjustments require a high degree of regulatory interactions  between and among different cellular functions in order to permit  the cell to grow.  Cross regulation provides a means for the  coordinate regulation among these different pathways.  This study  will focus on cross regulation in the control of genes closely  related to phosphorus metabolism (an essential nutrient whose  assimilation is closely connected to central metabolic pathways.)   Although these studies will be carried out entirely in the model  bacterium Escherichia coli, the results are likely to pertain to  all types of cells.  This is because of the unity among central  pathways.  Two mechanisms of cross regulation will be explored.   One involves protein phosphorylation, an important process for the  control of regulatory  proteins (in all cells).  The other involves  a small molecule (acetyl phosphate) which appears to act as an  effector molecule in the control of (certain) regulatory proteins  known to be affected by protein phosphorylation.  ***",
