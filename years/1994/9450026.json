It will  develop and implement systemic change strategies reaching parents, teachers and  professors, guidance counselors and other school and college administrators, school board  members, community leaders, and students (K-18), building on existing resource and  advocacy efforts by professional organizations, stakeholder groups, state and local  education agencies, and institutions of higher education.  The project has four  components:  (1) a Clearinghouse for statewide resource building, research, symposia  and conferences, and dissemination of project products;  (2) a public awareness  component infusing Women in SEM issues in the state's Statewide Systemic Initiative  public awareness campaign and also creating local \"equity partnerships\";  (3) a \"self-  esteem building\" component offering three different approaches to supporting girls and  women in SEM at the elementary, secondary, and college levels;  and (4) a pre-service  and in-service component developing new curricula addressing Women in SEM issues  for future and practicing teachers, respectively.  ***",
