The program will run for three years beginning July 5-29, 1994.   Approximately 10 will be selected  from each of fine schools (3 in  Boston, 2 in Cambridge).  Schools will be selected such that the 50  girls will represent a number minority groups (will be African-  American, Latina, Haitian, and Southeast-Asian in origin) and a  variety of abilities (will attend non-magnet and magnet schools,  etc.)  The major criterion for selection will be on motivation and  interest in science/math and a clear understanding of the nature of  the program.  Emphasis will be placed throughout the program on  factors affecting interest and success in science/math of the  students not only as under represented minorities, but also as  females.  A core component of the curriculum will be based upon a  three-week pilot offered at Bentley in the summer of 1993 for 15  predominantly minority girls.  This program utilized a curriculum,  in which age-appropriate mathematics were integrated with chemistry  laboratory experiments utilizing (1) team work and cooperative  learning styles and (2) material and problems familiar to girls in  particular.",
