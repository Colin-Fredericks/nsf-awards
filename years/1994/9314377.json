The  objective of their research is to develop a tunable vacuum  ultraviolet (VUV) laser light source for the wavelength range  110-170 nm and its application to spectroscopy and dissociation  dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The laser is considered the  light source of choice and necessity for investigating photo-  dissociation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon-oxygen and  oxygen at low wavelengths.  The U.S. investigator brings to this  collaboration extensive expertise in molecular dynamics,  especially in the area of photo-chemically laser dissociated  molecules.  This is complemented by the French investigator's  expertise in VUV spectroscopy of diatomic and small polyatomic  molecules of astrophysical importance.     Carbon dioxide is an important atmospheric and interstellar  constituent. In the earth's atmosphere, it has a profound effect  on the thermal balance.  It is also the principal constituent of  the atmosphere of Mars and Venus.  This project will advance our  understanding of its optical properties and its photochemical  processes.  ***",
