This will be done by comparing water  stabilized plasma formed coatings with those manufactured by  conventional processes.  Specifically, the researchers intend to:  1) Manufacture coatings, net-shapes and composites at high  production rates via high production rate plasma spray  technology; 2) Optimize the processing technology of water  stabilized plasma torches using laser diagnostics; and 3)  Characterize the material structure and mechanical properties of  net-shapes and composites.  Overall, results are expected to  improve our understanding of fundamental plasma/particle  interactions and particle/substrate interactions.    This engineering project in thermal systems fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
