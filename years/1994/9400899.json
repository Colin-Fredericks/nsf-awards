 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400899  Spielberg       It is proposed to study C*-algebras obtained from boundary  actions of Fuchsian groups. These C*-algebras have interesting  relations with certain dynamical systems known as Smale spaces.  Smale spaces are a ubiquitous feature in dynamics. The relation  with Fuchsian groups arises from the hyperbolicity of the  dynamics, and promises to yield fine topological structure not  accessible by techniques of ergodic theory. It is also proposed  to continue the study of upper and lower spectral multiplicity in  the spectrum of a C*-algebra. These notions were introduced by  Archbold as tools to understand trace functionals on  C*-algebras,and to analyze the structure of liminal ideals.  Applications are invisioned to the study of C*-algebras of groups  and groupoids.       An operator is an infinite dimensional version of a matrix.  These operators can be added and multiplied in a natural way  and consequently collections of operators can be consider as an  algebra of operators. This project deals with operator  algebras that arise in an interesting way from dynamical systems.  The important branch of mathematics called dynamical systems  attempts to understand the repeated action of transformations.  The successful completion of this project will be to the  mutual benefit of the abstract theory of operator algebras and  the important applied area of dynamical systems.  ***",
