This meeting is especially designed to  bring together researchers in each of these research areas.  Topics  will include optical networks based on switching or on time-,  wavelength-, or code-division multiple access techniques;  architectures and protocols for optical networks, end-user  applications for optical networks, experimental results from  optical network testbeds or field trials, implications of optical  devices on network performance, optical switches and  switching  fabrics, optical amplifiers and amplifier-based photonic circuits,  tunable transmitters and receivers, transmitter and receiver  arrays; wavelength and high-speed multiplexing devices and  subsystems; and passive optical network components including  splitters and combiners.  ***",
