 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322220  Netzly  This award provides an additional five years of continuing support to the Department  of Biology at Hope College to carry on with the Research Experience for  Undergraduates Site that was established in 1987. Each summer, under the direction of  eleven Ph.D. faculty, the program will provide ten undergraduate students with an in-  depth summer experience focusing on environmental biology.  Objectives of the  program are to: 1) continue the active recruitment of under-represented groups into  the program, 2) provide an effective, learning community of junior and senior  researchers focusing on environmental biology at the community, organismal, and  cellular levels; and 3) train undergraduate students to become proficient in learning,  doing and communicating their research.  This research program will have an impact  on the student participants' understanding of science; impact the sciences as the  students present and publish their results to the scientific community; and have an  impact beyond the sciences: students will have a working knowledge of science and   will impact society whatever their eventual occupational choice.  ***",
