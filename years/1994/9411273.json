That is, while decades of public  opinion research indicate that the voters are ill-informed on  issues of public policy, the literature on Congress demonstrates  that legislative behavior accurately reflects the preferences of  their constituents.  It seems unlikely that congressmen would  behave as they do unless voters ultimately possessed information  to punish those legislators who were not responsive.  Why is it,  them, that researchers have consistently found evidence of  congressional responsiveness given the relatively low levels of  information in the electorate?  The Ph.D. student addresses this  question arguing that while the electorate may be generally  uninformed, there are a variety of sub-population which devote  considerable attention to a relatively narrow range of issues.   The student tests the hypothesis in two ways:  1) by relying on  survey data provided by the National Senate Election Study; 2)  through a content analysis of major newspapers.  This study  promises to substantially enhance our understanding of the topic.",
