 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an innovative approach to all-optical TDM  communications in multiprocessor systems.  The proposed approach is  an extension of a previously developed connection paradigm for  reducing control latency in reconfigurable optical interconnection  networks.  Using the proposed approach, a connection is established  during a set of tome slots along the path which are dependent on  each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required and  simple switching devices can be used.  As a result, the overall  communication latency as well as the complexity of the network can  be reduced.  Thus, a near term impact of this research is on the  design of high-performance, low-complexity optical interconnection  networks suitable for multiprocessor systems.  The research also  has long-term impact on the advancement of technologies such as  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Wavelength-Division  Multiplexing (WDM) as the emerging technologies for computer  communications.",
