 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex nature of problems associated with global environmental  change requires far more interdisciplinary research than  traditionally has occurred.  The development of interdisciplinary  collaborations requires scientists from different fields to become  familiar with the perspectives, experiences, and methods that each  employs.  This award supports three two-week sessions that will be  conducted by the Aspen Global Change Institute during July and  August 1994.  The sessions will bring together natural and social  scientists for in-depth discussions during which they will share  the results from their latest work, learn from each other, and  stimulate new ideas regarding central topics for global change  research.  The three sessions in 1994 will deal with issues that  have been identified as being of major importance to agencies  participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP).   Those topics are (1) radiation feedbacks and the credibility of  atmospheric models, (2) anticipating global change surprises, and  (3) biological invasion as a global change.  The results of the  sessions will be disseminated through a variety of media.  Summary  reports will be published in widely circulated major newsletters.   Session chairs will conduct a briefing for US/GCRP agency  officials, and more complete written reports of session proceedings  and conclusions will be made available in both written and  electronic forms.  Support for this project is provided by NSF on  behalf of other US/GCRP agencies, including the Environmental  Protection Agency.       Through support of these sessions, new insights will be gained  about critical issues in global change research.  Of potentially  greater importance will be opportunities for leading scientists to  become familiar with counterparts from other disciplines.   Experience has shown that from initial discussions like those that  occur in these sessions, effective interdisciplinary collaborations  needed to conduct global change resea rch often develop.",
