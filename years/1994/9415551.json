In spite of a high degree of conceptual unity, the  interdisciplinary relations between logic and computational  complexity have not been as yet the focal point of any scientific  meeting.  Instead, they have appeared as subareas in various  meetings on Structural Computational complexity, Logic in  Computer Science, Feasible Mathematics, Database Theory,  Programming Language Theory, Mathematical Logic, Proof Theory,  and Category Theory.  The absence of meetings has hampered the  area's development at the conceptual as well as the personal  levels.  Important connections between the various approaches  have rarely come to the surface, and people who have joined this  research community from different background have had only  fragmented and incomplete opportunities to meet and discuss their  common interests.  The proposed workshop would, for the first  time, bring together this research community, with the potential  of infusing even greater vigor into its research activity and its  practical as well as theoretical applications.  ***",
