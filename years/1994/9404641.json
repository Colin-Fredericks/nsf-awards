 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404641  O'Halloran       Feedback and equivalence are transformations of linear  systems of differential or difference equations which may be  viewed as algebraic group actions on varieties.  For a given  algebraic group action, two basic questions are classification (a  method for determining whether or not two elements are in the  same orbit) and orbit closure (a description of the elements in  the topological closure of an orbit). The main purpose of this  research is to solve the classification problem for the output  feedback action on the space of state space systems,  using  methods from algebraic geometry, algebraic geometry software, and  linear algebra.  For the action of the full feedback group on the  space of generalized state space systems, a classification has  been established; this project will solve the orbit closure  problem in this setting.       The principle behind many automated systems, from aircraft  control systems to thermostat regulated heating systems, is that  of control by feedback, in which current information about the  device and its environment is used as input in order to effect  necessary adjustments.  \"State feedback\" refers to the situation  in which full information is available; when only partial  information is available, adjustments are made based on \"output  feedback.\"  \"High gain feedback\" occurs when reiteration of  feedback causes an evolution of the system in which feedback  input is playing a progressively larger role.  This research  focuses on mathematical models of feedback control systems, in  which two major projects will be pursued.  The first is to  determine which mathematical models of control systems can be  obtained from a given one by applying output feedback, thus  reflecting the range of situations that could arise in a physical  system when output feedback is utilized.  The second project  addresses the identification of those mathematical models of  control systems which can be obtained from a given one when high  gain state feedb ack is applied.  ***",
