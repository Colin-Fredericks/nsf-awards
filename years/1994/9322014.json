 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322014  Salah    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will host eight  undergraduate students annually at its Haystack Observatory to  provide research experiences for undergraduates.  The Haystack  Observatory is a multi-disciplinary research center dedicated to  radio astronomical research using its 37-m diameter telescope and  to studies of the earth's upper atmosphere using its 46-m and 67-m  high power radars.  The students will be involved in the  acquisition of data using the instrumentation, analysis and  interpretation of the measurements, as well as development of  hardware and software to improve capabilities of the facility.   Astronomical studies involve the characterization of stellar and  quasar radio emission, starburst galaxies, and masters in our  galaxy.  Atmospheric studies will emphasize the effects of   geomagnetic storms on the structure and dynamics of the earth's  atmosphere and on spectral studies of periodic variations observed  in the upper atmosphere.  Technical projects include the digital  design of signal processing systems, tests of advanced recording  heads, and development of real-time control software.  The students  will work closely with a staff mentor throughout the summer, and  will prepare a report and presentation on their projects.  The  presentations will be given at national conferences, and  opportunities will be provided to continue some of the projects  during the academic year.  The students will be exposed to all  aspects of the research facility through seminars and  demonstrations at the various unique facilities, and will obtain a  thorough practical experience of scientific research at a facility  dedicated to research.      The Haystack Observatory has an excellent record of providing  research experiences to undergraduates.",
