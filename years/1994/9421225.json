 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT                                  HARVEY, Paul    The Starfire system is a state-of-the-art 1.5m adaptive  optics telescope with laser guide star correction.  This  means that for objects brighter than about 9 mag (visible)  it is possible to obtain essentially diffraction limited  imaging over a field of view of order 10-20 arcseconds at  near-infrared wavelengths.  For fainter objects, it is still  possible to obtain such imaging over short time periods, of  order 0.05-0.1 sec by using the laser guide star with no  optical \"tracking\" correction.  This capability opens up a  variety of astronomical problems for observational  breakthroughs.    The first scientific goal in this program is to obtain  images of pre-main-sequence stars to study the distribution  of circumstellar matter on solar-system size spatail scales.  The second goal is to search for brown-dwarf companions to  known, young T-Tauri type stars.  This project makes use of  the fact the T-Tauri stars have a relatively well defined  age, and thus any companions that are found were probably  formed nearly simultaneously.  The final goal of the program  is to determine the relative abundance of old giants and  young supergiants in several \"starburst\" galactic nuclei.  this will make it possible to estimate the ages of the  starbursts and hence their frequency, much more reliably.",
