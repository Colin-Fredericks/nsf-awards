 "awd_abstract_narration": "After floral induction, the first step in the development of  flowers is the generation of floral meristems.  At least  three genes, CAULIFLOWER, APETALA1, and LEAFY, are necessary  for the specification of floral meristem identity in  Arabidopsis.  This investigator has recently isolated the  CAULIFLOWER and APETALA1 genes.  This proposal describes a  combined genetic and molecular approach for determining how  CAULIFLOWER interacts with other genes to promote flowering.  The investigator proposes to isolate and characterize an  allelic series of cal mutants and analyze the resulting  phenotypes by scanning electron microscopy.  The  transcriptional regulation of CAULIFLOWER will be  investigated by determining the spatial and temporal pattern  of expression in a variety of mutant backgrounds.  Additional studies will determine if the CAULIFLOWER protein  interacts directly with APETALA1,  and will identify the DNA  sequences to which CAULIFLOWER specifically binds.  Further  studies will investigate the cis- and trans-acting factors  needed to promote floral meristem-specific expression of  CAL, and will determine the molecular basis for the  functional redundancy of CAL and AP1.  These studies will be  integrated into efforts to understand the role of APETALA1  and should lead to significant contributions towards  understanding the genetic and molecular control of floral  meristem specification.  The cauliflower phenotype in  Arabidopsis is strikingly similar to the anomalous  inflorescence structures produced in the dinner table  cauliflower, Brassica oleracea.  Since Arabidopsis and  Brassica are closely related plant species, and since the  phenotypes of these mutants is similar, the investigator  will use the cloned CAL and AP1 genes to investigate the  molecular basis of the cauliflower phenotype.  Finally,  since the cauliflower phenotype has been described in plants  that are distantly related to Arabidopsis, and since the  CAULIFLOWER gene has not been isolated from any other plant  s pecies, the characterization of this gene should yield  significant insights into its role in diverse plant systems.",
