 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354423  Lo  We are revising our introductory computer science curriculum to  incorporate principles of whole computer science.  Whole computer  science emphasizes cooperative learning and problem solving,  communication skills, critical thinking, and individual  resourcefulness, while relating computer science to other  disciplines and to everyday life.  Incorporation of techniques from  this highly successful pedagogy to college level curricula should  help to address the critical problems of recruitment and retention  of women as well as the training of computer science professionals  with strong teamwork and communication skills.  We believe this  approach to be particularly important for retention of women  students because of the many studies which have shown that women  are more successful in a cooperative setting rather that a highly  competitive, individual-oriented environment.  We are developing a basic set of whole computer science learning  modules.  Each module will include (1) a rich programming  assignment that encourages interaction, sharing, and re-use; (2) a  set of cooperative in-class exercises and homework assignments and  (3) a resource library which serves to create a microcosm of a real  work environment.  Communication skills will be taught through  essay assignments, project writeups, a classroom community  newsletter, and documents included in the resource library.  We  will develop grading techniques appropriate for the whole computer  science model.  Evaluation of our curriculum innovations will be conducted through  recruitment and retention statistics; courses questionnaires  designed to assess students's perception of the importance of  specific traits and skills for success in the course and in the  field of computer science; interviews/ discussions with a student  focus group; and feedback from faculty at other universities  involved in curriculum innovations and from industrial affiliates.   Our results will be disseminated through papers to be submitted to  c onferences and publications focused on computer science education.   Publication of a teacher's sourcebook, a videotape, and workshops  presentation are planned as part of a later grant proposal to NSF  UCCD.  ***y",
