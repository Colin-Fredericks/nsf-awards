 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research on organometallic radicals by  Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart of the Chemistry Department, Brown  University.  Ligand substitution reactions, metal dependence of  reactivity patterns, and rates of electron transfer reactions  will be investigated for electrochemically generated 17- or 19-  electron species.  In addition, catalytic ligand substitution and  electroactivation of hydrocarbons will be studied.  A second area  of investigation is metal-promoted synthetic routes to indoles,  diterpenes, and steroids.  Chiral metal complexes will be tested  as effective reagents in the preparation of optically pure  products.  High oxidation state species are expected in the  reaction of oxirenes with metals to form the first oxirene-metal  complexes.    Odd-electron organometallic compounds are reactive species  thought to play important roles in catalytic reactions.  Using  electrochemical methods, Sweigart can produce and characterize  these species directly and thus predict their reactivities.   Because the systems to be studied include both homogeneous and  heterogenous examples, the results will provide insight into  surface corrosion as well as solution reactions.  The  investigation of large hydrocarbon ring compounds is biologically  relevant and establishing controlled synthetic routes may prove  useful to many investigators.  The study will also extend the  electrochemical methods available for characterizing chemical  processes.",
