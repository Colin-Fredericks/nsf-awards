 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407979  McIntosh  Plants, unlike other organisms, possess two respiratory pathways:  the \"normal\" cytochrome pathway and an \"alternative pathway\".  This  is important because alternative pathway respiration does not  contribute to a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial  membrane and thus electrons that flow down this pathway do not  conserve energy.  All plants apparently contain an alternative  pathway of respiration, that may be induced in response to  developmental signals (such as increased carbohydrate status and  flowering) and many environmental stimuli (such as cold, wounding,  and endogenous salicylic acid concentrations).  Why should plants  have a more complex respiratory system than most other eukaryotes  and what is its funciton?  Although it is not possible to form a  complete answer now, alternative pathway respiration is most  probably involved in the regulation of energy/carbon balance in  plants in response to varying demands of development and the  environment.  A classic approach to dissect the importance and  function of any pathway is to study mutants in the pathway.  No  plant mutants have been isolated for alternative pathway  respiration, possibly because of its proposed regulatory functions.   The approach put forward in this research is to create plant lines  with altered amounts of cytochrome oxidase and alternative oxidase,  and to use these lines to elucidate the genetic, biochemical, and  biophysical regulation of respiratory energy balance in plants.   Tomato and potato plants will be used as experimental systems.    ***",
