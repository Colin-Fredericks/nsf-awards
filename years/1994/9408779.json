The focus of  this investigation is on the case where desorption results from  valence instead of core level electron excitation.  The motivation  for this study is to understand the nature of the interaction  between photons and the surface atoms and to explore the  possibility of using a laser beam to modify the silicon surface by  selectively desorbing certain types of adsorbed atoms.  High  resolution time-of-flight techniques will be used to measure the  kinetic energy of desorbed ions.  Doppler shifted laser-induced  fluorescence techniques will be used to study the relation between  desorbed neutral alkali metal atoms and their ions.    %  %  %  %    Laser light has been shown to be able to deposit very fine metal  lines on semiconductor wafers.  This phenomenon, which is usually  referred to as laser writing, has important applications in  semiconductor technology.  The current investigation will examine  the ability of a laser beam to modify silicon surfaces by  selectively removing certain types of atoms adsorbed on the silicon  surface.  The initial study will concentrate on the simplest and  yet technologically important alkali metal and hydrogen adatoms.  ***",
