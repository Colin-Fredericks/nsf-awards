 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320930  Mizruchi    This is a study of the extent to which large American  corporations engage in business transactions with the firms  represented on their boards of directors.  Drawing on the  resource dependence perspective, political sociology, and agency  theory, the study develops a model to predict the conditions  under which corporations do business with firms to which they  have directorate interlocks.  Taking advantage of a 1978  Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that mandated that  firms disclose business relations with the firms of their board  members, the model will be tested with data on the 500 largest  U.S. manufacturing corporations from 1981 (the first year for  which reliable business transaction data exist) through 1992.   Because the design is longitudinal, the study will permit the  examination of a series of questions that involve reciprocal  causation, including: (1) the effect of the presence of a lending  banker in a firm's board on the firm's access to subsequent  financing; (2) the extent to which such financing comes from the  board member's institution; (3) the extent to which lending banks  are appointed to a firm's board after a loan is made; and (4)  whether ties with lending banks are more likely than ties with  non-lending banks to be replaced when accidentally broken.  %%%  This study will contribute to economic sociology, political  sociology, and to the development and testing of general  sociological theories.  Its findings will be of significant value  for policy-makers concerned that directorate interlocks may lead  to poor investment decisions, or conversely that such social  relationships linking corporations can enhance productivity.   Thus, the information gained from this research will help improve  American economic efficiency and competitiveness.    ***",
