 "awd_abstract_narration": "Filaseta             This award funds the continued work of Professor  Michael Filaseta as he refines the new differencing techniques he  developed in joint work with Prof. Ognian Trifonov.  Prof.  Filaseta has several specific problems on which he will apply the  method.  These problems include questions about the distribution  of integer values of fairly general functions modulo one, and  questions about the gaps between squarefree numbers and gaps  between squarefull numbers.             This work is in the general field of analytic number  theory.  The field of analytic number theory applies the  techniques of calculus to the discrete realm of the whole  numbers.  Calculus was developed to aid the analysis of  continuous mathematical objects.  The idea of using continuous  methods to investigate discrete objects is two centuries old, but  with the work of the modern analytic number theorists, the field  has had a  new rebirth and led to a deeper understanding of the  whole numbers. ***",
