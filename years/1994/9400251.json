The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans and regions.    This work is a component of the collaborative biology program.  Information will be provided on the spatial optical variability along the  cruise track by measuring beam attenuation at 660 nm using a Sea Tech 25 cm pathlength transmissometer.  Spatial distribution of optical properties with respect to fronts, currents, and other biohydrographic features will be assessed.  These measurements will augment information derived from concurrent biological, chemical, and physical data collected during the cruise.  The work will provide an understanding of the role that suspended particles play in Arctic Ocean productivity and air-sea-ice interactions.  In addition, data will used to explain the role of nepheloid layers in lateral transport of shelf productivity to the slope and basin and in benthic fluxes.  ***",
