 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416265  Chopra  The objectives of this project are to \"measure\" two  important properties--fundamental vibration period and modal  damping ratios-of some forty buildings from their recorded  motions during the Northridge earthquake and other recent  earthquakes.  These buildings, shaken strongly by ground  motions with peak accelerations between 0.15g and 0.82g,  would provide information directly relevant to earthquake  resistant design of buildings in contrast to much of the  existing data which are for smaller amplitudes of motion.    The vibration properties will be identified from the  recorded motions of the buildings using system  identification procedures. These results from the Northridge  earthquake and other recent earthquakes, combined with  similar data available from the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake, will create the most comprehensive database  which can be easily updated after every major earthquake.    This database will be used to evaluate and improve:  (1)  code formulas for estimating the fundamental vibration  period used in calculating the design base shear and lateral  forces; and (2) current recommendations for damping values  used in dynamic analysis.  The period formulas in the 1994  UBC and the 1990 SEAOC \"blue book\" were developed in 1975 as  part of the ATC-3 project, based largely on motions of  buildings recorded during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.  Similarly, the damping values used widely were originally  recommended by Newmark and Hall in 1978.    This project will culminate in:  (1) formulas for estimating  the fundamental vibration period of buildings using  different materials--steel, R/C, masonry etc.--and various  structural systems--moment resisting frames, shear walls  etc.; and (2) recommendations for modal damping ratios for  different categories of buildings, depending on response  amplitude and, if appropriate, on mode number.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
