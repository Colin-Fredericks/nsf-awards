 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412302  STAEHELI       This research project will examine the ways that political  activism has been affected by the increase in flexible employment  that has accompanied economic restructuring in the United States.  The initial premise is that flexible employment (i.e., part-time  work, off-shift work, temporary contracts, self-employment, and  work undertaken at one's home) and the concomitant changes in  wage levels, job security, and time availability lead to re-  evaluations of the potential for political activism.  The  household and the broad range of financial and interpersonal  resources it encompasses is the context in which decisions about  activism are made.  The local political structure and perceptions  about the local political structure are crucial intervening  factors that also affect decisions regarding political activism.  Trends in employment and activism therefore will be examined in  four different cities using a two-stage research strategy.  The  first stage will involve the construction of narratives that set  the structural context of economic restructuring.  The second  stage will involve extensive telephone surveys in which household  members reconstruct their employment and political histories.  This stage also will involve intensive in-person interviews with  political activists.  The telephone surveys will provide baseline  information regarding the nature of employment restructuring,  political activities, and household adjustment strategies, while  the intensive interviews will focus on the ways that work,  politics, household, and local context are interconnected.       Political activism is a crucial element for maintaining and  strengthening democratic institutions.  This research project  will add to theories related to restructuring, the state, and  citizenship, and it will provide valuable new insights about the  ways that economic change affects the form and character of local  democracy.  The results of the study therefore will have  significant theoretic al and practical implications for  understanding and improving democratization processes.",
