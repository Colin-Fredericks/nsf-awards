 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318002  Garbini  A recent series of articles by Joe Garbini, John Sidles, and  Gary Drobny of the University of Washington has described a  new method for imaging individual molecules.  The proposed  imaging technology is based on a variation of the Stern-  Gerlach experiment, in which the linear particle  trajectories of the classic Stern-Gerlach experiment are  replaced by the \"folded\" trajectory of a micrometer-scale  mechanical oscillator.    In theory, this new approach to magnetic resonance imaging  combines the single-particle sensitivity of the Stern-  Gerlach experiment, the nondestructive 3D imaging capability  of magnetic resonance, and the subAngstrom spatial  resolution of scanning probe techniques.  It might therefore  serve as the basis of a technology for imaging biomolecular  structure.    More recently, Dan Rugar and Nino Yannoni of IBM Almaden  Laboratories have reported the first experimental detection  of magnetic resonance by force microscope means.  It  is  noteworthy that this first experiment achieved a room-  temperature sensitivity comparable to the best available  room-temperature inductive coils.    The broad objective of the proposed research is to develop  practical instruments for imaging individual biological  molecules in situ.  This imaging technology would be  nondestructive, fully three-dimensional, and would achieve  subAngstrom spatial resolution.    Published theoretical work indicates that successful  molecular imaging will require a force sensitivity of  approximately 10-19 N/Hz.  In comparison, the room-  temperature cantilever in the UW/IBM experiment  experimentally demonstrated a sensitivity of 10-15 N/Hz.  One goal of the proposed research is to attain a sensitivity  of 10-17N/Hz suing commercially available cantilevers.  On a  logarithmic scale, this represents progress half-way toward  the overall goal of developing a practical molecular imaging  technology.  As discussed in the body of this proposal, it  is reasonable to expect substantial impro vements in  sensitivity from:    (1) operating a t cryogenic temperatures (3-10K), instead of  room temperature,  (2) operating in a high vacuum, as opposed to a millitorr  vacuum,  (3) removing the gold metallic coating from the cantilever,  (4) baking surface contaminants off the cantilever,  (5) annealing the cantilever material to reduce dislocation  density.    A primary focus of our research is to do these experiments,  which will serve to establish a reliable and experimentally  validated understanding of noise mechanical oscillators.  This applied knowledge base will serve as the necessary  foundation for developing a practical biomolecular imaging  technology.    A more fundamental objective of our program is to establish  a reliable and experimentally validated understanding o  noise mechanisms in microscale mechanical oscillators.  This  applied knowledge base will serve as the necessary  foundation for developing a practical biomolecular imaging  technology.    There reasonable scientific grounds to expect that the next  generation o molecular biologist will routinely, quickly,  and easily obtain images showing the full three-dimensional  structure of the molecules they are studying, in situ, with  all their ligands, cross-links, and glycosylation in place.  This structural imaging capability, if it can be achieved,  will complement and enhance the value of existing  instruments for the rapid sequencing of genes and proteins,  by providing a structural context for interpretation of  sequence information.  Our hope is that this will  substantially accelerate the development of effective  treatments for presently intractable disorders.",
