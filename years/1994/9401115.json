It is a study of policy experts,  political intellectuals, and political change in the United  States, 1935-1950, assessing the roles that experts and  intellectuals played in mediating different policy outcomes.   This will be accomplished through four case studies: 1) Social  Security, 2) labor law reform, 3) national health policy, and 4)  employment policy.  Analysis will compare the context of policy  debates and political culture in each of these domains, assessing  the extent to which expert reformers and their allies among  political intellectuals dominated debates in policy arenas.  %%%       This research will contribute to political sociology,  evaluating the relative success of theories based on state-  centered institutional approaches compared with those based on  class-centered approaches.  In addition to the scientific gains  to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist  a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next  generation of social scientists.    ***",
