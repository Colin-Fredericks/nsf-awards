The  research supported here will concentrate on the detailed  mechanisms and kinetics of hydrocarbon reactions on transition  metal surfaces.  These kinetic studies will be carried out  using a technique developed by Professor Hemminger known as  laser induced thermal desorption Fourier transform mass  spectrometry (LITD/FTMS).  The goal of this work is to apply  this LITD/FTMS method to the study of the effect of adsorbate  ensemble configurations on reaction rates, and to identify and  quantify the effects of hydrogen coadsorption on the mechanisms  and kinetics of hydrocarbon reactions.  Additional work will  address the kinetics of organometallic adsorbate decomposition  on transition metal surfaces as a possible route to the  synthesis of reactive intermediates on these surfaces.  %%%  An understanding of the detailed mechanisms and kinetics of  hydrocarbon reactions on well characterized tranisition metal  surfaces is important for developing an understanding of  heterogeneous catalysis. The research supported in this project  will provide the mechanistic and kinetic details needed to help  understand issues of reactivity and selectivity in catalytic  systems.  A very sensitive instrumental technique, laser  induced thermal desorption coupled with Fourier transform mass  spectrometry, will be used to obtain this basic information.  An understanding of these transition metal catalyzed reactions  will help to design more energy efficient and more  environmentally sensitive process chemistry.  ***",
