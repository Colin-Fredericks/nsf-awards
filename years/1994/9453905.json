The center's mission is to develop and  conduct coordinated school-based and external strategies that  result in the academic preparation of urban minority students to  enter undergraduate studies in the sciences, mathematics and  engineering.  During the last 4 years, the implementation of CRCM  activities at the middle and high school levels has provided  opportunities for involving students in formal and informal science  and mathematics enrichment, inquiry based learning experiences,  career orientation, and scientific research activities.  The high  school research program has resulted in dramatic increases in  student interest and participation in competitive science and  mathematics programs.  This includes historic participation of St.  Louis minority students in local, regional, state and national  science competitions.    In 1992, 120 students exited the St. Louis CRCM pipeline, as high  school graduates.  A recent survey of that group indicates that 85  students are in some level of post-secondary education; 62 students  are currently majoring in mathematics, a science or engineering  related area 55 students are pursuing B.S. degrees in the hard  sciences, mathematics or engineering.  These results and the  growing participation of the community strongly suggest that such  efforts are needed and can be an effective means to increase the  pool of qualified minority students for SME careers.",
