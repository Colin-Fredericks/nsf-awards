 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450007  Rodger    This model project seeks to attract and retain women in the computer science pipeline through  a variety of activities targeted at students from high school through graduate school.  High  school teachers and faculty from Rensselaer are to be involved.  There are plans to connect 20  local high schools to the University by providing computer accounts at Rensselaer for the high  school teachers and females students at these schools, with access via modems or networks.  The  female undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty in the computer science  department, will participate in electronic discussions and activities with the high schools.   Women at different stages in the pipeline will serve as mentors and/or mentees, receiving  knowledge from those further along, and passing it to those below.  In addition to the electronic  network, activities for the high schools include talks by female computer science professors and  female graduate students about their research and their field, three workshops for professors  from the University and high school teachers to plan activities, and a two-week summer  program.  Additional activities for female undergraduates and graduate students include transition  programs, formal seminars by distinguished female computer scientists, informal meetings for  discussion of issues, and a 10-week summer research program for undergraduates.    Women are underrepresented in the field of computer science, particularly at the highest levels.  The goal of the proposed work is to attract high school women to computer science, and to  retain interested women in the computer science pipeline from high school through graduate  programs.  Dissemination plans include sharing key components of the effort with the chairs of  computer science departments at universities within the U.S. to enable them to replicate  applicable aspects.  ***",
