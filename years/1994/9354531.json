This is  compounded by poor college preparation, bad study habits,  inadequate writing skills, limited economic resources, and great  variability in concept comprehension. Teaching such students  requires that the material be presented in an engaging fashion that  allows immediate grasp of principles regardless of the students'  background. This project aims to achieve these objectives and to  increase student retention and interest in scientific careers by  integrating computer visualization and simulation into a core of  introductory science courses: a new interdisciplinary course in  physical science and biology (Introduction to Environmental  Science), 3 introductory chemistry courses, and 2 introductory  geology courses. Customized courseware developed in the  NEXTSTEP-486 programming environment will utilize equipment  purchased with a recently awarded NSF-ILI (Instrumentation and  Laboratory Improvement) grant to one of the principal  investigators. These applications together with courseware that has  already been developed by the PIs will be used to illustrate  abstract concepts and model complex natural phenomena. Students  will explore the effect of changing parameters on a variety of such  systems. Pre-lab computer simulations will familiarize students  with equipment and laboratory protocols before performing  experiments thereby instilling confidence and facilitating  exploration and \"discovery\". Powerful multimedia capabilities will  be utilized to the fullest by incorporating sound, full color high  resolution images and video into the applications. Students will  use the Internet to access scientific data from public archives and  bulletin boards and communicate with peers at other campuses thus  providing a sense of connection to the  broader scientific  community. The proposed curricular improvements will raise  retention rates, attract more students to scientific careers, and  increase overall scientific literacy among students from  populations grossly underrepresented among professional scientists.",
