 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416775  Kassner    This is a high-risk, small grant for exploratory research (SGER) to  perform in-situ fatigue experiments in the transmission electron  microscope.  The classic metal-fatigue phenomenon is poorly  understood, partially because the dislocation dynamics of reversed  deformation has not been characterized.  Only limited success has  been achieved with direct observation of dislocations during cyclic  deformation, such as observed in in-situ cyclic or reversed plastic  deformation tests in the transmission electron microscope.  The  problem is associated with buckling of thin foils when the applied  tensile or shear stress is reversed.  Analysis shows that  dislocation movement can be reversed by tensile stressing in  alternating perpendicular directions, and buckling of the foil can  be avoided.  A new specimen holder has been designed by the  principal investigator for performing such mechanical tests in-situ  in the transmission electron microscope.  A series of in-situ  reversed deformation fatigue tests will be run and should provide  new insights into reversed deformation phenomena.    %%%  Fatigue of metal alloys can lead to unanticipated failure of metal  alloy components used in industrial machinery, transportation  systems, and related infrastructure areas.  This research should  provide improved understanding in this field.  ***",
