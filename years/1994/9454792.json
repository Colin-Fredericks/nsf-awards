 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454792  Watson    The Vermont Institute for Science, Math and Technology requests $99,000 in support of this  proposal to create a statewide Alliance of technology-related, education and business groups  which will plan a sustainable telecommunications network for rural educational and community  use, as a key component of Vermont's systemic reform activities. The plan, when implemented,  will boost Vermont's active educational restructuring with innovative technologies available to,  and useable by, teachers, students, and community members.    There is a great deal of work going on in Vermont in telecommunications, but it is not  coordinated toward a single goal and it is not directed toward systemic reform of education.  However, educational reform can be greatly facilitated by telecommunications advances both in  its scope and tempo. True reform looks at new methods. not just revisions of past ideas, and  requires participation from many diverse groups that make up our broad societal system of  education. This project provides fertile ground for the necessary collaborations to funnel energy  and innovation toward creation of a strong statewide Alliance that will link schools and  communities.",
