 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central  nervous system and its various actions are mediated by  several dopamine receptor subtypes.  One of these subtypes,  designated as the D3 receptor, is expressed in  phylogenetically older regions of the brain, including the  limbic system.  This suggest that D3 receptors play a role  in cognition and in the expression of emotive behavioural  phenotypes.  However, conventional animal studies on the  particular function of D3 receptors proved to be difficult  because of the high homology and the similar pharmacological  characteristics of this receptor subtype with other brain  dopamine receptors.  To circumvent these difficulties, this  proposal lays the groundwork for studies on the specific  function of D3 receptors in the whole animal by generating  mutant mice that lack functional D3 receptors.  This will be  achieved by introducing a mutant (non-functional) D3 gene  into embryonic stem (ES) cells of mice.  Such ES cells are  then used to generate chimeric mice that have the ability to  transmit the mutant D3 gene to their offspring.  Mutant  offspring will have a decreased (heterozygous mutants)  expression of the D3-receptor protein and such mice can be  interbred to generate homozygous mutant mice in which the D3  receptor expression is abolished.  Initial studies on such  mutant animals aim at testing whether a decreased or  abolished D3-receptor protein expression affects the  development of brain regions in which D3 receptors are  normally expressed.  At present, nothing is known about the  importance of D3 receptor expression for the normal  development of the brain.  Thus, comparative anatomical  studies of such brain sections obtained at defined  developmental stages from mutant and normal (wildtype) mice  are proposed.  Furthermore, because of the significant  anatomical overlap in the expression of D3 receptors and  another (very similar) dopamine receptor subtype (named D2),  and the potential functional complementarity bet ween these  two receptor subtypes, one might expect changes in the  expression of D2 receptors to occur in response to a  decreased or abolished expression of D3 receptors.  Such  changes could mask the functional consequences of a \"loss of  D3 receptor expression\" in our mutant animals.  Therefore,  experiments are proposed that will test whether the  expression of D2 receptors differs in wildtype and D3-  receptor-mutant animals.  The work proposed here will  provide a powerful mouse model for future studies on the  importance of D3 receptor expression for the expression of  certain behavioural phenotypes.",
