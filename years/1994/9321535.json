 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321535  COLLIER    Differences in nitrogen nutrition might affect the distribution of  phyoplankters because each nitrogen source has different patterns  of availability. Ammonium, which is the preferred nitrogen source  of most phytoplankton, is often not available in sufficient  quantities to support phytoplankton growth. Therefore urea and  nitrate are important nitrogen sources for the phytoplankton.  Because urea like ammonium is produced within the plankton, while  nitrate is supplied from deeper water, the relative availability of  the various nitrogen sources changes both in space and in time.    Marine cyanobacteria currently in culture are able to grow with  ammonium or nitrate as sole nitrogen source, but only about half of  them are able to utilize urea. This suggest that urea may affect  the growth rate and distribution of marine cyanobacteria. This  project, will develop molecular probes to cyanobacterial ureases  which will then be used in field studies to examine the  relationships between cyanobacterial urease utilization and basic  oceanographic parameter. Molecular probes will be used because it  is unlikely that any other techniques can provide the sensitivity  and resolution required to understand these relationships.  ***",
