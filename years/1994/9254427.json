This pilot project will develop  and test an implementation strategy for bring hands-on inquiry  based science to all of the elementary schools of city.  The  leadership training will begin with a three week summer program  for two years at UCSD.  During the year, selected teachers from  past leadership academies will support the newly trained teachers  as they introduce their own students to the new hands-on units.  Once they are comfortable with the new content and instructional  strategies needed for the new units the leadership teachers will  provide support for their colleagues as they begin to teach the  newly adopted instructional programs.    The cost sharing will be thirty-two percent of the National  Science Foundation Award.  ***",
