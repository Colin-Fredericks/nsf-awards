 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knudson:  This award to the College of William and Mary will restore and modernize  approximately 630 square feet of research space for the Department of Chemistry.  The  renovation activity is necessary to adequately support current research and research training  activities at the College.  When Rogers Hall was built nineteen years ago, Chemistry graduated  a total of 20 majors; in 1992 the number of graduates more than doubled to 51.  During that  timeframe the percentage (80%) of students involved in research projects, and earning American  Chemical Society certification on their degrees, remained constant thus substantially taxing the  existing facilities.  The NSF award will support a year-long effort to modernize the research  facilities into wet laboratory space and will, in addition, correct substantial inadequacies in the  HVAC system serving all Chemistry research space.",
