 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319798  ATRAN    This research will explore how people categorize animals and  plants and reason about them.  The focus is on how the structure  of categories, such as the set of taxonomic relations that hold  between DEER and MAMMAL or OAK and TREE, constrain inferences  about the distribution of biological properties among the  categories.  For example, when people discover that both deer and  cows have multi-chambered stomachs or hoof-and-mouth disease, to  what extent do people then predict that other animals also have  multi-chambered stomachs or hoof-and-mouth disease?  More  generally, to what extent does this categorical structure  constrain inferences that causally relate biological taxa to one  another, and to what extent are culturally-specific belief  systems, or \"theories,\" able to modify that structure and hence  change the nature of biological reasoning?  These interrelated  issues of category formation and induction are central to a  broader understanding of conceptual development both in everyday  thinking and in science.    This research will compare biological categorization and  reasoning among groups of American folk and Itza, the last Maya  native to Guatemala's rainforest.  This comparison also will  involve looking into the influences of science on American  folkbiology as well as the effects of cultural expertise on Itza  folkbiology.  In particular, the studies will address three  questions:  1) To what extent is there a universal folkbiological  taxonomy?  2) How is this taxonomy used in reasoning?  3) Where,  and how, do differences in theories and cultural belief systems  affect folkbiological categorization and reasoning?  The project  will build on previous fieldwork and laboratory studies, bringing  together recent theoretical and methodological innovations in  anthropology and psychology to promote an interdisciplinary  cognitive science.  It will provide a way to measure levels of  consensus in categorization and reasoning among individuals  within cultures, be tween cultures, and between the folktaxonomies  of different cultures and scientific taxonomies.  Biological  inventories of local flora and fauna provide crucial comparative  data.  The work will employ multidisciplinary techniques across  cultures to analyze theoretically the relationship between  category formation and category-based reasoning for a cognitive  domain, biology, which is at the center of human knowledge and  understanding of the natural world.  Although this project is  specifically designed to address issues in basic cognition, tasks  involving categorization of living kinds and reasoning about  biological properties and diseases can inform our broader  understanding of environment, health, and science education.    ***",
