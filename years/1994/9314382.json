 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314382  Staffeldt       The story can be traced back to the fundamental work of  Riemann, Klein, and Betti at the turn of this century, on  the classification of surfaces and their higher dimensional  analogues, called manifolds.  Loosely peaking, they showed  that for each surface there is a geometrically defined  natural number called its genus, that characterizes the  surface up to certain transformations, i.e. two surfaces  with the same genus are indistinguishable.  Moreover, given  any natural number there is a model surface with that genus  (to visualize a surface of genus g, imagine the surface of a  coffee cup with g- 1 extra handles).       A manifold of dimension n is a geometric object that  looks locally like n dimensional space, in the same way that  a surface looks in a small enough region, like a plane.  Albert Einstein's relativity theory, with its emphasis on  the four dimensional manifold of space-time, convinced the  scientific world of the necessity to come to terms with  manifolds of dimension greater than two.  Mathematicians in  the fields of algebraic and differential topology,  differential geometry, among others, and physicists have  devoted considerable effort in this century to developing  classification schemes for manifolds of dimension three and  higher.     Although a great deal is known, no such schemes have been  established that successfully classify manifolds of  dimension three.  Amazingly, in the 1960s a multistage  classification scheme was developed for manifolds of  dimension five and greater.  The methods used to establish  that scheme simply don't apply in the lower dimensions.       In the early 1980s Michael Freedman proved results that  led to the classification of a large natural family of four  dimensional manifolds, the simply-connected ones, up to  topological type, the coarsest classification that had been  sought.  Part of his work was devoted to constructing many  manifolds not previously know to exist.  Soon after Freedman  produced his top ological classification theorem, Simon  Donaldson used techniques of gauge theory, the subject of  the conference, to shed light on a finer classification of  four dimensional manifolds: the classification up to smooth  equivalence, or up to diffeomorphism.  Donaldson's main idea  is to study the finer structure on simply connected smooth  four manifolds by analyzing the geometry of spaces of  auxiliary structures that can be associated with simply  connected smooth manifolds.  His first result was that  hardly any of Freedman's new manifolds could be smooth, the  main reason why it was so hard to find them.  Later work has  produced a host of new variants for distinguishing smooth  manifolds within a given coarse, topological, Freedman type.       The conference will review the properties of gauge  theory which are crucial for understanding the geometry of  the spaces of auxiliary structure and will clarify the  connections.  Then the speaker will turn to a situation  which has the same formal properties of gauge theory a la  Donaldson, but whose analysis is incomplete and for which  several avenues for further research seem to be open.",
