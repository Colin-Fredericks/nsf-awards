 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353978  Smardon  The Great Lakes Research Consortium proposes to immerse 20  undergraduate faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that  demonstrates environmental problem-solving as an effective  teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in  environmental science. This model has proven to be effective  during a summer practicum for undergraduate environmental  science teachers of two and four year colleges who, as a result  of the practicum, successfully incorporated environmental  problem solving curriculum into their courses.   Undergraduate  faculty participants learn environmental analysis techniques  and prepare environmental impact statements for a hypothetical  development project in a contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario.  As they are being exposed to new innovative theoretical  concepts and techniques developed by the Great Lakes research  community to understand and solve environmental problems,  participants will integrate environmental problem-solving into  curricula at their home institutions. Special topics, based on  the Great Lakes experience, will include the theories and  applications of cascading trophic interactions and  particle-size spectra in community ecology; analytical methods  for determining toxic chemical concentrations in sediments and  fishes; and the use of microcomputers for mass balance and  bioenergetics modeling of large lake systems. Through  preparation of environmental impact statements for a realistic  project, these techniques will be integrated into the overall  environmental analysis and problem-solving approach.  Participants in the practicum will return to their home  institutions with expanded and updated professional skills and  new strategies, methods and techniques for improving  undergraduate education and addressing environmental problems  in local communities.  ***",
