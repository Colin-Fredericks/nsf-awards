 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452338  Pifer  Until recently our physics major program was narrowly directed at  preparing a small number of elite students for graduate studies.  The current employment situation has made it clear to us that we  can no longer take the narrow view that graduate school is the only  reasonable career goal for a scientifically able student, and in  fact, there are many technically able students who would like to  major in physics yet are not interested in graduate school. Many of  these students are minorities or women. In response to these  students' career interests, we have recently introduced an Applied  Physics Major. The Applied option emphasizes a breadth of technical  experience with an emphasis on experimental skills, and is intended  for students who plan to seek industrial jobs immediately after  graduation. The centerpiece of the option is a 3-credit, junior-  level applied physics lab course. This lab currently uses  experiments from our modern physics lab that are designed for  students headed toward graduate school. We are requesting funds to  introduce five applied-type experiments that are built around the  needs of these students and involve modern instrumentation and  experimental techniques of the type that students will encounter in  industry. We are initially concentrating on two areas -- the  scanning tunneling microscope and modern optics. The experiments to  be introduced are the scanning tunneling microscope, the He-Ne  laser, saturated absorption spectroscopy, holography, and the dye  laser.",
