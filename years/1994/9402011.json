 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402011  Park    Early researchers suggested that bathypelagic copepods have   extremely widespread distributions, which was generally attributed  to the relatively stable physical environment at bathypelagic  depths. However, recent research by Park found that species  of the bathypelagic copepod genus, Paraeuchaeta display highly  variable ranges of geographic distribution. The geographic patterns  displayed by the species seemed to reflect their food requirement  and the availability of food in their habitats. The dominant  species in the eutrophic waters were found to be endemics and the  rare species generally had wider ranges of distribution. This  project will study additional calanoid taxa inhabiting different  depth ranges to see how the geographic patterns of calanoids vary  with depth and whether the geographic patterns of the meso- and  epipelagic calanoids are similar to those of Paraeuchaeta.  The  meso- and epipelagic carnivorous copepod genera, Heterorhabdus and  Euchaeta were selected for the study so that carnivorous taxa from  three different depth zones can be compared. Samples to be used for  the study will be those collected from many different parts of the  world's oceans and presently available mainly at Scripps  Institution of Oceanography.  Additional samples will be obtained,  particularly for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, from several other  institutions. This study will follow the same procedures as  employed in the study of Paraeuchaeta, asking the same questions:  1) How many species are there in each taxon selected?  2) How  abundant is each species?  3) How widely distributed is each  species?  4)  How are the species related morphologically or  distributionally to one another?  By answering these questions, the  study will accomplish two major objectives:  1) to clarify the  taxonomy of the selected taxa by defining each species with  adequate diagnoses, and 2) to define the biogeography of epi- and  mesopelagic carnivorous genera based on established taxonomy  and  quantitative distribution data. The findings of this study,  together with those already obtained with the bathypelagic  Paraeuchaeta, are expected to help understand the global  biogeography of carnivorous calanoids.  ***",
