 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nancy E. Levinger is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from   the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform   experimental studies of polar solvation and chemical reactions at the   interface between immiscible liquids.  She will use surface second   harmonic generation (SSHG)  to perform initial studies on coumarin 153, a   classic probe of solvation dynamics, at the liquid/liquid interface.    SSHG is an ideal technique for studying interfacial chemistry because the   signals arise solely from the interface without interference from the   bulk medium.  Information regarding molecular rotational reorientation   and electron transfer reactions at interfaces can be examined by this   method.  A variety of liquid/liquid interfaces will be probed including   the octanol/water interface which is an important model system for drug   modeling of membrane solubility.  Electron transfer and isomerization   reactions will be studied at the liquid/liquid interface in a variety of   immiscible liquid solvent systems including real membrane bound   biologically important proteins.    A wide range of chemistry occurs at interfacial boundaries.  Examples   range from biological and medicinal interfacial problems, such as   chemistry of anesthesia, to industrial scale separations of metal ores   across interfaces, to the relatively new investigations into self   assembled monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films for nanoelectronics and   nonlinear optical materials.  These problems are based not only on   structure and composition of the interface but also on kinetic processes   that occur at interfaces.  As such, there is considerable interest in   chemical dynamics at interfaces.  Levinger has developed a tool to   directly probe the chemical dynamics occurring at such interfaces, and   will apply this technique to a variety of important and technologically   relevant problems.",
