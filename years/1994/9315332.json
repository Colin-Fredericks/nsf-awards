The two principal  Japanese co-investigators in that laboratory  are Chikahiro Minowa and Nobuyuki Ogawa.  The  joint research will first investigate and  clarify the lateral soil-reaction responses of  piles through experimental efforts involving  (a) model pile-section tests conducted in the  United States and (b) shaking-table tests  conducted in Japan.  The objective of the  research is to develop a new methodology for  evaluating the seismic performance of pile  foundations in potentially liquefiable soil  deposits.    Pile foundations have experienced damage and  failure during major historical earthquakes,  due mainly to the failure of foundation soils  caused by liquefaction.  A number of studies  have been conducted in recent years on the  dynamic behavior of isolated piles and of  groups of piles, to increase our understanding  of dynamic soil-pile interaction.  The state of  the art in this field, however, has not  advanced to a point where we can predict the  performance of piles when foundation soils  undergo liquefaction during an earthquake.   This joint research project will provide an  improved insight into lateral soil-pile  interactions in liquefying saturated sands, and  with a basis for developing rational seismic  design guidelines for pile foundations in  potentially liquefiable soil deposits.  ***",
