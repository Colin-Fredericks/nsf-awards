 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320003  Dean    This grant will provide support to allow scholars from outside  the United States to participate in the 1994 \"International  Conference on Tree Rings, Environment, and Humanity:  Relationships and Processes.\" In particular, effort will focus on  assisting researchers from the third world and Eastern Europe.  Without NSF support, such individuals could not attend.     In temperate regions of the world, trees add rings annually and  differences in the thickness and chemical composition of the  rings are determined by local environmental factors. Resultant  series from mature trees may cover hundreds of years and provide  excellent information on environmental change. Tree rings also  serve a valuable dating function since rings from archaeological  sites can be matched to master sequences. Tree ring research is  conducted in many parts of the world and the results are of value  to a wide range of scientists. For these reasons, international  conferences which bring together diverse groups of scientists are  extremely important and the 1994 meeting will serve this  function.    The amount of dendrochronological research in the developing  world has increased significantly in recent years. Therefore it  is particularly important to have representation from scholars in  these regions.  ***",
