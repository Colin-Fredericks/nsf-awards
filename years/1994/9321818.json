The student will            study how forced resettlement of a rural population (due to the            construction of a major water control project) in India has            affected their medical beliefs and practices.  The design            includes a comparison village which has not been relocated, and            one which has.  Using structured interviews, participant            observation, and several techniques of cognitive anthropology to            elicit medical belief models, the student will explore the            unintended consequences of forced relocation.             This research is important because of the frequency in the            developing world of forced relocation, due to development            projects such as this project studies.  The consequence of such            relocation on the health of the impacted peoples is usually            harmful, yet we have no understanding of how the impacted            people's understanding of health issues changes in response to            the many changes in their living situations.  In depth case            studies such as this one can help planners understand community            reactions to relocation, and help design programs to minimize            harmful effects.             ***",
