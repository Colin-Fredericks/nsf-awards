 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409297  Reitze  A three year project is proposed to experimentally and theoretically investigate the applicability of using phase and amplitude, tailored, ultrafast(<10 ps) optical and electrical fields to selectively manipulate electronic states in engineering semiconductor heterostructures.  Precise control of electronic and optoelectronic devices, including terahertz sources, and terahertz speed modulators and electronic switches. Directing the evolution of electron and hole distributions in these systems requires synthesis of the appropriate fields to interact coherently with the electronic wavepacket over time periods longer than characteristic dephasing times.  One of the key issues which must be addressed is the extent to which dephasing via phonon and other scattering mechanisms limits the time period in which the wavepacket coherence can be maintained.  In order to carry out these challenges, An innovative approach is proposed which uses ultrafast shaped optical and electrical waveforms to manipulate electronic states in an asymmetric coupled quantum well structure.  Initial efforts will first be directed at generating and characterizing  tailored electrical pulses by combining well established stripline propagation techniques with femtosecond and picosecond pulse shaping.  Later in the project, the methods of quantum optimal control theory will be applied to guide the design of fields which minimize the influence of dephasing effects and maximize wavepacket coherence.  The proposed research will identify the potential physical controlling mechanisms, determine the extent to which dissipation can be controlled and minimized, and asses the feasibility of applying optimal control methods to these systems.  ***",
