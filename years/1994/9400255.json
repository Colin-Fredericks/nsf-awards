The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans and regions.    This work is a component of the collaborative paleoceanographic program.  Work will involve research on ostracodes contained in sediment samples to be collected during the Section as well as from existing surface sediments collected by the Geological Survey of Canada, from several other Arctic Ocean sites, including the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago.  Ostracodes are small calcareous bivalved crustaceans, and some benthic marine ostracodes are attuned, within narrow limits, to several environmental variables, the most important of which are temperature, salinity, dissolved O2, nutrients, and substrate.  Their distribution on the sea floor therefore reflects bottom water conditions, making ostracodes ideal monitors of water mass changes and circulation anomalies through geological time.  Previous investigations have suggested that ostracodes are useful for paleoceanographic reconstructions of water-mass history.  This work will provide a better understanding of the relationship between modern ostracodes, water masses, and Arctic bathymetry; of  the relationship between intermediate depth and deep water ostracodes and Atlantic and Pacific faunas, and of faunal history and inferred ocean history during the Holocene, the Last Glaciation, and possibly the whole of the Brunhes Epoch.",
