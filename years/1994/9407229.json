 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard  9407229   Achieving an understanding of the evolution and the nature of reproductive isolation (lack of successful interbreeding between closely related species) is a fundamental goal of biologists.  The goal has been elusive, reflecting the difficulty of identifying and characterizing the trait(s) responsible for the onset of reproductive isolation.  Only long term studies focusing on closely related species that have been well characterized ecologically and evolutionarily are likely to provide important new insights.  A large amount of previous work on the ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius indicates that these sister species are reproductively isolated by a barrier to fertilization that operates after mating.  Although described for the first time only recently, this type of reproductive barrier has begun to attract a great deal of attention from biologists as an increasing number of studies indicate that many closely related terrestrial animals are isolated in such a way.  In the work proposed here, the barrier to fertilization  between A. fasciatus and A. socius will be further characterized by studying patterns of mating in both species, the strength of the barrier to fertilization, and the genetic basis of the barrier.  The  results of these studies will be used to construct computer simulation models of the reproductive isolating potential of a post-mating barrier to fertilization.  A laboratory test to the isolating potential of the fertilization barrier will provide an important check on the computer simulation results.   The work described in this proposal explores a new area in speciation research--the role played by post-mating barriers to fertilization in the reproductive isolation of closely related species.  At the same time, the work will have bearing on an old debate in biology, whether reproductive isolation arised through mutations of small effect (micromutations) at many genes, or through mutations with large effects (macromutations) at one or a few  genes.  The proposed work has important implications in two applied fields--agriculture and conservation biology.  The family Gryllidae (crickets) includes some very serious agricultural pests.  The proposed research will provide badly needed information on reproductive biology of crickets--information that can be used to help develop biological control programs.  In conservation biology, the integrity of rare species is often threatened by hybridization with more common sister species.  Hence,  achieving an understanding of how reproductive barriers operate is critical for preventing the loss of biological diversity.",
