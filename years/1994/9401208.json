 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401208  Guo       This RUI award supports mathematical research on problems in  harmonic analysis related to spectral synthesis, which roughly  states that smooth, decaying functions vanishing off a set  approximate Fourier transforms vanishing on the same set.  This  project is mainly concerned with spectral synthesis on manifolds,  the restriction of the Fourier transform and partial differential  equations with constant coefficients.  Specifically, the project  concerns distributions supported by hypersurfaces in Euclidean  space and how the curvature of the manifold is related to decay  properties of the Fourier transform of the distribution.  The  work  draws on recent results giving asymptotic estimates for weak  spectral synthesis.  Since there are examples where weak spectral  synthesis fails for general manifolds, it is necessary to  investigate the proper conditions, such as constant nullity,  which  will provide positive answers.        Harmonic analysis concerns the decomposition and  reconstruction of functions through representations in terms of  simpler components.  One of the fundamental tools of harmonic  analysis is the Fourier transform which plays equally central  role  in the study of partial differential equations where the two  fields  come together naturally.  Analysis of the transform, restricted  to  manifolds, is a relatively open field in which general results  are  usually hard to achieve.",
