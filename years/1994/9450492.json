The camp will utilize classroom  and lab facilities at Seattle Central Community College.  The goal  of the program is to motivate underachieving minority students to  pursue science, math and technology studies as they continue in  school.  Activities are designed to increase awareness of the  region's environment and how urbanization has affected water  quality in the Puget Sound region.  The camp will serve  approximately 75 students recruited from Seattle area middle  schools with the assistance of counselors, teachers, community  organizations, case workers, churches and parents.  Careers in  Electronics, Engineering, Computer Science, Biotechnology and  Environmental Science have been targeted for their job growth  potential in Washington state.    The Biosphere Of Tomorrow integrates activities in life, earth and  physical sciences with math and computers to current social and  environmental issues.  Principles from these areas will be linked  to daily life through experiments, design problems,field studies  and collaborative group problem-solving activities.  Sessions will  be held six hours a day, Monday through Thursday, with Fridays  devoted to field studies.  Students rotate in teams attending team-  taught sessions with professionals from the representative fields.   The camp will focus on water quality, exploring the hydrologic  cycle, watershed management, conservation, pollution, and hazardous  waste disposal.  Uses of water, including the generation of  electricity and its role in the economic vitality of the region  will be explored.  S tudents will conduct longitudinal site studies  examining impacts to water quality.  Water samples will be  collected and analyzed from four diverse sites in Puget Sound.  An  overnight \"Camp-In\" will be held at the Pacific Science Center.   Years two and three, students will grow bacteria that produce  plastic naturally and learn how to extract DNA from cultures.   Results from site studies will be utilized from year to year  tracing impacts to water quality in the region over time.  Problem-  solving exercises, probability, statistics, entering data into  spreadsheets and graphs, and visual documentation will integrate  lab activities with math and computer studies.  Students will learn  software authoring skills in order to produce a multi-media  presentation and display of their group's results for a culminating  event open to the public.  Hot lunches and daily transportation are  provided.  At the end of the camp, students are recognized with a  certificate and take-home science kit.  Two scholarships to camps  at the Pacific Science Center will be awarded to a boy and a girl  selected by faculty.    Teaching Assistants will recruited from high school and college  minority science programs including Math, Engineering, Science  Achievement (MESA), and the Minority Teaching Academy to work with  community mentors in the camp.  Career assistance workshops, a  parent outreach event and follow-u  activities during the school  year are included to reinforce and support the efforts of the  program.  A corresponding in-service teacher training institute  will be offered to fifteen Washington state teachers to develop  culturally relevant, anti-bias science teaching strategies with at-  risk students.  ***",
