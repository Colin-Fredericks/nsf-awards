 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402854  Leadbetter        Travel support and expenses are requested for the participation of at  least 24 promising junior researchers and graduate students in the 3rd World  Congress of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability,  which is to be held jointly with the 57th Annual Meeting of the Institute of  Mathematical Statistics (IMS).        The Bernoulli Society schedules a 4-year \"World Congress for Probability  and Mathematical Statistics\", which is an integral component of the  infrastructure for scholarly exchange of ideas on an international level.  It  plays a role in the fields of probability and mathematical statistics similar  to that of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in the field of  mathematics.        The Congress was last held in 1990 in Uppsala, Sweden, jointly with the  53rd annual meeting of the IMS. (The IMS and Bernoulli Society are the two  principal international organizations for Mathematical Statistics and  Probability.) This enormously successful conference provided strong  encouragement to the societies to consider further joint meeting, designating  Chapel Hill, NC (site of the University of North Carolina) as venue for the  next Congress scheduled for June 19-25, 1994.        The Congress is expected to attract up to 800 participants including  many internationally recognized statisticians and probabilists.  The  Organizing Committee desires to encourage the attendance and significant  involvement of promising junior researchers and graduate students, and has  instituted a  \"Host/Mentor\" program to pair junior participants with  established researchers.  This is designed to ensure their introduction to,  and instigate significant interactions with talented senior and foreign  statisticians and probabilists at the meeting.        The Congress Program emphasizes probability and statistical theory and  application with eleven invited sessions in Probability, thirteen in  Statistical Theory and eleven on Applications.  In add ition, a number of  related workshops and special lectures are planned.",
