 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319447  Kaler    In the first two-year research period, electron microscopy, light, X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved fluorescence quenching, and NM self-diffusion measurements were used to discover and chartreuse a menagerie of novel microstructures in synthetic and biological surfactant systems.  The key to enlarging the realm of surfactant solution microstructure (from the limits of simple micelles and lamellar phases) has been the \"physical synthesis\" of new materials by mixing surfactants to achieve a desired set of properties.  This has been most clearly  the demonstrated in the catanionic vesicle systems we discovered and investigated during the first research period.  The cationic surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) associate in solution to form a quasi-double-tailed surfactant that forms bilayers rather than micelles.  The bilayers of the catanionic mixture have different properties than do covalently bound zwitterionic double-tailed surfactants; the catanionic mixture forms unilamellar vesicles while the covalent zwitterionic surfactants form multilamellar phases. It is hypothesized that new microstructures are produces in mixtures because the intermolecular and interaggregate forces are altered in ways impossible in single component surfactant solutions.  In this renewal, experimental and theoretical efforts are used to design new microstructures of mixed surfactant systems by understanding how the components of the surfactant mixtures alter the intermolecular and inter-aggregate forces.  ***",
