 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403399  Conlon        The principal investigator will conduct research on problems in partial  differential equations. These problems are motivated by intuitions concerning  the behavior of interacting random walks over large time scales. A major step  in this direction would be to understand random walks in random environments.  The principal investigator's approach to these problems has been to obtain  sufficiently sharp estimates on solutions to appropriate partial differential  equations. He intends to continue this work.        The general goal of this project is to advance understanding of  diffusion in a medium where the consistency of the medium changes a lot. When  two liquids are mixed the process of mixing is a diffusive process. Heat  propagates largely by diffusion. There are many examples of diffusive  processes where the consistency of the medium of propagation changes a lot.One  example is the propagation of oil through porous rock. Another is the  propagation of pollutants in the ground. In each of the above examples it is  important to build up a qualitative understanding of the mechanism of  difdusion in such media. This study will contribute to this,",
