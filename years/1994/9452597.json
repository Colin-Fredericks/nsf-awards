This  development process will seek to duplicate the success achieved by  the revision of laboratory courses in physics (including general  curriculum, introductory, upper division and research courses) so  that they now introduce and use, in a systematic and coherent  manner, a set of data-acquisition and data analysis software tools  (Lab VIEW, Kaleidagraph, and IGOR). In the project described here  we will use five computational tools: a simulation package  (STELLA), a statistical package (Mini tab), a numerical calculation  program (Mat Lab), a symbolic algebra package (Mathematica) and a  programming language (C++). We will integrate these packages into  the physics, geology and mathematics curricula at all levels.  Students involved in research in all three departments will use  these software tools. A major outcome of the project is that the  faculty and students in physics, geology and mathematics will share  ideas for improving science education.",
