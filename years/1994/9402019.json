 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402019  ANDERSON      During their travel in the inner solar system, fine cosmic dust  particles acquire large amounts of noble gases owing to their  surface to volume ratio.  When these particles enter the earth's  atmosphere, those sufficiently small to enter the earth's  atmosphere at cosmic velocities without suffering ablation, are  called micrometeorites and retain their noble gases, including He.   Not only do the micrometeorites have high He concentrations, but  they also have very high 3He/4He ratios, several orders of  magnitude above that of terrigenous materials. The micrometeorites  eventually settle down to the bottom of the ocean where they are  mixed with other sediments. This project will use the bulk sediment  He concentration and isotopic composition as a measure of  micrometeorite concentration in the sediments. If the flux of  micrometeorites to the earth has remained constant in geological  past, then their concentration in sediments can be used to  quantitatively evaluate sedimentation rates and the fluxes of  different sedimentary components and changes in these fluxes  through time.  This research will test the assumptions that the  flux of micrometeorites to the sediments have stayed constant over  time and that the micrometeorites in sediments retain their He for  time-scales of interest. If successful, this approach will expand  our ability to look at high resolution sedimentation rates to  millions of years.",
