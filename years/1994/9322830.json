The research involves the use of recent results in queuing network  approximations and the extensions of already developed models.  The  research is targeted toward the development of design tools that  can produce an integrated logistics/economics analysis techniques  for improving existing designs and producing near optimal design  from scratch.  The research  result will be used to construct a  workable prototype design tool that will be linked to an industrial  equipment data base and tested in actual fabrication design  processes of a semi-conductor fabricator.       This research is well focused and very likely to result in a  product that has immediate industry application.  The problem  addressed is real and likely to have some lasting impact on  engineering infrastructure.  The outcome of this research, if  successfully accomplished, can lead to improved design of wafer  fabrication facilities and their operation.  The active support  given to this research by wafer fabrication companies is a strong  evidence of how the work is viewed by the target industry.",
