 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316296   Backhus    Wetlands are a natural resource of paramount importance in that  they are highly productive and biodiverse, and provide shelter for  a number of endangered species.  This unique environment can also  be \"engineered\" to treat aquatic pollutants.  Synthetic organic  compounds (SOCs) from agricultural run-off, atmospheric deposition,  and other nonpoint sources threaten their ecology.  One aspect of  SOC fate and transport in a wetland ecosystem that is poorly  understood is the role of mobile organic colloids that can bind  many nonpopular organic substances and enhance some aqueous phase  concentrations well beyond equilibrium expectations.  The proposed  study of the effects of organic colloids on the speciation and  mobility of SOCs in wetland environments will (1) measure the in  situ distribution of SOCs between environmental compartments, (2)  determine the abundances and distribution of organic colloids in  wetlands, (3) characterize the physiochemical properties of organic  colloids, (4) determine the partition reactivity of wetland organic  colloids to SOCs, and (5) correlate the properties of organic  colloids with their propensity to react with SOCs.  Samples will be  collected from three sites in Ohio:  Old Woman's Creek, Cedar Bog,  and the proposed Olentangy River constructed wetlands in Columbus.  The proposed research will better our understanding of and improve  our ability to model the role of colloids in controlling the fate  and transport of organic pollutants in wetlands and aquatic  systems.  The information accrued from this project should aid  those individuals responsible for managing ecosystems, and help  engineers properly design and construct wetlands for purposes of  remediating nonpoint source pollutants.",
