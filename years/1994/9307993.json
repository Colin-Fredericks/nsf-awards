 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307993  Winey    Adhesives, photoresists, impact modifiers, packaging materials, and  emulsifying agents are among the industrial uses of copolymers.   Copolymers contain two or more types of monomer units covalently  bonded to one another in a single polymer chain.  The different  monomer units of the copolymer can be arranged in a variety of  sequences, for example, random, alternating, and block.   Traditionally, researchers have assumed that the sequence  distribution does not influence macroscopic properties, except in  the case of very large sequencing differences, for example random  versus block copolymers.  However, a few studies, including work by  the authors, have demonstrated that small differences in the  sequence distribution dramatically influence blend miscibility.    Given these unexpected results, a thorough investigation of the  effect of sequence distribution on thermodynamics and mechanical  properties will be carried out.  The pertinent topics are the phase  behavior in copolymer/homopolymer/homopolymer blends and the  interfacial properties of copolymer confined between immiscible  phases.  Both blend miscibility and interfacial fracture toughness  will be studied primarily as a function of the sequence  distribution of the copolymer, though considerable attention will  also be given to the interaction parameter and molecular weights.   The sequence distribution in copolymers will be explored as a new  means of effectively tailoring properties by varying the molecular  structure.  ***",
