 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407606  McCourt       In an intriguing and challenging application of both molecular  and morphological data to a problem in phylogeny, Professor Richard  McCourt at DePaul University will be studying the algal group known  as stoneworts, the Charophyta.  Representatives of all seven genera  of living members of the group will be analyzed for a number of  genes by nucleotide sequencing methods, to acquire data on  mutational differences among the species.  Morphological features  of these same taxa along with data on the rich record of fossil  forms of these algae, acquired in collaboration with French  paleobotanical colleagues, will be integrated with the DNA results  to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the charophytes.       The charophytes are relatively large and complex for algae;  they have growing regions at the apex of branches and flagellated  sperm cells that are more similar to those of certain land plants  than to other green algae.  As one of the algal groups closest  phylogenetically to the land plants, the charophytes are likely to  show evolutionary adaptations that will help understand the  sequence of changes in the origin of land plants.  As well, their  fossil record provides an opportunity to calibrate rates of  molecular change in genes.",
