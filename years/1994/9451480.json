 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451480  Glaunsinger  The first multidisciplinary scanning probe microscopy (SPM)  laboratory for undergraduate students using research-grade  instrumentation will be created in this project. The primary goal  of this initiative is to create a unique SPM undergraduate  laboratory using affordable, state-of-the-art instrumentation for  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy  (AFM). The proposed laboratory is designed to serve as a magnet to  bring together students from different disciplines and ethnic  backgrounds to help prepare them for the imminent revolution in  nano-science, engineering and technology. The proposed laboratory  will be built around research-grade instruments that are capable of  operating in both STM and AFM modes at nanoscale resolution under  ambient conditions, in vitro and in situ under electrochemical  control. The multidisciplinary SPM laboratory will be completely  equipped with (i) sample and probe preparation equipment, (ii) four  SPM workstations, (iii) post-acquisition data processing equipment,  and (iv) testing equipment. This project will involve expert  faculty from the Department of Chemistry/Biochemistry,  Physics/Astronomy, Geology, Biology, Chemical/Bio/Materials  Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The proposed laboratory  will serve a new multidisciplinary SPM laboratory course,  complement many of the existing undergraduate courses and  laboratories in the above disciplines, provide highly qualified  students for undergraduate research projects, and strengthen  special programs such as the federally funded Interdisciplinary  Undergraduate Program in Materials Synthesis and Processing and the  Coalition to Increase Minority Degrees. The proposed  multidisciplinary SPM laboratory will have a positive impact on the  quality of science and engineering education at the university,  local, regional and national levels.",
