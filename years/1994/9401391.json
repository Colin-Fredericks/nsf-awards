 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401391  Yukie       This award funds the research of Professor Akihiko Yukie in  number theory.  Prof. Yukie will use the theory of prehomogeneous  vector fields to attempt to compute the density of certain  arithmetic objects.  In particular,  he believes that his  techniques can be used on arithmetic aspects of quartic and  quintic extensions of global fields.          This is research in the branch of mathematics known as  number theory.   Number theory at its most basic is the study of  whole numbers and their properties.  This theory begins with the  connections between whole numbers such as the divisibility of one  number by another.  In short order the theory includes some of  the most profound problems in science. It is among the oldest  fields of mathematics and was originally pursued for purely  aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century, it has  become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for  computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
