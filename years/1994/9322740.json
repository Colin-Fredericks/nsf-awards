 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322740  Molina       The objective of the proposed research is to improve the  understanding of the processes responsible for chlorine activation  in the stratosphere.  These processes involve chemical reactions  occurring on polar stratospheric cloud particles and on liquid  sulfuric acid aerosols.  It is important to have a detailed  knowledge of the mechanisms of these heterogeneous reactions in  order to make reliable predictions of future ozone depletion,  particularly at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.       Some of the proposed experiments are designed to probe various  aspects of the interaction of HCl (hydrochloric acid) vapor with  ice surfaces:  They include testing the solvation of HCl by  monitoring its isotopic exchange with DCl; investigating the  effects of surface morphology; exploring the extent of the uptake  at very low HCl partial pressures; etc.  The results should help to  discriminate among the various HCl uptake mechanisms proposed so  far, i.e. physical adsorption vs. formation of a liquid-like layer  on the ice surface.  Other proposed experiments consist of  measurements of the reaction probabilities for chlorine activation  processes on liquid  H2SO4/(sulfuric acid) HNO3/(nitric acid)  HCl/H2O(water vapor) solutions with compositions such as those  predicted for aerosol particles in the high-latitude stratosphere.   The results of these experiments are potentially of great  importance for interpreting the unusually high levels of the ClO  (chlorine monoxide) radical observed  in some air parcels in the  lower stratosphere.",
