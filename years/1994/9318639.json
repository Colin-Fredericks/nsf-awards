 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the   Chemistry Division, W. Carl Lineberger will study the structure and   dynamics of molecular ions, both isolated and aggregated with known   numbers of solvent molecules, with emphasis on three-carbon hydrocarbons   and transition metal aggregates.   Bond strengths of fundamental   hydrocarbon radicals will be obtained, rearrangements and transition   states for transient intermediates will be investigated, and quantitative   information on the electronic structure of small metal clusters will be   obtained.  Ultrafast laser technologies will be developed to obtain   real-time dynamic information on reactive processes in ions with   partially completed solvent shells.  This research will utilize two   ultrafast lasers to initiate and probe chemical reactions in a   microsolvent.    One goal of these studies is to increase the quantitative understanding   of the processes driving the simplest chemical transformations.  By   studying the chemical transformations of molecules which are both   isolated as well as surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger will be   able to demonstrate the effect that different solvents have on reactivity   as well as on the rates at which these reactions proceed.",
