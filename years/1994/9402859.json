 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402859  SHARP    The measurement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has garnered  renewed importance recently. This parameter is used by geochemists,  biological oceanographers, and physical oceanographers in studies  of global elemental fluxes and studies of ecosystem elemental  cycling.  In the past, DOC distributions were thought to show  little variation in the ocean and to represent refractory remnants  of biological activity.  They were considered poorly measured  parameters of little importance.  Demonstrations in the past 10  years of apparently much higher concentrations in the ocean and  large variations with depth caused considerable interest and  excitement in the importance of DOC, especially in relation to  ocean-atmosphere carbon interactions.      With many analysts trying to measure DOC, controversy arose because  of differences in reported concentrations as large as an order of  magnitude. The principal investigator of this renewal proposal has  been involved for the past two years with an attempted solution of  the controversy; working closely with a steering committee and with  a number of experienced analysts funded for routine DOC  measurements in the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study.  In a  coordinator and referee role, he has been able to get agreement  among analysts and variations are more on the order of +7.5%  instead of the previous +100% or more.  This agreement on analysis  has come from careful attention to analytical blanks, method  standardization, and carbon dioxide peak measurement, not from  preconceived ideas of concentrations and distribution.  A broad  community DOC analytical comparison is now underway with  participation by about 70 analysts from the United States and 17  other countries.  The effort of the renewal proposal will: 1.)  Complete the DOC community comparison; 2.) Make available reference  materials to keep broad community standardization for DOC analyses;  and 3.) Carry out research on collection and preservation of  samples to avoid sporadic  rapid changes in DOC concentrations from  microbial activity.  The large number of analysts interested and  willing to participate in the methods comparisons plus a larger  number who are not directly involved but who have been in contact  with the principal investigator, indicates the interest in the  international oceanographic and limnological communities and the  urgency to complete the proposed project.",
