 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317132  Chen      Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are small peptide  hormones known to play important roles in regulating growth  and differentiation of vertebrates.  Studies conducted in  mammals showed that IGF-II is produced in the liver and  several other prenatal and neonatal tissues, whereas IGF-I  is primarily produced in the post-natal livers under the  control of growth hormone (GH).  However, the mechanism of  hormonal regulation of IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression has  not been determined.  Using rainbow trout as experimental  animals, the long term objective of this research is to  investigate the molecular mechanism of GH controlled IGF  gene expression.  To achieve this long term objective, a  list of short term aims has been developed for the next  three years.  These are:  (1) determining patterns of tissue  and developmental stage specific expression of IGF genes;  (2) identifying hormonal factors that regulate the  expression of IGF genes in vivo and in vitro; (3) assessing  the consequence of differential inactivation of the  production of IGF-I or IGF-II polypeptide by a combination  of transgenic fish and Ribozyme technologies; (4) isolating  and characterizing the GH receptor and its cDNA molecules.  Fish represent the largest and the most diverse group of  vertebrates and their unique evolutionary position relative  to other vertebrates and their ability to adapt to a wide  variety of environments make them ideal for studying the  molecular mechanisms of growth regulation. Results of these  proposed studies will advance the knowledge of vertebrate  IGF gene regulation and expression in a way that is both  easily generalized to vertebrate models, and will provide a  phylogenetic perspective that has proved useful in the  studies of other complex biological phenomena.  Furthermore,  these studies on GH modulated IGF gene expression in fish  will provide an excellent alternative model for studying the  control of growth factor gene expression at the molecular  level in hu mans.  ***",
