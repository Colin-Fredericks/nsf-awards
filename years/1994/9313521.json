In the last three  years, their research and research training efforts have expanded to the point  that their outdated facilities are no longer able to provide suitable space. This is  especially true for faculty-supervised student research projects. Undergraduates  hoping to work on independent research projects are now routinely turned  away for lack of suitable lab space.        To resolve this problem, St. Louis University has planned to renovate a  moribund research lab into a shared-use lab for students and faculty, and to  replace a research greenhouse whose environmental controls cannot be  repaired. The research lab will receive new casework, an autoclave, plumbing,  laminar flow and fume hoods, as well as new space partitioning. The new  greenhouse will have modern environmental controls that will support a wide  range of experiments. These facilities modernization projects will alleviate the  space shortage by creating highly suitable environments for research in plant  growth and physiology, biochemistry, and plant pathology. The renovations will  enable student and faculty research collaborations, and will help to attract  students to careers in science.  ***",
