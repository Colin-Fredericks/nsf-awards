 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411794  Winick  The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at  the University of Michigan will purchase an electron beam gun and  an intracavity frequency doubled argon ion laser to support  research in engineering.  The equipment will be used to fabricate  novel integrated optical devices in glasses and crystals.  This  proposal is an integral part of our on-going research program in  glass integrated optics.  We anticipate that the new devices,  developed as part of this effort, may eventually become important  components in fiber-based optical communication and high density  optical storage systems.  As part of this program, we will develop  and exploit new fabrication technologies for glass waveguide  devices.  Specifically, rare earth waveguide lasers will be  fabricated, for the first time, in doped fused silica substrates  using low energy electron-beam irradiation.  Quasi-phase matched  second harmonic generation in poled fused silica samples will also  be demonstrated using electron beam technology.  In a closely  related effort, waveguide grating-based devices will be directly  written into planar germano-silicate substrates using the frequency  doubled argon ion laser.  Extensions of this direct write method to  include ion exchangeable glasses will be explored.  The successful  completion of this project should enhance the manufacturability of  a large class of integrated optical components.  ***",
