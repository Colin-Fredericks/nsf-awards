Eight undergraduate students will be selected to  work as apprentices with faculty members who are nationally known  for their research and highly experienced at preparing  undergraduates for graduate school.  Students will work full-time  for eight weeks in the summer in various subareas of experimental  psychology, including psychophysiology, emotions, perception,  cognitive, and physiological psychology.  They will design an  independent research project during the latter part of the summer  and complete it with the help of their Penn State mentor and \"home\"  school memtor during the following academic year.  At the end of  the spring semester, they will present their research results at a  Penn State department colloquium.  Every effort will be made to  encourage and assist students to gain admission to graduate school.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
