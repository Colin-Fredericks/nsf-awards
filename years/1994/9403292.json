 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403292  Rosemond     Although nutrients in aquatic food webs may control growth rates  of primary producers (which are consumed by higher trophic levels),  few investigations have directly probed the role of nutrients in  detrital systems.  Landscape - scale volcanic activity in Central  America results in prominent changes to surface water chemistry,  including dramatic increases in soluble reactive phosphorus (P)  concentrations, with appreciable localized effects on stream biota.   This research will examine whether geothermal P inputs enhance  microbial biomass, nutrient content, and leaf litter decomposition  rates.  Effects of P variation on higher trophic levels will be  assessed by comparing drift and trap densities, and size of  detritivorous shrimp.  High and low P site comparisons of leaf  litter quality will be performed using measures of detritivore  growth and fat content.  The relative importance of microbial  versus macroconsumer processes in leaf decomposition will be  determined using in situ manipulations of nutrient levels.  Both  bottom - up (nutrient) control and top - down (detritivory) control  will be examined.  %%%  The role of detritus in trophic dynamics hasn't been well studied,  particularly in lotic (flowing water) ecosystems.  But beyond  fundamental research aspects, this project's importance derives our  need to know how aquatic systems operate, as human population  pressures place increasing burdens on the natural environment, in  the United States, Latin America, and around the world.  ***",
