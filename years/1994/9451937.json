Each station will  include a computer with the necessary transducers, hardware and  software. The College's curriculum consists primarily of full-time  integrated, interdisciplinary programs. Instruction in laboratory  physiology centers on an upper-division program integrating  physiology, molecular biology, organic and biochemistry. A second  program emphasizes neurophysiology integrated with cognition and  philosophy. Laboratories in both programs will be greatly improved  by allowing the collection and immediate analysis of a variety of  physiological data such as electroencephalograms,  electrocardiograms and electromyograms. Advanced students, also  currently hampered by the lack of sophisticated equipment, can  follow up on proposed experiments. The new instruments will provide  much broader and more up-to-date laboratory instruction than  currently available and will greatly strengthen a program that has  been very successful in preparing many students for more advanced  studies.",
