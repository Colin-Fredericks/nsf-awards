 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409274  Novick         This proposal deals with connections between  combinatorial optimization, graph theory, matroid theory and  coding theory. Matroids generalize the notion of vector space. An  ideal clutter is a type of 0-1 matrix which arises in the set  covering problem. Applications of the set covering problem  include airline crew scheduling, dispatching of trucks and  facility location. The theory of codes is used to efficiently  account for noise when sending, receiving and decoding messages.  Binary clutters occur in many graph theoretic settings and  in network applications. There are close connections between  binary  clutters, matroids and codes. The applicant proposes to  study the structure of  ideal, binary clutters in a matroidal  context and to determine the feasibility of a matroidal approach  to a long standing graph colouring problem and to some  questions involving the covering radius of certain codes.       The covering radius of a code is important for decoding.  Planning activities will include working with two senior  researchers, Andras Sebo, of CNRC in Grenoble, and J.D. Key of  Clemson University. The outcome of the planning period will  be several papers and a formal NSF proposal to be completed  within 18 months of the start date.  ***",
