Current standard  practice in power converters operation is based on the generation  of periodic switching functions.  Periodic switching policies are  energy efficient, but can require extensive filtering, and can  produce excessive acoustic noise in motor applications, due to  interactions of harmonics with mechanical structures.  The  purpose of this project is to mitigate these and other related  effects through the development of a unified design procedure for  randomized switching waveforms in power converters.    The starting point for the proposal is a set of recently proposed  randomized switching schemes, where a stochastic signal with  appropriately chosen statistical properties is added to the  reference switching function.  Randomization then alters the  frequency content without affecting the proper operation.  The  proposed development of design procedures for switching governed  by Markov chains will further enhance this approach by enabling  time-domain adaptation and wave-form optimization in both time  and frequency domains.  The new approach is also practical and  interesting for manufacturing, as it does not require any major  hardware changes in existing equipment.   ***",
