 "awd_abstract_narration": "311935  Walker    A joint research program between the Lamont-Doherty Earth  Observatory at Columbia University and the International Business  Machine Thomas J. Watson Research Center is proposed.  The project  combines Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's unique capabilities in  high-pressure petrology with International Business Machine's  expertise in solid state chemistry and physics for the purpose of  investigating the synthesis of new copper oxide and sulfide phases.  This proposal represents an academic-industrial collaboration.   National Science Foundation support is sought for the Lamont-  Doherty Earth Observatory part of the program only.  Exploratory  synthesis work will be performed to create a homologous series of  ordered copper oxide phases based on the infinite layer-type  structure.  High pressures will be used to produce perovskite-  related precursors, and phase equilibrium studies conducted to  determine the conditions for ordering of various combinations of A-  site cations and oxygen vacancies into specific derivative  structural forms.  The goal is to create new materials and at the  same time learn how high-temperature superconductivity arises in  these various structure types.  Also proposed is a high-pressure  investigation of possible copper sulfide analogs of the  superconducting cuprates.  Since tetrahedral copper coordination  predominates in the crystal chemistry of the copper sulfides,  pressure is expected to be a major factor in the stabilization of  ternary copper sulfides into desired perovskite or intergrowth-type  lattices.  Preliminary work focuses on transforming copper sulfide  into a rock-salt type structure, and proceeds to exploratory  studies on sulfide analogs of the high-temperature cuprates.  The  routes to such new materials are unexplored and the synthetic  challenge promises unexpected and exciting developments.  ***",
