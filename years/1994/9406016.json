 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406016  Marti    In the last few years, several cosmic ray produced radionuclides  (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl), as well as stable nuclides 3He, 21Ne and 22Ne  have been discovered  in terrestrial surface materials.  Some of  these nuclides are now employed as tracers in studies of  geophysical and geological phenomena and open up a new field of  study that is expected  to provide essential data on rates of  change in global change research.  Such studies require accurate  production rates, present and past, which are not currently  available .  We are using a direct method for the determination of  some present production rates by exposing relevant targets at  mountain altitudes.  Furthermore, we are evaluating the production  rate ratio P21/P26 of the cosmic ray produced nuclides 21Ne and 26Al   by isotopic measurements of Ne in samples whic1h were exposed for  104-1047a.  Our experimental data are consistent  with inferred  neutron reactions in a 600 MeV proton irradiation experiment  (Aylmer et al., 1987), but do not agree with theoretical  predictions.  Measurements of the 3He21Ne ratio show that 3He is  incompletely retained in quartz.  Therefore, 21Ne production rates  and accurate 21Ne10Be and 21Ne/26Al production rate ratios are expected  to provide essential information for the evaluation of erosion  rates and to define geological processes (uplift, variations in ice  cover, etc.)  Further calibrations, such as activation energies for  long-term retention of Nec, are still required, but we are now ready  for research  on global change issues.    We propose to study the long-term exposure history of the Antarctic  ice field (the major controlling unit of the sea level).  We plan  to evaluate the 21Ne records in quartz separates  of documented  rocks from the Allan Hills region and to study a section adjacent  to the ice field in which the radionuclides 26Al and 10Be were   measured (Nishiizumi et al., 1991).  These authors estimate that  rocks in this region may have been exposed for millio ns of years   without ice cover, but caution that the record of an integrating   stable nuclide is required to define the early history.  We plan to  also include samples from the same area which indicate very erosion  rates.  The purpose is to increase the recorded  time interval of  cosmic ray exposure which is limited by the \"erosion equilibrium\".",
