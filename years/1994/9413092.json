This new  curriculum will give every student the experience of working in  product development teams through industrially-sponsored  multi-disciplinary design and prototyping projects.  Moreover, this  curriculum will broaden the student's perspective by teaching the  manufacturing enterprise as the integration of engineering,  business, and management challenges.  This new curriculum will link  course content directly to faculty research while creating a group  of faculty who can teach a wide variety of manufacturing subjects  at any academic level.",
