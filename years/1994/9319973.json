First, statistical methods will be used to  gain a deeper understanding of disordered patterns that are  evolving chaotically in time.  Physical systems to be investigated  include interfacial waves and liquid crystal layers.  Second, the  dynamics and defects of quasicrystalline patterns patterns will be  studied in a fluid system where the various excitations, e.g.  phasons, can be studied directly by optical imaging.  Finally, the  dynamics of crack patterns and networks in polymeric films will be  investigated as time allows.  This RUI project involves the pairing  of graduate and undergraduate researchers, which has been shown to  be a remarkably effective training strategy.      NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:    This program of experimental research is aimed at understanding the  ordered and disordered patterns that arise via instability as a  fluid or solid is driven away from equilibrium.  Systems to be  studied include waves on fluid interfaces, flows in liquid  crystals, and cracking patterns in polymeric materials.  Complex  and chaotic dynamics generally prevent exact prediction of the  pattern development, but a statistical approach can lead to limited  but useful predictability.  The methodology involves significant  technological innovation, mainly centered on digital analysis of  complex patterns.  This RUI project involves the pairing of  graduate and undergraduate researchers, which has been shown to be  a remarkably effective training strategy.  ***",
