The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Mace A. Hack tm work with Dr. Geoffrey A.  Parker at the University of Liverpool on the theory of  assessment and decision making by animals.    Their collaboration will focus on the development of a new  type of contest model based on repeated encounters between  opponents, the primary goal being a better understanding of  the strategies animals use to settle contests in a fitness  optimizing manner.  The second goal is for Dr. Hack to  acquire the skills necessary to build complex game theoretic  models which he may then apply to appropriate problems in  future research.  Decision making under conditions of  uncertainty is not only fundamental to assessment during  contests but is also critical in other behavioral contexts,  including foraging optimally in a variable environment,  selecting a mate of high quality and distinguishing reliable  cooperators. ***",
