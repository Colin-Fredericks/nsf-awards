 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407220  DiRusso    Fatty acids and higher lipids are essential to cellular and  organismal structure and function.  Our interests lie in  understanding how lipid metabolism is coordinated to meet  the nutritional, structural and regulatory needs of cells  and organisms.  Escherichia coli is a useful model system  since its lipids are confined to the cellular envelope and  this organism modulates its membrane fatty acid and  phospholipid composition in response to variations in the  nutritional and environmental state of the cell.  The  research proposed here investigates the E. coli transciption  factor FadR which regulates at least nine genes required for  anabolism and catabolism of fatty acids.  FadR exerts its  effect by binding to DNA to cause repression of genes  encoding proteins required for fatty acid catabolism and to  activate genes required for fatty acid anabolism.  DNA  binding by FadR is specifically prevented by long-chain  acylcoenzyme A thioesters.  The FadR gene has been cloned  and sequenced; and the protein purfied and preliminarily  characterized by the Principal Investigator.  The present  proposal is designed to:  (1) address questions regarding  FadR protein structure and function, and (2) evaluate  physiologic parameters which result in induction and the  cascade of FadR-dependent alterations in gene activity.  The  expertise of the Principal Investigator is in the molecular  genetics of E. coli fatty acid metabolism.  The present  award supports research activities during a sabbatical leave  in the laboratory of Dr. Jens Knudsen at the Institute of  Biochemistry, University of Odense, Odense, Denmark to  acquire technical skills in additional areas of lipid and  protein chemistry.  The specific research to be conducted  involves investigations into:  (1) the regulation by acyl-  CoA thioesters of FadR-DNA binding activity and prevention  of transcription activation, and; (2) determination of  native FadR structure and FadR complexed with acyl-CoA.  %%%  Fatty acids an d higher lipids are essential structural,  regulatory and nutritional compounds in all organisms.  Our  interests lie in understanding how lipid metabolism is  coordinated to meet the nutritional, structural and  regulatory needs of cells and organisms.  The bacterium  E.scherichia coli is a useful model system since its lipids  are confined to the cellular envelope and this organism  modulates its membrane fatty acid and phospholipid  composition in response to variations in the nutritional and  environmental state of the cell.  The research proposed here  investigates the Escherichia coli transcription factor FadR  which regulates many genes encoding proteins required for  both synthesis and degradation of fatty acids.  FadR  regulates these genes by binding to DNA to decrease the  activity of those encoding proteins required for fatty acid  degradation and to increase the activity of  those required  for fatty acid biosynthesis.  DNA binding by FadR is  specifically prevented by fatty acyl-coenzyme A thioesters.  The present proposal is designed to: (1) address questions  regarding FadR protein structure and function, and (2)  evaluate physiological parameters which result in induction  and the cascade of FadR-dependent alterations in gene  activity.  ***",
