 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318196  Battelle  The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the University of  Florida, was established in 1974 and is dedicated to the use of  marine animals as experimental models for the study of basic  processes in cell- and neurobiology.  This mission is augmented  by a teaching program that provides practical research training  using marine organisms to investigators at all career levels from  established scientists to high school students.  Because of the  cell biological emphasis of research at the Whitney Laboratory,  we rely heavily on the techniques of anatomy, biophysics, and  biochemistry and, most recently, molecular genetics.  The  expertise and specific research interests of the faculty at the  Whitney Laboratory are diverse, but all of our work falls within  the common themes of cell signalling and molecular evolution.    Central to the research efforts of all groups at the Laboratory  is our molecular genetics core facility that was established in  1989.  The current and growing importance of the tools of  molecular genetics and modern protein chemistry in the research  effots of the Whitney Laboratory has produced a critical need for  an image analysis system that will permit us to efficiently  analyze the results of biochemical and molecular biological  experiments.  For this reason we are requesting funds to purchase  an electriphoresis analyzer system that will be centrally located  in the Laboratory so it can be used conveniently by all research  groups.  This system is essential to the continued success of  many of our NSF-funded research programs.  Without it, many of  our on-going projects will be slowed significantly, and other  critical projects simply will not get off the ground.  ***",
