 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404379  DiBenedetto  This award supports applied mathematics research on problems  modeled by certain degenerate and singular evolution equations.  In particular, intrinsic Harnack-type estimates, Holder  continuity and asymptotic behavior of solutions in the time and  space variables will be developed.  For systems of equations,  work will be done analyzing the boundary behavior of solutions.   The new techniques generated by these studies permit the  mathematical treatment of a class of applied and industrial  problems.  These include understanding film rupture in the  coating of metals (existence of solutions, rupture and behavior  for large values of the variables), identification of cracks in  three-dimensional bodies (stability estimates for elliptic  ill-posed problems) the thermistor problem and problems in the  flow of immiscible fluids in a porous material as the  degeneracies approach the saturation point.  Further work will  concentrate on problems of conduction/convection with change of  phase for fluids obeying either the Navier-Stokes system or  Darcy's law.  These involve an estimation of the Hausdorff  dimension of the possible singularities of the temperature.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates  onthe accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
