 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316656  Bursik  The primary hypothesis to be tested is that the manner in  which elutriated ash clouds (of which 'coignimbrite' ash  clouds are a subset) are generated is strongly dependent  upon the interaction of pyroclastic flows and surges with  the topography surrounding a volcano.  Our objectives are  therefore to understand ash cloud generating mechanisms and  flow and surge mechanisms especially as they are affected by  topography.  The proposed research will consist of detailed  sedimentological measurements, laboratory experiments and  theoretical modeling.  Field work will consist of a novel  sampling strategy applied to the 1982 deposits of El Chichon  volcano, Mexico, at closely spaced sites lying along  traverse that traverse that parrallel flow directions.  The  sampling strategy will yield quantitative data that can be  used to test theoretical models of  flow behavior.  Laboratory experiments will be conducted in conjunction with  the analysis of the field data and the development of  theoretical models to provide constraints on interpretations  of field data and validation theory.  The proposed activity  will yield increased understanding of the mechanisms through  which ash clouds are elutriated from pyroclastic flows and  surges.",
