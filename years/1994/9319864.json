 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319864  Ashcroft  Theoretical research will be conducted on fluctuational physics and  its manifestations in electronic and structural order in both  quantal and classical systems. Motivated by experiment, three  research thrusts are planned: many-body theory, correlated  classical systems, and electronic structure.  Under many-body  theory a fundamental two-component theory of condensed matter will  be developed using coherent-state functional integral methods.   Under correlated classical systems, a theory of structured matter  will be developed which parallels the theory of the homogeneous  counterpart.  The electronic structure thrust will examine by both  single-particle and many-body methods the range of orderings seen  experimentally in dense assemblies of electrons and protons where  fast and slow degrees of freedom in a dual fermion system are  evident.  The theories developed will be applied to problems of  high current interest such as superconductivity, quasicrystals and  the metal-insulator transition.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on relatively simple models  of many-body systems in order to gain an understanding of  fluctuation physics as it arises in order, structure and transport.   This work will provide insight into similar behavior in more  complex systems.  The research not only addresses fundamental  issues in condensed matter physics, but also applies the models  developed to real materials of current interest.  ***",
