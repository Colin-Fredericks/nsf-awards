While this approach has been very  valuable in the past, it has its limitation when one  approaches the organization of the cytoplasm.  The goal of  this proposal is to study the organization and behavior of  several glycolytic enzymes in living cells.  These enzymes  are believed to exist freely dissolved in cytoplasm, but  much recent evidence suggests that they may exist partially  in the solid state.  During the first year of the project  efforts will be focused on continued studies of the enzymes  aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase.  These enzymes are  believed to interact with each other and with the actin  cytoskeleton, either directly or indirectly.  The  intracellular distribution and mobility of each of these  enzymes will be compared  using fluorescence ratio imaging  and fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching and the  interaction of these enzymes in vitro and in vivo will be  characterized extensively.  Specific antibodies will be used  against aldolase, cloned mutant aldolase, and fluorescence  resonance energy transfer to probe the interactions between  these enzymes both in vitro and in living mammalian  fibroblasts.  The significance of the work is three-fold.  First, it is clear that many reactions generally treated as  occurring in soluble phase may have some structural basis.  Characterizing and understanding the cellular organization  of these reactions is one of the important challenges  remaining for biochemical pathways.  Second, molecular  organization of biochemical pathways  may provide a link  between biochemical logic and three dimensional cytoplasmic  organization. Identifying the rules by which nature has  optimized biochemical reactions may allow genetic  manipulations to improve quality or efficiency of animals,  microbes and plants.  %%%  Understanding the cellular organization of metabolic  processes i s a basic requirement in our undestanding of  life.  The work proposed here to investigate the dynamics of  glycolytic enzymes in living cells will eventually provide  new tools for investigating other processes.  Understanding  the spatial and temporal organization of the cytoplasm is a  basic requirement for future genetic engineering experiments  in animals, microorganisms and plants.  ***",
