 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361481  Townsend       A new generation of robots with high-bandwidth, backdrivable  transmissions driven by high-performance brushless DC motors  presents the opportunity for improving the flow of force data back  to the controller without additional force sensors.  This research  will develop an algorithm for determining contact geometry, to be  used as feedback to the controller or teleoperator.  The algorithm  will complement existing force-sensor and tactile-sensor techniques  which offer improved accuracy, but otherwise limit the  responsiveness and stability of the system.  The proposed research  will compile a set of prototype force-control tasks, determine the  special kinematic equations necessary to calculate contact force  vectors, develop a mathematical and graphical representation of the  contact geometries, determine the best implementation algorithm for  the required speed, and outline specifications for experimental  development in Phase II.  The result of this research will be  faster, more dexterous robots which relay greater information about  the process than existing robot systems.  US companies, such as  Adept and Barrett Technology, have helped lead the international  community in backdrivable robotic hardware development.  By  improving the control algorithms to capitalize on these hardware  improvements, the US should retain its competitive lead in this  area of robotics.",
