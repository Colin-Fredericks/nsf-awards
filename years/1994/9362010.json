As  greater demands are placed on  devices from the standpoint of size  and cost per  controlled point,  easier methods of processing which  can produce smaller devices with  greater  performance are required.  Brewer Science has developed a  processable polyaniline, as well as   conductive, ion implanted polymer  films. Much of this prior work was  performed in collaboration  with  Southwest Missouri State University,  who is subcontractor in the proposed  work. Preliminary  investigations  indicate that devices constructed  from ion implanted polymers may have  particular  advantages over devices  using ceramic, metallic, crystalline  silicon and carbon-filled materials.   These advantages include improved  radiation hardness, greater  flexibility and range of travel, low   manufacturing cost, abrasion  resistance, and environmental  inertness. The polyaniline-based   sensors are easily deposited onto  the substrate and can be patterned  to small or large goemetries  by  standard photolithographic  procedures. These materials have  potential in the micromachining   industry because of the high quality  of the films that are produced on a  micro-scale (<1 micron),  and their  ease of processing. In the proposed  work, we will determine the  feasibility of using the  soluble  polyanilines and ion implanted films  for piezoresistive devices. Specific  goals of this  research are to  determine the piezoresistive gauge  factor, to minimize temperature  effects, to  improve environmental  stability, and to construct  prototypes of a precision laboratory  weight scale  and a vacuum/pressure  sensor based upon devices made from  these materials.  ***",
