The importance of  this new technology and the advancement of analytic methods that  employ GISs has been given considerable attention within the  private and public sectors.  In 1988, the National Science  Foundation (NSF) provided support that led to the establishment  of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis  (NCGIA), a consortium dedicated to research, education, and  outreach with respect to the advancement of geographic  information science.  Although the United States initially was  the locus of activity regarding GISs, scientists and  practitioners from other nations increasingly have engaged in  activities aimed at advancing the capabilities and uses of GISs.  In 1993, the European Science Foundation (ESF) started a  scientific program in Geographic Information Systems Data  Integration and Data Base Design (GISDATA).  This program is  designed to foster international collaborative research.  In  order to integrate the efforts of scientists from the U.S. with  the developing network of European scientists, this award will  support the efforts of the NCGIA to coordinate research  activities in the U.S. with those taking place in Europe.  In  particular, the participation of U.S. scientists in crucial  GISDATA meetings will be supported, as will the involvement of  more than a dozen early-career researchers in a summer institute  to be held in Europe in 1996.  These activities will be matched  by the ESF, which will send leading European scientists to  important U.S. meetings and funds participation of younger  European scientists at a 1995 summer institute sponsored by the  NCGIA in the U.S.  Other federal agencies and private-sector  firms are expected to complement NSF's support of this project.       Throu gh this award, the NCGIA will involve more U.S.  scientists in activities that will understand and remove  impediments to integration of geographic information from  different disciplines and from multiple national and regional  sources.  These activities also will develop improved methods for  database design, especially those currently inhibited by problems  in data integration.  The award also will facilitate  collaborations among U.S. and European scientists in a  partnership that is more than the sum of its parts, and it will  test new forms of mutual support between NSF and a major European  counterpart.",
