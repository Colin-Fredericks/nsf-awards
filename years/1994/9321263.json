 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321263  Meltzer    Under the direction of Dr. David Meltzer, Ms. Elizabeth Pintar  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Building on  previous archaeological research she has conducted in the high  \"puna\" region of northwestern Argentina, she will  conduct test  excavations at four rockshelter sites. Preliminary evidence  indicates that all contain archaeological materials and likely  span the Archaic period which dates from ca 10,000 to 3,000 years  ago. Ms. Pintar will conduct small test excavations to determine  the potential of each and on this basis select one for more  intensive work. Fourteen weeks will be devoted to this latter  stage of the project and should result in the collection of large  samples of lithic artifacts as well as floral and faunal remains.  On this basis human utilization of and adaptation to this harsh  environment can be determined. Pollen obtained from the deposits  should permit reconstruction of the climate as it changed over  time. Camelid remains will be analyzed to assess whether  domestication occurred during this period.    The dry highland regions of the Andes pose a challenge for human  subsistence. It is known that since the end of the last Ice Age,  climates within the region have fluctuated greatly and that at  times aridity was greater than today. Ms. Pintar wishes to  understand how human societies at a simple technological level  and dependent primarily on hunted and gathered foods were able to  subsist. She wishes to reconstruct diet and trace possible  patterns of seasonal movement. The rich data base which includes  well preserved plant and animal remains should permit her to do  this. She postulates that camelid species such as llama/guanaco,  alpaca and vicuna may have been domesticated in this context and  served to provide a more reliable food source.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on human potential to adapt to difficult environme nts and will  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
