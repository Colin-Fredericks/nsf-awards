Originally focused on the  interface with numerical analysis and computer science, in more  recent years it has been involved with a broad range of  scientific and technical areas, particularly hot areas such as  biotechnology and quality engineering. Computing is currently a  very active area in the statistics profession as desktop  computing power has made a huge advance in the last 5 years. For  example, Bayesian statistics used to be mostly theory and little  practice, because it was saddled with difficult numerical  integration issues. Today, the emergence of Monte Carlo methods  coupled with fast machines has made the techniques suddenly  practical. Researchers are asking for the distribution of  estimates, rather than just approximate standard errors, and a  number of resampling-based methods have emerged to provide those  answers. Exact significance levels are replacing approximate  ones. Smooth curves are replacing straight line fits. Statistical  graphics is helping researchers make discoveries. The Interface  Conference will have the specialized sessions on the  state-of-the-art,  and also a number of tutorial sessions and  short courses to help bring the new technology to a general  technical audience.       The Interface conference is the one annual conference  dedicated to statistical computing issues. Statistical computing  has emerged as a particularly important field in the last few  years because the arrival of cheap and fast desktop computers has  opened up a lot of new opportunities that were only dreamed of a  few years ago. A generation ago, the best statisticians could do  with limited computing resources was to get a statistic if the  data was organized a certain way, and look that statistic up in a  table. Then computing and numerical techniques improved enough to  handle more general models and get  significance levels. Now we  have progressed to where we can analyze very general models that  require fewer assumptions, have a more flexible functional form,  provide details on the distribution of the estimates in the  model, use interactive exploratory techniques to make new  discoveries, and present the results with graphical visualization  techniques. With further refinements in statistical computing  tools, the statistical community has a chance to really serve the  scientific and technical world much better at a time when the  Quality Movement, the Biotechnology Revolution, and the  Environmental mandate has made statistics and experimentation  more critically important. The Interface conference provides the  forum for presentation and discussion of the latest breakthroughs  in statisical computing.",
