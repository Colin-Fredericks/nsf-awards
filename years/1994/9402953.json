In recent  years considerable effort has been devoted to developing and  enhancing rigorous numerical and analytical methodologies for  control design and analysis. Although computational problems in  control are extremely complex, these problems often have special  structure that  can be exploited to obtain both theoretical and  computational results. Moreover, problems that arise from  applications are best addressed by interdisciplinary approaches  where experts in various disciplines (numerical analysis, control  theory, fluid dynamics) come together in an open exchange of  dialogue on recent research and current open problems. This type  of communication provides an important forum in which researchers  become aware of new mathematical tools from other areas and in  which new research problems are spawned in the individual  disciplines. This conference will bring together leading experts  from the areas of systems theory and control, numerical methods,  and a variety of other application areas to discuss recent  developments in interdisciplinary approaches to computational  control. In addition to standard presentations, many participants  will demonstrate and share recently developed software packages.        The main objectives of this conference are to provide  exposure to recent research as well as currents trends in  computational control, afford young postdoctoral researchers and  more established investigators an informal arena in which to  discuss problems, and to encourage graduate students toward a  career in research in interdisciplinary applied mathematics. Most  of the funds provided by this grant will be used to support young  researchers and graduate students.  ***",
