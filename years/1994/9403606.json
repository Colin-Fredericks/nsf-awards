 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403606  Cross    During a two-year research visit, Dr. Cross will  pursue a cooperative project with Nobuo Kamehara,  Inorganic Materials and Polymers Laboratory,  Fujitsu Corporation, to prepare and evaluate the  electrical properties of new ferroelectric  materials.  Their research will focus on  producing thin films of various ferroelectric  materials on different substrates and developing  empirical models of the ferroelectric material  properties.    Because of their superior conductive properties,  ferroelectric materials are being studied by  electronic manufacturers with the hopes of using  them to further reduce the size of semiconductor  devices.  Although ferroelectric materials  exhibit excellent properties in their bulk  crystalline form, reproducing the bulk properties  in thin films has been extremely difficult.  Regardless of the technique, producing a  homogeneous chemical composition throughout the  film is difficult.     Cross and Kamehara will design a matrix of thin  film samples using a wide range of quantitative  and qualitative variables: chemical composition,  electrodes, sputtering targets, pressure,  temperature, power density, etc.  After different  ferroelectric materials are deposited on various  substrates, the team will measure the electrical  properties of the materials and use that data as  a basis for developing empirical models.  The  team then plans to test their empirical models on  piezoelectric materials and finally to use their  models to design future semiconductor devices.  ***",
