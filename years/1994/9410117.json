A critical problem in present-day KR systems is  caused by the tradeoff between the expressiveness of the  representation language and the computational complexity of  reasoning with it -- deductive reasoning with sufficiently  expressive languages is inherently intractable.  In preliminary  work in addressing this problem, the PI has developed a technique  for generating tractable approximate reasoners, and a parameter,  called intricacy, whose finite value for a representation language  indicates that reasoning with it is tractable.  The preliminary  approach has some serious limitations.  First, although there are  many approximate reasoners that can be obtained using the technique  for any given application, the PI has not provided any systematic  way for among them.  Second, although he has shown that many known  tractable cases of reasoning have finite intricacy, he has not used  this parameter for obtaining new non-trivial tractability results.   The proposed research addresses these limitations.  The PI proposes  to evaluate various approximate reasoners by implementing and  testing them on KR systems used in some real-world applications;  this evaluation will be used to develop guidelines for choosing  appropriate reasoner for a given application.  The PI also proposes  to use intricacy for obtaining new non-trivial tractable cases that  are characterized by efficiently-identifiable syntactic features.",
