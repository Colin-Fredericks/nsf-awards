 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422144  Gross  Continuing support is provided for the international oceanographic  activities of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)  that are relevant to U.S. interests in marine sciences and the  Division of Ocean Sciences.  There are currently thirty-seven  countries represented in SCOR.  The Ocean Studies Board of the  National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S. national committee.    Individual ocean scientists participate in SCOR activities through  subsidiary bodies such as working groups and scientific steering  committees.  Funding will support two major SCOR activities: 1)  U.S. sponsorship of focused SCOR Working Groups.  Presently, there  are twelve such Working Groups covering diverse ocean-science  related topics.  Working Groups are comprised of experts from  different countries who meet on a regular basis to discuss and  assess the scientific status of their topic area and produce a  report that advises and provides recommendations for further  research efforts.  2)  Science Steering Committee activities of the  Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and the Global Ocean  Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) program; both are part of the U.S.  Global Change Research Program.  These major programs have origins  in U.S. and have turned to SCOR to provide a forum for  international planning and coordination.  SCOR's impact has and  will continue to be evident in the standardization of measurement  protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship time, and the  enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without  international coordination.",
