 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451214  DiJulio  The Mechanical Engineering Department at California State  University, Northridge has developed new courses in automotive and  environmental engineering. For the past nine years our students  have distinguished themselves in national automotive engineering  design competitions and as a result the ME Department has developed  expertise in the area of alternative fuels.  Last year as part of  curriculum development in environmental engineering a new senior  design course was developed which provides an opportunity for  students to solve local industry's environmentally related  problems.  High student demand for these automotive and  environmental engineering laboratories and a lack of new equipment  threatens the quality of these programs. The State of California  has provided limited, one-time funding for the 94-95 academic year  for an engineering and computer science building expansion and  laboratory improvement. This proposal requests matching funds for  automotive and environmental engineering laboratory improvement.  Specifically, the engine dynamometers and instruments requested  will provide additional measurement, diagnostic and development  capabilities in projects related to the use of alternative fuels in  engines. Engine performance characteristics will be integrated with  emissions measurements via the Department's existing exhaust gas  analyzer. The gas chromatograph requested for the environmental  engineering lab will be used to evaluate soil remediation projects  and automotive emission of methane and non-methane gas  concentrations. The requested equipment will support instruction  and provide research opportunities for undergraduates in the  future.",
