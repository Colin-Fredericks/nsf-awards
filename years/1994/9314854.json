These methods  will also be applied to simulation of the activities and inhibition  of two enzymes, cytidine deaminase and cyclophilin.  The proline  isomerase activity of cyclophilin is thought to involve the  catalysis of a conformation change, without formation of breaking  of a chemical bond.  Catalysis by cytidine deaminase appears to  require significant conformation change to admit substrate and  expel product.  Several components of the project will be directed  at development or improvement of techniques that may have general  applicability.  Development of a method (based on work published by  Friedman in 1975) to do molecular dynamics simulations of proteins  in a spherical \"bath\" filled with explicit water molecules, with a  so-called reaction field that accounts for the presence of a medium  with high dielectric constant (water) on the outside, even though  no molecules are explicitly represented there.  If this  implementation is successful, then it will be combined with the  fast multipole method (Greengard; Board) for calculation of all  long-range electrostatic forces.  Other proposed new developments  include an improved method for the calculation of absolute binding  free energies and the implementation of molecular dynamics programs  on parallel machines with many processors.    %%%  Hardly a single processes involving the action of a protein does  not involve a conformation change of some kind, and is fully  understood without an understanding of the nature of conformation  change.  The very process of formation of native protein molecules  from an unordered state is a process of coupled and sequential  conformation changes that is not at all well understood, and  conformation change is critical in the action of nearly  all  enzymes.  This project will apply accurate computer simulation  methods to the study of conformation change of peptides and  proteins.  Molecular dynamics simulations and specialized versions  thereof, capable of calculation of free energy differences will be  used with a variety of problems.  In earlier work the focus of this  project has been on validation of the method by application to  problems for which precise experimental results are available.   This will continue, but increasingly the project will include to  problems where experiments have given little or no information  about conformational equilibria.  %%%",
