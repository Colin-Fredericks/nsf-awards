The work proposed will draw on the complementary skills of  the Chinese group, headed by Professor Lin Qun, in numerical  analysis, particularly on finite element method, and the  skills of the Wyoming group in large scale computation and  mathematical modeling.    Mathematical models and scientific computations are playing  an increasingly important role in many applied fields such  as weather prediction, energy conversion analysis and  design, contaminant transport, etc. The proposed research  has important implications for contributing to practical  solution of such problems through advanced numerical  methods.  The combination of theoretical strengths of the  Chinese participants and the practical experience of the US  participants should produce results which neither group  could accomplish without the collaboration.",
