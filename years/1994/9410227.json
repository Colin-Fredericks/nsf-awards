The research is a multi-pronged effort in  the area of detection for wireless communication networks.  The  first direction addresses multiuser receivers for Code-Division  Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.  These low complexity adaptive  multiuser detectors for CDMA systems are expected to operate  reliably in the presence of strong interferers.  Incorporation of  the proposed receivers into CDMA systems should lead to significant  capacity improvements for the future generation of wireless  networks.  The second direction is diversity reception for  multipath fading channels.  The methods studied are expected to  alleviate the shortcomings of the existing frequency diversity  receivers and improve the reliability of wireless communications by  resolving multipath present in the mobile environment.  The focus  of the third component of the research is adaptive equalization for  present digital mobile radio systems.  The thrust will be to find  receivers that are less complex and more reliable than those  currently sued.  The final direction is the investigation of  capacity improvement of packet radio or local area networks using  joint demodulation.",
