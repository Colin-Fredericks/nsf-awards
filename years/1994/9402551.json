 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work on Constraint  Imperative Programming (CIP) languages. A constraint  represents a relation that  should be maintained by a  computer program. Constraints have a number of  desirable  properties that make them useful in building systems such as  interactive graphical applications. They are declarative  statements, rather  than imperative statement; a programmer  need only to state ``what'' rather than  ``how''. Additional  advantages result from embedding support for constraints in  the programming language itself. First, it becomes  convenient for programmers  to use constraints. Second, the  language implementation can ensure that the  constraints are  checked automatically. Third, a more uniform and elegant  language can result from expressing standard constructs as  constraints.  Finally, more opportunities for optimization  are opened to the compiler.    In  this project, the activities include  investigating techniques for  compiling object-oriented  constraint imperative languages, such as  Kaleidoscope, to  produce efficient code. To accomplish this, the system   does as much compile time analysis of the constraints  as possible.  Other  activities include developing tools for  writing, browsing, and debugging  constraint imperative  programs, investigating the compilation of Kaleidoscope  programs to run on shared memory MIMD machines, and testing  the utility of this  class of languages by programming a set  of representative applications. Another  important focus is the development of a more efficient and powerful  constraint satisfaction algorithm. A final activity is work on debugging  support for constraint systems. The work on constraint satisfaction algorithms  and debugging is useful both to support constraint imperative languages,  as  well as other kinds of constraint-based systems.",
