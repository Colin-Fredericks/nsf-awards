 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410115  Silber       The investigator will develop equivariant bifurcation theory  for applications to symmetry-breaking bifurcations in  hydrodynamic systems and in globally coupled oscillator arrays.  The first part of the research focuses on translation symmetry  breaking in hydrodynamic systems that are extended in more than  one space dimension. Both the situation where translation  symmetry is broken spontaneously by an attracting solution of the  governing equations, and the situation where it is broken  externally by perturbing the equations will be considered. In the  former case, the manifestations of the underlying translation  symmetry in the possible evolution of instabilities of the  symmetry-broken state will be investigated. In the case of  external symmetry breaking, the research focuses on the specific  physical system of rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection; this is a  system for which it has already been established that breaking  translation symmetry can have a profound effect on certain  instabilities. The second part of the research project consists  of a group theoretic/dynamical systems analysis of the  $S_n$-equivariant Hopf bifurcation problem. This bifurcation  problem is pertinent to the dynamics of n globally-coupled  identical limit cycle oscillators. This research is motivated by  recent analytic and numerical studies of series arrays of  Josephson junctions. Global coupling represents an important  limiting case for the coupling of oscillators; this aspect of the  research project should contribute to our understanding of  oscillator arrays ubiquitous in the modeling of physical,  chemical, and biological systems.  ***",
