The proposed project  considers  research on: a) signal representation methodologies that would  combat environmental noise and non-linearities which detract from  automatic speech recognition,  b)  speaker variability which is a  source of uncertainty also in recognition, and is to be tackled  from a probabilistic point of view from collected (telephone)  speech corpus,  and, c) dialogue enhancement methodologies and  strategies, including recovery, in order to increase the  probability of correct recognition. Each of these three areas  comprise major deterrents to robust recognition that will be  investigated.  The overall objective of the project is to  consider integrated approaches to spoken-language system  robustness.

Flanagan, James L.; Levinson, Steve E.; Lin,  Qiguang and Davis, Donald  Rutgers University      Computational Models for Speech Generation   __________         This is the first year of a continuing award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language Technology   for cooperation between researchers at Rutgers University s Center for Computer Aids for Industrial  Productivity (CAIP), AT&T Bell Laboratories and General Dynamics Electric Boat Division.  The  research to be conducted concerns the generation of speech signals in terms of (a) an articulatory  description of the vocal system, and (b) a fluid dynamic solution to the generation, propagation, and  radiation of audible sound produced by the acoustic system.  This includes the computation of the  speech signal from first principles, using the Navier-Stokes description of fluid flow, already  demonstrated feasible.  Anticipated results include a potentially significant improvement in the  quality  of synthesized speech and fundamentally new and more robust designs of speech recognizers  stemming from a better understanding of the speech phenomena and how it can be made more  immune to interference.  Also it is expected that this research influence improvements in the coding  of speech at lower bit rates.

Shattuck-Hufnagel  SRI International      Modeling Disfluencies in Spontaneous Speech   __________         This is the first year of a continuing award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language Technology   initiative involving cooperation between researchers at SRI International, Stanford University and the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   The proposed project  considers research on the hypothesis  that disfluencies in spontaneous speech - pauses, repeated words, repairs, filled pauses, word  fragments,  and elongated segments - are far from random and that knowledge about their regularity  would shed light on aspects of human cognition  and provide principled methods for dealing with  them in spontaneous speech processing.  Several relevant disciplines are involved in this effort such as  human-computer interaction, linguistics, psycho-linguistics,  computational linguistics, prosody, and  speech technology.  The multi-disciplinary approach includes investigating the forms and distribution  of disfluencies across many corpora, conducting perceptual experiments to assess the saliency of  specific cues in the signal, and developing and evaluating new methods for automatic processing of  speech.

Boguraev  Brandeis University      A Core Lexical Engine: The Contextual Determination of Word Sense   __________         This is the first year of a continuing award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language Technology   initiative involving cooperation between r esearchers at Brandeis University and at Apple Computer.   The research involves the building of a generative lexical engine at the core which aids in the  determination of word sense following lexical properties considered composable in a  given phrasal  context.  The project instantiates a lexical semantic segment of a substantial fragment of English by  constructing such core lexical engine with the following components: a semantic typing system,  relational structures for all categories, and generative mechanisms enabling  extension and  identification of word sense in context.  The project is complementary to other initiatives to develop  linguistic infrastructure resources on a large scale, such as COMLEX and WordNet.  The project  develops mechanisms that carry out the specialized lexical inferences that result, through composition  of lexical types, in word sense determination.

Lafferty   Carnegie Mellon University      Grammatical Trigrams: A New Approach to Statistical Language Modeling   __________         This is the first year of a continuing award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language Technology   initiative involving cooperation between researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and  International Business Machines.  This project intends takes advantage of the simplicity of the  classical statistical trigram model of language while augmenting it with the syntactic and semantic  aspects which constrain the use of the new grammatical trigram model to advantage over the purely  stochastic model.  The concepts of  probabilistic link grammars are used in this research,  incorporating trigrams into a unified framework for modeling long-distance grammatical dependencies  in computationally efficient ways.   The methods proposed are expected to have greater predictive  power over current methods from the point of view of entropy measurements,  and to integrate finite-  state automata models and new statistical estimation a lgorithms with modern powerful machines  resulting in improved speech recognition, translation, and understanding systems.

Hobbs  University of Pittsburgh      Integrated Techniques for Generation and Interpretation   __________         This is the first year of a continuing award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language Technology   initiative involving cooperation between the University of Pittsburgh and the Stanford Research  Institute.  This project involves research on integrating the intentional and informational perspectives  in architectures for interpretation and generation of interactive discourse.  Particular problems  investigated include the recognition by the listener of the speaker s plan, a formalization of the notion  of  conversational record,  discourse structure from a computational point of view, and analysis of  implicatures involving quantity and similar phenomena involving interactions between the processes of  generation and interpretation.  Bases for the research are the use of abductive inference in finite-state  approximation methods and in knowledge-based systems, accommodation processes in interactive  discourse, generation of coherent text, use of defeasible reasoning in plan recognition, and utterance  planning to achieve communicative goals.
