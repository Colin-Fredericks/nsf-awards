 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the research is the design and evaluation of  hardware assets and software techniques to improve the  performance of the  memory hierarchy of high-performance  systems.    Processor speed has steadily  improved during the last decade  but memory latency and bandwith have been  progressing at a  slower pace.  Several techniques to reduce or tolerate high  memory latencies have recently surfaced.  Some of these  techniques are  evaluated using trace-driven and  instruction-level simulations of benchmarks.  A major thrust of the effort is to devise improvements  in the simulation  techniques, e.g., by using selective  sampling and parellel discrete event  simulation, so that  performance results can be obtained faster.  The experiments  in  parallel simulation serve as a test bed to  customize programs for  parallel execution.    Additional projects continuing present reserch include  the  design of cache coherence protocols with various block sizes  for transfer  and coherence.  These protocols are geared  towards a reduction in contention in  the interconnect of  shared-memory multiprocessors and a decrease in the amount  of traffic caused by sharing.  Similar goals are the subject  of software  techniques such as compiler directives for  bypassing the cache and placement of  data in the right  levels of the memory hierchy.",
