 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452514  Blaha  We propose to bring Carleton's observational astronomy program  into the 21st century through the introduction of  state-of-the-art technology in our laboratories and lectures.  This ILI project will equip a new astronomical image processing  lab which will enable our students to gather their own images  here on campus, to use modern astronomical software packages to  analyze their data and to interpret their results in a  collaborative research setting. Through experimenting with two  small format CCD cameras, we have found the ST-6 camera to be  the best choice in terms of high quality images and ease of  operation. We are requesting five new ST-6 CCD cameras to equip  the six 8-inch Meade reflectors used in observational labs,  with camera control and data acquisition to be provided by six  Macintosh Duo systems. These Macintosh computers will also be  used in the lab to run the Voyager II planetarium display  packages, telescope observing simulators as well as numerous  image analysis programs. A fully equipped software laboratory  will allow both introductory and advanced students to explore  the universe and to understand the celestial motions they  observe. Two Sun workstations will provide more powerful image  processing tools, access to data on the Internet and rapid  image data storage and retrieval when connected with the  network of Macintoshes. To provide more advanced research  opportunities, we are also requesting a Photometrics Star-1 CCD  and a spectrograph to be used with our permanently mounted  refractors. With these tools, students and faculty will create  new lab experiments to engage future generations of observers  and challenge them to learn the power of modern astronomical  observing techniques.  ***",
