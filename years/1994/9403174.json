Dr. Shear received his  doctoral degree from Stanford University under the supervision  of Professor Richard Zare. Dr. Shear will continue research at  Cornell University under the sponsorship of Profesor Watt Webb.  His postdoctoral research will involve technique development  and application of laser scanning fluoresence microscopy  imaging to study electrophysiological events in neurons. Longer  term, he plans to develop and utilize other fast analytical  techniques for characterizing dynamic chemical events in  biological systems.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.",
