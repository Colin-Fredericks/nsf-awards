The regeneration of  forest areas that have been cleared is one topic for which these  complex interactions are especially apparent.  This doctoral  dissertation research project will compare patterns of forest  regeneration in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where dense  forests were cleared by logging and fires in the late 19th  Century.  Some of these areas have experienced active  regeneration, while others remain \"stump prairies\" that  essentially are devoid of trees.  The project will focus both on  the factors that have influenced this differential regeneration  and on the impacts of vegetative patterns on current soil-  development processes.  Following identification of patterns of  forest composition before clearance through examination of  General Land Office survey records, contemporary stands of  homogeneous composition will be mapped using aerial photography.  Field observations will be made in a sample of sites of forest  composition, soil texture, soil fertility, and soil horizon  development.  These data will be analyzed along with  microclimatic data and information from historical sources to  identify the determine how various natural and human factors  influenced regeneration processes in different sites.  Analyses  of relationships between vegetative patterns and soil-development  processes will be undertaken through observations of the movement  of selected nutrients through the soil in different locations.       This project will provide valuable information about the  importance of specific natural and human factors in the ongoing  dynamics of change in forested regions, and it will address  import ant questions regarding processes that alter the  composition and quality of soils.  As a doctoral dissertation  improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable  a promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.",
