 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318675  Karasov         Feeding and digestion rates of some birds are particularly  high during fattening prior to migration, during wintertime  exposure to low temperature, and during postnatal growth. The  PI  will study how the avian gut adjusts to high feeding rate because  it is important and has been little studied. The adjustments are  important because they might influence stop-over times during  migration, wintertime distribution of birds, and the evolution of  growth and development patterns. Study of the gut  adjustments of  birds will also complement similar kinds of studies in mammals  that have biomedical significance. Finally, knowledge of  digestive capabilities and limitations should help in the design  of artificial diets for animals in captivity, and hence improve  husbandry practices for both endangered species in zoological  parks and animals with economic value.       The PI will study gastrointestinal adjustments to high  feeding rate in several avian species during migration, cold  acclimation, and postnatal growth. The PI will test for changes  in digesta retention time, amount of gastrointestinal tissue, and  tissue-specific levels of digestive enzymes and nutrient  absorption. These features are chosen because they determine  features of whole-animal nutritional performance such as  digestive efficiency and rate.  ***",
