 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dicyanate ester/polycyanurate thermosetting polymers are a  relatively new class of high-performance materials used in  electronic and composite applications, because of their excellent  dielectric properties.  This research program will investigate  the effect of network parameters on the properties of these  materials.  A series of oligomers of bisphenol A dicyanate  (trimer, pentamer, etc.) will be synthesized, and conversion-  versus-property relationships will be compared with that of the  monomer.  Since the relationships between conversion of cyanate  and network parameters will differ when different size oligomers  are reacted, and since the structure at full conversion is  identical for the different oligomers, the effects of network  parameters can be determined.  This novel approach overcomes  complications generally encountered when studying the effects of  network parameters in thermosetting systems that arise when the  structure of the repeat unit is charged.  The properties examined  will include the glass-transition temperature and the volume.  The conversion at gelation for the reaction of the various  oligomers will yield information concerning the magnitude of ring  formation in the reaction.  Experimental techniques will include  differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry, nuclear magnetic  resonance spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography,  and gel permeation chromatography.  %%%  This work will help our understanding of the origins of free  volume in the glassy state.  This is particularly important for  dicyanate ester materials since moisture absorption, which is  related to free volume, appears to adversely affect their thermal  stability.  The proposed work is also important for the  optimization of thermosetting properties and for the development  of models which predict the time and temperature dependence of  glassy thermosetting materials of potential use in composite  materials.",
