Dr. Sheldon Shore, Chemistry Department, Ohio State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research designed to expand and develop avenues for the preparation and study of organometallic transition metal cluster systems. Compounds derived from  ruthenium and osmium carbonyl clusters in which a boron is either incorporated at a cluster vertex or encapsulated within the metal core will be synthesized by reactions of borane with carbonyl or carbonylate metal clusters. The carbonylate anions will be further reduced with borane in hopes of obtaining species with multiple methylene bridges and reactions with carbon monoxide and hydrogen will be explored. The reduction of the ruthenium and osmium carbonyls with lanthanide metals will be used to prepare ladder polymers in which lanthanide/transition metal chains are joined by carbonyl linkages. With the development of the synthetic strategy, this work will be extended to a variety of transition metals and to alternative bridging groups such as cyanide. These ladder polymers will be loaded on hydroxylated magnesia and converted into bimetallic nanoparticles for use as catalysts and for studies of surface reactions.  Small metal containing particles are finding application in various areas of catalysis and as electronic devices. This project is aimed at preparing small \"clusters\" which are composed of a transition metal, such as ruthenium or osmium, and a boron atom or a more extended, sheet-like array of transition and  lanthanide metals. These will be converted into \"nanoparticles\" which will be characterized and evaluated for their chemical and catalytic properties.",
