 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419527  Wharton  This award supports a workshop entitled Antarctic Geographic  Information Systems.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together  experts in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and active  Antarctic researchers with an interest in spatial analysis to  assess the need for a US Antarctic Program (USAP) GIS and to  discuss how such a system might be developed.  The impetus for  holding this workshop is two-fold: 1) the spatial analysis  requirements of Antarctic researchers are growing rapidly; and 2)  the USAP requires objective input in order to prioritize research  support decisions relating to the potential development of a USAP  GIS.  The three day workshop will be hosted by the US Geological  Survey in Reston, Virginia, and will be by invitation.  The  organizing committee represents a good cross-section of the  Antarctic research community and all members are familiar with,  though not experts on, GIS.  Invited participants will include GIS  experts from universities, government agencies, and the private  sector, as well as active USAP researchers.  A workshop report  summarizing results from the workshop will be produced.",
