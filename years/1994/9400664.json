 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for funds for the next three years  (remainder of the GEM Boundary Layer Campaign) to analyze the data  that is being received from an induction magnetometer operating at  Iqaluit, Northwest Territories, Canada which is nominally  magnetically conjugate to South Pole, Antarctica.  The magnetometer  was built and installed at Iqaluit in June, 1993 with funds   provided under the GEM program and Grant # ATM-9111929.  The major  objective of the GEM Boundary Layer Campaign is to understand the  interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field and  the transport of energy across dayside boundaries.  Waves are an  important mediator of this transport of energy due to the  collisionless nature of the medium in which the boundaries are  imbedded.    Induction magnetometers measure the high frequency component  (greater than 0.1 Hz) of naturally occurring ULF waves in the  Earth's magnetosphere and in the solar wind which cannot be done  with conventional magnetometers.  Ground measurement and the study  of these waves in the magnetosphere is important because they are  of sufficiently short wavelengths to propagate as wave packers in  the Earth's magnetic field.  In such a mode of propagation the Pc  1 and Pc 2 waves can be used as probes of the topology of the  geomagnetic field and its boundaries.  Their resonant generation by  ions and the modification of their propagation by cold plasma  populations, indirectly provides a study of these particles.    The location at Iqaluit, MW Territories is vital because this site  permits a global study of the ULF waves by using several sites in  the Antaractic a which these waves are also measured as well as at  the Sondre Stromfjord site in Greenland.  Repetitive structure in  the wave form at two opposite hemisphere sites 180 degrees out of  phase can be an indication of closed magnetic field lines.  A time  delay between sites at different longitudes in either hemisphere  can give scale size and/or motion of the source  creating the waves.   Spacecraft making single point measurements are hard-pressed to  define boundaries, but done in correlation with multiple ground  measurements, as proposed here, one can begin to build a global  picture of the important dayside magnetospheric boundaries.  As a  result of this correlative work in providing \"space-truth\", ground  measurements in the future can monitor these boundaries and their  dependence upon solar wind and, ultimately, solar conditions.",
