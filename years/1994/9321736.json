 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321736  Holm-Hansen  The effects of increased ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on  planktonic ecosystems have been studied in some detail for  Antarctic waters but comparable studies have not been carried out  at high northern latitudes.  Recent evidence has documented a  thinning of ozone over Arctic seas, suggesting the potential for  similar UV effects in northern waters.  In this proposal we will  determine the effects of present-day ultraviolet radiation, as  well as the potential effects of increased UV irradiance, on  phytoplankton and ichthyoplankton in high Arctic latitudes.   Studies of Arctic phytoplankton, to be conducted in Norway, will  focus on (i) the effects of UV radiation on photosynthetic rates  and the effect on overall rates of primary production, (ii) the  extent to which cells can decrease their sensitivity of UV  radiation by synthesis of UV-absorbing compounds, (iii) species-  specific differences in UV resistance, and (iv) DNA repair  capacities which are unknown for northern plankton communites.   Studies of UV damage to ichthyoplankton have not been conducted  at either pole.  Recently developed methods allow us to measure  the amount of UV induced DNA damage in individual free-living  eggs and larvae.  The results of these studies, done at temperate  latitudes, have shown that the diel cycle of damage and repair,  the pre-exposure conditions, and interspecific differences  greatly effect the susceptablility to UV damage.  The present  study will be the first attempt to measure the impact of UV on  early life-stages of important polar fisheries species.  The  proposal brings together the investigators' skills in measuring  UV damage together with the unique location, collaborators and  technical capabilities of the laboratories in Tromso, Norway.",
