 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421863  Messing    This is a planning grant proposal to conduct a planning  meeting with potential industrial members to establish an   Industry/ University Cooperative Research Center for Particulate  Materials at Pennsylvania State University.    To remain competitive with the U.S. as well as internationally,  powder/particulate material industries must actively engage in the  technology improvement and development.  An Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Particulate Materials could provide  a horizontally-integrated, generic research program for the benefit  of the powder/particulate material processing and manufacturing  industries.  The major research thrusts include:  powder synthesis,  powder handling and flow, grinding and dispersion, press and sinter  systems, and characterization in support of these emphasis areas.    Currently, industry has already endorsed the concept of the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Particulate  Materials through cash membership from three companies and  equipment donations from three other.  A planning meeting is  scheduled to be held on September 27-28, 1994.  It is anticipated  that over 30 industrial representatives will attend the meeting.    The Program Manager recommends Pennsylvania State University be  awarded $10,000 for six months to conduct this planning meeting.",
