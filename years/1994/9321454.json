 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321454  Welker  The focus of this research is the use of transition-metal  substituted 1,3-diene complexes as substrates in cycloaddition  reactions, especially in Diels-Alder reactions.  Transition-metal substitution will be utilized to enhance the  reactivity of dienes as well as enhance the regio- and  stereoselectivity of subsequent cycloaddition reactions of  these dienes, especially in control of exo-endo ratios of  Diels-Alder products. It will be demonstrated how simple  changes in the metal's coordination sphere can profoundly alter  the stereochemical outcome of subsequent Diels-Alder reactions  thus providing some practical solutions to long standing  reactivity problems associated with the use of Z- and  1,1-disubstituted dienes in this reaction. Cleavage reactions  involving the metal substituted cycloadducts will show how  these metal substituted dienes can serve as synthons for  several dienes which normally have low reactivity in  Diels-Alder reactions. Transition-metal substituted chiral  dienes will be investigated as useful reagents for asymmetric  Diels-Alder reactions involving acyclic dienes which are  invariably poorer substrates in catalytic asymmetric  Diels-Alder reactions than cyclic dienes.  %%%  With this award the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the  research of Dr. Mark E. Welker of the Department of Chemistry  at Wake Forest University. Professor Welker will focus his work  in the area of development of synthetic methodology using  transition-metal substituted diene complexes in cycloaddition  reactions, one of the most important methods for constructing  complex ring systems.  ***",
