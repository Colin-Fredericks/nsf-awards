 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408920  Freeman    Under the direction of Dr. Leslie Freeman, Mr. James Pokines will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze  microfaunal materials excavated from the archaeological site of  El Juyo which is located in the Santander region of Spain. The  site was occupied by Paleolithic hunters and gatherers about  14,000 years ago and the intermittent habitation spans a period  of approximately 1,000 years. The extremely rich lithic and  faunal remains recovered provide a unique insight into human  adaptation at the end of the last Ice Age. Mr. Pokines wishes to  use the abundant micromammal remains which are also present to  reconstruct environment and determine how it changed over time.  Because larger mammals entered the cave as food and therefore  reelect human selection, they do not provide an accurate  environmental signal. The incorporation of micromammals however  results from a different process: owls which inhabited the cave  during human absence regurgitate pellets which contain the bones  of prey. Studies of modern owl behavior indicate that their prey  selection closely mirrors natural abundances of small mammals in  a region. Mr. Pokines will collect modern pellets to determine  the present day species composition. With this as a baseline, he  will then study the archaeological sample.    This work is important for several reasons. Archaeological data  provides excellent insight into human-environment interactions  over long periods of time. They shed light on how humans both  adapted to and in turn effected the natural surroundings on which  they depended for survival. The data collected by Mr. Pokines  will shed light on this relationship during an important period  of human prehistory. The research will also assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
