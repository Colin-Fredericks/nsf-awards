The  laboratory component will foster increased exploration, critical  analysis and hands-on experience in using state-of-the art  instrumentation by students enrolled in the course. Equipment will  be purchased to build five (5) electrophysiological workstations  including: electrophysiological instrumentation, computers, and  optical equipment. Emphasis will be placed on the use of  instrumentation, as well as graphical and statistical analysis of  data using computers and computer software. As a result of this  experience, students will learn concepts of neurobiology through  inquiry and experimentation. The students will also become familiar  with a computer and its application as a tool to gather and analyze  data, skills that are increasingly becoming a requisite for both  technical and non-technical careers. Approximately 40 students  annually will be able to increase their skills through enrollment  in the proposed computer-based neurophysiolocal laboratory.",
