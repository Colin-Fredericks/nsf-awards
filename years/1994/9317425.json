In  preliminary studies, gene fusions repressible by iron or manganese  or both were identified.  Three of these metal-regulated genes were  cloned and analyzed using molecular genetics.  In B. subtilis, iron  regulation appears to involve a regulatory protein similar in DNA  binding specificity to the enteric Fur protein.  There have been no  Fur homologs described to date from any gram positive organisms.   Unlike the enteric Fur protein, the B. subtilis iron-regulatory  protein appears to discriminate against manganese.  In the enteric  organisms manganese can mimic iron and repress siderophore  biosynthesis and other iron-regulated functions.  In contrast,  production of sideropheres in B. subtilis is insensitive to  manganese repression.  Conversely, our detection oh highly   sensitive manganese-specific transcriptional control suggests the  presence of a novel type of metalloregulatory system.  This system  may account, in part, for the many striking effects of manganous  ion on production of secondary metabolities in Bacilli and other  gram positive organisms.  In Bacilli, iron and manganese appear to  control distinct, but overlapping regulons.  For example, we have  identified sets of promoter fusions that respond selectively to  iron but not manganese or to manganese but not iron.  In one case,  we have genetically separated the iron and manganese responses.   These results suggest that these elements exert specific and  independent transcriptional control.  However, the mechanisms  allowing cells to selectively detect these elements and mediated  appropriated transcriptional responses are largely unknown.  We  will define the global effects of iron and manganese on gene  regulation and determine the molecular basis of selective gene  regulation.  Using protein gel electrophores is, we will identify  sets of metalloregulated proteins and determine the extent of  cross-talk among the different metal ion regulons.   Metalloregulated genes will be isolated using transposon Tn917-lacZ  and the DNA sequence determinants of metalloregulation defined.   This will provide the tools necessary for the genetic and  biochemical identification of the relevant metalloregulatory  proteins.  Characterization of these regulatory proteins promises  to shed light on how proteins can discriminate chemically similar  metal ions to effect selective transcriptional control.  %%%  This grant provides information on how bacteria respond to their  environment, especially as regards the presence of metals.  ***",
