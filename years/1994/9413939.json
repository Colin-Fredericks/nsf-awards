 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanneman    With National Science Foundation support, the University of  California, Riverside, will develop a networked computing  infrastructure for the departments of political science and  sociology. This will consist of: a central Unix machine providing  remote-login service for all users as well as data-storage  facilities; two fast workstations providing processing power for  users working on large data sets or computationally intensive  problems; 16 Pentium based machines and various other PCs which  will serve as X-Windows terminals. Several existing machines will  be upgraded to have X-Windows capability and all will be  connected via the University's ethernet. The server and  workstations will run a variety of statistical software through  SAS, SPSS and Gauss and these will provide primary tools for data  analysis.    This system will be used by both faculty and graduate students  and serve both research and training purposes. Projects to be  conducted involve analyses of: congressional roll-call data, data  on Supreme Court opinions, the performance of different maximum-  likelihood estimators on the choice problems faced by voters in  multiple-candidate elections, simulation of models of social  processes, Mexican politics, and the sociology of garment  manufacturing in Los Angeles. Currently the research in the  departments of sociology and political science is constrained by  computer limitations. This award will remedy that situation.",
