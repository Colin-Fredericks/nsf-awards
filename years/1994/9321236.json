 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321236  Lau    The vote decision is made in the context of a dynamic ever-  changing information environment, and yet the chief methodology  with which political scientists study elections, surveys, is a  static one.  This investigation explores the information  acquisition and choice strategies employed by voters during  political campaigns with a new research technique, a dynamic  process tracing methodology, that allows the vote decision to be  studied while it is being made.    The essence of this methodology is to provide information about  (fictitious) candidates in a manner that allows the researchers  to record and study the way in which that information is  gathered.  This is accomplished by the use of modern, multi-media  computer technology.  Information about candidates (e.g., policy  positions; background/personal characteristics) is stored in the  computer; however, only brief \"labels\" for this information  (Smith' stand on issue \"A\") are visible and the information must  be physically \"accessed\" (by clicking a mouse) for it to be  learned.  The labels \"scroll\" down the computer screen so that  only a limited amount of information is available at any given  time.  This scrolling emulates the dynamic, ongoing nature of  political campaigns.      The implications of this research for models of the vote decision  and for basic theories of democracy are significant. A new  methodology is developed that, for the first time, will allow a  direct assessment of how voters, with more or less personal  resources (i.e., expertise), gather information about candidates  involved in political campaigns in more or less demanding  situations.  With this methodology scientists can explore how  expertise and broad campaign strategies affect the ways  information is gathered and combined into a decision, and how  those factors affect the normative \"correctness\" of the vote  choice.  These are new questions for political scientists, and  this methodology promises to open many new fertile research  qu estions for study.  ***",
