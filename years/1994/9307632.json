This work aims  to build a comprehensive  understanding of the processing of  spatio-temporal signals.  It is  founded on recent results obtained  by the proposer showing that very  large classes of continuous  functionals and shift-invariant  functional maps can be uniformly  approximated by certain  conceptually simple neural-like  structures.  These structures are  the Function Space Neural Networks  (FSNNs) that involve a  preprocessing linear operation  stage such as convolution with  suitable kernel functions, followed  by a network of nonlinear cells.   The project shall address key  issues pertaining to the design and  use of FSNNs.  These include  determination of suitable kernel  functions, network size,  connectivity patterns and form of  nonlinearity for different problems  classes, effectiveness of alternate  learning algorithms and their  convergence rates, and techniques  for constructive/destructive  network growth.  Anew call of FSNNs  based on higher order networks that  have proved very effective for  static classification, will also  propose be evaluated.  Theoretical  studies shall be supplemented by  extensive simulations using several  suites of spatio-temporal signals  ranging form low-dimensional  artificial patterns to a set of  over 1000 short duration signals  representing actual passive sonar  returns form underwater biologics.   This work shall try to raise the  understanding of the capabilities  and usability of artificial neural  network structures for the   processing of spatio-temporal  signals to a level comparable to  that achieved at present for  (static) multilayered feedforward  networks.  ***",
