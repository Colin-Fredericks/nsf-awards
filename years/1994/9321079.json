 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Nancy S. True of the Chemistry Department of the   University of California at Davis will pursue a research program to   determine if the kinetics of simple conformational processes in the gas   phase is significantly influenced by restricted intramolecular   vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).  To this end the fall-off curves   (i.e. unimolecular rate constants vs. pressure) will be determined under   experimental conditions that will help address this question.    Calculation of the energies, symmetries, and anharmonic coupling   constants for vibrational states above the threshold energy will be used   to develop models for the IVR process in the critically energized   molecules. These models will be used in fall-off calculations employing a   relaxation matrix approach which explicitly includes competition between   IVR and decay.  The studies are a first attempt to relate the   experimentally determined shape of the fall-off for conformational   processes to a kinetic model containing a description of the IVR process.    Experimental fall-off curves will also be compared to those calculated   using standard RRKM theory in order to test its realm of validity in   transition state chemistry.  The experimental techniques to be used in   this work include high pressure gas phase  NMR.  Methyl nitrite,   cyclohexane, and sulfur tetrafluoride, as well as processes involving the   internal rotation dynamics in amides and substituted ethanes,   trimethylsilyl group rotation in tetramethylsilylcyclopentadiene,   pseudorotation in fluxional inorganic molecules and ring inversion in   unsaturated six-membered rings will be investigated.    The intramolecular redistribution of vibrational energy is at the heart   of theories of chemical reaction  dynamics and equilibrium.  Several   theories have ben proposed to account for such redistribution processes,   the most prominent of which is that proposed by Rice, Rams perger, Kassel,   and Marcus, which is known under the acronym RRKM theory.  This theory is   based on a statistical model of energy flow and recent spectroscopic   experiments have indicated that not all intramolecular energy   redistribution can be accounted for by it. The research performed in this   project, using different experimental techniques,  will provide   additional data which will help delineate the range of applicability of   the RRKM theory.",
