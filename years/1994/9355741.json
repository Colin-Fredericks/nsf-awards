 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355741  Olejniczak    The Carnegie Science Center (of Carnegie Institute) and Carnegie  Mellon University (Center for Light Microscope Imaging and  Biotechnology, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology  Center, and The Studio for Creative Inquiry) have initiated a  collaborative project that portends to change in a dramatic fashion  the planetarium theater as a tool for informal science education.   After several months of preliminary discussions and, now, the  beginning of work, the creative team has been assembled that is  defining the vision and executing the program of this exciting  project.    The vision being formulated is the transformation of The Henry Buhl  Jr. Planetarium into a new visualization environment to achieve an  interdisciplinary and interactive group learning experience.  We  call this new concept the \"Group Immersive Visualization  Environment (GIVE).    GIVE will accomplish much of the impact of virtual reality by  combining \"three-dimensional\" images generated by Evans &  Sutherland's Digistar Projection System with real and animated,  high-resolution video computer images and multimedia and by  providing direct audience-control of program direction via The  Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium's elaborate 156-seat, electronic  response system.    While we anticipate the eventual production of a series of programs  in a variety of subject fields, the first to utilize GIVE will be  \"Journey to the Center of the Cell,\" a 35-minute presentation.  The  treatment will convey an experience of self-discovery and natural  wonder as audiences transport themselves through striking  visualizations of the living cell.    Production and evaluation of \"Journey to the Center of the Cell\"  and the development of the Group Immersive Visualization  Environment will occur under the auspices of staff of The Henry  Buhl Jr. Planetarium, key personnel from Carnegie Mellon  University, evaluator Harris H. Shettel, and an Advisory Panel  consisting of key planetarium and eductional profes sionals.    Program production packages, incorporating compatible components of  \"Journey to the Center of the Cell,\" will be produced, marketed and  distributed to public and school planetariums; and a Teacher  Resource Kit containing supplementary educational materials in the  form of video tapes, CD-ROMS and computer disks wil extend the  program's reach into the classroom.    Special relationships and viewing times will be offered at The  Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium targeting Pittsburgh inner city schools  and regional districts containing large percentages of underserved  and minority students.",
