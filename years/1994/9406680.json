 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406680     Boggess  This proposal focuses on the application of ultrafast optical  techniques, based on a broadly-tunable femtosecond optical  parametric oscillator, to the measurement of hot carrier  relaxation, optical nonlinearities, and carrier transport in  GaInAsSb/A1GaAsSb quantum wells and related ternary and binary  heterostructures.  The extent to which band structure engineering,  through both strain and quantum confinement, influences these  properties will be explored.  Pump-probe spectroscopy, transient  grating techniques, and time-resolved photoluminescence  upconversion techniques will all be employed.  The semiconductor  samples to be used in this research will be provided by The Hughes  Research Laboratories (HRL) as part of a long-standing, broadly-  based collaborative program.  While the ultimate goal of these  studies is to enhance the knowledge base required to improve mid-IR  optical and optoelectronic devices, it is emphasized that the  proposed measurements will provide information related to the  fundamental physics of this largely unstudied materials system.   Specifically, these measurements will provide insight into carrier  energy relaxation through both inter- and intravalley electron-  phonon scattering, the relationship between the engineered band  structures and nonlinear susceptibilities, which in turn are  related to dipole transition matrices and energy band separations,  and the fundamental scattering processes that determine the nature  of both in-well and cross-well carrier transport in Sb-based  multiple quantum wells and superlattices.  ***",
