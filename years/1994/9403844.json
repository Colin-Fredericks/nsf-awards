 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403844  Rogers         This project will support an ongoing study of a family of  problems in phase transitions.  The problems come from three  areas of application: mechanics (liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and  multiphase-solid transitions), superconductivity, and magnetism  (rigid ferromagnets as well as magnetostrictive materials).  The  research primarily involves studying static problems of energy  minimization and trying to characterize the set of metastable  states (local minimizers) of the energy.  The goal is to describe  hysteresis (which occurs in all of these problems) in terms of  these metastable states.  The primary technique is to model the  physical problems being studied using relaxed, nonlocal energy  functionals.  Stationary points and/or relative minimizers are  found using techniques of integral equations, convex analysis,  and methods from the calculus of variations.  Numerical  algorithms are developed to approximate solutions of the  Euler-Lagrange equations.         The most useful properties of many high-tech materials (e.g.   shape memory alloys, magnetic and magnetostrictive materials, and  superconductors) are caused by the material undergoing a change  of \"phase.\"  Often, these phase changes do not occur smoothly,  but instead, exhibit wild oscillations at a microscopic level.   In the last century, there has been a great deal of empirical  study of these phenomena by materials scientists.  But it was  only in the past decade that mathematicians began to turn these  investigations into a more quantitative science.  The current  project aims to make quantitative predictions of the behavior of  large-scale material structures based on fundamental models of  the internal energy.  The project combines elements of  mathematical modeling, mathematical analysis, and the development  and analysis of new numerical algorithms.  The proposed  applications are to liquid-vapor transitions, crystal growth,  shape memory alloys, magnetic and magnetostrictive materials, and  superc onductors.",
