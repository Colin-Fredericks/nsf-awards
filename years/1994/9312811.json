 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312811   DePablo  This award supports Dr. Juan DePablo and two graduate students of the  University of Wisconsin to collaborate in theoretical chemical  engineering research with Professor Hans C. Oettinger of the Polymer  Institute of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.   Professor Oettinger is a world-renown authority in the mathematical  aspects of stochastic methods, and his institution has some of the  world's fastest supercomputers.  The Department of Chemical  Engineering at the University of Wisconsin is one of the world's  foremost centers for the development and application of the theory of  transport phenomena to the solution of chemical engineering problems.   These complementary strengths are well suited to the goal of their  collaboration, which is to develop stochastic methods to the point  where they become a standard tool for the solution of problems in  transport phenomena. They will do this by investigating the  mathematical foundations of such methods and by applying these to a  wide variety of engineering applications, beginning with the  rheological behavior of polymer melts after cessation of different  types of flows.  They will compare their theoretical work with  experimental data generated by colleagues of Professor Oettinger at  ETH-Zurich.    Stochastic methods are playing an increasingly important role in the  solution of complex, multidimensional problems.  They were first  developed and are now widely used in physics and mathematics, but  this  sophisticated mathematical approach has not been fully  exploited in chemical engineering.  Stochastic methods are remarkably  simple compared to some other methods, and they appear to work in  some complex problems resistant to traditional analytical treatment.   On the other hand, they are not always superior to numerical methods.   Substantial work, such as that proposed here, is necessary to explore  the advantages and practical applications in chemical engineering.  ***",
