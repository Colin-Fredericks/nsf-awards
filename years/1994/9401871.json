 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401871  Teboulle    The research program will focus on proximal-like methods and  their applications to nonlinear constrained optimization  problems.  Central to this study is a recently proposed new class  of proximal-like mappings associated with closed convex  functions, where the usual quadratic term is replaced by a kind  of quasi-distance.  When applied to the dual of an optimization  problem, these give rise to wide variety of modified Lagrangians  methods which have many attractive properties not present in the  classical quadratic augmented Lagrangian.  The research project  will attempt to provide a unifying framework for the design and  analysis of modified multiplier methods for solving nonlinear  programming problems.  The program's objective propose to sharpen  and extend the mathematical theory needed to analyze the above  algorithms.  In particular, the research will consider new  variants of modified Lagrangians for both convex and nonconvex  programs, and will develop a complete convergence theory.   Related decomposition algorithms within the proximal framework  will also be investigated.    This project will focus on the study and development of new  methods for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems.   Such problems consist of minimizing/maximizing an objective  subject to some constraints which are determined by the nature of  the particular model/problem.  Optimization techniques play a  central role in the solution of fundamental problems arising in a  wide range of applications such as: computerized tomography,  finance, geophysical sciences, production and manufacturing,  robotics, to mention just a few.  One area of this research will  concentrate on developing the mathematical theory needed to  analyze a new class of methods for solving nonlinear problems. In  particular, the PI will focus on the design and analysis of  reliable and fast algorithms.  The second main research area will  concentrate on decomposition methods for large scale problems.  Recen t advances in computer technology have motivated the search  for constructing new algorithms for specific classes of large  scale problems, by taking full advantage of the structure of this  problem classes.  Such problems arise for example in structural  optimization, water distribution systems, and planning problems  under uncertainty.  Here, the PI will study and develop splitting  methods, which are leading to highly parallel algorithms.  In  both areas, the role of optimization methods is central.   Improvement of methods and their practical applications would  thus have a beneficial impact on contributing to the solution of  real life problems.",
