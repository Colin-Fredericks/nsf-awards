 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313797  Cotton  This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. F. Albert Cotton of the  Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University, into the nature of  metal-metal multiple bonding by transition metals.  Compounds  containing multiply bonded ruthenium and osmium are well known, but  in these investigations some unusual compounds will be synthesized  and characterized.  The scope of multiple bond chemistry will be  extended by synthesis of species containing V, Nb, Ta, Fe, Ir and  Pt.  For some of the metals more commonly associated with this type  of bonding (Os, W, Re, Pt), new compounds in higher oxidation  states will be investigated.  In addition, the internal movement of  metal-metal dimers within the confines of the ligand cage will be  studied.  Also to be prepared are oligomeric and polymeric  compounds in which metal metal dimer units are linked by pi-  electron containing species, in order to probe the magnetic and  electronic interactions along the chain or within a sheet.    In dimeric compounds which contain two transition metals bonded to  each other, triple and quadruple bonds are sometimes observed.  The  goal of this research is to test whether this type of bonding is  possible with certain metals or metals in higher oxidation states  for which it has not previously been observed.  Research in this  area contributes to the basic understanding of bonding and  reactivity in organometallic cluster molecules, which have been  found to be important in catalyzing organic reactions.  Additionally, understanding compounds of this type contributes to  knowledge of some types of solid-state electronic and optical  devices and some potential anti-tumor agents.",
