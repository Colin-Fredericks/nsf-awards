 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416393  Wyllie  Current code provisions for structural walls with openings  result in substantial reinforcing requirements for both new  construction and the retrofit of existing construction.  In  the case of retrofit, the upgrade cost is typically close to  or exceeds the building replacement cost.  Existing  buildings are commonly demolished and replaced with a  building incorporating a potentially less reliable lateral  forced resisting system.    The objective of this project is to develop performance-  based retrofit guidelines.  A focused research project is  conducted to identify appropriate analysis and design  methodologies for both new and existing construction.    The Northridge Earthquake provides an excellent opportunity  to study the performance of \"older\" reinforced concrete  buildings constructed with perforated shear walls.  The  primary effort of the research will be to compare expected  versus observed building performance and to assess current  retrofit strategies of buildings utilizing perforated  reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls for lateral load  resistance.  The results of the research have the potential  to significantly impact the development of design guidelines  for RC perforated shear walls.    The project team for this research project combines the  talents of  \"research\" and \"practicing\" engineers.  This  collaborative effort will enable the project to encompass  the broad spectrum of design and retrofit issues associated  with perforated shear walls necessary to assess the current  state-of-the-practice as well as future research needs.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
