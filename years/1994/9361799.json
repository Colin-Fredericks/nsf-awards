 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361799  Dixon  Analytical techniques, based on fluorescent lifetime measurements are currently being  developed for applications in clinical chemistry and biological research.  By measuring  the phase of the fluorescent emission from a sample relative to that of an RF-modulated  excitation source, it is possible to accurately determine the fluorescent decay  rate.  Although sensitive phase fluorometers have been constructed in a number of  research laboratories, they require the use of large, expensive laser sources to excite the  fluorescent sample.  The commercial introduction of a phase fluorometer requires the  development of compact, efficient laser sources with the correct combination of output  power, wavelength and modulation bandwidth.    Diode-pumped, intracavity sum frequency lasers can be modulated at rates up to 1 GHz  and are capable of producing output powers in the blue and green that are greater than  25 mW.  In this Phase I SBIR program we will investigate the feasibility of using a sum  frequency laser to excite the sample in a phase fluormeter.  A 490 nm sum frequency  laser will be built and its modulation bandwidth and output power determined.  The  source will then be imaged into a commercial fluorescence microscope and the  modulation depth of the fluorescent output determined as a function of input frequency.  ***",
