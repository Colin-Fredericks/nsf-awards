 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354094  Skidmore    The continuing Committee on Women is Science and Engineering  (CWSE), within the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel  of the National Research Council, is comprised of expert scientists  and engineers who are particularly knowledgeable about the  underparticipation of women in the technological work force of the  United States.  This project helps to fund activities of the  Committee to achieve greater representation of women in science and  engineering (S&E) at undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and  professional levels in the United States.  CSWE is continuing and  expanding the multifaceted program of activities developed during  the past three years to address the unerrepresentation of women in  S&E careers.     While recognition of the barriers to participation in science and  engineering by women, and of the need for more comprehensive  measures to spur the development of female scientists and  engineers, have been evident for some time, parity representation  of female scientists and engineers has not been achieved.  CWSE is  helping to address this problem by:  serving as a resource to  collect and disseminate data on the needs of and opportunities for  women in science and engineering; exerting its influence on the S&E  community, and society as a whole, working toward the removal of  barriers to the participation of women in the sciences and  engineering; encouraging interactions between concerned groups; and  stimulating development of innovative programs to increase the  representation of women in scientific and engineering careers.  The  Committee is setting an example in the S&E community, playing an  effective role in revealing the status of and the opportunities for  women in these areas in society, as well as making recommendations  for policy and program changes that will enhance the participation  of women in S&E careers.  ***",
