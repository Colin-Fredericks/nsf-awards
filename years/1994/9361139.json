 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361139  Shaffer    In the near future, our children will make choices that will  significantly change all life on earth.  Thus, it is imperative  that they obtain a coherent overview of how the biosphere operates  and of how they are participants in that operation.  A fascination  for children of all ages and attitudes, Closed-Ecological-Systems  (CES)--developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for Life-  Support Studies and further researched for the past two decades at  the University of Hawaii--are a gallon-sized simplified analogue of  the biosphere that will autonomously recycle its elements and  support life for decades.  While CES, which are considered  authentic \"mini-planets,\" have obvious instructional value  concerning global ecologic topics, currently marketed CES novelties  are static and of limited usefulness.  This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to investigate  the feasibility of developing a specialized interactive CES-  photobioreactor containing shrimp-algae and even fish-plant  ecosystems and incorporating accurate but inexpensive  instrumentation; accompanied by defined media; experimental  protocols; and short instructional text modules to serve as a  supplemental educational aid applicable to grades K-12.   The project has the potential to contribute a hands-on approach to  explore a variety of major ecologic principles from the simple to  the sophisticated and to offer the educator a vehicle for which to  introduce related environmental subjects.  ***",
