The biochemistry laboratory serves an  active and growing B.S., Biochemistry degree program. The  instrument will be used to implement a new experiment measuring  rates of protein turnover in cultured cells under a variety of  conditions in the biochemistry laboratory. This experiment has been  carefully designed to 1) teach students the theory and practice of  radioisotope handling and detection, 2) provide an interesting and  challenging laboratory experience, 3) enable students to perform  standard computations and corrections associated with the use of  multiple isotopes, quenching, and isotope dilution, and 4) convey  procedures and practices associated with safe handling and disposal  of radioisotopes. The requested instrumentation will also be used  extensively by students in active undergraduate research programs.  Research is an essential component of the educational process at  CSUF and has been highly successful by a number of criteria  including publications co-authored by students and entry of  students into graduate programs in the sciences.",
