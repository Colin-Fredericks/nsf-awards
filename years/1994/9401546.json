 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401546  Lin       This award supports mathematical research on problems in  nonlinear partial differential equations, variational calculus  and geometric measure theory.  In the first part, work will be  done analyzing singularities which contain the generalized  version of Reifenberg's theorem and its applications, the p-  harmonic mapping approach to Ginzburg-Landau vertices and the  study of dynamic and deformation of defects in nematics.  In  addition, an investigation defects in biaxial liquid crystals  will be initiated.  The second part of the project concerns the  evolution of liquid crystals.  It is represented by a  nonlinear system which can be viewed as a nonlinear  coupling between flow of harmonic maps and a Navier-Stokes  system.  Of particular interest is the determination of global  existence, uniqueness and stability of classical or weak  solutions.  Work will also be done in studying the partial  regularity of such systems by exploring free interface problems  arising in elasticity, optimal design and liquid crystal  droplets.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.   ***",
