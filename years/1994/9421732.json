The conference is the first of its kind in New England, and is being sponsored by the Pollution Prevention Consortium of New England Universities.  It expects to attract and involve juniors, seniors and graduate students and faculty from a variety of disciplines.  Students already participating in pollution prevention research will be invited to present their results at the conference and share their experiences.  The conference will provide a forum for the exchange and demonstration of pollution prevention activities among students, and for the discussion and dissemination of pollution prevention education programs among faculty and educators.  Speakers from industry, academia, and state and federal agencies will participate.  Partial support has also been obtained from the US EPA and the US DOE.",
