 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320247  Kohler  Oceanography, like high energy physics (HEP) and astronomy, is a  \"big\" science.  Much of the study of the oceans requires very large  teams of researchers with support technicians and massive  investments for instrumentation, facilities, drilling platforms,  etc.  Indeed, oceanography is the most highly-funded per capita of  all sciences, including physics.  Unlike HEP and astronomy,  oceanography is much more an interdisciplinary science drawing on  scientists whose degrees are in fields like biology, physics,  chemistry, and geology.  Further, much of the science has practical  application.  Despite--or perhaps because of--this  interdisciplinarity and practical, economic implications, the  history of oceanography has hardly been examined.   Helen  Rozwadowski, under the direction of Dr. Kohler, is examining the  origins of oceanography in the United States and Britain.      In the 19th century, the deep ocean was largely unfathomable:  a  dangerous byway that became a location for commercial and military  work on an unprecedented scale.  Because of commercial necessity,  however, scientists were driven by the 1880's to attempt to  understand what transpired below the surface of the oceans.  Ms.  Rozwadowski has already undertaken the American half of her study.   With this dissertation grant, she will be able to fill out the  British part of this program. British investigation of the deep  ocean was firmly rooted in the long tradition of peace-time  scientific exploration, to which a group of natural scientists who  formed the various Dredging Committees of the British Association  for the Advancement of Science brought new questions about the deep  ocean and its strange inhabitants.  Submarine telegraphy was a  primary instigator for these studies.  The question the politicians  and industrialists gave to the scientists and engineers was how to  link via underwater telegraph cable various parts of the empire  upon which \"the sun never set.\"  To accomplish this goal,  scient ists had to borrow industrial technologies ranging from  mining hoists to piano wire.  Producing scientific knowledge about  the deep ocean required oceanographers to integrate natural history  with existing maritime practices and customs, usually under  difficult physical conditions of constrained space, harsh  discipline, bad weather, and worse food. Scientific work at sea  involved a series of complex relationships -- between officers and  common seamen, military men and civilian gentleman naturalists,  mariners and landlubbers.  The conflicts and potential for  cooperation inherent in these relationships and their negotiation  at sea shaped the practice of oceanographic work.  By examining how  the science of oceanography rose out of the very different cultures  of Britain and the United States, Ms. Rozwadowski promises to  expand greatly our understanding of how this science developed in  one of the biggest of big sciences today.  ***",
