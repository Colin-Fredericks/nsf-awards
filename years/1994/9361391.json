 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361391  Arya  Thermal management is one of the  critical aspects in the design of  the 2 and 3 dimensional multichip   modules (MCM's) to ensure  reliability at increased functional  densities in electronic devices.  Diamond  has the highest know  thermal conductivity and yet is an  electrical insulator. It is proposed  to deposit high quality diamond  films on high thermal conductivity  metal matrix composite heat sinks  which will allow  powder dissipation  of several hundreds of watts in the  advance MCM packaging concepts.  Recent  developments in fullerene  chemistry show that the carbon atoms  in the pentagons of the spheroidal   molecules of C60, C70, etc are  predominantly Sp3 hydribdized and  are sterically fairly close to the  diamond.  MER has demonstrated that  a small amount of rearrangement of  these atoms in highly energetic  plasma  can result in transformation  of fullerenes into diamond. This  unique fullerene vapor phase  precursor  process will be  demonstrated and optimized to  produce will bonded, high quality  thin and thick diamond  films at  very high growth rates and at low  temperatures on the MMC and other  electronic substrates.  Single,  hybrid and magnetically enhanced  plasma systems will be investigated  along with different plasma  gas  chemistries to produce  polycrystalline diamond films as  well as free standing film of  geological size  and quality diamond  which will establish a basis for  Phase II optimization and scale-up  to economically  produce diamond  films.  ***",
