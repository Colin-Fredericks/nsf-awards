 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404316  Schwartz        This award supports mathematical research on problems whose  solutions will derive from a combination of techniques from the  theory of orthogonal polynomials in one and several variables,  hypergroups and measure algebras.  Hypergroups are relatively new  mathematical constructs.  They arise when one wishes to perform a  harmonic analysis of functions defined on subsets of Euclidean  space when the sets are not groups.  This loss of structure can  often be compensated if the measures on the set form a hypergroup  or some more general measure algebra with basis functions as  characters.  Building on the previous work which focused on  compact one-dimensional hypergroups whose characters are  polynomials or eigenfunctions of Sturm-Liouville equations,  efforts now will be made to extend the structure theorems to non-  compact hypergroups.  Work will also be done investigating those  hypergroups on n-dimensional space that have polynomials  characters and those which have characters which satisfy  differential equations.  The development of harmonic analysis of  hypergroups, and, in particular, understanding the structure of  hypergroups through their subgroups will also be carried out.   Finally, the properties and harmonic analysis of non-hypergroup  measure algebras with character sets consisting of spherical wave  functions and other special functions will be studied.   Undergraduates, supported by the grant, will participate in  developing examples and computer checks of relevant symbolic  computations.        Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are  examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing a continuous d ecomposition.  Orthogonal polynomials  play an important role in certain segments of harmonic analysis  because (a) they arise naturally in the study of differential  equations (b) they can be used to represent large classes of  functions and (c) they are often easily computable.  ***",
