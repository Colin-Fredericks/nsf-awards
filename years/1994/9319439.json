 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319439  Hook    Cell-cell communication in neuroendocrine systems utilizes small,  potent, peptide hormones and neurotransmitters that are secreted  from nerve cells.  These peptide hormones and peptide  neurotransmitters are synthesized as large protein precursors or  prohormones that require specific proteolytic processing to yield  the smaller physiologically active peptides.  The prohormone  processing enzymes represent an important point of regulation since  it is this step where the inactive prohormone is converted to the  smaller active forms.  Active processing enzymes are prerequisite  for the formation of potent functionally relevant neuropeptides.   Dr. Hook i examining the role of a 70 kDa aspartyl protease in  manufacturing enkephalin and neuropeptide Y peptides from its  larger precursor products.  These two peptides serve very important  functions.  Enkephalin is an endogenous opiate that plays a  critical role in controlling pain and Neuropeptide Y is shown to be  involved in feeding, shifting of biological rhythms, hypotension  and reproduction.  Dr. Hook will use state-of- the-art technologies  to purify and characterize this enzyme.  She will then generate  large quantities of the prohormone to establish that the newly  purified protease produces enkephalin and neuropeptide Y.  Finally,  Dr. Hook will use a technique called directed mutagenesis to  determine the specific sites of action of the 70 kDa aspartyl  protease.  The results from this work is fundamental for  understanding  the molecular basis of precursor processing in  generating active neuropeptides as well as contributing to a more  general understanding about the control of biologically important  messengers.  The greatest promise of this basic research on how  peptides are normally regulated may be in ultimate treatment of  drug addiction since it appears that the regulation of the levels  and activities of enkephalin may be involved.  ***",
