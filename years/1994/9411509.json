 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  a  proposal to examine the impact  of  major  technological  and  market structure changes  on  individual  occupational and firm mobility opportunities.   It  will  be  carried out through comparative analysis of both individual-  level   and  society-level  data  from  the  United  States,  Germany,  Sweden,  and the Netherlands.  At  the  individual  level,  longitudinal  data extending  over  approximately  a  decade will be examined using a discrete-time logit model.        The  links between the major changes occurring in  the  structure of economies as America and other countries  enter  the  post-industrial  era  and the  livelihoods  and  career  opportunities   of  individuals  are  still   insufficiently  understood.   This  project will help  us  understand  these  links  at  both a conceptual and empirical level through  an  extremely sophisticated examination of how the nature of the  labor  market, welfare state provisions, and other  features  of  the  four countries studied affect how societal  changes  reverberate   into   individual  work   lives   and   career  opportunities.   The results of this project have  important  potential policy significance as well through their  bearing  on individual welfare and national economic competitiveness.",
