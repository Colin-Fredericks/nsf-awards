 "awd_abstract_narration": "The apical and root meristem are the most important  structures of the plant embryo responsible for further  development.  These meristems give rise to the aerial and  underground portions of the mature plant.  Two aspects of  apical meristem development are central to its function.  First, the apical meristem must maintain a pool of  proliferating, undifferentiated cells.  This pool  continually provides new cells for organ generation.  Equally important is maintaining the balance between the  proliferation of the meristem cells and their subsequent  differentiation.  As meristem cells become distal to the  apical meristem tip as a result of cell division, these  distal cells must be allowed to enter a specific  developmental pathway leading to eventual differentiation.  Thus the apical meristem can be thought of as having two  zones, a central zone containing meristem cells in an  undifferentiated state (or uninduced towards a  differentiated state), and a surrounding peripheral zone  where cells are entering a specific developmental pathway  toward a differentiated state.  As a first step toward  determining the genes controlling meristem development,  mutations with defects in these two processes must be  identified.  CLV1 mutants develop excess undifferentiated  meristem cells and may be required to maintain the balance  between cell proliferation and cell differentiation in the  meristem.  Two other loci, CLV2 and CLV3, also appear to be  involved in the same process based on their similar  phenotype.  This investigator proposed to investigate  meristem development by addressing several questions:  (1)  What is the gene product encoded by the CLV1 locus; and does  this give any clues to its function?;  (2) What is the mRNA  expression pattern for CLV1?; (3) Does CLV2 function in the  same pathway as CLV1 and CLV3, and is there any evidence for  direct interactions between these loci?; and (4) Are there  other genes that interact with CLV1 and CLV3?  These studies  should provide exciting n ew information about some of the  genes and processes involved in meristem development.",
