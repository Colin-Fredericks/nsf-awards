This research focuses primarily on how the vascular plant community in Alaskan taiga vegetation changes during succession, and how these changes affect and are affected by the soil microbial community. Evidence exists to suggest that plant species may enhance their ability to occupy and maintain a site through modification of the soil environment. This occurs because the litter quality and chemical composition differs among tree species. Using field and laboratory procedures, this research will directly determine whether or not plant extracts affect microbial activities in associated soils.  %%%   The general notion that reciprocal interactions occur between aboveground and belowground processes has long been of interest, but rarely studies. With the development of new technology such questions are just beginning to be answered. This research will provide the baseline analyses for more detailed investigations of ecosystem feedbacks between aboveground and belowground communities.",
