Antigen is  presented to the T cell receptor in the form of a peptide which  binds within the helical bordered cleft of the class I molecule.   The molecular interactions involved in the presentation of the  peptide receptor are not fully understood.  Preliminary results  suggest that the class I molecule is structurally flexible and  susceptible to structural perturbations induced by beta-2  microglobulin, a 12 Kd protein non-covalently associated with class  I at the cell surface.  This research is designed to address the  role of class I structural flexibility and the relationship it has  to class I function.  Specifically, the role of beta-2  microglobulin in overall class I structure and function will be  investigated.  Discerning the role of beta-2 microglobulin in class  I structure will provide insight into the ability of class I to  bind and present a vast array of disparate antigenic peptides to  the T cell receptor.  %%%  The transplantation antigens were first shown to be responsible for  rejection of tissue transplants in mice.  The transplantation  antigens are cell surface protein molecules encoded by a multigene  complex known as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).  The  major gene families in this complex have been designated class I,  II, and III.  Products of the genes are now known to play a crucial  role in the recognition by the immune system of cells bearing  foreign antigens on their surfaces.  The subject of this research  is how the structure of the Class I molecule and an associated  protein, known as beta-2 microglobulin, affect their function in  recognizing foreign molecules.  This research will be carried out  by a new investigator at a predominantly undergraduate institution.   This research, therefore will not only contribute to our  understanding of rec ognition and response mechanisms in immune  function, but also enrich the environment for science education at  an institution with a high proportion of minority undergraduates.  ***",
