They are also one of the least studied for their importance in  energy flow, nutrient cycles and vertical fluxes in these  environments.    Planktonic sarcodines play an important role in the production of  organic material by organisms >70 um in oceanic plankton  communities (via their intracellular symbiotic algae).  Moreover,  by virtue of their large size (and consequently their potentially  rapid sinking rates) they also play a greater role in the flux of  material out of the mixed layer than would be predicted by their  overall contribution to planktonic biomass.  Previous studies  indicate great variability in the surface productivity and flux of  sarcodine material out of the mixed layer that may be related to  the reproductive periodicities of some species of symbiont-bearing  planktonic sarcodines or to episodic events leading to rapid  population growth.  This project will test this hypothesis, and  determine the extent to which these periodicities control the  temporal changes in the importance of planktonic sarcodines to  primary production in the surface waters of the oligotrophic  Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda, and to their flux out of the surface  waters at this site.  ***        The symbiont-bearing planktonic sarcodines (Acantharia, Radiolaria  and Foraminifera) are one of the most conspicuous groups of micro-  /macrozooplankton in the surface waters of oceanic communities.
