 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Penn State Graduate Research Traineeships focus on preparing  Mathematics Education or Science Education researchers in the areas  of cognition and technology.  Increasing access to new technologies  are suggesting fundamental questions about the content and nature  of mathematics learning and science learning in these environments.   The program includes courses and research experiences which provide  a firm foundation in research on mathematics or science teaching  and learning, a strong mathematics or science background (at or  beyond the masters level), a cutting-edge knowledge of emerging  technologies, an expertise in both qualitative and quantitative  research methods (with special emphasis on using interviews to  probe student understanding), and a deep understanding of cognition  and learning.  Trainees are involved in research on the teaching  and learning throughout their program.  In addition, the program  centers on the establishment and development of an international  dialogue on research issues culminating in an international  symposium on setting a research agenda on the impact of technology  on the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.  The  program is designed to prepare individuals at all levels  (elementary through undergraduate) whose research can contribute to  the knowledge base regarding the impact of technology on the  teaching and learning of mathematics or science.",
