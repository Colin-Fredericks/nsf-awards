 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408201  Thompson    The goal of this study is quantitative understanding of the origins  and evolution of texture during grain growth in thin films, and the  ability to accurately predict grain size and orientation  distributions as a function of thermal and process history of  different film/substrate combinations.  Experimental and  theoretical research on grain growth and texture evolution in  polycrystalline films is focused towards the competitive effects on  minimization of the film/substrate interface energy and  minimization of strain energy densities.  The research includes the   polycrystalline-silver/single-crystal-nickel system, silver/copper,  and a number of polycrystalline metallic films on a variety of  silica-coated substrates with different thermal expansion  coefficients.  Strain energy is controlled through the choice of  substrates and through modifications in thermal history.  Known  strains are imposed using 4-point and 3-point bending.  Texture  evolution is characterized using thin film X-ray diffraction and  several electron diffraction techniques.  Grain sizes are  characterized using electron and focused ion beam microscopy and  film stresses are monitored by measurements of wafer curvature,  both during and after heating and grain growth.  A computer program  for simulation of grain growth in thin films will be improved to  account for orientation-dependent strain-energy-density  differences, in both elastically strained and plastically deformed  films.    %%%  This research should improve technology for creating thin films  used in a variety of industrial applications.  ***",
