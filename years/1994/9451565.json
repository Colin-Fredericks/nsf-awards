 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451565  Ono  Macintosh computer workstations and analytical instruments are  requested to accommodate recent modifications of the curriculum in  the Department of Biological Science at California State University  Fullerton to include more investigative laboratories, encourage  cooperative interactions among students of diverse cultural  backgrounds, and improve scientific communication skills. The  equipment will be used in several upper division physiology  laboratories (Mammalian Physiology, Comparative Animal Physiology,  Plant Physiology, and Cellular Neurobiology) and in a required  Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory. Student Workstations  consisting of Apple PowerBook Duo Docks connected to a local  network controlled by a File Server will permit students to acquire  data from assorted physiological transducers when connected to  MacLab interfaces. The network will facilitate on-line analyses of  class data and foster discussions as the data are graphically  presented through a Presentation Workstation, consisting of an  Apple PowerBook with a color monitor and a color projection pad.  Student groups and instructors will develop multimedia  presentations on a Development Workstation that will permit  capturing video images from diverse sources. The portability of the  PowerBook and PowerBook Duo Dock System will maximize the use of  the computers since they can be used in the field or in other  laboratories for data entry and students may use them for  developing and giving their presentations in other locations. The  laboratories affected will be moving to a new building in Spring  1994 that will be configured for Ethernet connections to the campus  mainframe computer and will permit students to access external  databases. The equipment will greatly facilitate the goal of the  Department to continue to develop fundamental scientific skills,  including critical thinking, analytical reasoning, effective  communication, and the use of computers as tools of biological  investigation  in upper division classes.",
