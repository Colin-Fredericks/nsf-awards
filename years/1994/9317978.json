Acarologists, scientists who study mites and ticks, from as many as 50 different countries will give reports on basic science in 14 symposia, 12 submitted paper sessions and a workshop during the six day meeting.  The very broad program will include presentations on research in genetics, evolution, systematics, ecology, physiology and molecular biology of these organisms.  A plan has been developed to emphasize allocation of travel funds to junior scientists, graduate students and researchers from other countries who might otherwise not be able to attend.  %%%  Mites and ticks are important medically as disease vectors and parasitic organisms and economically for the status of many species as pests of crops and domestic animals.  This International Congress will provide an opportunity for researchers to from around the world to interact directly and to communicate recent research findings on many aspects of the biology of these organisms.  ***",
