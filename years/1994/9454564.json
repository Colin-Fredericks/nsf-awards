 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills curriculum project,  (SciTeKS), will fill the void of science-oriented technical courses  in Tech Prep and similar school-to-work transition high school  programs.  The project is designed to develop printed and  multimedia student and teacher materials for large context modules  involving chemistry, biology, and earth/space sciences. The  development will include curriculum design recommendations and  models, multimedia instructional and reference materials for  students, suggestions and models for implementation, support for  teachers, and guidance for assessment.  The curriculum will be  designed to develop in high school students skills in teamwork,  problem solving, communication, and other capabilities considered  critical for their success in the workplace and/or in further  education.  The SciTeKS project will provide a two-year science  curriculum for a variety of school-to-work programs.  Students  completing SciTeKS will be ideally prepared to enter immediate  employment or college technician programs based on biology,  chemistry, or earth/space sciences. The pedagogical strategies will  be developed by a team of high school, college, and",
