 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454729  Pea    The work in this proposal builds on the Learning Through  Collaborative Visualization (CoVis) Project, an NSF-AAT testbed.   CoVis has focused on three areas - project-enhanced science  learning, collaboration, and scientific visualization - as a means  for transforming science education.  Its goal has been to use next-  generation technologies to support the formation and work  activities of learning communities with media-rich communication  and scientific visualization tools in a highly interactive  networked collaborative context.  The NIE testbed will transform  the small-scale working CoVis model with three hundred participants  at the high school level into a large-scale Collaboratory, for  thousands of users in diverse settings.    In exploring networking infrastructures for education, it is  essential to recognize that \"infrastructure\" consists of more than  network connections and transport protocols.  To be effective,  support for networked learning communities requires three  interdependent components: technology infrastructure, educational  content infrastructure, and teacher support and development  infrastructure.  In order to characterize costs and outcomes, a  testbed also requires an evaluation and dissemination  infrastructure.    The technology infrastructure will provide students and teachers  with an environment to support collaborative learning that includes  video teleconferencing, collaboration software, a video server,  Internet tools, and software environments for open-ended science  investigations.    The educational resources infrastructure will take advantage of the  technology infrastructure to allow students and teachers to look up  and exchange a broad range of interactive multimedia learning  materials and scientific datasets.  These resources will be  developed by teachers, students, atmospheric scientists at UIUC,  specialists in hands-on learning at the Exploratorium Science  Museum, and other collaborators.    The teacher development and supp ort infrastructure will take the  form of workshops for teachers conducted by project staff,  materials to support project-oriented pedagogy, and an emerging  networked community of teachers sharing their experiences as they  transform their teaching practices.    The testbed evaluation and dissemination infrastructure will  consist of a substantial research framework combining cognitive  science, survey methods, and case studies to help expose the  challenges for deploying high-bandwidth networking infrastructures  for education and clarify the ways in which these infrastructures  can improve the effectiveness of science education.  The results of  this research will be disseminated through a variety of traditional  and network-based mechanisms to reach an audience of school  administrators, policy makers, corporations, and researchers.",
