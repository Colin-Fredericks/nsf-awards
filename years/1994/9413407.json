 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine roots are an important component of the carbon and nutrient  budgets of terrestrial ecosystems.  Recent developments in  microvideo image analysis have made it possible to quantify fine  root production, longevity and mortality for the first time  under natural and experimental field conditions.  Studies have  shown that the root systems of plants are dynamic and responsive  to changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, soil temperature,  and soil nitrogen availability.  Man-caused deposition of N is a  significant environmental concern over industrial regions of the  Earth, and increasing atmospheric CO2 and soil temperatures are  central facets of changing global environments.    Because of our ability to quantify fine root demography, it is  now possible to better understand the effects of atmospheric  CO2, soil temperature and soil nitrogen availability on plant  root dynamics and ecosystem-level feedbacks.  Understanding the  flux of carbon and nitrogen from root systems to soil and soil  microbes is a critical aspect of global change in terrestrial  ecosystems.  This proposal attempts to justify NSF support for  acquisition of instrumentation to quantify effects of global  change on plant root, and ecosystem processes.",
