 "awd_abstract_narration": "Onuchic  9316186  The focus of this research program is to understand under  precisely what conditions electron tunneling in proteins can be  explained by our Pathways approach, and when explicit multiple  pathways become important.  To address these questions we will  implement our new suite software package, Greenpath, which is  based on our SGF method.  Using the new software, we will be able  to develop the concept of pathway families.  In the limit that  the protein can be represented by a few independent pathway  families, a reduced or simplified representation of the protein  (renormalized protein) will become possible for ET.  This  renormalized protein will include all the relevant details of the  protein environment that will influence the value of TDA.  In the  opposite limit, when large interferences between families of  pathways become important, the description of the  protein  environment as a homogeneous medium will become valid (details of  the structure will not be important).  The simple model of TDA  decaying exponentially with the direct distance separation  between redox sites will become valid.  (However this decay  factor may vary for different proteins.)  This strategy will be  tested on ruthenium-modified cytochrome c and myoglobin.  A  larger number of proteins is necessary to understand why some  structures may be understood with a few pathway families while  other ones may not.  Therefore, myoglobin and cytochrome c are  just the first two proteins to be analyzed using the proposed  procedure.  Several other proteins will also be analyzed:   cytochrome b5 and cytochrome C551 (alpha-helical), plastocyanin  and azurin (beta-barrel), and HiPIP, for example.  If successful,  this strategy will become a very powerful tool for the study and  design of new electron transfer proteins.  The method will be  expanded to investigate electron transfer in protein complexes.   Studies will focus on the following complexes:  cytochrome c-  cytochrome c peroxidase and photosynthetic  reaction center-  cytochrome c.  Also, since the tunneling matrix element is  affected by protein internal water molecules and protein motions,  improvements to the method will be included to account for these  effects.  %%%  Electron transfer processes are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology  and physics.  In biology, these reactions occur in the key  bioenergetics processes of photosynthesis and oxidative  phosphorylation.  The rates of these reactions are  extraordinarily sensitive to the chemistry of the bridge coupling  the sites for the electron.  Our main goal is to create a  theoretical framework for understanding these electron transfer  reactions and for designing new molecules with performance  analogous to the biological ones.  The success of our model and  software Pathways opens up new methods for designing electron  transfer proteins.  The power of predicting experimental data  speaks for itself.  To the best of my knowledge, Pathways is the  only theoretical approach for biological reaction rate design,  other than qualitative structural (steric effects)  or  electrostatic calculations.  Yet, this is just the starting  point.  We are very optimistic about the growth of new  increasingly sophisticated methods following on the developments  of Pathways.  These new techniques will give rise to a new  software package Greenpath  that is the main goal of the proposed  work.  Using these new techniques, we will be able to answer  several existing questions not addressed by Pathways (or other  methods).  We will also create a powerful set of tools to  interpret native biological electron transfer systems and to aid  in the design of new electron transfer proteins.  ***",
