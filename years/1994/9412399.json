 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412399  Payne      Brood parasitic birds lay their eggs in the nest of other  species, the fosters, which rear their young; the parasite  birds do not rear their own young.  In the African finches,  field work suggests that adult parasites copy the song of  the birds that rear them, and females mate with males with  songs like their own foster parents.  This style of behavior  may have led to new races and species.  The project tests  these ideas with behavior experiments, field work, and  molecular genetics to compare the evolutionary history of  the parasites and their foster species.  In experiments, the  parasites will lay in aviaries in their normal fosters'  nest.  The eggs will be moved to a new foster species, and  the young will be reared by this foster.  Then the behavior  of the adult parasites will be tested to determine if males  sing the song of the bird that reared them, and females  prefer males that sing like their foster father.  The  experiment recreates the conditions when the parasite  switches to a new foster species, at the beginning of a  cultural speciation event.  This is a novel model of the  origin of species in birds. In the field in Africa, young  parasites will be photographed to test how similar they are  in appearance as begging young to their fosters' young,  which have bright mouth colors.  Morphology and genetics  will be tested for evidence of a past switch of foster  species in natural condition.  Molecular genetics of adults  and of young finches will be compared for the gene histories  of the species of brood parasites and their foster species  group, to test whether the parasites evolved along with  their old foster species, or switched from old to new foster  species.",
