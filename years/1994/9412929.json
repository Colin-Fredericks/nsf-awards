 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412929  This work is a collaborative effort between an experimental group  under the direction of Professor Jacob Schaefer and a theoretical  group under the direction of Professor Robert Yaris.  The  experimental group has developed new methods using solid-state  nuclear magnetic resonance to accurately measure interchain  distances between labeled atoms in polycarbonate.  In this grant  period we will measure additional interchain distances to further  characterize the structure of the glassy state of polycarbonate.   In addition, we will study blends of polycarbonate with a  derivitized polycarbonate to study the changes in dynamic behavior.   This work will also be combined with dynamic mechanical studies on  the mechanical properties of polycarbonate and the blends.  The  theoretical group has developed a general method to simulate the  long-term dynamics of a system and has applied this to a simplified  model of polycarbonate.  In this grant period we shall extend this  simulation, in several steps, to polycarbonate itself using  constraints and parameters obtained from the experimental group.  %%%  Glassy polymers (plastics) are very important industrial materials.   In particular, polycarbonate has very unusual physical properties  -- it is bulletprooof glass.  We are studying it in order to  characterize and understand its molecular dynamic properties.  The   long-range goal of the study and modeling is to develop an  understanding of the connection between the microscopic dynamics of  polymer glasses and their macroscopic physical properties.",
