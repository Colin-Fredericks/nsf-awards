 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316161  Schaefer  Dr. Schaefer proposes new solid-state NMR experiments to determine  the structures of big, non-crystallizeable complexes of proteins  with macromolecules, including protein-protein cross-links in  insect and plant cell walls, protein-oligosaccahride complexes, and  protein-DNA complexes.  The versatile rotational-echo double-  resonance (REDOR) and transferred-echo double-resonance (TEDOR)  analytical methods that he has developed in the last five years for  the accurate determination of internuclear distances (and hence  geometry and structure), and the new combined TEDOR-REDOR and  TEDOR-TEDOR methods which he proposes to develop, are techniques  that are directly applicable to the analysis of big complexes.  The  sensitivity of solid-state NMR for this kind of work already has  been established in practical applications on big proteins.  Dr.  Schaefer now routinely performs long-range distance measurements on  one umole of a 50-kD labeled protein complex embedded in an ionic  glass, an amount of protein commonly used for conventional  solution-state 1H multi-dimensional NMR.  %%%  The practical applications of REDOR solid-state NMR could lead both  to new science and new biotechnology, the latter including the  biorational design of pesticides, herbicides, and drugs.  Dr.  Schaefer plans to examine by NMR protein-protein cross-links in  insect and plant cell walls, protein-oligosacahride complexes, and  protein-DNA complexes.  These complexes cannot be analyzed by other  techniques because they are too big or are part of too  heterogeneous a matrix.  He also proposes to use atomic force  microscopy (AFM) to characterize the global structure of some of  the same protein complexes that we examine by NMR.  Protein  complexes anchored on the undulations of glassy polymer surfaces  will be examined by non-perturbative \"tapping-mode\" AFM.  The  combination of NMR and AFM experiments on the same protein systems  will provide an internal calibration (a self consistency check) and   should lead to new structural insights.  ***",
