 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Yin - 9403193    Automatic systems widely employed in industry consist of many interdependent working parts which are individually subject to malfunction or failure originating from mechanical or physical changes which may be internal or external to the system.  These faults or failures may cause product degradation, equipment damage, process stoppage or a catastrophe involving economic loss, environmental damage or the loss of human lives.  The detection, identification and prediction of faults during real time operation of a dynamic system is also known as a fault detection, diagnosis and isolation (FDI) process.  The aim of this research is the development and study of on-line FDI techniques.    Two detection schemes, an extended statistical approach and a method based on stochastic approximation and kernel estimation will be studied for their applicability.  The extended statistical approach is an integrated method of analytical redundancy and an on-line statistical procedure.  An input-output model will be used for residual generation.  Both a traditional probability ratio test and a test based upon a confidence region approach will be used for decision making.  An algorithm based on stochastic approximation and kernel estimation has been developed and will be employed for fault detection.     This is a Research Planning Grant consisting of computer simulation studies.  If successful, it will be followed by experimental validation of the algorithms that are developed.",
