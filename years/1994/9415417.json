Somasundaran of  the School of Mining at Columbia University and  Dr. Pradip of the Tata Research, Development &  Design Centre in Pune, India.  An integrated  approach is proposed to develop an accurate  understanding of the mechanisms involved to  alleviate the problems associated with  separation of fines and ultrafines from raw  materials.  It is planned to investigate  selective flocculation/dispersion of hematite-  alumina system of fines and ultrafines in the  presence of polymeric reagents.  Emphasis will  be on the identification of mechanisms by which  interactions between reagents at the interface  control selectivity.  A multi-pronged approach  using diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier  transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, fluorescence  spectroscopy, electron spin resonance  spectroscopy along with conventional techniques  of electrokinetics, adsorption, flocculation  and wetting will be employed.     Scope:  The project brings together two well  regarded laboratories in India and the U.S. to  conduct research in an important area of  mineral processing.  The scientists have  complementary capabilities and resources and  also have excellent track record of research.   Students from the two countries will be  involved in the research.  The project meets  INT objectives for enhancing U.S.-foreign  collaboration in areas of interest to both  sides.  ***",
