 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318119  Taylor       Molecular methods of DNA analysis, including nucleotide  sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping, are revolutionizing the  study of fungal evolution and taxonomy.  The most problematic  groups of fungi, the asexual forms that do not undergo meiosis and  do not form spores, are especially troublesome because it is  morphological features of the spore-bearing structures that have  traditionally served as characters for taxonomic identification and  classification.  Molecular data provide a solution to the dilemma.   Postdoctoral associate Dr. Karen LoBuglio under the guidance of Dr.  John Taylor at University of California-Berkeley is using modern  molecular procedures in a novel attack on this problem, emphasizing  the well-known mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum, which has  been found throughout the world but never with spores.  Data from  proteins and from nuclear ribosomal DNA will help determine the  closest living phylogenetic relatives of this fungus in the  ascomycete lineage; under molecular clock assumptions, these data  will also suggest the time of origin of the taxon.  Molecular data  will also indicate the extent of genetic variation within local and  regional populations of the fungus, and thereby test whether  cryptic cellular processes of recombination might generate  variation in what has been considered an asexual, dead-end mode of  life.       New DNA-based data from a widespread but asexual mycorrhizal  fungus will help answer two important questions: the proper  classification and phylogenetic position of Cenococcum geophilum  and the possibility that asexual taxa of fungi are able to generate  genetic variability, perhaps through cryptic cellular processes of  recombination.",
