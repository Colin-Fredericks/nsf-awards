In some species, many males  commonly have several mates at one time while many others  have none.  Why females are willing to mate with males who  already have mates is a question that has interested  biologists for decades.  Drs. Yasukawa and Enstrom will  investigate mate choice in such a species of bird, focusing  on the role of distinctive male plumage.  Use of DNA  fingerprinting will allow the genetic fathers of nestlings to  be identified, so that female choice both of social partners  and of genetic mates can be studied.  Finally, the effects of  genetic parentage on male care-giving will be studied by  assessing the male's contributions of food to nestlings and  his willingness to defend nestlings against predators.  These  studies will help to fill a conspicuous void in our knowledge  of mate choice and will provide research experiences for  several college.",
