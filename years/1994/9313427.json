 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gill       The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia is one of the oldest natural  history museums in the U.S., and it has a long tradition of research in biology and  environmental science. This long tradition brings with it an aging facility, and several  additions to the building have been constructed over the years to provide new space  for research, education, and public exhibits. The Academy has recently constructed  new space in what was an interior courtyard. Several new research techniques in  molecular biology have the potential to make significant contributions to the  Academy s research programs, but the lack of suitable facilities has been an obstacle  to using these techniques. The Academy plans to dedicate a portion of the newly  constructed addition to research laboratories with these capabilities. Space  modifications will create ideal environments for the sensitive instruments used in  molecular biology and DNA sequencing. The renovation will also provide: controlled  environment growth chambers for microbial cultures and for ecological experiments;  safe storage areas that are in compliance with fire codes for alcohol-preserved  specimens; adequate ventilation and fume hoods; and capabilities for safe storage,  use, and disposal of hazardous research materials.       This renovation project will solve a variety of safety issues, and will enable  researchers at the Academy to broaden their research programs through the addition  of new laboratory techniques. Irreplaceable specimens in the reference collections will  have safer storage facilities, and sensitive research instruments will be given suitable  settings. The overall research and education productivity of the institution will  increase as a result of this renovation.      The Department of Agricultural Engineering, Oklahoma State University, is  recognized as one of the nation's leaders in Biosystems Engineering research, the  application of engineering principles to biological systems.  While agriculture remains   an integral aspect of the research program, Biosystems  includes environmental,  natural resources and biological applications.  To reflect this broader scope, the  Department will be renamed Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.  In addition to  the programmatic changes, the facilities housing ongoing research activities will be  renovated and replaced to complement the new priorities of the Department as it  completes its transformation to Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.    Existing facilities were built in an era when agricultural mechanization research  primarily involved the construction of heavy mechanisms and soil and water research.   These facilities are inadequate to perform Biosystems research that requires high  quality labs with special provisions. This award will provide funding for the  modernization of laboratory space that will allow for the proper support of programs  in machine vision, sensors and controls, intelligent machines and bioenvironmental  engineering.  The relocation of the shop facility to the main campus will be adjoined  to the research laboratory, providing more effective and efficient shop services for  faculty.  Specific renovations will include upgrading the HVAC, electrical, and  mechanical systems.  The modernization of the research facilities at Oklahoma State  University will have maximum impact on the human resources needed for the nation's  continued leadership in science and engineering into the twenty-first century.",
