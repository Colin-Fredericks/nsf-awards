At this  working meeting, 15 participants will work together to identify,  analyze and develop recommendations on such issues as:  defining  contributions and authorship; responsibilities of individual  researchers in collaborative relationships; intellectual property  ownership; accountability and quality assurance issues; and  monitoring.  A white paper with an in-depth analysis and  recommendations will be developed and disseminated to individuals  involved in teaching issues in scientific integrity, to the broad  microbiological community, to policy makers who have concerns about  collaborative scientific research, and to the public.  Prior  meetings have provided the opportunity to describe relevant issues,  but have provided little analysis and guidance.  This colloquium  will focus on this very specific area in order to explore and  develop the issues in depth.  The report from this treatment will  be useful to scientists and instructors in defining, refining, and  developing their courses in scientific integrity.  It will also  assist the lay public in understanding the issues surrounding  research collaborations.  ***",
