 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450709     Nakhleh  The faculty in the Department of Chemistry propose to assemble  a model of change in both the undergraduate chemistry  curriculum and instructional strategies.  The faculty also  propose to fully evaluate the learning that occurs as a result  of these changes.  The model envisions an outwardly spiralling  approach to innovative changes in the full undergraduate  chemistry program.  The model starts with a pilot program of  innovative changes in the two-semester introductory course for  chemistry majors (60-70 students per semester), spirals out to  changes in the introductory sequences  for science/engineering  majors and agriculture/health majors (3900 students per  semester), and finally spirals out to the upper division  chemistry courses (2500 students per semester), including the  courses which train chemistry teaching majors.  The model  creates a thematic approach to the curriculum so that students  will understand how the major themes of chemistry interrelate  and how major concepts in chemistry, such as acid and bases,  relate to major themes, such as equilibrium.  In order to  emphasize these themes and concepts the model prunes the  curriculum and selects topics which are fundamental to a sound  understanding of the discipline.  The model also weaves the  real world of chemistry into the courses by appropriate  examples and introduces organic and biochemistry in appropriate  topics, such as equilibrium, thermodynamics, and complex ion  chemistry.  In terms of instructional strategies, the model  seeks to implement cooperative learning, conceptual change  teaching, a balanced presentation of the macroscopic and  microscopic worlds of chemistry, and a balanced development of  conceptual understanding and skill in problem solving and using  algorithms in the real world environment of large lecture  sections and multiple laboratory sections at the university  level.  ***y",
