 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320203  Johnson  Being a successful scientist is extraordinarily difficult:  one  must have the intelligence to master extremely difficult material,  the creativity to come up with solutions to problems which vex the  best minds in your discipline, the stamina to pursue leads in long  hours of research in laboratories or in field work, the ambition to  beat out one's competitors, and the wisdom (called \"luck\" by those  who fail to understand how science works) to seize opportunities  which fortuitously come ones way.  These traits are required for  any scientist.  Women scientists, however, need additional  qualities to be successful.  They face social, cultural and gender  biases that militate against their success.  This problem is not  just the problem of women entering a predominately male field,  though male colleagues have placed barriers in the path of women  scientists.  Social traditions and demands provide additional  barriers:  married women traditionally have extra burdens at home  that their male counterparts do not carry;  women who are mothers  have primary child-rearing responsibilities; and society frowns on  women with the traits (eg. ambition) necessary to be a success in  science.      Unfortunately, studies of women in science too frequently  concentrate on the social aspects of the problems women face  without integrating the scientific difficulties or these studies  concentrate on the technical scientific problems without adequately  understanding the social components.  Dr. Johnson is the rare  individual who understands both the social and the scientific  aspects of these issues.    Dr. Johnson is studying Maria Goeppert Mayer, Nobel laureate in  nuclear physics in 1963.  Mayer made extensive contributions not  just in nuclear physics, but also atomic, chemical and molecular  physics.  She was married to the chemist Joseph E. Mayer, and their  influence on each other's science was substantial.  Dr. Johnson is  addressing Maria Goeppert Mayer's scientific contributions,  her  experience as a woman in 20th century physics, and the role her  marriage played in her career.    ***",
