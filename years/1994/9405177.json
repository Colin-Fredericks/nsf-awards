 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405177  Headley  The hydrogen bond basicity ability of structurally different   sulfides will be determined in an Argon matrix and from   theoretical calculations. From infrared spectra of selected   sulfur bases and 4-fluorophenol, the vibrational modes of   the hydrogen bonded complexes will be assigned based on   comparisons of the spectra of deuterated and undeuterated   complexes. The relative wave number displacements (DnO-H)   for the O-H stretching of 4-fluorophenol caused by a   hydrogen bond to the sulfides will be used to represent the   hydrogen-bond basicity of structurally different sulfides.   Ab initio molecular orbital calculations will be used to   predict spectra for the hydrogen bonded complexes after   calibration to experimental data.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   work of Professor Alan Headley at Texas Tech University.   Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds that form between a basic atom   and a proton donor. This type of bonding is considerable   importance in molecules of biological interest. In this   research project, hydrogen bonding between sulfur atoms and   a proton donor will be studied by infrared spectroscopy in   conjunction with theoretical calculations. A hydrogen-bond   basicity scale will be determine for various sulfur   containing groups in molecules.",
