 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Knobler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of Langmuir   monolayers of amphiphiles.  He is examining long range order in self   organizing monlayers, and the phase transitions which occur in these two   dimensional assemblies.  Fluorescence microscopy and Brewster angle   microscopy are used to distinguish the optical textures corresponding to   different molecular orientations.  The experimental results are compared   with a mean-field theory of these textures which has been developed.    These methods will also be employed to examine the structures and   kinetics of growth of mosaic textures that are characteristic of certain   condensed monolayer phases.    Langmuir monolayers are films of a single molecular layer that can be   formed at the interface between air and water.  They are composed of   amphiphilic moleucles such as long chain fatty acids, esters and   alcohols.  Such films provide an opportunity to study two-dimensional   systems, and they provide structural insights into biochemical systems   such as lipid bilayers.  These monolayers can be transferred as   Langmuir-Blodgett films to solid supports, and may be employed as   sensors, and as electronic devices.",
