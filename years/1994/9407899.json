 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407899  Clearfield    Metal oxide pillared layered materials (PLM) are a relatively new  class  of microporous solid acids. Potential areas of application  include their use as catalysts, sorbents, ion exchangers, sensors  and  ionic  conductors.  In a previous grant  from  NSF,  a  wide  variety   of  PLM  were  synthesized  including  clay   minerals,  phosphates,  oxides, layered double hydroxides (LDH)  and  single  metal hydroxides. Novel pillars were prepared in addition to more  traditional  alumina, zirconia and chromia pillars.  The  aim  of  this  work is to incorporate other transition elements  into  the  nickel  oxide or cobalt oxide pillars.  The long range objectives  are  to  obtain a fundamental understanding of the synthetic  and  post-synthesis  procedures for control of  pore  size  and  other  structural features, control of acidity or basicity by choice  of  layered material and pillars and subsequent pillar treatments and  to  develop  novel acid, bifunctional and redox  catalysts  based  upon this information. To acquire the needed structural data  for  the  new materials,  novel x-ray methods and procedures involving  electron  diffraction, lattice imaging, atomic  force  microscopy  and novel mass spectrometry methods will be used.  %%%  Solid-acid  catalysts are the backbone of the major processes  of  refining and petrochemistry. In the reformulation of gasoline and  petroleum  products  to  meet  environmental  standards  and  the  requirements of future vehicles, new solid acids directed towards  catalyzing specific reactions will be in demand. Redox  catalysts  also play a crucial role in many large scale industrial processes  and in the future, both catalyst types will be expected to play a  greater  role  in  the  preparation of fine  chemicals.  Pillared  layered materials represent a potential new class of catalysts of  astonishing   breadth   and  variety.   However,   before   their  application  becomes  a  reality, it is essential  to  develop  a  complete   understanding of their structures,  develop  strategies  for  altering  the  structures  in controlled  ways,  and  relate  catalytic  behavior to structure and composition. These  problems  are addressed in this proposal.",
