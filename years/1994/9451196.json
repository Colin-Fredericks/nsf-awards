This course is required of physics majors and is also popular with  students from other academic departments who need to know how to  use electronics in their work.  Currently, the laboratory teaches  basic analog electronics, operational amplifiers, digital  electronics, and analog to digital interfacing.  However, the  equipment now used for the course is not current, and methods of  computer data acquisition and control need to be taught in order to  prepare students for the way experimental physics is now done.  As  well as its use in teaching computer techniques, the equipment will  be used as a diagnostic tool which the students can use to  elucidate aspects of circuit behavior.  This will allow the  students to have a better understanding of how the lecture and  laboratory parts of the course relate to each other.  Each station  will be equipped with a Macintosh computer, LABVIEW data  acquisition software, and a computer-controlled multimeter, digital  oscilloscope, and function generator.",
