 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Introduction. X-ray structure analysis is a critical tool  for a large group of major researchers at the University of  Illinois at Chicago (UIC), a group whose annual research  funding currently totals 4 million(Sec III).  Seven  laboratories are engaged in ten different macromolecular  structure projects that require area detector technology.  There is now a campus wide effort for  establishing  a  comprehensive, centralized x-ray diffraction facility at UIC  to serve the many needs of these basic science research  projects.  As part of that larger plan, this proposal if for  acquisition of a state-of-the-art area detector and related  equipment for macromolecular crystallography.    Proposed Instrumentation.  The equipment to be procured from  this proposal consists of five main components:    1) a rotating anode x-ray generator, the strongest in-house  source of x-ray photons available;  2) an area detector, for the most efficient measurement of  the thousands of diffraction data;  3) a low temperature device, for lifetime extension of the  radiation sensitive samples;  4) a host computer, for detector operation, and primary data  collection and processing; and  5) a graphics workstation and software, for calculation of  structures from the data, and display and analysis of the  results.    Price quotes and product information for the x-ray equipment  have been received from four different suppliers. Although  the detailed budget (Appendix V, p.20) is written for one  specific supplier, the other quotes are at an equivalent  total amount.  The actual make of the equipment and type of  area detector to be procured (fluorescent screen vs. imaging  plate vs. multiwire) will be finalized after detailed  performance comparisons if an award is made.    Research and Training to be Conducted.  The research  activities to be conducted with the proposed x-ray equipment  will be three-dimensional structural determination of  molecules.  Structures of biological macromolecules will  consti tute the majority of the work.  These include the  protein crystallography projects described in the research  activities section (pp. 4-11)  The non-biological  macromolecule projects (metallocluster compounds) require  are detector technology in that their cell dimensions,  solvent content, and radiation sensitivity rival those of  standard protein crystallography work.  The training will be primarily for doctorate level graduate  students from the participating departments.  The structural  aspects of their research will be supervised by a core of  three principal investigators with expertise in x-ray  structure determination, who will closely interact with the  interested laboratories.  The training will concentrate  on the application of x-ray structure analysis to their  basic science research projects.  An important feature of the planned x-ray facility will be  in its relationship to the Molecular Biology training  program initiated this year at UIC.  The program includes  three of the six departments participation in this proposal  (Microbiology & Immunology, Biochemistry, and Physiology &  Biophysics).  The structural biology component of the  training program will be substantially enhanced by the  presence of the x-ray facility.  In turn, this arrangement  will increase the pool of potential graduate students for  structural biology, and thus promote utilization of the x-  ray facility to its maximum potential.    Activity Resulting from Funding.  An x-ray at UIC will have  a significant impact on research performance on our campus  by providing the necessary crystallographic tools for the  ongoing structural projects.  This will improve the success  rate of our many laboratories in securing external agency  funds.  Because the facility will bring a focus to  structural analysis for our multidisciplinary group of basic  science researchers, it will also foster interaction and  further collaboration among the participants.",
