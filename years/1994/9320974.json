 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320974  Wedel       This project involves a cultural anthropologist from George  Washington University in a study of the process of foreign aid in  five democratizing countries of Eastern Europe.  The  investigators will study three state factories in Poland, Hungary  and the Czech Republic, and two state farms in Romania and  Albania as they deal with foreign advisers and aid institutions  in their effort to get help in privatizing their production.  The  anthropologists will focus on the ideology, politics and  bureaucratic organization of aid in donor societies as well as  the dynamic relations involved as donors and recipients negotiate  their way towards large-scale technical assistance. Using  ethnographic techniques of in-depth interviews and participant  observation, fieldwork in factories and farms in Eastern Europe  will be coupled with interviews and observations at U.S., E.C.,  and joint East-West meetings where aid policies are formulated.       This research is important because the democratizing process  taking place in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe  is one of the major events of our time, and its success is  critically important to world peace and prosperity.  The actual  implementation of international aid programs is not a one-way  street of expertise flowing out of the First World into the ex-  Second World, but a complex process of negotiation.  Increased  understanding of the actual behavior involved in foreign aid, and  how different perceptions and understandings of each other,  different goals and political agendas, and different practices  all influence aid outcomes, will be important in structuring  future relations between First and ex-Second Worlds.  ***",
