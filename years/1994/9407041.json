The  proposal is  jointly sponsored by the University of Maryland College Park  and  Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  The underlying  motivation  is that a postdoctoral associate could facilitate and  exploit a  two-way transfer of technology in which the modern  analytical and  numerical expertise that is available in the University, is  tested in the light of the expertise available at CSC,  namely an  extensive knowledged of traditional mechanics approaches,  and of  practical questions that arise in flying satellites.  The  project  will comprise case studies of specific operational  satellites and  comparison with actual flight data.  The mathematical  techniques  that will be considered include applications of i) the non-  canonical Hamiltonian formulation of Arnol'd to predict so-  called  gravity-gradient and other perturbation effects on the  attitude  dynamics of satellites, ii) modern Hamiltonian formulations  of  rod models to describe the dynamics of antennas and booms,  and  iii) applications of symplectic and energy-momentum  integrator in  high accuracy numerical simulations.  The associated  physical  effects to be investigated will include i) coupling between  attitude and orbit dynamics due to finite satellite size,  and  internal and external damping, ii) spin-up dynamics and  instability resonances, and especially iii) effects of  flexibility of satellites.  The final objective is improved  understanding of the attitude dynamics of satellites that  will  lead to robust, efficient and accurate numerical  simulations.",
