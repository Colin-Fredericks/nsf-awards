 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354477  Lemons  A significant mismatch exists between what traditional Anatomy  and Physiology (A&P) courses offer and what many  non-traditional students need. As a result these students are  not learning how living human systems function, but rather are  memorizing many often disconnected facts about them. We propose  a new, innovative curriculum which: 1) presents function first,  in the context of a broad organizing theme, and then introduces  anatomical and physiological details to explain the function,  2) reverses the order of the traditional teaching process by  beginning with hands-on exploration with physical models, and  then progressing to higher level thinking, 3) places the  highest priority on critical thinking about physiological  systems so students learn to solve problems, 4) uses computer  technology as a tool to support all stages of learning, not as  the focus of it, 5) provides structured out-of-class support  and 6) uses assessment as an integral part of the learning  process, not just an endpoint. To demonstrate this new  approach, we present in detail our modified learning cycle  method for the unit on the heart. When this new curriculum is  completed, we plan to: 1) Facilitate its implementation, a) in  other CCNY courses, b) at the three community colleges whose  faculty are involved in the project and c) at three local high  schools. 2) Disseminate widely the learning cycle exercises and  the student assessment plan. 3) Publish about, and present the  project at the national level. Nothing could be more important  from our perspective, than to introduce competent, critical  thinkers into the science pipeline from our courses, and we  expect the new A&P sequence to be a model curriculum for doing  this. We also expect to see significant improvement in the  critical thinking ability and A&P content mastery of women and  minorities who makeup the overwhelming majority of our student.  ***",
