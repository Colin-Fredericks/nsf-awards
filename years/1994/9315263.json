The co-organizers of the  seminar are Professor David Mills, Department  of East Asian Language and Literature,  University of Pittsburgh, and Professor Kazuo  Otsubo, Director of Japanese Language Teaching,  Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.    The objective of the seminar is to strengthen  the infrastructure of science in the United  States by leading to improved methods of  teaching technical Japanese to U.S. scientists  and engineers, thus enabling a greater level of  collaboration with their Japanese colleagues.   The seminar will focus on a review of existing  programs, discussion of pedagogical issues, and  consideration of what directions are the most  fruitful for the future.  Also, the seminar  will examine ways to foster better cooperation  between scientists and engineers on the one  hand and Japanese language specialists on the  other.  One further goal is to establish  relationships that may lead to enhanced  opportunities for U.S. students to spend time  in Japan mastering the language in an  appropriate scientific setting.    ***",
