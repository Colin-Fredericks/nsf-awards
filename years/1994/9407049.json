 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407049  Blackstone         Much of the theory and data of modern evolutionary  biology converges on two related subjects: the evolution of  development and the evolution of life history. Curiously,  these subjects have remained conceptually and operationally  distinct-studies of the former focus on evolutionary changes  in the timing of organismal development and on the  morphological manifestations of this process (e.g., size,  presence of juvenilized, adult or derived features), while  studies of the later focus on the organism's allocation of  energy into various life history traits (e.g., size, timing  of reproduction, number of offspring).      To unite studies of life history and the evolution of  development conceptually, it is necessary to elucidate a  mechanistic link between energy allocation and the timing of  development. In particular, efforts must be made to identify  an appropriate organismal system which can illuminate the  withinorganism mechanisms mediating the connection between  energy allocation and the timing of developmental and life  history traits. This system must show correlations (1) in  natural populations between variation of the putative  mechanism and the observed variation of life history and  development, and (2) in laboratory populations between  experimental perturbation of the putative mechanism and  variation which mimics the naturally occurring variation.       Recent studies of colonial marine hydroids suggest that  within-colony circulation serves as a mechanism by which  energy allocation mediates the timing of morphological and  life history traits. The PI proposes to initiate a research  program which will establish, for the first time, how  ecological variation in life histories is linked to  evolutionary changes in the timing of development.  ***",
