 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410888  Carpino    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Louis A.  Carpino, University of Massachusetts, and one faculty member  (Dr. El-Sayed Mansour), one postdoctoral fellow,  and three  graduate student from the University of Alexandria, Egypt.  Project funding will allow the team from the University of  Alexandria to work for various periods of time in Dr.  Carpino's laboratory and also allow Dr. Carpino a research  visit to the University of Alexandria.  Dr. Carpino, as  Principal Investigator, will provide overall project  supervision.  The focus of this cooperative research  activity is the development of generally applicable,  reliable and rapid procedures for the chemical synthesis of  longer peptides and small proteins.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of peptide synthesis and  coupling.  It is anticipated that this collaborative  research will result in novel techniques for the synthesis  of  peptide segments.  The Egyptian scientists will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at the University of Massachusetts as well as  contribute to the overall success of the project.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
