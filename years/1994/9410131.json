 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elucidating the biological basis of learning and memory is a  goal critical to our understanding of both brain and  behavior.  Whether the ultimate goal of such research is the  development of artificial systems with brain-like  capabilities, or gaining insight into the diseased brain,  this basic knowledge is indespensible.  The most popular and  successful model of learning-related plasticity in the  mammalian brain is called long-term potentiation (LTP).  We  have learned a great deal about the cellular and molecular  mechanisms of LTP induction, but are still in the dark as to  whether LTP (or something like it) is really responsible for  learning and memory.  One consistent finding across  laboratories and procedures is that the calcium  concentration within neurons activated by high-frequency  stimulation must be elevated for LTP to occur.  We are  therefore focusing our research efforts on two calcium  dependent enzymes which could be critical for learning and  memory; nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and calcium/calmodulin  dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).  Specifically, since  these enzymes are both activated by the same signal, but  perform very different functions, we are exploring the  hypothesis that NO and CaMKII act synergistically within  neurons during LTP.  Using pharmacological and  electrophysiological techniques in living brain slices taken  from mice which carry targeted mutations to the gene that  produces a CaMKII, we are examining the conditions under  which inhibitors of NOS impair LTP in two brain regions  strongly associated with learning and memory.  The studies  are elucidating not only the interaction of the two enzymes,  but the generality of their function in different brain  regions, and their role in a simple form of learning.  In  doing so, we will be able to focus on those cellular and  molecular processes that are most important for mammalian  learning and memory.",
