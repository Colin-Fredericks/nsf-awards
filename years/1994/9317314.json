 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317314  Sahagian  We propose to develop an analytical formulation and  numerical model directed toward gaining a quantitative  understanding of the relationship between bubble growth and  volcanic eruptions.  As a result of the proposed project, we  hope to quantify the processes which control bubble growth  in ascending magma during eruption and how the various  magmatic properties, parameters, and environmental  conditions affect the style of volcanic eruptions.  Our  proposed study can be divided into two basic objectives  including 1) quantification of the factors contributing to  bubble growth in an ascending magma (parametric study); and  2) quantification of the effect of bubble growth on magma  ascent during eruption.  The first objective involves  numerical modeling of individual bubbles (small scale) and  their interaction with the surrounding melt.  The second  objective is to account for the feedback between magma rise  (and decompression) and bubble growth throughout the magma  column.  This will allow the quantification of dissolved and  exsolved volatile fractions at the point of melt  fragmentation into spray.  The proposed project will extend  our analysis far beyond the preliminary work, and should be  more applicable to natural systems.",
