 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355523  Sarquis    This project will build upon Teaching Science with TOYS.  Through  TOYS over 475 K-12 teachers nationwide have brought toy based  science into their classrooms using nearly 100 activities.  TOYS:  CAPS will  1.  Actively cultivate district level systemic implementation of  toy based physical science education.  There will be 180  participants over 4 summers.  Teams of 2-3 teachers and one  administrator will participate in a 3-week summer workshop which  includes working directly with students in a summer camp.  Academic  year follow up will include fall and spring sessions either at the  Miami University host site or a regional University Affiliate site  where participants will report on activities share sessions and  exchange ideas.  In service workshops will be held with the  tecnical support being provided by TOYS staff and/or University  Affiliates.  2.  Over a three year period 18 TOYS graduates per year will  undergo extensive 'training' to enhance their pedagogical content  knowledge and develop leadership skills to become district Leaders.   This program will overlap with the Teacher/Administrator Program  (TAP) in which teams of 36 under prepared teachers (grades K-9) and  administrators will attend programs run by the TOYS leaders and  faculty.  3.  University Affiliates (two college or university science or  faculty members per summer) will participate to replicate the  program regionally to create TOYS centers throughout the US and to  implement hands on TOY based activities in local schools.   University Affiliates also include toy-based activities in their  pre-service science education courses.  4.  Through the Teacher/Researcher Program 12 peer writers per year  will work with TOYS faculty to research, develop and test  activiites and teacher resource modules.  In TOYS: CAPS 378 teachers representing 66 district teams and six  university affiliates will directly participate over the 41 months  of the project.  An estimated 3,000 additional teachers will be  r eached through in-service and other outreach activities.  It is to  be noted that academic year programming will focus on regional  teams within commuting distance and summer programming will target  a national audience.",
