 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321826  Kahn    Technical abstract:  This study will focus on the structural,  chemical, and electronic properties of surfaces and metal  interfaces of wide band gap zinc-selenide and III-V nitrides  (gallium nitride, indium nitride, aluminum nitride).  The validity  of the Schottky barrier models developed for narrower gap  semiconductors will be tested for these materials.  The nature of  electronic surface states, their impact on the surface band bending  and their role in the formation of metal-semiconductor barriers  will be determined.  The project will also investigate the  occurrence of negative electron affinity which has been reported  for aluminum nitride surfaces.  Formation of metal-zinc-selenide  and metal-nitride barriers will be investigated in order to  establish the limits of the dependence of Schottky barriers on  these materials.  The thermal stability of interfaces, especially  important for high temperature applications (gallium nitride) will  be investigated.  This will include a search for diffusion and  chemical reaction barriers (e. g., titanium-gallium nitride).   Finally, the difficult problem of making ohmic contacts to these p-  doped semiconductors will be addressed.  These contacts are crucial  for the development of light emitting devices.  Two techniques will  be studied:  combination of high p-doping and large work function  metal (platinum) for p-gallium nitride, and high electronegativity  polymeric and metallic (poly sulfur nitride) contact on p-zinc-  selenide.    Non-technical abstract:  This project will investigate the  structural, chemical and electronic properties of interfaces of two  important types of semiconductors:  zinc selenide and the Group  III-V nitrides (gallium nitride, indium nitride, and aluminum  nitride), which have applications in optoelectronics (emission in  the green-blue for the II-VIs, blue-ultraviolet for the nitrides)  and high temperature electronics (nitrides).  The proposed work  will begin to establish for these materials a  solid understanding  of their interface properties for future technological  developments, as well as to test the validity of interface concepts  and metal-semiconductor barrier models developed for narrower gap  semiconductors.  The formation of ohmic contacts will be  investigated, since these are crucial for the operation of high-  performance, reliable, light-emitting devices.  For example the  chemical stability of these contacts will be modulated via  preparation of diffusion barriers which should lead to interface  engineering of these materials.  ***",
