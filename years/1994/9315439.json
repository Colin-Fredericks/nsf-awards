The goal of the collaborative effort is  to obtain cDNA clones for Neurospora crassa  genes that are induced in response to  ultraviolet light damage.  The investigators  will use sensitive differential hybridization  techniques to identify these clones in cDNA  libraries prepared from UV-induced cultures.   They will also prepare libraries using this  cDNA to enable expression in yeast and  bacteria, providing additional powerful  approaches to understand gene functions.    This collaboration will provide the basis for  an increased understanding by the scientists in  the U.S. and Japanese laboratories about the  functions of genes induced by mutagenic events  as well as the mechanisms that control the  expression of these genes.  ***",
