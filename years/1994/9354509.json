This course is designed as an  alternate (to the standard calculus sequence) route into the  mathematics curriculum, one which stresses breadth and includes  much of the modern mathematics and applications which are  currently \"homeless\" in the mathematics curricula. The design,  review, field test, and production of the course is being  overseen by an advisory/editorial board and author team with a  wide range of mathematical expertise and writing experience.   There is an extensive outreach effort including regular  mailings, professional meetings presentations, and faculty  enhancement workshops. The project will culminate with the  dissemination of the materials by a major textbook publisher.",
