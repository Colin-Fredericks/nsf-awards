 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is increasing evidence that heterogeneous  processes involving cloud droplets, ice particles, and  aerosols play an important role in global tropspheric  chemistry.  As a contribution to unraveling the many complex  phenomena involved, the PI proposes to undertake  investigations of a wide range of reactions pertaining to  the chemistry of nitrogen containing species of atmospheric  importance.  The details of the molecular processes will be  investigated through three major activities.   The first  will involve contribution to unraveling the complex  chemistry associated with oxides of nitrogen, nitric acid  and nitrosyl sulfuric acid, and ammonia in the troposphere.  The second phase of the work will encompass thermochemical  measurements which will provide information on the  energetics of the reactions, and particularly on the  stability of complexes which are likely to be important in  the condensation of nitrogen containing species and in their  gas-to-particle conversion.  The third area of  study will  comprise investigations of the structure, growth and  nucleation of aqueous phase clusters and ice-like crystals.  The overall aim of the work is to provide complementary data  which will serve to elucidate a number of the physical and  chemical phenomena at the molecular level, through an  investigation of reactions which have been proposed to be of  particular importance on the basis of modeling calculations,  atmospheric measurements, and other laboratory studies.  The  approach is to study clusters of ever increasing degrees of  hydration that serve to bridge the regime from the small  cluster domain to the macroscopic particle state.  Recent  advances in out laboratory enable us to investigate  transformations over this entire range of particle size.",
