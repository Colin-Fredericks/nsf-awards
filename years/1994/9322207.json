The project will run for a period of eight weeks. Students will  be recruited nationally and selected on the basis of mathematical  ability and background and the perceived benefits which will  result from the program.  Efforts will focus on attracting  applications from students in underrepresented groups.  Students  will be paired with faculty advisors to work on problems from  areas such as combinatorics, dynamical systems and  stochastic processes.  Each topic will focus on an unsolved  problem close to state-of-the-art research in the mathematical  sciences.  To foster the research environment, students will  participate in a seminar series and present their own results  both orally and in writing.  Healthy interaction among the  students will be an important goal of this activity.        Availability of university resources such as a  computer laboratory will add to the strength of the activity.   Students will have offices and computational facilities available  for the duration of the project.  ***",
