The revised curriculum introduces the object-oriented programming  paradigm immediately, and stresses the view that software  development is no longer an exercise practiced by individuals in  isolation, but rather is more commonly a cooperative effort  involving members of a team working to produce a solution.  Immediate exposure to the object paradigm is a revolutionary  approach to Computer Science education which we feel will have  far-reaching impact on the field.  Our revision addresses four primary problems: the perception that  computing = coding; the disparate backgrounds of entering students;  the inability of students to grasp fundamental structures and  relationships; and the need for early, sustained emphasis on  software engineering. Our solution revolves around the points  mentioned above, through early exposure of students to large,  \"real-world\" examples. Students begin not by developing software  from scratch, but by examining and modifying existing artifacts,  imprinting them with the principle of software reuse while at the  same time illustrating good programming practice in a way which  involves the students from the start.  In order to implement this curriculum, a portion of our existing  facilities will be upgraded. We will purchase UNIX-based  workstations which will provide the resources needed to support the  software used in the new curriculum. Both hardware and software are  needed to fully support the new curriculum.",
