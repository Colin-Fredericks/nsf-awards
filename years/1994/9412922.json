 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412922  Baker      This planning grant award is oriented to the investigation of a  knowledge-based scientific visualization assisting system with the  purpose of providing intelligent assistance to a user upon the  description of the type of data, the analysis of the task, and the  system environment for the visualization project for which the  advice is sought.  The paradigm of task-directed visualization  involves the automatic construction of the visualization for the  task that has been described.  This planning investigation involves  understanding the types of tasks for which scientists use  visualization, as well as the relation between the task and the  effectiveness of different visual displays.  Empirical studies are  carried out as part of this planning to determine the relative  effectiveness of different visualizations of different tasks from  a collection of tasks reflecting common analysis goals of the  visualization-user to be incorporated in the rules of the automated  visualization assistant.",
