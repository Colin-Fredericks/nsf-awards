 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Telecommunications Laboratory is a multi-use state-of-the-art  undergraduate teaching facility designed to be both flexible and  powerful. The controlled workstation and computer communications  facilities allow undergraduate students an opportunity to apply and  integrate classroom knowledge in communications, signal processing,  computer architecture, and algorithm and software development via  a set of practical experiments. Students are exposed to  state-of-the-art computer communications systems, on which they can  implement everything from modern digital communication and signal  processing algorithms to parallel algorithms and real-time  databases. State-of-the-art computer software provides the  undergraduate students modern models of quality software, as well  as allows them to design and build sophisticated software/hardware  systems. This laboratory  significantly impacts many of the  University of Oklahoma undergraduate students in both the School of  Computer Science and the School of Electrical Engineering. Many of  these students will take positions with organizations in the  telecommunications/ computer industry, where these skills and  experiences will be greatly valued.",
