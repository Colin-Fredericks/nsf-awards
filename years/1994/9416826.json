The State University  of New York at Buffalo's Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center for Biosurfaces is being joined by a research site at the  University of Memphis and another research site at the New York  State College of Ceramics.      Research in the multi-site Center will address:  1)  Characterization of the chemical/physical properties of various  substrata that favor or inhibit bioadhesion, in aqueous media of  varied organic/inorganic content; 2) Determination of the surface  properties of cells as they engage in interactions with well-  characterized substrata, giving special attention to the dynamics  of media flow, cell arrival, surface modification, bio-attachment  and -- finally -- stability of the attachment mechanisms; 3)  Documentation of reactions between cells and supporting films,  cells and adjacent cells, films and surrounding media, and other  cross-reactions, with particular attention to technology that may  control these interactions to either promote or prevent bioadhesion  in practical biomedical or bioengineering situations; and 4) Scale-  up of these biotechnologies to macrosystem processes, like adhesive  secretion or biomineralization, that may produce new, or mimic  existing, materials such as structural composite shells and  adhesives of natural organisms.    This multi-site Center has been coordinated with Dr. Norman Caplan,  Program Director, Environmental Systems Program.    The State University of New York has requested funding to support  undergraduate research assistants.  These students will participate  in the Center's ongoing research projects.    Additional funding is provided through a supplemental Research  Opportunity Award (ROA) for a woman Assistant Professor at  D'Youville College to perform research for the State University of  New - Buffalo.                                           Pa ge 1 of 2            The Project is determining the protein structure associated with  bioadhesives functionality.  The project's goal is to study the  protein structures responsible for the binding ability of selected  native adhesive protein domains and for their use in the  development of manufactured proteinaceous adhesive agents.  The Program Manager recommends the State University of New York at  Buffalo be awarded:  $50,000 for the first year of a five-year  continuing award (including $25,000 for administrative activities);  $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award to the  University of Memphis through a subcontract; $50,000 for the first  year of a five-year continuing award to the New York State College  of Ceramics through a subcontract; $5,000 for one year with  funds provided by the Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering  Research Assistants Program; and $54,995 for 24 months for a  Research Opportunity award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which support base is developing; and 3) the extent to  which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
