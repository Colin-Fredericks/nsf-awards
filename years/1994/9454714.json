 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454714  Helfrich    The Franklin Institute proposes to establish the Science Learning  Network (SLN), a unique online collaborative of science museums,  industry and schools to support the teaching and learning of  science, mathematics and technology (SMT) in grades K-8.    The SLN will integrate the educational resources offered by  science/technology centers with the power of telecomputing  networking to provide powerful new support for teacher development  and science learning.  By December 1997 the SLN will develop and  evaluate the following:              UniVERSE - an online SMT database and software package            which will provide interactive capabilities to actively            and intelligently assist K-8 classroom teachers in their            Internet explorations, much like an electronic            \"librarian.\"              Online Museum Collaborative - a national consortium of            science museums (The Franklin Institute, the            Exploratorium, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry,            Museum of Science - Boston, and Science Museum of            Minnesota) that will pool their resources and expertise            to create online assets and provide ongoing professional            development on telecomputing networking for precollege            SMT teachers.              Online Demonstration Schools - a network of K-8 schools,            working in collaboration with consortium museums and            Unisys Corporation volunteers as demonstration sites for            online teaching and learning in SMT.    Over the course of three years, the SLN will provide direct support  to 180 teachers and 3,000 K-8 students in the online demonstration  schools.  Through existing teacher networks, each museum will offer  professional development for an additional 200 teachers each year.   The Urban Systemic Initiatives in Philadelphia and Miami offer the  potential for broader, systemic impact in those cities.    By the end of the grant period, the SLN will provide field- tested  models of a new kind of online SMT community through the  collaboration of science museums with industry and schools.  The  sustainable impact of the SLN will be assured by UniVERSE's status  as a publicly accessible database and software package and the  development of the national consortium of online museums, whose  network resources will be made available on an ongoing basis to  educators.  The three-year formative development of the online  demonstration schools will contribute vital data to precollegiate  school reform in SMT, showing how schools build capacity to become  members of the online community and demonstrating how teaching and  learning are enhanced by online resources.    Unisys Corporation has pledged its support to this project and will  provide matching funds for up to 40% of the total NSF award.",
