The forum will carry out strategic analyses of the   technical and business issues affecting agile manufacturing.  It   will serve as an industry voice in defining and prioritizing   research needs in support of agile manufacturing.  The forum will   provide recommendations as requested on the entire Agile   Manufacturing Initiative (AMI) including the Agile Manufacturing   Research Institutes and related demonstration projects.  The forum   will evaluate industry training needs in agile manufacturing   against available courses and materials.             This forum plays a central role in the success of the AMI   which provides an industry-led institute.  The forum will work as   a catalyst to assist in the dissemination and adoption of the agile   manufacturing research results.  Rapid deployment of this research   is seen as an important manufacturing strategy for the country.    Enterprises which adopt agile manufacturing concepts are expected   to change a broad range of operating characteristics quickly.  This   will enable them to take advantage of new manufacturing   technologies, and to facilitate timely response to unanticipated   market opportunities.",
