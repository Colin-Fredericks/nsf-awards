 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361730  Aye  POC proposes an entirely new approach to tomography in which recording and  reconstruction of the 3-D object is done in 2-D slices automatically, without significant  computer assistance and with very high spatial resolution.  This new process is based on  reduced coherence interferometry and will be called Spatial Coherence Effect  Tomography (SCET).  SCET overcomes the limitations of both classical holographic and  tomographic approaches.  Previous attempts at 3-D tomographic imaging usually involved  2-D projection images and the heavy use of computers for data processing and display,  thus reducing spatial resolution.  Although holographic imaging can provide high  resolution, it lacks an intrinsic tomographic interpretation.  The proposed method is  based on holographic recording using radiation with very short temporal coherence  length which can overcome major drawbacks in techniques using such sources, e.g., x-ray  lasers, while still preserving the advantages of both tomography and holography.  Moreover, the method is simple and efficient because it can provide a continuum of high  (spatial) resolution images of object slices in a single recording.  This new system will  produce low-cost, high-resolution tomographic imaging for biological structural analysis  as well as other non-destructive-evaluation (NDE) applications.  ***",
