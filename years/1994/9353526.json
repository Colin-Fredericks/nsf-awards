Through summertime  Teacher Institutes, year-round workshops, and regular meetings with  professional scientists, 272 teachers will learn new instructional  techniques for fieldwork pedagogy; increase their knowledge of  aquatic ecology, environmental chemistry, and scientific reporting;  learn to use new computer systems and environmental monitoring  equipment; and help students produce formal reports that are used  by public and private sector agencies to compile research data  about water quality in Connecticut.    The project is jointly managed by teacher educators at a regional  science museum and the CT Department of Environmental Protection,  and uses public and private sector expertise to enhance teacher  skills in a new applied environmental field research curriculum.   Project Search links teachers with professional scientists; it has  important implications for long-term curricular change and the  systemic improvement of statewide high school science education.",
