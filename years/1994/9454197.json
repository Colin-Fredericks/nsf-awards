It is a unique link between the creators of the  hardware, scientific researchers, and educators who can see the  adaptability of this material for the advancement of learning.   This project would take data that are waiting on the \"information  highway\" and provide practical, learning context for its use by  students.  In this pilot, three teachers would be funded for six  months.  As a supplement to KidSat, this project would combine the  team's and the teachers' efforts to produce usable materials for  teachers and thus provide a scientific context for data use by  students.    Cost sharing is 27%.",
