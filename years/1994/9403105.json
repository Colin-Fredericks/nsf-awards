Dr. Miller's doctoral degree  was from Harvard University under the supervision of Professor  David Evans.  Dr. Miller will continue research at the  California Institute of Technology under the supervision of  Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Miller's postdoctoral fellowship  will enhance his synthetic organic skills by providing him with  experience in organometallic catalysis as applied to olefin  metathesis. Longer term, he will apply his organometallic  training to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alpha-amino  acids based on the use of chiral rhodium carbonyl complexes.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***",
