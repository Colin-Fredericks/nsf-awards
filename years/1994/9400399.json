 "awd_abstract_narration": "The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center  (MRSEC)   at   the   University  of   Alabama   features   a  multidisciplinary  research  program  built   on   a   solid  foundation provided by the existing Center for Materials for  Information   Technology   (MINT).    The   MRSEC   supports  interactive research through two interdisciplinary  research  groups.    The   group   which   focuses   on   the   relationship   of  microstructure   and   magnetic   properties   carries   out  fundamental  measurements on materials  systems  which  have  potential applications in future magnetic recording systems.  Of  particular interest are nitrogenated iron based  alloys,  high    magnetization   iron   nitride   films   and   giant  magnetoresistance thin films.   The group which concentrates  on  the preparation and dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles  is  directed  to  develop  new synthetic  methods  for   the  preparation  of magnetic particles and to gain a fundamental  understanding of magnetic dispersions.    The  MRSEC is housed in the same research building where the  MINT  Center  is  located and shares  a  number  of  central  facilities  with  the existing center.   Collaboration  with  industry  is  extensive  and well established  by  the  MINT  Center.   The  MRSEC provides seed funding  for  exploratory  research    and   emphasizes   minority   recruitment    and  interdisciplinary  training.   A  major  component  of   the  educational  goals  is  to attract, retain  and  train  more  students  in  a  technologically important  area  where,  as  demonstrated by the success of graduates, excellent jobs are  available.  The close association with the Historically Back  Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in the South is utilized to  enhance  current  outreach programs  that  support  minority  students  and  faculty.   The center  currently  supports  7  faculty,   5   post-doctoral  assistants,  and  5   graduate  students.  The MRSEC is directed by Professor William D oyle.",
