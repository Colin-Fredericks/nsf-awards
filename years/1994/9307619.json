These systems assist and mediate  communication, interaction, understanding, and synchronization  among collaborating processes within organizations.  Workflow  techniques have existed for decades but, despite progress in many  areas, intelligent, industrial strength workflow systems are not  well established; the models themselves are too restrictive and the  systems lack flexibility, built-in intelligence, distribution, and  a solid theoretic foundation.  To advance the state of the  technology, this research has two objectives:  (1) the evolution of  a mathematical family of models for description and analysis of  organizational activity, and (2) the development of system  architectures to support the enactment of organizational  workflow.The models must enable expression of goals, temporal  constraints, dynamic change, and exception handling.  The systems  must enable execution of dynamic, goal-based models; provide  coordination and assistance to users at each opportunity; and take  advantage of distributed computer systems technology.  The method  to be employed for this research will include prototyping efforts,  methodology development, and studies of work in selected offices.   The final outcome of the research will be a solid foundation  consisting of a family of models, architectures, and methodologies  for the development of future workflow systems.",
