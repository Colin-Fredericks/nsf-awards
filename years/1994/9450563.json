Restructured  schools, a differentiated staffing model, a changed learning  environment, curricular adaptation based upon national standards,  and a strong professional emphasis emphasis are all components of  the Cincinnati Urban Systemic Initiative's (CUSI) plan for  systemic change. The CUSI builds on solid and extensive prior  work in the reconfiguration of the schools and implementation of  other major changes, including the replacement of top-down  management with a Total Quality Management approach to school-  based management, the creation of a pilot mini-district which is  envisioned as a catalyst for educational reform and the use of  Chapter I funds to bring about systemic reform.  Innovative  approaches to mathematics, science and technology (MST) education  reform include: (1) the changing of the school calendar in pilot  schools to a year round schedule that provides opportunity for  more flexible and creative learning opportunities tailored to the  needs of individual children; and (2) the creation of multi-  age/grade classroom structures in which the same team of  educators and support persons stays with individual children for  multiple years and is responsible, with the child, for each  child's successful attainment of outcome-based performance goals.",
