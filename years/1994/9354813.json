This is being accomplished through a  variety of mechanisms including the publication of a book and the  hosting of three learning tools development workshops.  The book  will be a multi-authored, collaborative work on the BioQUEST 3P's  philosophy with specific examples of use of materials in the  BioQUEST Library, use of the 3P's in wet labs and field work and in  situations where computers are not necessary, and discussions of  the specific issues related to the development and implementation  of open-ended, research and research-like experiences for students.   The project will also support curricular reform and learning tools  development through three summer workshops in three additional  major areas of biology.  Materials and information dissemination  will occur using a variety of methods including the book, BioQUEST  Notes, the BioQUESTLibrary, presentations and workshops at  conferences, the Introducing BioQUEST Hypercard stacks, field  testing of materials as part of the three-stage review process for  publication in the BioQUESTLibrary, through other publications such  as journal articles and labs in labbooks, electronic networks, the  monthly consortium status reports, and responses to general  inquiries via phone, e-mail, and U.S. mail.",
