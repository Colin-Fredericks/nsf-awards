 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354782  O'Connell             Courses in Climate Change, Global Warming and Paleoclimatology  are a recent addition to most earth and environmental science  curricula.  Most courses do not include laboratory exercises.  Climate change is a subject which is ideally suited to teach  students computer and analytical skills. It can be used to  encourage them to look at data and to draw their own  conclusions, and thus to question predictions and solutions  that are not based on thoughtful and thorough analyses of the  available information. They can learn that in science there is  often no single clear-cut answer. I propose to develop an  integrated course syllabus using available texts and journal  articles with six, climate-oriented laboratory exercises.  Developing the laboratory exercises is the main focus of this  proposal. The exercises should be adaptable to most Climate  Change courses and would be used to teach students to collect  and analyze data with a spreadsheet (using Microsoft Excell),  to develop simple model simulations (using Stella II), and to  manipulate and present data in variety of visibly useful  formats (using Spyglass Transform 2.0). They would learn to use  these programs as a component in assessing climate change from  both the geological and modern record. The resulting course  would be highly interactive, with students thinking through  their own answers. This format will better prepare them to  address the complex environmental and social questions of the  21st century.  ***",
