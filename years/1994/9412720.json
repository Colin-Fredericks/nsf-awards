 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412720  Chidsey  This research project addresses the structural origins of the  rates of long distance electron transfer across interfaces.  It  is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program,  with a goal of understanding the role of intervening and  surrounding material in the transfer of electrons between a  metal electrode and a precisely positioned electroactive  species.  The continuum dielectric model will be examined as a  basis for understanding and predicting the activation barrier  to electron transfer, the role of electroactive species located  between the metal and the polar electrolyte will be examined,  and the effect of electronic states of the spacer material on  electron transfer will be probed in these studies.  Thiol  monolayers on gold electrodes form the basis for these electron  transfer studies.  These measurements will have impact on the  development of new sensor and display technologies, and will  help to develop an understanding of interfacial charge transfer  in applications ranging from biology to microelectronics.  %%%  In order to understand the rates and mechanisms of charge  transfer between electrodes and electroactive species, a number  of model approaches have been developed.  One very promising  approach uses self assembled monolayer technology to position  the electroactive species and to control the structure and  electronic properties of the medium through which electron  transfer occurs.  The work supported here uses this approach to  examine the structural origins of the rates of charge transfer  across interfaces.  Knowledge in this area is crucial to  understanding the mechanisms of biological membrane charge  transfer, and in the development of new sensing and display  technologies.  The work supported here will contribute to the  development of this understanding.",
