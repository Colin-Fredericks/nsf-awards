 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361652  Feng    A very large number of science and engineering courses taught in colleges and universities today do not involve laboratories.  Although good instructors incorporate class demonstrations, hands on homework, and various teaching aids, including computer simulations, the fact is that students in such courses often accept key concepts and experimental results without discovery them for themselves.  The only partial solution to this problem has been increasing use of class demonstrations and computer simulations.    Protein Solutions propose the development of a completely self contained polymer materials laboratory which, although packaged like a textbook, will contain within it all of the materials, equipment, and information needed to directly discover and experience key concepts related to polymer materials.  Protein Solutions expect that such a Labless Lab Book will be widely adopted a a supplement to the more conventional polymer science and engineering textbooks, particularly in those courses which do not have a laboratory section or component.    Protein Solutions expect to eventually expand this approach to a wide variety of science and engineering courses.  It is appropriate to begin with polymer materials, however, because polymeric materials are so readily available for a wide variety of applications and because they exhibit a range of phenomena which are very easy to observe, experience, and discover.  ***",
