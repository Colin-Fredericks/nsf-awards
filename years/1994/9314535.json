The investigators intend to study mapping methods to  provide reliable approximate treatments of multi-quark  hamiltonian systems.  Various approaches will be  tested in the context of an exactly solvable model of  quark systems that admits both two- and three-quark  correlations.  Exact solutions of this model problem  will also be used to extract useful insight on the  quark structure of real nuclei.  The proposed research  will benefit from the expertise of the U.S.  investigator in mapping techniques and their  application to quark systems, while the Mexican  investigator will contribute his expertise in group  theoretical methods in physics.  In addition, the  proposed work will involve various groups in Spain  that have been collaborating with the two  investigators over the past few years.   ***",
