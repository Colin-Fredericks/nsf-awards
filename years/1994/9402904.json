 "awd_abstract_narration": "A discrete time stationary stochastic process is said to be long  range dependent if its correlations decrease to zero like a power  of the lag, as the lag tends to infinity, but their sum diverges.  Part I of the proposal proposes to investigate the large sample  behavior of three classes of robust estimators and to develop  asymptotically efficient and adaptive estimators in non-linear  regression models when the errors are long range dependent with  possibly unknown joint distributions. The Part II of the proposal  is concerned with studying the asymptotic behavior of several  classes of robust estimators and devloping asymptoticlaly optimal  inference procedures in non-linear time series in the presence of  regression component, in a semi-parametric setup. In particular,  the P.I. plans to develop asymptotically efficient and adaptive  estimators in random coefficient and threshold autoregression  models when there may be a regression variable present in these  models, in a llinear or non-linear fashion, and when the  distributions of the random coefficient and the error variable  are unknown. The optimal estimators would be developed a l  a Hajek - Le Cam theory.   A data set where an association between distant observations is  slowly decaying but persistent, as distance between observations  increases, is called long range dependent. Such data arise often  in astronomy, economics, geophysics, hydrology, meteorology, and  many other disciplines. An example worth mentioning is the data  of 289 high-precision measurements on the 1-kg check standard  weight made between 1963 to 1975 by the U.S. National Bureau of  Standards. In spite of ideal conditions for preserving  independence, the observations turned out to be long range  dependent. The first part of the proposal is concerned with  developing some optimal statistical procedures for analyzing the  long range dependent data in the presence of a covariate. The  second part of the proposal is concerned with developing  efficient inferential  procedures in some complicated time series  models that often arise in econometrics. It is anticipated that  these procedures will be broadly applicable and not very  sensitive to model departures.",
