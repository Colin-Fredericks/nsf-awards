Most of this award ($459,060)  provides funds to enable the NRC/BGC and other NRC committees and  boards to continue to provide assistance to agencies  participating with NSF in core functions of the NSTC Committee on  Environment and Natural Resources's Subcommittee on Global Change  Research (CENR/SGCR) in the development and evaluation of the  U.S. Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP).  Through this  additional funding, which was contributed by agencies  participating as members in the CENR/SGCR, the NRC/BGC and  related NRC boards and committees will continue to fulfill their  responsibilities in the following areas:       1.  Provision of advice to the CEES/SGCR on the U.S. Global  Change Research Program (US/GCRP);       2.  Provision of periodic reviews of the US/GCRP;       3.  Service as a liaison between the U.S. and other nations  in international planning efforts; and       4.  Establishment and operation of special ad hoc groups to  address issues of special concern regarding the US/GCRP.         In addition to continuing these core activities, an  additional $76,090 is made available to NAS through interagency  transfer of funds from NOAA and funds from NSF to support a  National Forum on Environment and Natural Resources R&D held in  late March 1994 at the request of the White House Office of  Science and Technology Policy.         Funds for these activities have been provided by NSF, the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Institute  for Environmental Health Statistics.",
