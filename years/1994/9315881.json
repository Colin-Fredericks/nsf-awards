In 1904, chinook salmon eggs from the upper Sacramento River in  California were shipped to New Zealand where reproducing  populations successfully became established throughout   New Zealand's South Island, all traceable to this single egg  shipment.  No other attempts to produce self-sustaining   transplanted populations of these fish have proved successful  elsewhere in the world. The study will focus on variation in  reproductive attributes of chinook salmon which are central to  the fitness of the population. This collaborative research brings  together the American and New Zealand experts concerned with the  reproductive traits of chinook salmon.",
