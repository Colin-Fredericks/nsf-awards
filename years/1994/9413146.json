 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413146  Ward    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Jerome V. Ward, Botanical  Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), to make a short-term visit to  the Philippines to finalize plans with Dr. Lolita J. Bulalacao,  Botany Division, National Museum, Manila, for cooperative  research on vegetation and climatic history of the Philippines.   During the three-week visit, the collaborators expect to (1)  establish personal links for future collaboration and  experimental design and (2) collect and analyze field samples in  order to demonstrate that the project has sufficient scientific  merit to justify support of a future cooperative research  proposal.    The collaborators expect to address several open questions for a  paleoecology study.  This preliminary research and the larger  project on tropical palynology, to follow, will provide new  insights into Late Quaternary environmental change and vegetation  instability, Holocene plant species migrations and population  expansions, and prehistoric human impacts on the tropical  forests.  The present project is ancillary to the Flora of the  Philippines Project (supported in part by NSF Grants No. INT-  9320518 and INT-9442970) which is surveying the remaining native  forests, cataloging all vascular plant species, and documenting  the plant diversity in the Philippines.  The PI and his Filipino  collaborator are well trained in this field of research.  This  project is relevant to the objectives of the East Asia and  Pacific Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and East Asian scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and  benefit.  ***",
