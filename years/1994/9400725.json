An excellent protection of steel has been achieved by applying a cathodic electrocoating (E-coat) primer on an interface-engineered steel panel (plasma polymerization of trimethylsilane by means of DC discharge with a pair of anode magnetrons), outperforming a zinc phosphated galvanized steel with the same E-coat in a corrosion test.  This research is an extension of such an approach to a larger scale operation by means of low temperature cascade arc torch (LTCAT) polymerization, that delineates many technical limitations of (conventional) plasma polymerization processes which hamper applications in large scale operations.  The proposed fundamental research is a preparatory step to the robotic spray coating of plasma polymers by LTCAT polymerization, which would enable engineers to coat large size, complex shape substrates with high uniformity  and reproducibility.  The advantages of this approach are that (1) the process is capable of coating a large surface area without scaling-up problems; i.e., the laboratory scale operation is essentially the same as that in a large scale operation, (2) the method can be applied regardless of nature and shape of substrate; i.e., it can be used in the surface treatment of plastics such as bumpers, and also in interface engineering of steel automobile bodies, etc., (3) the application of interface engineering can eliminate many conventional (pollution-prone) wet chemical processes such as galvanizing and phosphating processes, (4) the interface engineering process does not create non-recyclable materials and maintain high recyclability of final products.  Fundamentals of cascade arc torch polymerization and the transitional interface structure which provides the  maximum benefits of composite materials will be investigated at the level of a laboratory pilot scale reactor which employs moving (rotating) substrates.  This is an Industry/University Cooperative Research Project in which the Marshall Research Laboratory (Automotive Products) of the E.I. duPont Company is collaborating with the principal investigator at the University of Missouri, Columbia.    REU Supplement    Proposal Number: CTS-9442632  Institution: University of Notre Dame    Support in the amount of $5,000 is requested in order to support a female undergraduate student, Ms. Allison A. Barbeau, who has completed her sophomore year in chemical engineering at the University of Notre Dame with a 3.75/4.00 cumulative grade point average.  She is interested in obtaining research experience with Professor Joan F. Brennecke since she is considering going to graduate school.  this supplement is in line with the objectives of the REU program and ,hence, is recommended by the program officer.",
