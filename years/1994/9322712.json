The objective is to unify and simplify   these mathematical relationships for discrete event simulation.     The ultimate goal of the research is to develop explicit     mathematical representation of the dynamics of a discrete event     system with some practical utility and theoretical foundations     similar to that provided by differential equations in continuous    time simulation.       The outcome of this research will make it easier for users of   simulation to move between different models representations without  loss of the key elements of a model.  The ability to move between  different model representations is a significant research    contribution in simulation.  The impact is ease of modeling,     flexibility in system usage as users can easily move across     platforms, better modeling and modeling tools, and improved     analysis as the results from one model representation are compared   with those obtained under a different representation with the     objective of identifying any causes of discrepancies in results, if   any.",
