 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410646  Chen       This project investigates a challenging problem in nonlinear  control.  It aims to provide a systematic synthesis procedure for  designing output tracking controllers that apply to nonminimum  phase nonlinear systems.  Not only does the controller provide  stable asymptotic tracking, it also ensures that the transient  error will be within a prespecified bound.  This achieved by  using a novel approach of stable inversion.  In this approach,  the nonminimum phase system is first stably inverted to obtain  desired (and stable) state and input trajectories that map  exactly into the reference trajectory.  With this, the nonminimum  phase control problem is converted into a minimum phase one.   Then a feedback controller is designed to stabilize the closed-  loop system and to ensure robustness to certain types of  uncertainties.  This research is expected to make significant  contributions to the tracking problem as well as the basic  understanding of nonlinear systems.  The new procedures developed  can be applied to many engineering problems, such as aircraft   control, rocket control, medical equipment, nondestructive  evaluation, leading to superior performance and economic  benefits.  ***",
