The result  is to provide a better foundation for scientific and technological  literacy. All mathematics faculty are provided with hands-on  resources and on-site professional development training to devise  and incorporate laboratory components utilizing the TI-82 graphing  calculator in algebra, precalculus and calculus courses. By  providing classroom sets of TI-82 calculators and projections  units, all mathematics classrooms have vital technology which  facilitates both group discussions of mathematics and the overhead  projection of student and faculty presentations.  A set of  calculators for the library provide student with access to the  technology outside of the class time.  The project is predicated on  the belief that the collaborative nature of laboratory learning  moves the student from a passive role to one of an active learner,  injecting a new spirit of investigation into learning. The graphing  calculator is a tool by which abstract concepts and concrete  experiences are bridged, changing the way mathematics is taught and  learned.",
