Morphology  plays a unique role in organismal biology in that it integrates  and forms the context for observations from a variety of  disciplines. The Fourth Congress will be in North America and is  expected to attract a large number of distinguished scientists  from many countries. The purposes of ICVM-4 are to make the most  current research in vertebrate morphology available to North  American scientists and to provide the syntheses between  vertebrate morphology and its cognate fields that will provide  direction through the 90's and into the next century.       Holding of ICVM-4 in the U.S. presents a rare opportunity  for a large number of Americans to be exposed to the work of  European and other scholars. Although aspects of morphology are  strongly represented in the U.S., many areas are centered  elsewhere. Previously, only scientists who traveled to European  meetings could take full advantage of new developments in these  fields.       The scientific focus of the Congress will be provided by an  invited program consisting of (1) plenary lectures delineating  the interactions between morphology and population biology,  ecology, physiology evolution and development; (2) informal,  hands-on workshops intended to stimulate discussion and  interaction, and (3) formal symposia directed at major syntheses  of modern research areas, such as integrating molecular findings  into the framework of organismal biology and exploring how  physiological and paleontological evidence can be combined to  study evolutionary transitions. The Congress will also feature  contributed paper and poster sessions in a format intended to  enhance social interactions among the participants.  ***",
