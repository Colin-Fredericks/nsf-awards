 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321605  Bermann    Under the direction of Dr. Marc Bermann, Mr. Alvaro Higueras-Hare  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological survey and excavation in two areas of the Cochabamba  Valley which is located on the subtropical eastern slopes of the  Bolivian Andes.These valleys include distinct ecozones, some with  significantly higher agricultural potential than others. Mr.  Higueras-Hare will select two which vary along this axis and  compare their land use over time. To accomplish this he will  conduct a regional survey noting both differences in agricultural  potential and the distribution of archaeological sites over time.  With the use of GIS techniques he will map variations in  agricultural potential and then compare the archaeological  trajectory of high and low producing areas. In particular he is  interested in the transition from pre-Tiwanaku to Tiwanaku times.    Archaeological evidence indicates that large scale prehispanic  states developed in the Andean region. Empires repeatedly expanded  and incorporated smaller adjacent entities. This process occurred  on a worldwide basis but is particularly interesting in the Andes  because of the strong attitudinal zonation in the region. Given the  need to obtain products from different ecological zones, what  strategies did groups employ to accomplish this? What economic and  political mechanisms were thus developed? Many models have been  proposed. The Tiwanaku empire had its origin in highland Bolivia.  Although it's influence was widely felt, it is unclear just how it  interacted with important outlying regions. The Cochabamba Valleys  constitute such an area and through study of subregions of both  high and low agricultural potential, Mr. Higueras-Hare hopes to  learn how the Valley was tied into the Tiwanaku subsistence net.    This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of the interaction between human societies and  the environment in which they exist. It  will shed new light on the  growth of complex societies and assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
