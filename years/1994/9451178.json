 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451178  Hodapp  Over the past decade, solid-state laser diodes have made inroads  into a wide range of commercial electronics and industrial  applications. These inexpensive, monochromatic, wavelength tunable,  intense light sources are useful not only in CD players but in a  number of applications including atomic spectroscopy and laser-  cooling. This project will explore the physics of laser diodes and  their application to atomic spectroscopy as well as  introduce  first-year physics students to concepts of laser spectroscopy and  a portion of the advanced physics curriculum. The project will  construct a pair of optical workstations suitable for measuring  characteristics of laser diodes as well as for using the light to  perform absorption and saturated absorption spectroscopy on atomic  rubidium. These experiments have been designed with an open-ended  quality to them to allow students to explore the physics, rather  than to just execute a standard cookbook type of lab. As a portion  of this laboratory, upper-division students will be required to  present their findings to small groups of students in first-year  physics laboratories. In this way students will not only learn the  concepts more clearly (by having to present them), but the project  will provide an exciting introduction to physics not traditionally  seen in the first-year laboratory. These upper-division  laboratories are required of all physics majors and constitute a  significant step forward pedagogically, as it requires students to  develop their own experiments (within the context of the lab), make  their own predictions, and truly discover their own education.",
