 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gao  9400565          Based on the complementarity theory developed by  Gao-  Strang  in 1988-89, the objective of this proposed  research  is  to offer a comprehensive study on the duality theory  in  nonsmooth  mechanics and the related numerical  methods  for  finite   deformation  systems.  Topics  will  include:   (1)  Nonsmooth  plastic flow and structural limit  analysis;  (2)  Nonlinear  buckling  analysis for  plates  and  shells;  (3)  Control  problems and optimal design of smart materials  and  structures;  (4)  Complementary finite  element  method  for  nonsmooth optimization.          Finite deformation nonsmooth mechanics has been  found  more  and  more  important applications in smart  structural  analysis, civil and aerospace engineering. Direct method for  solving nonlinear and nonsmooth systems has always presented  serious  difficulties for mathematicians and engineers.  The  dual   approach  andcomplementary  finite  element   method,  however,  possess a great of advantages. We can expect  that  the  results  of  this proposed research  will  provide  new  insight  to  the  nonsmooth mechanics, variational  methods,  finite deformation theory, nonlinear optimization theory and  numerical methods.",
