 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400729  Qin       Since the fundamental work of Simon Donaldson about a decade  ago, gauge theory has been very sucessfully applied to study  smooth 4-manifolds, especially complex surfaces.  The main  concern of this project is to study the interplay between the  complex geometry and the differential topology of complex  surfaces, by utilizing smooth invariants introduced by Simon  Donaldson and Dieter Kotschick, by investigating stable vector  bundles and their moduli spaces on complex surfaces, and by using  recent work of Jun Li and Robert Friedman.  In particular, the  investigator wishes to study Donaldson invariants for simply  connected algebraic surfaces with trivial geometric genus  (including the complex projective plane).       This project is in the field of gauge theory, which  interacts heavily with other areas of mathematics such as  topology, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical physics.   Progress could take many different forms.  Surprisingly, recent  work in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by some physicists  (notably Edward Witten) has led to many mathematical insights in  the differential topology of complex surfaces.  Quite possibly, a  deeper understanding of some of the algebraic geometry and  algebraic topology at issue in this project will in turn shed  light on problems of concern to the community of quantum  physicists.  ***",
