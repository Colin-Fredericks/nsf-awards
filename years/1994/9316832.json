The glossy8 locus, one of the seventeen loci  known to be involved in the biosynthesis of this wax in maize, has  been molecularly cloned by tagging with a transposable element.  In  addition, the cer2 locus of Arabidopsis, which is involved in  cuticular wax biosynthesis, has been localized to a 70-kb segment  of the genome.  The cer2 locus will be identified by genetic  complementation tests.  Both genes will then be used to study the  biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of  these unique and biologically significant plant lipids.    The cuticular waxes of plants constitute the first barrier to the  environment and the stresses it imposes on plants.  Thus, these  waxes lay an important role in plant survival.  The composition of  these waxes and the biosynthetic pathways by which they are formed  are incompletely understood.  This project will make use of  molecularly cloned genes to examine the gene products of the  biosynthetic pathway and thus enlarge our understanding of it.    ***",
