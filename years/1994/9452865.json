This planning grant will result in  implementing a larger five-year project designed to reach out to  American Indian urban and rural communities to provide technical,  educational, and personnel support for their development and/or  enhancement of technological applications and communications, and  associated mathematics and science knowledge and skills.  The  Electronic Pathways Alliance will assist American Indian schools  and communities to upgrade science, mathematics, and reform their  efforts in restructuring these content areas in American Indian  education and communities.  Initially, a minimum of four national  projects will be finalized and begun as a result of this planning  grant.  The five-year project will operationalize the initial four  projects of Electronic Pathways Alliance in efforts to reach 100  interested American Indian communities (20 per year) over the five  years.  This planning Pathways Alliance and its associated  projects.  A brief paper describing Electronic Pathways Alliance  and associated projects will be generated and distributed  nationwide to American Indian communities, schools, and other  interested organizations.  ***",
