 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408973  Okunbor  Computer simulation of molecular dynamics is the study of time  evolution of the dynamical state of a system of interacting  particles or bodies by the computation of trajectories of  particles based on the numerical integration of Newton's  equations of motion.  Many-body and many-particle systems arise  in several applications, such as in studies of the dynamics of  biological macromoleculesin drug design, in the simulation of  plasmas, in vehicle and space structure simulation and in  cosmology.  The dimension of this system of ordinary differential  equations is of the order of tens of thousands.  To solve such a  system requires an enormous amount of computer time.  This  project aims to develop cost effective and globally stable  algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations, with an emphasis  on schemes suitable for large systems.  The project concentrates  on the development of integration methods that would facilitate:  taking much larger step sizes without sacrificing accuracy,  extension of the multiple-time stepping strategy to higher-order  integrators and the application of Psi Calculus for partitioning,  scheduling and routing the arrays to the multiprocessors to cut  down the computation time by a significant proportion.  ***",
