Keever   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9416922  The Medical Center of Delaware's Wide Area Network links five  main campuses, as well as several satellite primary care and home  healthcare facilities throughout the state.  With an Internet  connection at the Center, pharmacists will be able to exchange  protocols for new drugs, scientists can query their colleagues at  other institutions on specific research questions, legal data  bases and case studies, and physicians participating in clinical  trials can log patient-care information and receive updates  without leaving their offices.    The Center will purchase and install the gateway hardware  necessary to make an SMDS connection to the Internet by  connecting to PREPnet, the closet mid-level network .    Because of the Center's ever expanding involvement in research  and other areas, the requirements for connectivity are no longer  met by dial-up facilities.  Providing a direct connection to the  NSFNET has become increasingly important to meet the Center's  existing and future needs.",
