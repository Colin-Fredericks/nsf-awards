 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewitus  9315663    The recognition that light can stimulate respiration has  cast uncertainties in  primary productivity measurements for  years.  Resolution of this often pronounced effect is  complicated by the existence of several respiratory pathways  in phytoplankton (e.g. \"dark\" respiration, photorespiration,  mealier reaction), all driven by the cell in different ways.  It was recently discovered in the laboratory that several  estuarine phytoplankton contain another such pathway,  \"alternative   respiration\", that previously had been  reported in few species and whose function in phytoplankton  is poorly understood.  The potential for expression of this  pathway can be very high (up to 99% of the total light-  stimulated respiration), and glucose enrichment in the light  can this potential.  Based on this preliminary findings and  higher plant research, it is hypothesized that the  alternative pathway has energy dissipating role in  phytoplankton -- the pathway is engaged when the cellular  energy supply exceeds the demands for growth, maintenance,  and storage.  This hypothesis will be tested by examining  the effects of light, dissolved organic substrate, and  nutrient supplies on the capacity and activity of  alternative reparation in recently isolated phytoplankton  clones and in field populations.  This will be accomplished,  in part, by the use of membrane inlet mass spectrometry and  a newly developed antibody to the main enzyme of the  alternative pathway.  Understanding how alternative  respiration works impacts our understanding of how primary  productivity is controlled --  this process may be a rapid  and efficient means by which phytoplankton can dissipate  excess carbon and energy in the upper euphotic zone.    ***",
