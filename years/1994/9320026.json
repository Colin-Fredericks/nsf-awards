 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320026  Knobler    This award will support the participation of nine U.S. scientists  to take part in a workshop on the structure of monolayers at the  air/water interface to be held at Heron Island, Queensland,  Australia in February 1994.  The American coordinator is  Prof. Charles M. Knobler from the Department of Chemistry,  University of California, Los Angeles.  The Australian  organizer is Dr. G. T. Barnes, Department of Chemistry at the  University of Queensland. This project is being conducted under  the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program and support in  Australia is provided through the Department of Industry,  Technology and Regional Development. (DITARD).    The workshop will focus on the application of optical techniques  to the determination of the structures of insoluble monolayers  at the air/water interface. The availability of bright  synchrotron x-ray sources and pulsed neutron sources has made it  possible to carry out diffraction and reflection measurements on  interfacial layers. American investigators have been involved in  much recent work on the structures of monolayers; Australian  scientists have done notable work on monolayers, largely  classical due to the lack of easy access to synchrotron and  neutron sources. This situation has now changed with the purchase  by the Australian Government of a beam line in Japan. The  workshop will be conducted in a Gordon Research Conference style.  In addition to the Australian and American participants, two   scientists each from France, Germany and Great Britain will  also be taking an active role in this workshop.",
