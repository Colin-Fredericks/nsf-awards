Ten undergraduate biology students, the  majority of whom are expected to be African-American, will spend eight weeks during  the summer working at the bench, paired with a senior scientist leading a research team  working on timely questions involving marine physiology.  Using sharks, skates, flounder  and other sea animals, students will explore questions involving marine   physiology.  Using sharks, skates, flounder and other sea animals, students will explore  questions at the mechanistic level concerning reproduction, osmoregulation, acid base  balance, and ion transport.  Orientation lectures on basic concepts of marine physiology  and molecular biology during the first week will be supplemented by weekly evening  lectures on these subjects designed to encourage discussion by the students.   Undergraduates will attend the three weekly laboratory-wide science seminars on topics  related to marine physiology.  They will participate in a special ethics course taught  around expert lectures and group discussions of cases illustrating the ethical issues with  which scientists are confronted.  The research experience will be completed by each  student giving a talk to the lab community on his/her results and writing a research  paper for publication in the laboratory Bulletin.  ***",
