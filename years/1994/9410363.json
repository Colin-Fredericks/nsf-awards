 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410363  Nies  This is an award to provide support for a project, the overall  objective of which is to study interactions of reductive  dechlorination of chlorinated organic compounds and the  biomethylation of metals mediated by microbial coenzymes.  The  investigator plans on doing this in three overlapping periods,  the initial one of which will characterize the experimental  conditions under which methylation of metals like mercury occurs  in a defined chemical system.  He then plans on examining the  methylation of metals when combined with reductive dechlorination  under similarly defined chemical conditions followed by  determination of the rates at which these processes occur  individually and combined in anaerobic sediments.    The decontamination of air, water, soil, sediments and sludges  containing mixtures of pollutants, each of which requires a  different removal or transformation procedure, poses a special  problem in the engineering design of processes and systems that  are aimed at restoration of the useful qualities of the  contaminated media.  Results will provide guidance for  engineering design of processes to decontaminate environmental  media contaminated by mixtures of heavy metals and chlorinated  organic compounds.  The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards  Program.  ***",
