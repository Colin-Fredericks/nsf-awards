 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near-infrared fluorescence is a relatively new technology which enables high sensitivity at reduced cost.  It is currently used in commercially available automated DNA Sequences as well as applied in single molecule detection research.  The large reduction in background fluorescence as well as the greatly reduced scatter effect.  Derived by operation in the near-infrared optical region accounts for the increased sensitivity.  The economical use of diode lasers and low noise silicon detectors has been made possible by recent technology advances in communications, optical storage, and video cameras.    This STTR project will investigate the feasibility of using near-infrared fluorescence for detecting and quantifying analytes using liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (HPCE).  Various optical configurations will be fabricated in order to maximize sensitivity as well as compatibility with HPLC and HPCE.  Both direct fluorescence using analytes labeled with near-infrared dyes will be examined.  Applications includes detection of analytes in media such as blood where background fluorescence and scatter is greatly reduced in the near-infrared.",
