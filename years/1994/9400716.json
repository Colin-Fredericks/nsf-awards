 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mijovic  This research is on molecular and phenomenological aspects of  dielectric properties of reactive systems in the frequency domain  of the dipole relaxation process.  The work concerns both  monofunctional (non-polymer forming reactants) and multifunctional  or polymer forming reactants.  The unique feature of the  investigation is that it will probe the exact molecular make-up of  the reactive system, where the molecular probe is the dipole itself  and the response is measured in real time.  The analysis is based  upon the premise that the dielectric response in the course of  reaction must reflect a change in the type and concentration of  dipoles and a decrease in their mobility.  Reorientational dynamics  of dipoles will be experimentally determined as a function of  reaction time and temperature over a wide frequency range that will  always include the major relaxation process.  The observed  dielectric behavior will be checked against model predictions.  For  the monofunctional reactive formulation, we shall seek to establish  correlations between the dielectric properties and the known  mechanistic kinetics.  Modelling of the multifunctional polymer  forming system will be based upon the fundamental correlation  between the frequency-dependent dielectric constant and its time-  dependent counterpart, which will be appropriately modified to  account for the distribution of relaxation times in reactive  polymers.  %%%  This fundamental research is of utility in the preparation of  polymer-matrix composites in that it will allow a better control of  the chemical reactions in their manufacture.",
