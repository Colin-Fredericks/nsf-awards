 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410895  Siddiqi  This research program is to investigate the hypothesis that  seismic deformations can cause, or contribute to, drain clogging  of earth dams, specifically, the Tampas Canyon Dam.  This dam has  been shaken by several significant earthquakes, including the  January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake and its after shocks.    In recent years it has been observed that the water table  (phreatic surface) has been rising significantly at this dam due  to improper functioning of the inclined drains, resulting in  seepage on the downstream slope.  The Tampas Canyon Dam is an  earth and rockfill dam, and is located in San Juan Capistrano,  Orange County, California.  A complete geotechnical investigation  during the past three years has indicated that the factor of  safety under pseudo-static conditions with the existing elevated  phreatic surface is well below the acceptable level.  Several  borings have revealed significant clogging of the drains with  upstream core material.  Based on the results of this  investigation, it is hypothesized that the presence of the core  material has been caused by disruption of the existing bond  between the drain and the core due to seismically induced  deformations.  Relative displacement of the core and drain, along  with loosening of the core material, are thought to result in the  intrusion of the fine-grained core material into the coarser and  more porous drain material.  No definitive proof of this  mechanism has so far been found.    The objective of this investigation is to determine if changes in  the phreatic surface at this dam are caused by seismically-  induced settlements.  This is being accomplished by monitoring  horizontal and vertical movements within the embankment due to  significant aftershocks.  Piezometer readings and pool elevations  are monitored to determine if a rise in the phreatic  surface  occurs.  ***",
