 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321117  Schott  Scientists have collegial circles that influence their research.   This dissertation will examine how these circles differ between  men and women scientists and how the circles differ between the  United States and other countries.  Scientists have been surveyed  in a dozen other countries but at only one U.S. university, where  the number of women scientists is too small to enable inference.   This grant will support interviews with 80 or more scientists at  four other U.S. universities.  Preliminary analyses suggest that  gender does affect the composition of scientists' circles of  colleagues.  Notably, at least for scientists in other countries,  there is a tendency for same-sex selection.  The dissertation  will contribute to the understanding of how gender affects  informal communication and organization in science and how  national contexts shape these gender effects.  ***",
