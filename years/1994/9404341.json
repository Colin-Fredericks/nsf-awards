 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404341  Kan       The principal investigator proposes to analyse the global  wave structures for systems of conservation laws governing  three-phase flows in petroleum reservoirs. Global solutions to  these equations with arbitrarily large initial data will be  constructed by showing the convergence of various finite  difference schemes and the vanishing viscosity method.  He also  plans to study the eqautions governing two dimensional steady  irrotational transonic gas flows past an obstacle. Solutions to  the inviscid problem will be constructed by studying the  convergence of the zero-viscosity limit of the corresponding  viscous problem.    The model equations to be studied in the first  problem are qualitatively similiar to various models used in  practical petroleum reservoir simulations. The mathematical study  of these equations should add to our understanding of the  processes of secondary and tertiary oil recovery from oil fields.  The equations to be studied in the second problem can be used to  describe the flow of air past an airplane wing. The mathematical  studies of these equations are therefore relevant to many  aerodynamics applications.",
