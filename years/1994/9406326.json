 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diversity of neuronal cell types in vertebrates derives  from regional differences along the anterior-posterior (A/P)  as well as the dorsal-ventral (D/V) axes of the developing  nervous system.  Previous work has shown that A/P properties  are extremely labile during the initial phases of  regionalization.  In order to investigate the corresponding  stages of neural regionalization along the D/V axis, this  investigator initiated a series of experiments examining the  early phases of D/V neural patterning using the amphibian  Xenopus as a model system.  Preliminary data suggest a model  in which D/V pattern in the prospective spinal cord region  is fixed at relatively early stages in contrast to the  anterior brain region in which D/V pattern remains labile  for a prolonged period of time.  Using tissue manipulations  in conjunction with molecular approaches, this proposal will  test and extend this model by systematically examining the  tissue interactions governing the early stages of D/V neural  patterning.  These experiments will not only provide a  framework for linking gene expression with biological  processes mediating D/V patterning events but will also  contribute to an understanding of the unique properties of  embryonic neuronal tissue, particularly its enormous  plasticity.",
