In  collaboration with universities, other education agencies, and all  state school systems, 230 inservice and 170 preservice teachers are  trained to use the current technologies that are available as tools  to enhance science and mathematics learning.  Teachers from 135  schools each participate in a two-year enhancement program, meeting  for two weeks each of the two summers and 12 additional days during  the school year.  Topics include computer software, data probes,  data storage, and telecomputing.  E-mail and database support are  provided through the state system for teachers known as NEWTON.    The summer workshops are organized with the mornings dedicated to  the teachers learning the tools and the afternoon to hands-on work  with the technology.  The staggered plan, the multiple settings,  and the supporting communications technologies enable teachers to  work with their peers throughout the school year.     Cost sharing is estimated at 109%.  ***",
