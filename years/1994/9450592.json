The partners in this project are the Newark  Museum, the New Jersey Marine Science Consortium and Liberty Science Center.  The non-  residential program will be comprised of five academic year workshops conducted during the  spring semester of 1995, a four-week summer component to be held during July of 1995, and  a follow-up session in September 1995.  Instruction will be provided in science, math and  engineering, as well as oral and written communication skills.  Continuing experiences will be  provided through follow-up site visits to:  the Pocono Environmental Education Center in  Dingman's Ferry, Pennsylvania; the Marine Science Consortium in Sandy Hook, New Jersey;  the Newark Museum and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.  In addition,  the student participants will receive academic and career counseling, and will continue to  interact, both formally and informally, with female professionals engaged in SEM careers,  including faculty, as well as with university students.      Participants will be involved in daily structured athletic events to encourage teamwork and  cooperative efforts.  Existing study groups will continue to foster cooperative learning habits in  the investigation of scientific, math and engineering concepts.  Program staff will include three  female elementary school teachers and three female high school math/science teachers, and NJIT  SEM faculty.  The pre-college teachers will form teams composed of an elementary teacher and  a high school teacher to work with the students.  A program coordinator will work part-time  during the 1995 spring semester and full time for five weeks in the summer.  All participants  will be provided with information and applications for other summer precollege enrichment  programs in SEM following completion of this program.  ***",
