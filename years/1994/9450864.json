 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing an undergraduate laboratory in which  computer-aided analysis and display will be used for instruction in  atmospheric sciences.  The facility allows the integration of  interactive analysis, manipulation and display of meteorological  data into the department's curriculum and serves an increasing  student population.  The department has already made considerable  efforts in software development, establishing a data acquisition  infrastructure, and in pilot attempts applying workstation analysis  in the classroom.  A considerable range of courses makes use of the  proposed facility, from introductory classes to predominantly  major's classes in synoptic meteorology, forecasting, and dynamics.   In addition, the new laboratory is increasing and enhancing the  undergraduate research opportunities in the department.  This  facility allows students to examine atmospheric structures and  processes with an ease and a level of detail not previously  possible and aids student understanding of the complex  three-dimensional structures of weather systems.  Considering the  department's substantial experience in meteorological software  development and data storage technologies, it is expected that the  laboratory software and instructional approaches that are developed  for the proposed facility will be important contributions to  undergraduate instruction in the discipline; these advances will be  made available to the entire atmospheric sciences community.",
