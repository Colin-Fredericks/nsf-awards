 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of democracy is dynamic and multifaceted.  Because  democracy had been examined form a variety of intellectual  perspectives, any graduate training program in the study of  democratization must necessarily be interdisciplinary if it is to  adequately prepare the students for conducting research or teaching  on the topic of democratization.    The proposed traineeship program at Iowa would meet this  interdisciplinary goal by recruiting students onto both the  Political Science (three students) and the Sociology (two students)  Departments and then providing a training program that draws upon  substantive courses in these departments, as  well as the Colleges  of Law and Business Administration.  The formal course work will be  anchored by two core seminar; one that present a broad theoretical  and methodological overview of studies of democratization and a  Coordination Seminar that acts to integrate the students into  ongoing research projects focused on the process of democratization  in a number of Asian, East European, former Soviet and latin  American countries.    The elective seminars that add to the interdisciplinary quality of  the proposed training program are organized into four substantive  topic areas:  those focused on Institutions, Economics and Markets,  Socia-Political Culture and Elite Strategies.  These different  areas reflect the major research traditions in the study of  democratization.  Students would take at least one course from each  of these substantive areas.    A research apprenticeship would be a required part of the training  program.  This apprenticeship would directly involve the student in  research opportunities in countries currently experiencing a new  wave of democratization.  In most cases, this research involvement  would form the basis for the students' dissertation research.    The Political Science and Sociology Departments of the University  of Iowa are both highly rated graduate departments that have small  number s of graduate students relative to the size of their faculty.   Because these departments have traditionally provided the graduate  students with a good deal of individual attention and mentoring,  they have had very high rates of PhD completion.  Enrollments in  graduate courses in these departments is relatively low, therefore,  adding three to five more students in these classes will not affect  the quality of these courses in any way.  The University of Iowa  faculty that would participate in this program are all currently  involved in ongoing teaching and research on democratization; they  stand ready to welcome a new set of graduate students interested in  obtaining training in this relevant and exciting area of study.",
