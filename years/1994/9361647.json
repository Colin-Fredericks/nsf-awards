One group of fifth-generation systems,  conceptually descended from graphics-based simulators, uses  virtual reality (VR) technology to capture motor responses  and alter a simulated world accordingly. A proposed second  group, conceptually descended from embedded training systems  and called a literal reality (LR) system, is the focus of  the proposed work. In LR applications, students will move  freely about in a real-world educational environment,  receiving instructions and feedback in part from tools to be  developed in this effort. Three supporting devices will be  investigated to determine their potential value as tools for  LR and VR systems. Specifically, three-dimensional  anthropometry systems and an existing cordless audio  computer interface will be investigated, adapted, and tested  for their value in LR and VR systems. Also, a  computer-controlled laser pointer will be studied for its  value as a tool for LR systems. A prototype LR educational  environment will be created and demonstrated.  ***",
