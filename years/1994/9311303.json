The Australian summer monsoon is strongly influenced by  the Asian winter monsoon, the intensity of which is controlled by  changes in solar radiation caused by variations in the Earth's  orbit around the sun (Milankovitch effect).    This award supports research designed 10 to develop an improved  geochronology of lake-full events as a first-order test of the  proposition that January insolation over the Tibetan Plateau can be  as a proxy for the intensity of the Australian monsoon; 2) to  produce an independent reconstruction of aridity for the last 150  ka across the basin, and reconstruct vegetation during the last  lake-full interval (60-70 ka), using the isotopic composition of  organic and inorganic molecules preserved in ratite eggshells  (reflecting the proportion of C3 and C4 plants), and 3) to test the  potential impact of vegetation change on climate by modeling the  penetration of monsoonal precipitation into the Lake Eyre Basin  with a high-resolution (3o grid) Global Circulation Model  incorporating two different vegetation regimes.",
