 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452536  Ferguson  The Franklin Institute of Boston will improve its Physics  Laboratory by the purchase of equipment that, together with already  existing computers, will enable enhanced data acquisition and  analysis, the further integration of major physics topics, and the  reinforcement of similarities in physical phenomena.  The  instrumentation consists primarily of sensors, peripherals, and  transducers. This equipment, together with the addition of  dynamics, optics, microwave and e/m systems will facilitate the  collection, storage and manipulation of data. A single experimental  platform selected from the above-described equipment, such as a  sonometer studying wave behavior, when teamed up with the ability  to change experimental results through the use of power amplifiers,  digital function generators, driver/detector coils and sensors,  will result in a more integrated approach to physics instruction.  The physical phenomena of wave behavior described above will then  be studied in optics, microwaves and atomic structure, reinforcing  the similarities, through the utilization of the appropriate  systems.  The proposed laboratory improvement is highly significant  to Franklin, as a two-year technical college serving a  predominantly economically-disadvantaged urban population. Without  full exposure to the state-of-the-art data analysis methods  currently utilized by private sector industry, the Institute's  students, the majority of whom will be entering the work force upon  graduation, will not have adequate professional training in this  vital area. In addition, these students, and those who elect to  continue their education at four-year institutions, will gain a  more thorough knowledge of the general theory through a laboratory  which offers the best possible integration and reinforcement of  major physical principles and phenomena.",
