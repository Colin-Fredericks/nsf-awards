 "awd_abstract_narration": "Granaas    The University of South Dakota is the recipient of NSF funds to support the  renovation of the Human Factors Research Laboratory located in the 64-year old  South Dakota Union Building.  The modernization of over 1,550 square feet will  provide students and faculty with the opportunity to conduct contemporary research  and research training within the Human Factors program.  The role of Human Factors  Psychology has grown commensurately with modern society's increasing reliance  upon technology.  As emerging technologies have progressively increased the  complexity of human-machine and human-system interactions, Human Factors  psychologists have been playing an increasingly important role in the analysis,  modeling, and design of systems to increase worker safety and productivity.  The  program has trained 57 Ph.D.'s since its founding in 1965.  The multidisciplinary  training program is research based and places heavy demands upon the laboratory  infrastructure which has become outmoded and crowded.  As one of only 24  universities nationally to establish a Ph.D.-level training program in human factors,  the laboratory renovation is important to understanding the human-machine interaction  and the development and use of future technologies.",
