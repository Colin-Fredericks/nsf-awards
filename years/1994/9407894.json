 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407894  Fink    The discovery that tolerance to self antigens encountered in  the lymphoid periphery can be induced by rendering self-  reactive T cells immunoincompetent has stimulated the  analysis of the signaling machinery in these anergic  populations.  The experiments described in this proposal are  aimed at understanding the nature of the signaling defects  in a subpopulation of murine T cells that has been rendered  refractory to normally stimulatory signals.  These T cells  are derived from mice that are transgenic for a T cell  receptor (TCR)  chain gene whose expression mediates the  recognition of a self antigen.  Encounter of the T cell with  this self antigen is unusual in that it results in the  downregulation of the cell surface expression of both the  TCR and its CD8 coreceptor, and renders these cells  immunoincompetent, even upon stimulation by signals not  thought to be affected by receptor density.  These studies  are designed to localize the impairment in signaling in  anergic cells by analyzing:       (1) their ability to mobilize internal calcium stores  in response to antibody-mediated crosslinking of surface TCR  molecules       (2) their patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation before  and after TCR crosslinking       (3) the mobility shift of the CD8-associated  nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase p56lck upon cell  activation       (4) the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase  upon TCR crosslinking, and       (5) the transcriptional activity of the genes encoding  the transcription factors c-fos and c-jun upon activation.  %%%  The lymphocyte effector arm of the immune system is divided  into two main compartments, B and T Cells.  While B cells  make antibody molecules that can recognize soluble foreign  substances or antigens, T cells concentrate on cell-bound  antigens using a two chain surface receptor (the T cell  receptor or TCR).  Much of T cell differentiation takes  place in the thymus, including the induction of self  tolerance, a process that often resu lts in the deletion of  thymocytes whose TCRs recognize self proteins.  This  distinction between \"self\" and \"nonself\" is critical to the  functioning of a healthy immune system.  T cell tolerance to  antigens expressed outside the thymus can be induced and  maintained by mechanisms in addition to clonal deletion.  Encounter of self-reactive T cells with antigens in the  lymphoid periphery can render these cells nonfunctional or  \"anergic\" frequently resulting in their elimination.  This  investigator has defined a population of relatively long-  lived anergic T cells that can purified from murine blood on  the basis of an unusual surface antigen phenotype.  Using  this system, she will define the aspects of the complicated  pathways of signaling that lead inward from the TCR on the  cell surface that are altered in anergic relative to  immunocompetent cells.  These studies are aimed at  understanding this nondeletional mechanism for maintaining  self tolerance, and why it occasionally fails.  ***",
