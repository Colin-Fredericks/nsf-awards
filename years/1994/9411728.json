Transposition is a significant source  of spontaneous mutation in most, probably all, organisms.  It is  widely supposed that transposon insertions in coding regions cause  loss-of-function (knock-out) mutations.  This paradigm is the  product of the genetic methods (detection of phenotypic mutants)  which have been used to monitor transposon activity.  Recent  discoveries suggest that many transposons are efficiently spliced  from transcribed messages, and so do not induce phenotypic  mutations.  The proportion of transposon insertion which have no  visible phenotypic effect is unknown.       Molecular methods will be used to detect transposon insertions  based on their DNA structure.  A large number of insertions in a  target gene will be isolated, and each characterized to determine  its phenotype and pattern of splicing.   The results will have  general implications for understanding the structure of eucaryotic  genomes, as well as applied benefits for the use of transposon  tools in molecular biology, and the detection and treatment of  transposon-induced mutations.",
