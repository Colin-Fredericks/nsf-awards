 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320960  CUTLER  Public trust in the process of trial by jury rests on peoples'  perceptions of the fairness of trial procedures and the accuracy  of trial outcomes.  Behavioral science methodology can be used to  assess the fairness and accuracy of trial procedures, to make  recommendations for improving those procedures, and ultimately to  enhance peoples' faith in the justice system.  This research  focuses on one of the most common elements of criminal and civil  trials: eyewitness testimony.  By bringing behavioral science  data to bear on the effectiveness of traditional legal safeguards  designed to ensure the accuracy of eyewitness testimony, this  research will make concrete and practical recommendations  concerning trial procedure.      In this series of experiments the PIs systematically examine  attorney, judge and jury sensitivity to the factors that  influence the quality of identifications tests and their  abilities to use this information to properly evaluate the  utility of eyewitness testimony.  The methodology involves  exposing practicing attorneys to simulated line-up identification  tests, judges to simulated motions to suppress identification  testimony, and experienced jurors to simulated trials, and  recording their reactions to and evaluations of the fairness of  the procedures and the likely accuracy of the eyewitness  testimony.  ***",
