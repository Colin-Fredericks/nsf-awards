These  \"synthetic lethal\" mutations are likely to define genes whose  products interact with profilin, or that provide similar functions.   To identify the specific functions of these genes and to define  their interactions with profilin, the following genetic and  biochemical studies will be performed: 1) Characterization of  profilin synthetic lethal (ps1) mutants.  2) Cloning of profilin  synthetic lethal genes and analysis of their protein products.  3)  Investigation of the PSL1 gene product and associated proteins.  %%%%  The long-term goals of this project address several basic cell  biological questions using yeast as a model experimental organism:  i) how does the cell establish polarity; ii)what signals convey  this decision-making process to those components of the cell that  are responsible for carrying out the necessary morphological  changes; and iii) once this message is conveyed, how are  morphological changes controlled in an orderly fashion? More  specifically, this project strives to identify the role of the  actin-binding protein profilin in cell growth.  ***",
