This study will investigate the sublethal  effects of two types of disease on populations of mountain spiny  lizards (Sceloperus jarrovii).  Animals in the natural populations  will be medically treated to cure them of intestinal worm  parasites, malaria, or both with an additional group of lizards  left as controls.  Subsequently, their growth rate, survival, and  fecundity will be measured.  Additional studies will be conducted  on the physiological performances of infected versus uninfected  lizards.  Studying the effects of disease in natural populations is  important, because disease could be a major impediment to the  survival of numerous endangered species.",
