The conference will  include invited papers, panels, and working groups evaluating the current practices and future  directions in science education for students with disabilities.  The purpose of the conference  is to educate science teacher educators, science teachers, and professionals providing services  and/or equipment to persons with disabilities as to what resources and strategies are effective  for quality science education for students with disabilities.  General goals of the conference  are:    1.   To model instructional strategies and provide specific suggestions which can enhance       and contribute to the learning and participation of students with disabilities in the       science classroom and laboratory.    2.   To increase awareness of technological and educational advancements which can       enhance and contribute to the learning and participation of students with disabilities.    Participants will be provided with opportunities to actually experience effective instructional  practice for persons with disabilities while receiving guidance and direction from an educator  and a scientists, with the disability, in each of four disability areas along with a science  educator and special educator with expertise in the area of cognitive impairments.   Recommendations for improved practice will be shared and responded to by participants.   Information in areas of career concerns, teacher education, methods, materials/programs,  dissemination, evaluation and assessment, and educational organizations and agencies will be  compiled and prepared into a document for conference participants.  The proceedings will be  completed following the conference, and become available to interested individuals and  agencies at a nominal cost.  ***",
