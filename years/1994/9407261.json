 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407261  Towle    Euryhaline animals by definition are capable of tolerating a broad  range of salt levels in their aquatic environments.  An example is  the green shore crab Carcinus maenas, an introduced species in many  intertidal habitats around the world.  This crab succeeds in a  range of environmental salinities by regulating its own salt levels  in the blood, depending on transport systems in its multifunctional  gills.  Two sodium transporters in crab gill, a sodium/hydrogen  exchanger and a sodium/potassium pump, are very similar to  transporters in the mammalian kidney.  If we can learn more about  how the green crab and other euryhaline animals cope with varying  salt loads under natural conditions, perhaps we will better  understand processes in our own kidney which may be related to  hypertension and other disorders of homeostasis.  We may also learn  enough about the specifics of the physiology of Carcinus to suggest  environmentally safe approaches to its control as a pest species.   Dr. Towle plans to study the two sodium transporters in the crab  using the techniques of molecular biology.  He will identify the  genetic code for each of the transporters using the polymerase  chain reaction (PCR).  Determining the DNA sequence of each will  permit a comparison with similar transporters in mammals and other  vertebrates.  He will also be able to study the molecular  expression of each transporter in different specialized tissues  under various salinity challenges.  He expects that the  transporters will be expressed most strongly in gills of animals  challenged with low environmental salt, conditions in which salt  uptake would be adaptive.  The research will be accomplished with  the assistance of undergraduates at Lake Forest College and Mount  Desert Island Biological Laboratory.  ***",
