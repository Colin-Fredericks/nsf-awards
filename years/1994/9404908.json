Techniques will be developed for machine learning of the syntactic and semantic structures in scientific text. Unsupervised learning, which has been successful in discovering syntactic and semantic word classes, will be extended to more complex tasks.  Supervised learning will be used to set the unsupervised results in the standard context of parts of speech (noun, adjective, verb), structures (noun and verb phrases, prepositional phrases) and relations (coreference, apposition, prepositional phrase attachment).  The character-stream-based approach used in past corpus studies will be replaced by an object-oriented database approach, which will integrate smoothly with case-based techniques already developed.  The database approach makes it possible to build information-rich indexes as new relations are discovered.  The indexes, in turn, make further analyses more flexible and efficient.  The research will use the electronic forms of the journals of the American Society for Microbiology.  The result of the research will be to introduce a collection of powerful and flexible new techniques to analyze complex text and extract the basic conceptual content from it.  The content can then serve as the basis for building powerful information retrieval systems.  ***",
