These  facilities include three beam lines equipped with two dimensional  multi-wire area detectors for macromolecular crystallography,  membrane diffraction and small angle scattering.  The biology  user program at the HFBR has been in existence for approximately  15 years and has serviced academic, industrial and federal  researchers in the biological sciences as well as by physicists,  chemists and material scientists from the U.S. and abroad.   During the last grant period over 50 publications have resulted  from work done at these facilities and currently there are over  50 investigators including postdoctoral associates and graduate  students who are using the facility.  In addition to providing  hardware support for these researchers, the resident scientific  and technical staff provide data analysis support and educational  programs for the user community in order to maximize the  productivity of our neutron scattering and diffraction program.   During the last grant period, several major changes in hardware  and software, including the installation of a new detector on the  crystallography station were implemented.  These changes have had  the cumulative effect of increasing the throughput on all of the  biology beamlines.  %%%  Biological structural studies using neutron diffraction and  scattering techniques are important because they provide  structural information which can not easily be obtained through  other means.  These studies are aimed at determining the  structural basis for function of these systems thereby providing  fundamental information which can be used to understand the basis  of viable, healthy life and will provide strategies for the  treatment of diseases.  Because neutron structural studies are  exquisitely sensitive to the location of hydrogen atoms, they  have been used to determine the role of hydrogen in enzyme  reactions, the  location and delivery of drugs across cell  membranes and the organization of large biochemical systems such  as muscle, ribosomes and chromosome structure.  Because of the  successful pioneering studies on these systems at Brookhaven  National Laboratory, we are in a position to probe the frontiers  in structural biology and to further our understanding of these  systems thereby facilitating discoveries with biomedical and  environmental applications.  ***",
