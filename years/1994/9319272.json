More specifically, the goals are to:  (1) elaborate a model of prosodic production proposed recently by Ferreira (1993), which in turn will shed light on more global models of production; (2) use this model to develop and test hypothesis about how prosodic information might be used and integrated with syntactic and semantic information during auditory language comprehension; and (3) develop an online task for examining auditory language comprehension, an auditory analogue of the moving window task.  In addition, by combining research in production and comprehension, this project will shed light on the important question of how the language production and comprehension systems are related.  The proposed studies are divided into two sections, one on production and one on comprehension.  The production experiments employ a paradigm in which participants view a picture or answer a question and generate a sentence in response to the stimulus.  These studies designed to explore the prosody of spoken sentences employ a paradigm in which speakers read a sentence, memorize it, and produce it upon receipt of a cue.  These experiments will examine the syntactic and phonological factors influencing the durational and pitch properties of spoken sentences.  The comprehension experiments will use a technique Ferreira has recently developed called the Auditory Moving Window, which measures processing load across a sentence.  (To allow comparison of sentence processing in the auditory and visual domains, the comprehension studies will also be conducted using eye movement monitoring and the visual moving window paradigms.)  The listeners will hear sentences containing prosodic cues normally produced by speakers for those sentences, either with or without biasing lexical and contextual information.  The goal of these studies is to examine how t hese sources of information interact during auditory language processing.",
