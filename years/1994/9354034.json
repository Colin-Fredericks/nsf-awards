 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354034  Hillman    The Temple University's Colleges of Arts & Sciences,  Education, and Engineering & Architecture, the Community  College of Philadelphia, the School District of Philadelphia  and PATHS/PRISM-the Education Partnership have joined to  develop a new model for the education of prospective K-12  teachers which integrates new teaching methodologies with  math and science core content courses.  Since Temple  University, in conjunction with Community College, is the  major teacher preparation institution for the Philadelphia  School District, this will have a systemic impact on the  200,000 students in the Philadelphia School District and  serve as a national urban model.    The Collaborative will revise selected basic college math and  sciences courses to reflect closely the pedagogies and  content that the students will need as teachers.  These  revisions will include:  enhanced faculty/student  interaction, appropriate instructional materials, inquiry-  intensive methodologies as well as new technologies.  Several  courses will be developed and modified, including, for  example, a team-taught cross-disciplinary science course and  a cognitive psychology course. Prospective teachers will  participate in practica early in their pre-service training  at specially selected Professional Development schools.   Practicum supervisors will join intending teachers in  seminars to reinforce content and pedagogy.  The model will  include expansion of Temple's 5-year teacher education  program in which students who major in Arts & Sciences and  minor in education are certified after completing their 5th  year.  University and Community College faculty will  participate in intensive staff development and cross-class  visitations with School District teachers.  After careful  evaluation, the model will be widely disseminated through a  national conference and a variety of presentations.",
