Given that active, rather than passive,  study is necessary for the mastery and application of the concepts  of chemistry, the computer provides an ideal vehicle for this type  of learning, especially in the form of hypertext.  Our preliminary  version of a hypertext problem solving guide using the hypertext  program Guide (OWL International) has received very favorable  student responses.  We believe that this hypertext program, using  the Guide software, is helping to develop rational approaches to  learning and problem-solving, is building self confidence, is  making the concepts of chemistry accessible to students with a  greater range of abilities, and is serving as a model for the  teaching of chemistry by secondary school teachers.  This hypertext  book, ChemGuide, is encouraging student participation by  constructing most discussions around questions that must be  answered by the student.  The responses to the questions are hidden  in hypertext until selected by the student. ChemGuide also provides  hints and definitions upon selection and when necessary takes the  student to an appropriate section of the text for review or help.   Although the content of ChemGuide is adapted from an introductory  text co-authored by the principal investigator, the conceptual  content of the ChemGuide is similar to that of most texts.  ***y",
