 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314253  Hajek       The principal investigator (PI) will focus on performance  evaluation and design of communication networks of the future with  emphasis on large, high-speed networks, both optical and  electronic.  The main topics are 1) Spectral Response of Queues and  Diffusion Approximation, 2) Continuous Traffic in Packet Switches,  3) Multirate Circuit Switches, and 4) Optical Interconnections.       The approach will be to perform modeling, analysis, and  design.  Models will be based on current and anticipated future  technology and cover a broad spectrum of networks with  circuit-switched to datagram packet networks at the extremes.   Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact probabilistic methods  and simulation.  Design will be motivated by modeling and analysis  and aided by optimization tools of both combinatorial and linear  types.  Finally, inequalities from information theory, mathematical  physics, decision theory and combinatorics will be applied to yield  new performance bounds, providing a bridge between design and  performance evaluation.       Successful completion of the proposed research would provide  new network topologies and control strategies for high performance  networks, improved means to predict performance to support the  offering of guaranteed service, and techniques to extrapolate  accurately performance observed for small experimental networks to  large-scale networks.   ***",
