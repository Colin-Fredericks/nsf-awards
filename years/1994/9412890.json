 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412890 Lowrey   This workshop will address high-performance computing in participating media radiative heat transfer.  Experts form the fields of radiative heat transfer and high-performance computing will be brought together to discuss and identify opportunities for exploiting the advantages of high-performance computing for solving radiative heat transfer problems that are otherwise intractable.  The goal is to: (1) educate participants from the radiative heat transfer community about the opportunities of high-performance computing; (2) educate the participants from the  high-performance computing environment about the unique and demanding aspects of radiative heat transfer; and (3) provide a vehicle for the participants to explore interdisciplinary development in transport modeling, computational algorithms and hardware strategies that will enable a significant improvement in the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate complex radiative heat transfer.  There will be approximately 35 participants.  The workshop will be held at the Doubletree Hotel, Albuquerque, New Mexico, March 29-30, 1994.  The findings and recommendations regarding new research directions and funding needs will be documented in a workshop proceedings.  Copies will be widely distributed among all  major research entities, funding agencies, and targeted industries in the country.  A summary of the results will be presented at the 6th AIAA/ASME Thermophysics and Heat Transfer Conference and the 10th International Heat Transfer Conference.  The results will be placed on national electronic information networks.",
