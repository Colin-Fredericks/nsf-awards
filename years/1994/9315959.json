 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9315959  Carroll  DNA molecules injected into Xenopus oocytes are subject to very  efficient homologous recombination, providing that they are linear  and have appropriately placed homologous sequences.  This process  has been demonstrated in nuclear extracts from oocytes, and it is  known to depend on the action of a 5' - 3' exonuclease.  It is  proposed to purify this exonuclease from oocyte nuclei and to  characterize its properties, particularly with respect to  recombination.  Partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme  will be determined and antibodies that recognize the protein will  be raised.  cDNA clones representing the exonuclease mRNA will be  isolated and sequenced, allowing comparisons with nuclease  sequences from other organisms.  Expression of the exonuclease from  a cDNA clone will be engineered in bacteria (or in yeast) to allow  isolation of larger quantities of the enzyme for enzymatic and  immunological studies.  Anti-nuclease antibodies will be used to  determine where and when during development the enzyme is present.   Particular attention will be paid to stages of oogenesis and early  embryogenesis in which a role for the exonuclease in DNA metabolism  has been hypothesized.  Functions of the exonuclease will be  examined directly by using antibodies that block its activity.  The  consequences of injecting such antibodies into fertilized eggs will  be determined, with the expectation that defects in DNA replication  and chromosome integrity may be found.  Some effort will also be  expended in identifying other activities that are necessary for  recombination in oocytes.  They will be sought by fractionation of  nuclear extracts and assayed by reconstitution of recombination  activity.  Anticipated activities include DNA ligase, DNA  polymerase, and a catalyst of the annealing of complementary single  strands.  ***  Recombination events very like those demonstrated in Xenopus  oocytes have been documented in cells of other organisms, including  mammal ian cells. Thus, information of the oocyte exonuclease and  other recombination proteins which should result from this work  will have wide applicability, perhaps even in approaches to  targeted gene manipulation.  In any case, we will be more informed  as to the critical parameters of homologous recombination in  Xenopus oocytes.  %%%",
