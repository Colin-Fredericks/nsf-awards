Our work to date indicates  that the major effects of this reversible interconversion, which is  brought about by oxidation of spatially vicinal thiol residues in  the dehydrogenase to oxidase conversion, involve conformational  changes in the protein which affect mainly the flavin redox center.   However, there are indications from rapid reaction studies that the  molybdopterin redox center may also be affected by the  interconversion.  The major thrust of this proposal is to study in  detail the physicochemical properties of the two forms of the  enzyme, with the aim of defining the parameters that give the two  forms such different catalytic properties.  This study will involve  extensive use of rapid reaction spectrophotometry, EPR and EXAFS  measurements, flavin replacement studies, catalytic properties of  the enzymes with different classes of substrates, and examination  of the modes of binding of potent inhibitors of the enzymes.  %%%  The enzyme xanthine oxidase is commonly believed to be implicated  in the phenomenon known as oxidative stress, in which free radical  species of oxygen react with many essential components of living  tissues, including proteins, lipids and DNA.  Such oxidative damage  has been implicated in cancer, ischemia and the aging process.   Xanthine oxidase exists in two forms, the oxidase, which oxidizes  xanthine and a wide variety of purines and pyrimidines at the  expense of reducing oxygen to the superoxide radical (02-), and the  dehydrogenase, which oxidizes the same compounds, but uses NAD, a  coenzyme derivative of vitamin B3, instead of oxygen.  We have  isolated the enzyme from cow's milk, and shown that the two forms  can be interconverted in a reversible manner, depending on the  oxidation-reduction  state of the protein thiol residues.  The two  enzyme forms have many different properties, which are clearly due  to different protein conformations.  While the oxidase form has  been studied extensively in the past, comparatively little is known  of the dehydrogenase.  This study is to explore in detail the  differences in properties of the two forms, in order to provide a  firm scientific basis for concepts regarding their physiological  functions.  ***",
