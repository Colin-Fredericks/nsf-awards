 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regan  9316863  Amino acids have distinct conformational preferences that influence  the stabilities of protein secondary and tertiary structure.  The  degree to which different amino acids favor the formation of a  particular secondary structure is important in understanding the  relationship between protein sequence and structure.  In the case  of a-helices, a number of studies have determined a thermodynamic  scale of the helix-forming tendencies of the amino acids.  There is  reasonable agreement among these studies and between these  experimentally determined preferences and the statistically  observed preferences in proteins of known structure.  The study of  B-sheets, on the other hand, has not been similarly successful  because of aggregation and solubility problems with the model  systems used to date.  As a result, there has been only one  published attempt to generate an analogous scale for the B-sheet  forming tendencies of all the amino acids.  The experiments proposed here will avoid the difficulties of  aggregation that other groups have encountered by using a small,  soluble, naturally occurring protein composed mostly of B-sheet as  the model system.  The protein of choice for these studies is the  56 residue IgG-binding binding domain of Streptococcal protein G  (\"B1\").  This protein displays an ideal, reversible two-state  denaturation transition and its structure is known at high  resolution.  To quantify the B-sheet forming tendency of the amino acids, each  of the amino acids will be substituted into an idealized \"guest\"  position in this protein.  Thermal and chemical denaturation  measurements will be made to determine the free energy difference  between each variant and a standard B1 with Gly at the guest  position and it is this difference that is considered to be a  measure of the guest's capacity for the B-sheet formation.  These  experiments will provide both workable system for analyzing the  factors involved in B-sheet stability and a comprehensive  quantitative sc ale of the B-sheet forming ability of the amino  acids.  %%%  Proteins are large molecules that perform many important functions  within a living cell. They are formed from 20 different types of  building blocks, called amino acids, the linear sequences of which  dictates the shape of the protein and what its function will be.   The amino acids are not strung together randomly, but rather they  first form sub-assemblies, known as secondary structures, that then  associate to give the folded protein.  There are two types of  secondary structure:  alpha-helices and beta-sheets.  This proposal  aims to determine a quantitative scale for how likely it is for  each amino acid to be found in beta-sheet secondary structure.   This knowledge is of key importance to the understanding of protein  structure and the rational modification and design of potentially  useful, new proteins.  ***",
