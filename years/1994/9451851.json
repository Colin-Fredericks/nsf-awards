Facilities for training undergraduates in these areas are limited,  both at Stony Brook and elsewhere. Training requires collaboration  between computer scientists and psychologists, as well as  specialized computer systems that support images, sound, video, and  advanced I/O devices. The Departments of Computer Science and  Psychology at Stony Brook have recently been awarded an NSF  Educational Infrastructure grant to develop an innovative,  interdisciplinary curriculum in the design and implementation  aspects of computer-human interaction and multimedia.  The  curriculum consists of nine courses: User Interface Development,  Human Information Processing, Computer Graphics, Computer-Supported  Cooperative Work, Visualization, Multimedia, Human Factors in  Interface Design, and two Senior Design courses.  We are creating an undergraduate multimedia user-interface lab, the  MULTI-Lab, which enables the implementation of the curriculum with  over 150 undergraduates every semester.  The MULTI-Lab is paramount  to the success of our curriculum.  Every participating student has  hands-on experience in the design, prototyping, and evaluation of  a variety of user interfaces and multimedia systems.  The MULTI-Lab  is a data-, audio-, and video-networked heterogeneous laboratory of  multimedia Macintoshes, with a few PCs and Sun Unix workstations,  along with a selection of I/O devices and multi-media peripherals.   The instructional material for the curriculum is multimedia  courseware and software that will be disseminated widely as a set  of CD-ROMs and monographs in a series called \"Stony Brook  Curriculum in Computer-Human Interaction.\"",
