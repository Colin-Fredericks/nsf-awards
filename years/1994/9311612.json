West, Liquid Crystal Institute, Kent State University, Ohio, and Dr. Shunsuke Kobayashi, Faculty of Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Tokyo.  During a four month visit, Professor West will conduct research on surface anchoring and alignment in polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC).  Measurements will be taken of the azimuthal anchoring energy as a function of temperature of the eutectic liquid crystal mixture E7 at a polyvinylformal surface.  The results will be correlated with previous experimental results which show that the electro optic response of a PDLC changes abruptly at the glass transition temperature of the polymer binder.  The experimental technique will then be expanded to other polymer and liquid crystal combinations.  Establishment of a positive correlation between the polymer glass transition and azimuthal anchoring energy will lead to a wide variety of additional research, such as determining if anchoring energy is the cause of observed electro optic variations in PDLC materials composed of different polymer binders.  Understanding of the mechanism and role of surface anchoring in the electro optics of PDLC materials will allow materials to be optimized for a variety of applications such as high definition projection and flat panel displays.  Professor Kobayashi is at the forefront of liquid cr ystal research, with expertise in the alignment and anchoring of liquid crystals at a solid interface.  This specialization coupled with Professor West's significant research in PDLC and related composites should provide an excellent collaboration that will continue after the completion of this phase of the research.  This project is supported by the NSF CGP (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program.",
