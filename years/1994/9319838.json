The existing knowledge base, particularly for seismic performance of a large class of mixed constructions needs to be expanded before comprehensive design provisions can be established to advance engineering practice.  Concrete walls or cores have been frequently coupled by steel beams, and steel perimeter frames are commonly attached to central concrete cores through outrigger beams.  A major concern is the transfer of forces from steel coupling beams or outrigger beams into the walls or cores, particularly beyond the serviceability limit state.  An experimental and analytical study of the fundamental seismic performance of concrete walls coupled through steel or composite beams is undertaken.  The experimental phase of the research includes testing of six isolated connections representing half scale subassemblies.  The specimens comprise a portion of a reinforced concrete wall and stub steel beams (either encased or unencased) simulating one half of a coupling beam.  The parameters that will be investigated include:  (a) effects of construction joints above and below coupling beams; (b) boundary element transverse reinforcement in the connection region; (c) addition of face bearing plates to the coupling beam as an effort to mobilize      h)          0*0*0*         compression struts in the connection region; (d) philosophies for sizing steel coupling beams, i.e. design as link beams in eccentrically braced frames or as \"regular flexural\" members such that web yielding will be prevented prior to development of plastic moment capacity; (e) performance of encased versus unencased steel coupling beams; and (f) requirements for preventing premature flange and web buckling.  The pr oject will provide basic input for developing appropriate design model and  seismic guidelines for such coupled structural systems.",
