 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354160  Ross    Cayey University College will design methods to further develop  itself as a Model Institution for Excellence (MIE) in  undergraduate Science and Mathematics.    The MIE program will contribute to significantly increasing the  number and quality of Puerto Rican students entering and  progressing through the educational pipeline, and pursuing  graduate degrees in the Natural Science, Computer Sciences,  Engineering and Mathematics (SEM). This comprehensive long term  program is possible at Cayey because of an existing commitment to  this objective.    Cayey intends to sustain the success of the MIE program in the  Natural Sciences and Mathematics faculty and curricula with a  balanced teaching and research practice. The balance will be  insured and enhanced by the creation of a support structure with  three components: Student, Research and Academic development.    The Student Development Component will deal directly with  students at pre-college, college and college-to-graduate levels.  Specific activities will be developed for recruitment of high  school students, enrichment and support of undergraduates, as  well as information and support for college-to-graduate students.  Also, activities will be provided for the development of  scientific literacy to potential students, their families and  members of the community.    The purpose of the Research Development component is to  strengthen the overall Science and Mathematics research  capabilities. It will administer research grants and handle  specific research related activities in coordination with the  Academic component.    The Academic Component proposes to complement the learning  experience with undergraduate research, creating a climate of  excitement with the learning process which comes from discovery.  Such an experience is conceived to promote students to move on to  graduate SEM programs. As a whole, the component will strengthen  the undergraduate programs through the following activities;  revision of curricula a nd programs to integrate undergraduate  research as a unifying structure, co-curricular activities with  visiting specialists and speakers, renovation of teaching  methodology, recruitment of new faculty, and acquisition of  modern equipment and instrumentation.",
