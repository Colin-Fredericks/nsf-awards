This conference is a joint celebration between the Royal  Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the American Chemical Society (ACS).  In 1974 the 200th anniversary of Joseph Priestley's discovery of  oxygen was observed.  Since that time conferences have been held  every three years;  The first in 1977 in Leed, UK (Heterogeneous  Oxidation): the second in 1980 in Birmingham, UK (Oxygen and Life);  the third in 1983 in London (Oxygen and the Conversion of Future  Feedstocks); the fourth in 1986 in Leeds (Membranes in Gas  Separation and Enrichment); the fifth in 1989 in Birmingham  (Separation of Gases); and the sixth in 1992 in Paris, France (Role  of Oxygen in Improving Chemical Processes).       The basic theme of the 1994 conference will be \"Oxidants and  Oxidation in the Earth's Atmosphere\" with a keynote lecture on the  history of ozone.  Topics crucial to the atmospheric chemistry of  global change and local and regional air pollution will be  addressed.  Recent progress in these areas has been rapid.  As  detailed in Section 2, the Organizing Committee has assembled a  distinguished group of U.S. and international atmospheric chemists  who will address the issues domination current research and policy  agendas.  The ACS and RSC feel it is important to communicate this  progress and to identify remaining scientific and societal  questions in a forum accessible to academic, industrial, and  government scientists, engineers, and policy-makers.  This grant  will support the participation of graduate and post-doctoral  students in the conference.",
