 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400522  Lee  This four-day workshop on mobile subsea robots will be concerned  primarily with complete working systems or subsystems and will  emphasize experimental results.  Participation will be by  invitation only on the basis of extended abstracts or complete  papers.  Participant will be selected by an international Program  Committee composed of leading experts in the field.  A maximum of  twenty-five papers will be selected for presentation and  inclusion in the workshop proceedings.  An IARP forum meeting  will be held preceding the workshop.    Topics to be addressed in the workshop include: 1) system  architecture, 2) modeling, simulation, and display of operational  environments, 3) task and mission planning and execution, 4)  teleoperation and communication, 5) sensing and control, and 6)  actuators, propulsion, and structures.    In the context of this workshop, the term robot will be taken to  mean unmanned computer-controlled vehicles operated under human  supervision as well as completely autonomous systems.  The term  mobile refers to a system able to move from a base to a work site  using its own propulsion system.  With this definition, the topic  of this conference excludes fixed-base manipulators or sensory  packages and also excludes simple manually-controlled remotely  operated vehicles.",
