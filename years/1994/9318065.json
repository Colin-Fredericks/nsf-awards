 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318065  Dickson    In addition to being the focus of important commercial  fisheries throughout the world, tunas are of particular  interest to biologists because they are the only bony fishes  known to maintain muscle temperatures(Tm) elevated  significantly above the temperature of their environment by  using metabolically derived heat; i.e., they are  endothermic. To do so, tunas need a source of heat (provided  by contraction of red muscle during continuous swimming) and  a mechanism to retain the heat within the muscle during  activity (blood vessels arranged as counter-current heat  exchangers). The goal of this research project is to test  the hypothesis that maintenance of high muscle temperatures  in tunas results in increased swimming performance. A  computerized, temperature-controlled, variable speed,  swimming-tunnel respirometer system will be used to measure  the maximal sustainable/aerobic swimming speed versus fish  size and the cost of swimming versus fish size relationships  for juvenile black skipjack tunas ranging in fork length  (FL) from ~100mm to ~250mm.  These sizes are above and below  the minimum size for endothermy of 207 mm FL postulated in a  recent publication by the Principal Investigator.   Comparisons will be made with a similar size range of  closely related fishes that cannot elevate Tm significantly  at any size to \"control\" for the effects of fish size. Also,  if swimming mode changes with fish size, the maximal speed  and/or cost of swimming may change independent of Tm.  Therefore, swimming mode, as well as tail beat frequencies  and amplitudes, will be determined from high-speed videotape  recordings of each fish swimming at speeds up to its  maximum, using a computerized video motion analysis system.  In addition, Tm in a size range of juvenile black skipjack  tuna will be measured as they swim in laboratory aquaria and  in the respirometer: these data, combined with microscopic  examination of heat exchanger blood vessel morphology and  red muscle amou nt in the same fish, will allows the PI to  test the hypothesis that the minimum size for endothermy in  black skip jacks is 207 mm FL.  These studies will  contribute a great deal to our understanding of the  evolution of endothermy and the advantages it confers. The  results will have implications for the ecology, energetics,  and both short- and long-range movements of tunas. In  addition, estimates of the cost of swimming obtained in the  proposal study can be used in models of tuna energetics and  population dynamics that are used to regulate the fishery  aspects of these species.  ***",
