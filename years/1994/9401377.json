 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401377  Craig       This award support mathematical research in three areas  which related the theory of partial differential equations and  mathematical physics.  The focus is principally on conservative  evolution equations.  Examples include nonlinear wave equations,  Schrodinger equations, the Korteweg deVries equation and versions  of the Boussinesq system.  These problems can all be written as  Hamiltonian systems, with infinitely many degrees of freedom.   The analogy with dynamical systems can be pursued with the goal  of describing the important features of solutions and  the principal structures of the phase space in which they are  posed.  The projects include the continuation of development of  the theory of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser to systems with  infinitely many degrees of freedom, in particular, to the above  nonlinear equations.  The intent of this work is to understand  the stable motions of nonlinear wave equations, either in  neighborhoods of equilibrium points, or for perturbations of  completely integrable systems.  A second project concerns the  evolution of singularities of solutions of the Schrodinger  equation, in both linear and nonlinear cases.  This requires  microlocal analysis techniques in a novel setting in which there  is an interdependence of properties in the spatial and Fourier  domains.        The final project involves work on the free surface problem  of water wave, which is important in mathematical fluid dynamics  as well as partial differential equations.  Work will address  steady free surface problems and nonstationary problems, in both  two and three dimensional settings.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematicalmodeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops me thods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
