 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451774  Brown  Current learning theory indicates that effective student learning  in the physical sciences can be greatly enhanced through the  creation of a learning environment that enables students to focus  on physical phenomena that are directly linked to useful  abstractions, to make predictions based on their conceptual models  which receive immediate interactive feedback, and to collaborate  with other students in making such predictions and discussing  unexpected results. The aim of the proposed project is to create  such a learning environment for physics laboratory instruction  through the use of a number of technological tools. Specifically,  the project will combine image processing and video capture  technologies to create motion and optics lab experiments which  enable students to link visual and graphical representations of  conceptual models with real-world phenomena. Students will view and  interact with live video images which are processed in real time to  enhance or measure important features. Students will also overlay  captured video images and clips with student-drawn interpretations  and predictions, image measurement tools, and graphics generated by  model simulations. This innovative project has numerous benefits  for students and the results will be widely disseminated to  community college and university physics and science instructors.",
