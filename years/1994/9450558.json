 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450558  Walker    The Marine and Aquatic Mini-Camp For Female Secondary Students is  a series of several-day, field-based, inquiry-focused, hands-on  educational experiences designed to modify an existing,  successful program at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory to meet  the specific needs of a population of secondary,  at-risk-for-science female students.  The Principal Investigators  believe that the proposed effort will contribute to a realistic  change in the academic and professional ambitions of participating  students, thus enhancing their scientific literacy and career  aspirations. A more specific goal is for the participants to  continue their formal science education through  enrollment or re-enrollment in high school science courses.      The residential programs will be composed of four major conceptual  sections:  oceanography and hydrologic processes; marine and  aquatic biology-fauna; marine and aquatic biology-flora;  and, beach and barrier islands.  The effort will build upon an  established relationship with local schools to ensure selection of  students who could most benefit, as well who could be tracked  over time.  Selected students from the same school would attend at  the same time.  Schools are in northwest Florida, Alabama,  Mississippi, and Louisiana.  ***",
