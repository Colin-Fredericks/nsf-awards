 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gattis    The University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, College of Engineering, offers programs in seven  engineering disciplines, the only institution in the State of Arkansas that offers a Ph.D.  program in engineering.  The College of Engineering occupies three buildings on the main  campus and one research complex, the Engineering Research Center (ERC).  All engineering  research, in the areas of Biological and Agricultural, Chemical, Computer Systems, Civil,  Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical engineering, are housed and conducted in the ERC.   Rapid growth of research programs, coupled with deteriorating conditions of the ERC  building, have placed the College in dire need for modernized research space.  Renovated  space is needed immediately for new research programs and for several federally funded  Centers, including the Material Handling Research Center.  Presently, the ERC consists of  three buildings that have adequate space, but lack the infrastructure to allow for the optimum  use of the space.     Required renovations will entail modernizing electrical and HVAC systems and roofing.  The  renovation of the electrical power distribution system will involve the complete replacement  and conversion of the power feed.  A new closed-loop water source heat-pump system will  replace the inefficient  HVAC units, boiler and chiller systems.  The roof renovation will  involve the removal of old roofing materials and replacing it with new insulating materials.   This renovation project will facilitate faculty and student research to remain competitive by  providing functional research space.  Moreover, it will enhance the College's recruitment and  retention of talented faculty and quality students, including women, persons with disabilities,  and minorities from Arkansas and adjacent states.",
