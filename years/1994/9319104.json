 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319104  Williamson, Patrick  Schlegel, Robert  Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a developmental process  whose result is the death and engulfment of cells without the  pathological consequences which attend cell death due to injury  (necrosis).  The presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell  surface has been implicated as one of the signals for recognition  and phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphocytes.  The exposure of PS  requires alteration of the normal distribution of plasma membrane  phospholipids, and thus regulation of the processes which control  this distribution must be part of the program of apoptotic cell  death.  Studies of erythrocytes have demonstrated the existence of  two distinct pathways governing transbilayer lipid distribution.    The first is an ATP-dependent transport of the aminophospholipids,  and particularly PS, to the inner leaflet; the second is an energy  independent randomization of all phospholipids between the two  leaflets, a process which brings PS to the cell surface.  In this  project, flow cytometric techniques will be used in combination  with specific fluorescent phospholipid probes to analyze  transbilayer lipid movements in apoptotic cells.  The normal, ATP-  dependent, NEM-sensitive movement of PS to the inside of  lymphocytes will be characterized in cells before and after  induction of apoptosis, to determine whether and when this pathway  is inactivated.  NEM-insensitive movement of phosphatidylcholine  (PC) from the outer to the inner leaflet (a marker for the second  pathway) will be characterized before and after induction of  apoptosis to determine whether and when lipid randomization occurs  during apoptosis.  The generality of these events will be tested by  comparing the results in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by  steroid hormone treatment and by inactivation-induced suicide, and  by extension of the results from tissue culture cells to thymocytes  in the mouse.  The role of elevation of cytoplasmic calcium as a  regulatory me diator of alterations in transbilayer lipid movements  will be assessed, and the role of several specific calcium-related  signalling pathways in this regulation will be investigated.  %%%  Fatty, organic molecules called lipids form the basis of the  structure of the membrane that separates a cell interior from its  external environment.  Despite their importance, however, little is  known about the mechanisms by which lipids are organized in  membranes and play their roles in cell membrane structure and  function.  Recent evidence indicates that one of the molecular  species of phospholipid in the cell membrane (phosphatidylserine or  \"PS\") serves as a signal for recognition and removal of cells  undergoing programmed cell death.  Programmed cell death is an  orderly process activated during tissue remodeling in development,  allowing replacement of one cell type by another, or, in the adult  organism, to remove cells with a limited life span.  Removal of  dying cells by specialized scavenger cells prior to their  disintegration is important to this orderly process. The goal of  this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms which  regulate the exposure of PS on the surfaces of cells at the time  they begin programmed cell death so that they are targeted for  removal.***",
