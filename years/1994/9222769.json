 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is becoming increasingly evident that reactions of gases at  solid interfaces play a key role in atmospheric chemistry.   However, at the present time, our understanding of the fundamental  kinetics and mechanisms of such reactions at interfaces in the  atmosphere is rudimentary, at best.  However, such data are  essential to elucidate the role of these processes in the chemistry  of both the stratosphere and troposphere.       This research will explore the fundamental kinetics and  dynamics of the reactions of solid NaCl, the major component of sea  salt particles found in marine areas, with gases such as HNO3 and  N2O5 using surface science techniques including X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy, high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and  laser-induced desorption mass spectrometry.  These reactions are  believed to contribute to the formation of HCl and ClNO2  respectively.  The latter is of particular importance since its  photolysis produces chlorine atoms which may compete with OH in  initiating the oxidation of organics in the troposphere.  These  studies will result in a much better understanding of the  fundamental parameters controlling these gas-solid processes, which  can than be input to models to provide a more realistic and  accurate assessment of the role played by such reactions in the  atmosphere.  In addition, it will establish the utility of modern  surface science methodology in elucidating the fundamentals of  reactions occurring at interfaces in the atmosphere.",
