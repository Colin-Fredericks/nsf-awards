This model  that is specifically designed to make science instruction  accessible to language minority students, will be implemented in  four urban school districts, two in California and two in Texas.  In years 1 and 2, leadership teams from eight California schools  and six Texas schools will attend summer institutes that  introduce teachers to marine science education integrated with  mathematics and other areas of science.  The teachers will also  have assistance as they plan for the improvement of the total  science program of their buildings.  During the school year, the  lead teachers will assist the MARE staff in conducting whole-  faculty inservice sessions to share the program and the teaching  strategies with their colleagues.  They will also lead faculty  planning sessions for the whole-school Ocean Week immersion event  that is the high point of the year-long marine science program at  each site.  During Year 3, the district leadership teams will  adopt eight new schools in California and six new schools in  Texas.    The cost sharing will be 35% of the NSF award.  ***",
