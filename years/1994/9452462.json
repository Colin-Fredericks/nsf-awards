 "awd_abstract_narration": "An enhancement of an advanced laboratory course in modern physics  for physics majors is proposed.  The specific goal is to offer new  experiments closely related to present-day research and  applications in the areas of atomic physics and condensed matter,  in response to a projected increase of students with interests in  applied and engineering physics.  The project introduces to the  laboratory two new experiments: one using a solid state diode laser  to do optical pumping and spectroscopy of atoms in an atomic beam  and a second experiment involving measurements on a high Tc  superconductor.  The laser spectroscopy is combined with a  Stern-Gerlach experiment to yield a rich variety of atomic physics  effects which would be accessible to the undergraduate student.  In  addition to the Stern-Gerlach effect, the experiment allows  demonstrations of: Doppler-free optical spectroscopy, hyperfine  structure, optical pumping, radio frequency resonance, and Zeeman  effect.  The experiment on a high Tc superconductor involves   measurements of the persistent current.",
