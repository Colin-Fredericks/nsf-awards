 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Alabama Cryogenic Engineering, Inc., 9362074      Partial oxidation reactions are very important routes to chemical synthesis.  A large fraction of all catalytic processes are oxidation reactions, and there is a need to reduce waste byproducts and to improve yield in the synthesis of a wide variety of specialty chemicals.  Oxidation reactions are very difficult and dangerous to manage.  Their exothermicity, speed, flammability and explosive potentials mandate extreme care in the design of reactors.  Consequently, current reactors for oxidation are designed very conservatively and far from yield optima.  Recent research has led to the development of new ceramic monoliths (solid metal plates perforated with small, uniform holes) for use in partial oxidation processes to catalyze very fast, high selectivity synthesis reactions such as the direct production of syngas from methane, olefins from higher alkanes, and formaldehyde from methanol.    This SBIR Phase I research project will test such metal monoliths as a new catalyst for carrying out these reactions.  Metal monoliths have high thermal conductivity, so that the heat of reaction can be removed and the reaction temperature regulated.  This will allow higher selectivities and greater yields than are possible with currently available ceramic monolith catalysts.  A new fabrication technique will be used that allows thin layers of noble metals to be incorporated into the holes of the monolith so that the reaction rate can be further enhanced.  Monoliths can be fabricated with hole diameters less than one micron and porosity's as high as 65%.  The monoliths can be mounted in large arrays and thus be scaled up for commercial chemical production.",
