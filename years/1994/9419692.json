Veziroglu and Dr. Nelson Nemerow, of the  U. of Miami, and a team from the Indian  National Environmental Engineering Research  Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur, India, headed by  Dr. P. Khanna.  The objective of the research  is to determine the feasibility of locating,  building and operating a two-industry complex,  consisting of a phosphate fertilizer and a  cement plant, within an environmentally  balanced industrial complex at one site.  An  analytical model will be developed from data  obtained to produce an optimum mass balance for  the fertilizer-cement plants complex during the  first phase of the project, and laboratory  bench prototypes will be built to test the  modeling results during the second phase.  The  focus will be on relating the various  parameters to a cost-effective, waste-reducing,  and environmentally satisfactory model for the  production of these two materials.    Scope:  This project deals with an idea that is  simple and also attractive, but which has not  been implemented yet.  The reason is the  existence of unknown variables and their impact  on the viability and efficiency of the  procedure.  In this research, involving experts  from the U.S. with industrial concerns and  environmental engineering specialists from  India, it is expected that these variables and  their impacts will be defined. This information  should lead to the selection of optimum  conditions for implementation.  The project  will benefit from the complementary resources  in the U.S. and India, and the benefits are  likely to accrue to the two countries.  ***",
