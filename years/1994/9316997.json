We will employ the two-hybrid  system as a sensitive and systematic molecular genetic screening  strategy in yeast which exploits selection for amino acid  prototrophy as a result of bait-library interaction and permits the  screening of the full complexity of large mammalian expression  libraries.  In Preliminary studies we have demonstrated that the  two-hybrid system can detect the interaction between the insulin  receptor and its known substrate IRS-1 as well as two novel IRS-1-  interaction proteins in vivo which also associate with IRS-1 in  vitro.  Based on these results we will systematically identify and  isolate the coding sequences of all proteins that directly interact  with the insulin receptor and that are detectable with this  sensitive strategy.  In particular, we will prepare various fusion  plasmids with catalytic insulin receptor domains as baits and  screen two mammalian cDNA expression libraries for interacting  expression products.  Positive clones will be isolated, purified  and confirmed by genetic tests, and cDNA inserts encoding  interacting proteins will be sequenced and compared with protein  sequence databases for motifs which may suggest potential  functions.  cDNAs lacking sequence homology to known proteins will  be used as probes to identify and isolate complete protein coding  sequences.  Novel interacting proteins and known proteins  identified with this strategy will be tested for their role in  insulin signaling by biochemical analysis including cDNA  expression, co-purification, in vitro binding, co-  immunoprecipitation, cross-phosphorylation assays, and by other  approaches, which will be specifically designed for the candidate  proteins once they have been identified.  The knowledge gained is  expected to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved  in  insulin signaling and peptide hormone action in general.  ***  One of the most thoroughly studied models of peptide hormone action  is insulin with its receptor, both of which are key elements in  signaling pathways in virtually any mammalian cell.  Despite great  progress in the elucidation of the structure and function of the  insulin receptor, many of the detailed mechanisms, the sequence of  events and the components involved in the transmission of the  insulin signal from the cell surface to the nucleus remain unclear.   While a number of direct insulin receptor substrates are suggested  by the complex cellular responses to insulin only one, IRS-1 has  been characterized in detail at the molecular level.  Part of the  reason has been the lack of systematic and efficient strategies to  identify other unknown direct insulin receptor targets by molecular  cloning techniques.  Using a new, simple and systematic molecular  genetic strategy, the two-hybrid system, we have demonstrated that  protein interactions involving the insulin receptor and its  substrate IRS-1 can be detected and that IRS-1 interacting target  protein sequences can be identified and isolated.  With this  approach we will screen mammalian cDNA libraries for all cellular  targets of the insulin receptor that are detectable.  The screen is  expected to identify and isolate sequences of known proteins with  a previously unknown role in insulin action as well as novel  cellular targets of the insulin receptor.  Once they are identified  these components will be characterized by biochemical analysis for  their role in the insulin signaling pathway.  This strategy is  expected to identify the elements in the insulin signaling pathway  stepwise to the final destination in the cell nucleus.  The  elucidation of these steps should critically contribute to our  understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in peptide  hormone action.  %%%",
