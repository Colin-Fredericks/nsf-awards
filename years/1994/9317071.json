The enzyme complex is the terminal member of the electron  transport chain responsible for transferring electrons from  cytochrome c to oxygen.  Subunit II binds to cytochrome c and  accepts electrons via the CuA redox center. The protein has  several highly conserved features including two hydrophobic  regions, a conserved aromatic region, a number of negatively  charged amino acids thought to interact with lysines on  cytochrome c and a copper binding site like those found in blue  copper proteins.  To understand the function of this protein,  yeast mutants defective in subunit II have been generated.  We  have identified strains defective in function due to alterations  in the CuA binding region and due to codon substitutions in the  aromatic region.  We are finishing our analysis of the mutants  and to extend our investigation to revertants of these strains  that have recovered function.  We expect to find true revertants  that restore that wild type sequence; pseudo revertants where one  amino acid is substituted for another and strains carrying extra-  genic suppressors.  Among the latter group, we expect to identify  gene products, both nuclear and mitochondrial, that interact  directly with subunit II.  This analysis will yield information  concerning functionally critical amino acids in the protein and  possibly about interactions between oxidase subunits.  %%%   This is a continuation of the genetic studies on the yeast  protein, subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase.  This protein is a  highly conserved protein required for respiration in all higher  organisms.  This research has the potential to broaden our  understanding of respiration.  In addition, the project is  providing college undergraduates with the opportunity to  understand the process of scientific research and to participate  in it.  ***",
