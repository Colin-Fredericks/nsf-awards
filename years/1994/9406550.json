 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9406550  Much of chloroplast gene regulation occurs at the post-  transcriptional level.  The aim of this project is to undertake a  systematic study of chloroplast translation initiation using  genetic and biochemical approaches.  We will focus on the pet  genes, whose products form the cytochrome b6/f complex, which  transports electrons between photosystem II and photosystem I.   Mutations predicted to interfere with translation initiation will  be introduced into pet genes and second-site suppressors of these  mutations will be analyzed.  In a parallel approach, efforts will  be made  to generate null mutations in nuclear translational  activator genes by insertional inactivation.  Non-photosyntheic  transformants will be generated and screened for defects in  chloroplast protein accumulation and translation.  The inserted DNA  tags the gene, which facilitates cloning the mutated gene and  subsequently the wild-type version.  In addition to these genetic  approaches, in vitro biochemical methods will be used to identify  and characterize proteins that interact with the 5' UTR.  Protein  extracts from suppressor and insertion mutants will be assayed for  any differences in protein binding factors.  The results of the  project will lead to a greater understanding of the cis-acting  sequences controlling translation, and the proteins that interact  with these sequences.  %%%  Although chloroplasts contain their own genetic apparatus, most of  the regulatory signals are transmitted to the chloroplast by the  action of nuclear gene products.  The isolation and analysis of  mutants in both higher plants and algae that are defective in this  signaling process have revealed that in most cases, chloroplast  gene regulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level.  Examples  of such mutations include those that affect messenger RNA lifetimes  or RNA maturation, protein synthesis or stability, and the assembly  of macromolecular complexes.  The first of two general approaches  in this projec t is to introduce mutations that interfere with  protein synthesis into chloroplast genes and then to identify  compensating suppressor mutations in nuclear genes.  At the same  time, biochemical methods will be used to detect the protein  factors directly.  In a second general approach, efforts will be  made to generate mutations that disrupt the functions of nuclear  translational activator genes, by introducing transforming DNA into  the nucleus.  Once such mutants have been identified, the \"tagged\"  gene can be isolated.  The results of the proposed research will  lead to a greater understanding of the sequences that control  translation of chloroplast RNAs, and of the proteins that interact  with these sequences.  ***",
