The Archive  was established in 1977-81 using keypunches for data entry and encoded  in a character set that provided only upper case roman numerals and some  mathematical symbols. All the special characters in the original  documents are coded with 2 and 3 character sequences. We will modernize  the data base by (1) converting the complex character coding to a more  standard scheme such as Unicode; (2) re-coding the numeric field labels  as mnemonic abbreviations; (3) fully standardizing field structure and  characters from document to document; (4) organizing document storage  logically; and (5) to the extent that copyright permits, making the  whole data base available on line, together with some kind of  concordance(s) or concordance programs. If time permits, we will also  fill in gaps in some of the documents. Work will be done by John E.  Koontz, Research Associate at the Center for the Study of the Native  Languages of the Plains and Southwest, and supervised by Prof. David S.  Rood, who originally developed the Archive.  ***",
