OS&E is emerging as a key enabling element for a host of  applications that address critical national needs such as  manufacturing, information technology, health care,  transportation, environment, and education.  It is also a vital  area of frontier scientific research.  The purpose of the study is to define the field of optical  science and engineering, assess the state of the art in research  and technology, project the future impact of OS&E on national  needs, identify institutional and educational innovations needed  to optimize the contributions of OS&E to national needs, identify  how public policy influences the ability of the field to meet  these needs, and examine trends in private and public research  activities as compared to those in other countries.  The study is being supported jointly by NSF, NIST, and ARPA.  The  Foundation of the report will be based on the conduct of 5 major  workshops; each workshop would be organized according  to  national needs and would address issues that cross OS&E  scientific and technical disciplinary boundaries.        ***",
