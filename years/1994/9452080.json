The project integrates disciplines which are well  established in the Manufacturing Engineering department. This  project is being used for integration and modification of  curriculum in a variety of existing courses, and for development of  a new undergraduate course which demonstrates the fundamentals of  CIM by hands-on lab projects. The system uses three CNC machine  tools for machining a variety of products, and provides automatic  assembly of the product and inspection. With an automatic storage  and retrieval station and four robots, the entire manufacturing  process may be run fully automatically. Product design and process  planning is fully computerized and virtually-paperless. Creation  and use of databases is also an integral part of the project.",
