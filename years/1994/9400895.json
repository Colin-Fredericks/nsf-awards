It is a study of  organizational  change   and  differentiation.   Detailed  information  will   be  collected on every known organization that has arisen in the  gay  and  lesbian  community of San Francisco between 1950  and  1993,  with  the  total  number  of organizations  studied  expected  to  approach  2000.   The changing ways in which these  organizations  have  expressed their identities over this period will be studied  qualitatively.  In addition, quantitative tests will  be  carried  out on predictions drawn from competing theories of organization,  particularly   ones   concerning  trends  toward   organizational  homogenization versus diversification over time.        This  project  will contribute to several different  fields  within  sociology.  Through its focus on organizational  identity  formation,  this research will enlighten prevailing  work  within  cultural  sociology  and  the study of social  movements,  fields  which  deal  with  the processes by which low status  or  deviant  groups struggle to gain acceptance and power.  It will also speak  to  important  issues  in  organizational  sociology,  since  the  increasing  diversity  of  organizations  over  time  appears  to  contradict    prevailing   expectations   that   trends    toward  organizational  homogenization should dominate.  In  addition  to  the  scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this  award  will  materially assist a highly promising student in  completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.  ***",
