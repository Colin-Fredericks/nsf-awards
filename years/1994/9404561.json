 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404561  Brandon        The principal investigator plans to study creation and propagation of  oscillations on a model for the evolution of phase transitions (with a  viscoelastic damping term), by considering solutions generated by a convergent  sequence of initial data. Fonseca, Lin, Rogers and the PI intend to prove the  convergence of a numerical scheme for solving a nonlocal variational problem  modelling one-dimensional mechanical phase transitions. Ma and the PI plan to  clarify (numerically first) the full picture for a nonlocal model for  ferromagnetic materials with (nonlocal) exchange energies that yield  hysteresis. The PI and Rogers are currently examining the stationary points of  the James/Kinderlehrer Terfanol model using a symbolic manipulator.        The goal of this work is to aid in the technical knowhow for shape  memory alloys. The aim of the first project is to help in the attempts to  model the evolution of phase transitions in these materials. There are a lot  of problems in obtaining numerical data for phase transitions, the hope in the  second project is to help in solving some of those problems.(The data already  obtained is very promising.) The work with Ma is intended to aid in  constructing models that can predict the behaviour of ferromagnetic materials.  Finally, Rogers and the PI hope to gain further insight into the  aforementioned model for Terfanol and for magnetostrictive materials in  general.",
