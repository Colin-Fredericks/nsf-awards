 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rich  9409122  This NSF Research Initiation Award is aimed at enhancing the  understanding of fundamental processes in the carrier dynamics of  modulation doped quantum III-V heterostructures.  In spatial light  modulators (SLMs), strong photo-optic and electro-optic effects  which lead to nonlinearities in the optical absorption and  refractive index are required to obtain sufficient control of the  intensity, phase, or polarization of optical signals.  In the  proposed work, Professor Dan Rich of USC will study fundamental  problems associated with the phenomena of excitation-induced  absorption modulation in nipi-doped strained III-V multiple quantum  wells (MQWs).  The spatially separated electron-hole plasma that  can be generated in periodically doped nipi MQW structures exhibits  unique electronic and optical properties which can be utilized to  fabricated low-power and high-contrast SLMs.  Because of large  enhancements in the excess carrier lifetime and in-plane ambipolar  diffusion constant, large excess carrier concentrations can be  created by relatively weak optical excitation to alter the MQW  exciton absorption.  The PI proposes to study the carrier  recombination dynamics of the electron-hole plasma in nipi-doped  III-V MQW samples using a novel approach called electron beam-  induced absorption modulation imaging (EBIA).  In this proposal we  will show that EBIA will yield unprecedented um-scale spatial  imaging information on the in-plane diffusion processes and  recombination lifetimes which govern the performance of optically  addressed and electron beam-addressed SLMs.  The effects of  extrinsic defect- and impurity-related processes associated with  dopant interdiffusion and strain-induced misfit formation which can  affect the spatial distribution of luminescence and differential  absorption in periodic nipi-doped InGaAs/GaAs MQWs will be  examined.  It is anticipated that a variety of \"smart pixel\" and  Fourier-plane processing photonic technologies will benefit from  the  proposed work.  ***",
