 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408155  Fonstad  Recent NSF-funded research at MIT has shown that InGaA1As quantum-  well, tunnel-barrier heterostructures can be produced with  intersubband energy level separations (n = 1 to n = 2) as large as  0.8 eV (1.55 um) and with TE-, as well as TM-, optical activity.   The proposed research project builds on these results, and will  focus (1) on developing structures with even larger level  separations; (2) on using femto-second pulse-probe techniques to  measure upper state lifetimes in quantum wells; (3) on studying the  optical properties (index of refraction and absorption coefficient)  in the vicinity of the intersubband absorption peaks, and on  studying bias- and population-induced changes in these properties;  and (4) on incorporating quantum-well, tunnel-barrier  heterostructures in waveguide geometry optoelectronic devices  (modulators, switches, and detectors).  The excited state lifetimes  in quantum wells are inherently very short (and can be shortened  further using their tunnel barriers) so it is anticipated that this  research will lead to the realization of faster, lower power  devices than are presently available in the 1.5 um spectral range.   It is also anticipated that these devices will show superior  temperature stability because they are based on intersubband,  rather than band-to-band processes.  ***",
