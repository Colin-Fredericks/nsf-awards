 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360015  Mandel       This project is to study a new class of very promising  highly parallel iterative methods for the solution of large  scale systems which arise from high order elements (the p-  version finite element method) in three-dimensional  elasticity for  structures with plates, shells and  junctures.  The size of problems on interest now rules our  direct solvers, but high order elements, particularly thin  elements, give rise to very ill-conditioned systems of  equations, which necessitate new specific preconditioners.       The plan in Phase I is to investigate new methods for  preconditioning thin solid high order elements and to study  their performance on three-dimensional problems with up to  over one million degrees of freedom.  The design and  development will be guided by theoretical analyses as well  as extensive experimentation.  Phase I will result in a  coarse grained parallel prototype code running on CRAY-YMP.      Phase II will be concerned with eliminating bottlenecks  for very large problems, extending the capabilities of the  method to include complicated goemetries and development of  production level software for CRAY-YMP and IBM SP-1.       The project will further knowledge in the areas of  multilevel and domain decomposition computational methods on  parallel supercomputers.  The availability of the proposed  methods will have a significant impact on mechanical  engineering practice.",
