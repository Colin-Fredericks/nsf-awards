Concerns over the environmental damage and  risks associated with the dumping of radioactive and toxic  substances into streams has heightened public awareness of this  problem and of the need to better understand the distribution  patterns of heavy metals in stream beds and the dynamics through  which they are transported in order to avoid hazards and  facilitate clean-up operations.  This project will measure and  analyze the spatial and temporal variability of concentrations of  heavy metals in gravel and cobble deposits of a southern Montana  stream that passes through an area that was intensively mined  over the last century.  Measurements of copper, lead, arsenic,  zinc, and other metals will be taken in different parts of two  200-meter reaches of this stream over a two-year period, thereby  permitting analysis of seasonal variations.  Analyses will be  made of the form and origins of the metals, and spatial  statistical analyses will be undertaken to evaluate their  location patterns and associations with other factors.  A model  of hydraulic processes will be adapted and tested in order to  determine whether variability in metal concentrations can be  predicted as a function of sediment size, hydraulic conditions,  and characteristics of the minerals.       This project will yield new understandings with both  fundamental and practical implications.  The project will provide  valuable new insights into the locational patterns of heavy metal  concentrations in stream beds over time, and it will expand  knowledge of the processes through which metals are transported  and concentrated in stream deposits.  This knowledge will be of  immediate benefit to those people responsible for maintaining  water quality, especially those assigned to monitor and restore  streams that have excessive concentrations of heavy metals.",
