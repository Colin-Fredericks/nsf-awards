 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT        This project seeks funds to purchase instrumentation  that will be used to conduct research specifically in the  area of \"plant responses to environmental stress\".  The  funds requested will not only provide our  \"plant  stress\"  research program with modern instrumentation,  but will also  strengthen our capabilities for training  graduate  and  undergraduate  students  in  the  most  contemporary techniques in plant stress physiology.  The  focus of the research to be conducted within the scope of  this proposal is somewhat  broad  in  the  sense  that  it  will  encompass  several different research projects.  However, all of the research projects that will be enhanced  by this project  fall  into the general  category of plant  physiology and metabolism as a response to environmental  stress.   One of the projects that will use the requested  instrumentation  centers   on  the   development   of  physiological selection criteria for breeding drought  resistant  genotypes of grain sorghum.  This continuing international  research program with Mexico which has received federal and  state support, has developed into a fruitful collaboration  which is now involving several researchers and students from  both Miami University and the Autonomous University of  Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico.  In a second   research  program   that   will   use   the   requested  instrumentation, we are studying the role of epidermal  flavonoids  as W-B  response molecules and W-B protection mechanisms  in  plants.  We have synthesized (only one of two labs in the  world to do this), a specific inhibitor of plant phenolics  that is capable  of  completely  inhibiting  the  synthesis  of  flavonoids.  This inhibitor has uniquely enabled us to test the  hypothesis that epidermal flavonoids are important W-B  screens in plants.",
