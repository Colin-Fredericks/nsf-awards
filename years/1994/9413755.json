 "awd_abstract_narration": "Winsborough    With National Science Foundation support, the University of  Wisconsin's Social Sciences Computing Co-operative will purchase  a Fiber Distributed Data Interface backbone for its extensive  computing network. This high-bandwidth backbone is necessary to  the very data-intensive research done in the Co-op. work which  uses a 50 gigabyte, on-line, data base of government and  privately collected data files from the U.S. and around the  world. The current network is an amalgam of older and more modern  equipment using a 10 mb/s ethernet specification. Some of the  older technology is slow and some is fragile and this seriously  impedes research. The backbone is overloaded in the older part of  its topology and peak daily loads are several times industry  recommendations. It has become fragile and causes frequent  interruptions for researchers along its path. The network to be  constructed will have from 30 to 60 times the current bandwidth.  It will both serve current users and add Department of Economics  researchers to the system.    The Social Sciences Computing Co-operative is composed of five  research and teaching agencies in the University of Wisconsin and  includes the Center for Demography and Ecology,  the Department  of Sociology, the Department of Rural Sociology, the Institute on  Aging and Adult Life and the Institute for Research on Poverty.  About 100 faculty and their teams of graduate assistants and  professional researchers use the co-op facilities. The research  conducted focuses on human resources, demography and the causes  and consequences of global change, especially as it relates to  the physical environment. The work contributes in a significant  way to the increase in basic scientific knowledge much of it  relevant to pressing national needs.",
