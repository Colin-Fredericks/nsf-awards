 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412851  Ayres    Under the direction of Dr. William Ayres, Mr Christopohe  Descantes will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He  will conduct ethnographic, ethnohistorical and archaeological  research in the village of Gachpar, located on the Pacific island  of Yap, and at Ulithi, a coral atoll located off Yap's coast.  Ethnographic data indicates that in the Yap region, as in many  parts of the Pacific, extensive exchange networks existed to  distribute goods among resource poor islands and this exchange  network played a central role in the political organization of  island polities. In Yap the situation appears quite complex since  specific areas of the island maintained exclusive links with  individual outlying atolls. At an even finer level, these  linkages appeared specified by individual family and lineage. Mr.  Descantes will carry out ethnographic and archaeological  fieldwork on both Yap and Ulithi. He will conduct interview and  excavation in the Yap village which, by tradition is linked  through trade to Ulithi. He will do similar work at Ulithi as  well. On this basis, he will determine what trading ties exist at  the present time and trace them backwards first through the  historical record and then, by means of excavated archaeological  material into the prehistoric past.    Archaeological data indicates that small and geographically  isolated Pacific islands were inhabited thousands of years ago.  While the original feats of navigation involved in this expansion  have long been recognized, less attention has been focussed on  the social, economic and political systems which permitted  sustained occupation of islands which were often lacking in  workable stone, clay and other essential goods. This research is  focussed on this topic. It is important because its deep  chronological perspective will permit one to examine how the  system developed and was maintained over millennia. The data  which M. Deschantes collects will be of interest to many  anthropologists. The proj ect will also assist in the training of  a promising young scientist.",
