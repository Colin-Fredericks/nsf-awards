 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Graham Fleming of the University of Chicago will examine   chemical dynamics in condensed phases on a femtosecond time scale.    Ultrafast spectroscopy and non-linear spectroscopic techniques will be   used to probe the molecular dynamics in solution which are usually masked   by the featureless nature of liquid-phase electronic spectra.  Ultrashort   pulses will be combined with pulse sequences to study the full range of   time scales present in the experimental system and its solvent.    Structures to be studied include biological systems with a photosynthetic   reaction center. Various chemical phenomena such as electron transfer   will be rationalized and predicted using spectral densities.  The cage   effect on the dissociation of iodine will be observed to determine the   mechanism of solvent-induced curve crossing.    This research will attempt to find examine several issues.  One involves   the effect of solvent molecules in liquid solutions on reactions in an   attempt to determine, for example, under what conditions the solvents   form cages around reactive species and keep them close enough for   reaction to occur.  Do these solvent molecules modify the reactive   condition of these reagent molecules?  How are proteins affected in the   water solutions which are characteristic of living systems?  These   experiments will also examine some aspects of the mechanism of   photosynthesis in order to gain a fuller understanding of this important   life process.",
