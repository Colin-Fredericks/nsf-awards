 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316896  Henrich    Steroidogenesis is a developmentally regulated,  neurohormonally stimulated, second messenger mediated  process whose molecular regulation remains largely undefined  in a variety of experimental systems. Among insects, neural  factors periodically stimulate the synthesis of the insect  steroid hormone, ecdysone, in the larval prothoracic gland.  This steroid is then converted into its active form, 20-  hydroxyecdysone, and interacts with nuclear receptors in  target tissues to trigger the developmental changes  associated with larval molts and metamorphosis. This project  will identify and characterize several genes at the  molecular level suspected to be involved in the regulation  of ecdysteroid biosynthesis in a model organism, the fruit  fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, the project will  pursue the following objectives; 1) clone a gene by  chromosomal walking  that is  defined by a conditional  mutation (ecdysoneless; ecd-1) which in turn, causes an  ecdysteroid deficiency at the mutation's restrictive  temperature; 2) deduce the structure of the ecd gene product  from cDNA clones, delineate its developmental expression,  assess its functional role in steroidogenesis, and construct  a physical map of the gene; 3) identify and characterize  members of the steroid hormone receptor super family active  in Drosophila steroidogenic tissues, including those whose  mammalian homologues have already been implicated in  steroidogenic regulation and those implicated in ecdysteroid  regulation. As part of achieving the first objective, a cDNA  library will be prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase  chain reaction methods with RNA extracted from the  Drosophila ring gland, which contains the prothoracic gland.  These methods will also be employed to quantify receptor  transcripts through the developmental period during which  the capacity of the Drosophila larval prothoracic gland to  produce ecdysteroids and respond to proteinaceous neural  factors increases dra matically. By achieving  the aims of  this project, a foundation will be laid for future genetic  investigations in a powerful model system concerning the  individual roles and functional coordination of molecular  activities that underlie steroidogenesis, as well as the  relationship between steroidogenic activities and steroid  dependent activities in target tissues.  ***",
