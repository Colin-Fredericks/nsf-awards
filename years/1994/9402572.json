 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402572  Goodno  Experimental and analytical investigations of hybrid control  systems designed to combine passive damping provided by  cladding-structure interaction with robust active control  systems will be continued in this second phase of the  overall research.  The research plan is organized into three  primary tasks:  (1) development of new low-dimensional  controller designs for robust control of building  structures; (2) development of hybrid design approaches for  optimization of the combined active (control) and passive  (cladding) systems; and (3) experimental verification  through simple scale model lab testing.  The principal  products of the proposed research are expected to be: (a)  new approaches to designing low-dimensional controllers in  output feedback settings that can be used for robust control  of building structures; (b) integrated design methods for  active/passive control systems in which the design process  concurrently optimizes active and passive subsystem  properties; (c) modeling, analysis and synthesis procedures  along with representative designs which combine advanced  cladding systems with several different active control  systems (e.g., active bracing or variable stiffness systems)  to form economical hybrid control strategies; (d)  development of improved computer models and extension of  present software to include consideration of techniques for  hybrid control of buildings using architectural cladding;  (e) verification of basic hybrid system behavior through  scale model lab experiments.  ***",
