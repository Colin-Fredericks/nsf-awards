 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds  from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program  will be employed to acquire a field emission gun scanning  electron microscope  (FE SEM). Peripheral attachments to be  included are energy dispersive scattering (EDS), a liquid  nitrogen specimen stage, electron beam induced conductivity  (EBIC), and backscattered channeling detector and analyzer.  The FE SEM will provide of resolution better than 5  nanometers at 1 kiloelectronvolt, which is not currently  available with current  SEMs at Northwestern. Several of the  peripherals are also new features for Northwestern  researchers.The FE SEM will be utilized in a large number of  diverse research projects including:  crack propagation in  structural ceramic composites, grain boundary phenomena in  electroceramics, microstructure and toughening mechanisms in  advance steels, polymer and membrane materials,  ultrastructural analysis of chemosensory signal  transduction, heavy metal recognition in gene regulation,  structure of the enthrocyte membrane skeleton, advanced  photonic and electronic devices, nucleation and growth of  diamond, and zeolite supported metallic and bimetallic  catalysts.    A new field emission scanning electron microscope with much  higher resolution and new peripheral devices not currently  at Northwestern will be acquired for a broad range of  research topics.  These topics include the study of  ceramics, the improvement of advanced steels, the study of  polymers and membrane materials, the study of biochemical  systems, the synthesis of diamond and buckytubes, the  development of advanced photonic and electronic devices, and  the study of zeolite-supported metallic catalysts.",
