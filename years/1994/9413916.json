 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in plant biology at the University of Vermont focuses on both  fundamental aspects of plant growth, development and ecology as well as  the effects of environmental factors on these processes. A consortium  of scientists from the Departments of Botany and Zoology and the School  of Natural Resources have formed an interdisciplinary research core  which seeks to advance opportunities for research in plant biology at  the University of Vermont. The expertise of these researchers extends  from the gene to the ecosystem level, presenting a well-balanced  foundation from which to foster research in plant biology. Ongoing  collaborative ventures among scientists within this core and active  student and post-doctoral participation in their laboratories attest to  their commitment to interdisciplinary research and education in the  plant sciences.    While each of the core faculty within this proposal has established a  productive research program at the University of Vermont, individual  and collaborative research is limited by the availability of growth  chambers that allow precisely controlled environmental conditions. This  restriction is not limited to any branch of plant biology but impacts  productivity and competitiveness in plant molecular biology, plant  physiology and metabolism, plant environmental biology and plant  evolution. A Controlled Environmental Facility for Plant Biology at UVM  brings together a cadre of scientists across units who are actively  collaborating or envision potential interdisciplinary interactions  stemming from a facility designed to provide controlled environments  for research in plant biology. Externally-funded research programs in  Botany, Zoology, and the School of Natural Resources highlight the  vitality of the research core.    The goal of this proposal is to establish a facility comprised of eight  growth chambers that allows maximum flexibility and breadth in research  opportunities in plant biology. Acquisition of this facility will  greatly en hance the research and educational opportunities that  currently exist at the University of Vermont This facility will provide  environmental conditions needed for the generation of transgenic  plants, for analyzing a plant's response to contrasting environmental  conditions, and for studying principles of group selection in large  plant populations under controlled conditions. The proposed facility  will also foster new avenues of experimentation, especially  collaborations that are currently impossible due to the lack of  adequate controlled growth facilities. Lastly, the facility will  enhance the quality of undergraduate and graduate education at the  University of Vermont by providing students studying plant molecular  biology, physiology and genetics with a state-of-the-art growth  facility necessary for their research.",
