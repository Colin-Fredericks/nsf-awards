 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316644  Butler       We have identified and characterized an isolate of the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a conditional defect in the  pathway for the production of mature mRNA.  The recessive, lethal  mutation (pap1-1) lies in the gene encoding poly(A) polymerase  and results in thermolabile mRNA polyadenylation activity in  vitro and in vivo.  Shift of pap1-1 cells to the restrictive  growth temperature results in a rapid loss of polyadenylated mRNA  and the eventual death of the cell.  We intend to exploit this  mutation and the clone of the normal copy of the gene we obtained  to pursue several lines of investigation designed to gain a  better understanding of the function and mechanism of  polyadenylation.  This novel mutation and the strength of the  genetic and biochemical techniques offered by this system put us  in a unique position to bring new insights to this area of  molecular biology.  First, we will continue to characterize the  pap1-1 mutant to determine why lack of polyadenylation kills the  cells, thereby providing insight into the role of poly(A) tails  in the cell.  Second, we will search for and characterize  suppressor mutations restoring the ability of pap1-1 cells to  grow at the non-permissive temperature with the aim of  identifying and understanding genes whose products interact with  poly(A) polymerase, or play a role in mRNA metabolism.  %%%  This research has as its central aim the understanding  of how cells modify the chemical structure of genetic messages,  called messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs), and how these  modifications affect the function of these molecules.   Specifically, we are using to use baker's yeast as a model  organism to study how the cell adds a series of nucleosides  called adenosines to the end of mRNAs and to what degree this  modification affects the ability of these messengers to translate  their genetic information into proteins.  During the period of  our previous NSF award we isolated and characterized a yeast  mutation that  allows us to control, in living cells, the activity  of the enzyme required to carry out this modification.  Our  approaches therefore feature the use of this mutation under  conditions that allow us to study the synthesis and function of  the modified mRNAs.  Baker's yeast has proved to be an invaluable  tool to study basic processes in cells because it is easy to grow  and is amenable to biochemical and genetic analyses. Importantly,  the basic molecular details of how cells grow and differentiate  appear to be remarkably similar in yeast and humans, thus  implying that basic biochemical research in yeast will shed light  on the nature of basic molecular biological processes in many  organisms as well.  ***",
