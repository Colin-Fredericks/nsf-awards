However, relatively few of these studies have dealt  with  effects of dinoflagellates on zooplankton. The main  objective of  this project is to determine how the dinoflagellates,  Alexandrium  tamarensis and Scrippsiella trochoidea act upon the copepod  digestive system and metabolism. These studies will examine  if  different copepod species have different susceptibilities  and how  these relate to feeding history and nutritional status, and  will  determine if other dinoflagellate species have similar  impacts on  copepods. This project will use visual description and  morphometric  analyses of the gut cells of several copepods feeding upon  the 2  species of dinoflagelattes in laboratory experiments.  Analyses of  gut morphology will be conducted at both the light and  electron-  microscope level , and also will include observations of the  digestive system of live copepods under light microscope.  Changes  in physiological rates (digestive enzyme activities,  metabolic  enzyme activities, excretion rate, and respiration rate) and  feeding rate also will be determined to assess the  consequences of  ingesting a toxic dinoflagellate or of being exposed to  dinoflagellate toxins. After establishing the interactions  between  copepods and the two dinoflagellates, this project will use  the  knowledge gained as a basis for a survey of impacts of other  dinoflagellate species on copepods.",
