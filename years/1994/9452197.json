 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452197  Dewey  The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, as part of the  effort to insure that graduates are environmentally literate as  well as technically competent, is restructuring the Civil  Engineering Materials course sequence. Unifying themes of the  revised three course sequence include an awareness of the  environmental impact of material acquisition and use along with the  development and use of material evaluation protocols as decision  making tools. The course sequence includes an introductory class in  civil engineering material properties, a class in civil engineering  composites, and a class in properties of soils.  Laboratory  experiences are considered important to the understanding and  appreciation of material behavior, and these revised materials  classes will provide extensive hands-on opportunities to understand  experimental procedures and determine material properties. The  laboratory experience will start with manual equipment operation  and data collection and progress to computer controlled experiments  coupled with automated data collection and display. Materials  considered and characterized include traditional construction  materials as well as industrial and post-consumer residuals. An  awareness of non-conventional or novel materials will permit  graduate engineers to effectively utilize these materials as an  important part of pollution prevention efforts.  One of the manual  universal test frames and a data acquisition system procured under  this project will be mounted on a portable cart to permit classroom  demonstrations in later design classes.",
