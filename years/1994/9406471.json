 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406471  Moyer    Entomopoxviruses are poxviruses of insects and are related  to the more commonly studied vertebrate poxviruses such as  vaccinia.  The proposed project has relevance to  biotechnology, biological control, and gene expression.  The  PI's studies may open the way for a variety of applications  including genetically engineered biopesticides, vaccines,  and expression systems for foreign genes.  An entomopoxvirus  expression system would be a valuable tool for all these  areas in much the same manner as that of other insect virus  expression vectors have been.  There are potential uses of  entomopoxviruses in biological control of insects.  Grasshopper entomopoxviruses are presently being developed  for use in grasshopper control programs on rangelands.  Identification of viral genes associated with natural  virulence may offer clues to the control of insect  populations.  It is anticipated that the genetic engineering  methodology developed in this project will greatly aid in  the insertion of insect-specific toxin genes into  entomopoxviruses to enhance their potential efficacy as  biological control agents.  The PI's studies may also pave  the way for examination of the molecular aspects of disease  production of this as yet unexploited yet very different and  interesting group of viruses.  ***",
