 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on three distinct, but interrelated  areas of research:  quantum gravity and its generalizations,  classical gravitation theories and quantum field theory.    The main problems to be considered include the following:  Conformal anomalies in general space-time dimensions and  their applications, following on results obtained very  recently.  This subject cuts across all three main topics,  with consequences for both classical gravity and quantum  field theory, for example in extending two-dimensional field  theoretical theorems to four dimensions.  The properties of  quantum gravity in the ultra-high energy domain will be  studied to establish whether this regime can be understood  independent of the complications of the full theory, just as  can the low energy sector.  In particular, possible  relations to topological theories will be investigated;  again preliminary progress is encouraging and will provide  the starting point.  The role of the self-energy problem for  ultra-rapid particles must be considered both in the above  context and as an intrinsically important aspect of gravity  theories; is there an improvement over the difficulties  encountered by massive sources?  The definition of energy,  central to understanding the solutions of two-dimensional  gravity should be uniquely settled by systematic application  of the well-understood methodology originally developed for  general relativity.  While the properties of two-and three-  dimensional gravity have provided much insight and have been  a central aspect of recent research, the qualitatively  different domain of high dimensions has not yet received  attention.  Any simplifications or unusual features at high  D would also yield a deeper understanding, and this sector  of gravity will also be probed.  The role of scalar fields  in gravitation has been pervasive, most recently under the  impetus of string theory, as well as in connection with  conformal invariance.  Nevertheless, there is still no  systematic unde rstanding of the possible physical effects of  scalars.  At their most optimistic, these might include an  alternate approach to the Higgs problem at a fundamental  level.",
