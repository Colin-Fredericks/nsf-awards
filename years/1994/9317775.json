 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317775  Smith       The Gesneriaceae, the African-violet family of plants, is a  mostly tropical group in the New and Old Worlds, little known  biologically except for those species prized as ornamentals.  Dr.  James Smith of Boise State University has pioneered the application  of new DNA-based methods of analysis to problems of taxonomic  delimitation and phylogenetic reconstruction in this family.  With  assistance from undergraduate students in research, he is exploring  phylogenetic relationships in representative species of all tribes  and most genera of the family, using traditional morphological  characters and new evidence from chloroplast DNA.  Concordance in  these independent datasets will lay the basis for detailed studies  of biogeography and of the evolution of pollination systems.       The comparison and integration of data from different sources  constitute an important arena of contemporary phylogenetic  research.  Taxa from predominantly tropical regions are rarely  explored as model systems in this debate, because in general they  are poorly known.  The RUI project by Dr. James Smith will  contribute new DNA data and refined morphological insights to the  study of Gesneriaceae in particular and to taxonomic methodology in  general.",
