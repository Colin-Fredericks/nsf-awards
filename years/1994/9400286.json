 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360638  Wang  Brimrose proposes to research and demonstrate novel integrated photorefractive waveguide-based photonic devices including optical amplifiers and homodyne detectors.  They have advantages of significantly increased sensitivity, integrated waveguide format, rigid, stable and self-alignment.  The sensitivity of these devices are several order of magnitudes higher than their convention bulk counterparts.  The mechanism of the high sensitivity is two fold: (1)The optical signals are confirmed in films on the order of a few microns thick in photorefractive waveguides.  Thus even with low signal energy, the energy density can still be very high; and (2)The interaction length of the underlying mechanism response for amplification and homodyning are much longer than in the bulk case where the interaction length is limited by the beam width.  The index change An for 1.0uj/cm3 absorbed energy will be increased from 0.51x10-6 in the bulk format to greater than 500x10-6 in the integrated guided-wave format.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that homodyne detection using photorefractive two-beam coupling can increase the signal-to-noise ratio by 3 dB.    These devices will be fabricated from photorefractive II-VI semiconductor materials, CdTe:V and ZnTe:V, which have been extensive worked on for over five years and Brimrose is the only manufacturer in the world.  They have photorefractive sensitivity between 0.6 um to 1.5 um which is perfectly matched with laser diodes and optical communication wavelengths.  ***",
