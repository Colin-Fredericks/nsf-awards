 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320680  Taylor    STRATEGIC PLANNING'S ROLE IN ESTABLISHING UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND              PLANS FOR TEACHING, RESEARCH AND SERVICE    Universities are under pressure to contain costs as a result of  declining revenue growth and competing priorities.  Also,  universities are being criticized by the public for neglecting  undergraduate students in favor of research activities. With cost  containment and reallocation counterpoised against calls for  research investment, and with old assumptions being questioned,  higher education officials are searching for techniques to  maintain the quality of their programs while stabilizing or  downsizing their institutions and controlling costs.    This study seeks to extend earlier research by determining the  role institutional planning plays with respect to fundamental  mission issues affecting graduate, research universities.  The  study will examine a set of issues and planning processes at the  institution, college and department levels at ten Carnegie  Classification Research I universities, five public and five  private.    Data collection will include institutional planning documents,  research policies, organizational charts, annual reports from  engineering and science departments, and related documents.  Selected institutional officials will be interviewed concerning  planning approaches and institutional mission. A survey will be  repeated (Larson, 1987) to detect any changes in planning  organization, policies, plans and attitudes that facilitate or  detract from engaging in strategic planning. A content analysis  approach will be used to analyze the data collected from the  interviews and institutional documents. A test of statistical  differences will be applied on all survey items for any  significant changes between the Larson survey and the survey in  this study.",
