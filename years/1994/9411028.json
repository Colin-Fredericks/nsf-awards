 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411028  Canon  A central problem for representative democracy is to provide a  voice for minority interests in a system that is dominated by the  votes of the majority.  The legitimacy and stability of any  democracy depends, in part, on its ability to accomplish that  difficult aim.  The problem is especially acute in the U.S.  Congress where minorities are dramatically underrepresented.   State legislatures attempted to address this concern in the 1992  reapportionment process by creating 20 new districts in which a  majority of the voters are African-American or Hispanic.  The  goal of \"empowering\" minority voters through creative  redistricting is extremely controversial.  Detractors ridicule  the policy as affirmative action for African American politicians  and worry about creating political apartheid.  The issue received  national attention for several weeks in the summer of 1993 as the  Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision that could  challenge the new districts (Shaw v Reno) and Lani Guinier's  nomination to the Civil Rights Commission was removed by  President Clinton under pressure from Democrats who bridled at  her notion of \"authentic black representation.\"  Minority  districting also has important implications for the normative  debate raging in the minority politics and women's studies  literature concerning the \"politics of difference\" versus the  \"politics of commonality.\"  A politics of commonality strives to  provide equal protection of the laws without special treatment  for any single group, while a politics of difference calls for  proper remedies for previous discrimination and exclusion.  Most  political observers, including proponents and opponents of the  strategy, see the creation of minority-majority districts as an  embodiment of the politics of difference.    This research challenges that common wisdom.  The investigator's  previous research shows that many of the African American  politicians who were elected in the new districts embody the  politics of c ommonality, rather than the politics of difference.   This investigation will determine whether behavior in campaigns  translates into behavior in office.  Does the racially charged  atmosphere of some campaigns carry over into the governing  process so that some blacks do not represent white voters?  Are  promises to represent both white and black constituents kept by  black members who were elected by biracial coalitions, or do they  follow their colleagues in the Black Caucus on some issues that  are racially polarizing?  This research will examine roll call  votes, speeches, introduction of bills, committee assignments,  constituency service, and the media's coverage of black House  members to explore the nature of representation in black  districts.   The multivariate analysis to be employed will be  supplemented by interviews of members and their staff.  The  research will provide important new insights about the nature of  representation provided to these new districts, the linkages  between campaigning and governing in racial politics, and the  usefulness of racial redistricting as a means of empowering  minority voters.",
