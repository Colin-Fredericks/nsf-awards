 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401990  Brzezinski         Global mass-balance consideration, vertical nutrient  profiles, and seasonal nutrient cycle data all indicate that  the large subtropical mid-ocean gyres may account for the  majority of the global oceanic production of biogenic  silica.  Although diatoms can become abundant during spring  blooms in these regions, the available evidence suggests  that most of the annual silica production in summer and  autumn.  This may be especially true in the oligotrophic  North Central Pacific which does not have a strong seasonal  cycle of phytoplankton production due to Persistent  stratification.  The surface waters of the Central North  Pacific contain the highest concentrations of silicic acid  of any oligotrophic gyre.  It is unknown whether this  greater availability of silicic acid results in higher rates  of silica production in this region compared to other mid  ocean systems.  Siliceous biomass in this region has been  reported to be overwhelmingly dominated (>90%) by centimeter-  sized mats are not effectively sampled by traditional water  bottle samplers and are typically collected by divers.  This  give rise to a unique situation where silica cycling  in  this region, which is likely to be significant in global  terms, may be dominated by large rare sells that would be  essentially invisible to investigations which employ  traditional sampling methods.         This project will be the first study of the production  and dissolution of biogenic silica in the oligotrophic  Central North Pacific Ocean.  Our study will combine  traditional water column sampling using water-bottle  samplers with collections of mats made by divers to compare  the relative roles of these large mats and suspended  diatioms in the cycling of biogenic silica in the surface  waters of this  region.  This study will have two major  objectives:  (1) to evaluate of the magnitude of silica  production in the North Central Pacific Gyre, and (2) to  assess the relative contribution mats of Rhizosoleni a sp.  and unaaggregated diatoms in the cycling of Si.  This work  will be conducted during two cruises out of Hawaii.",
