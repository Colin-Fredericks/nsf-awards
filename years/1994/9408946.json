 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT -- CTS-9408946  Pfeffer - NJIT    It is proposed to explore the use of a rotating centrifugal bed filter with a \"self cleaning\" zeolite catalyst for removal of soot and NOx from the exhaust of internal combustion engines.  Its application for reducing air pollution from mobile Diesel engines will also be tested.    The rotating fluidized bed as a dust filter with variable speed was proposed by the PI.  A preliminary test for a \"self cleaning\" zeolite catalyst has been performed in the University of Tokyo, by a collaborator of the PI.  At 695 degrees Kelvin, the soot and NOx interacted successively with the fluidized bed composed of a copper ion-exchange ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst, resulting in emissions of N2 and CO2 and a continuous regeneration of the original catalyst.  This project aims to verify the \"self cleanliness\" of several particulate catalysts, their range of application, and the time scales over which the catalysts would remain active.  If the preliminary study is positive, a fluidized bed device will be engineered for direct attachment to a mobile Diesel-powered vehicle and tested in situ with the objective of reducing air pollution.    If successful, the research may lead to a versatile filter for the internal combustion engines, with improved performances as compared to existing systems for a variety of applications in environmental technology.",
