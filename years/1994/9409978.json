The symposium is dedicated to recent research in hot electron and quantum transport in mesoscopic structures, specifically quantum wires and dots.  Novel optical phenomena in wires and dots (including research in light emission mechanisms of porous silicon) is also of interest.  Of particular importance are cooperative phenomena in coupled dot and wires (including both linear arrays and lateral surface supperlattices) and exchange mediated artificially engineering many body ground states in such systems.  The symposium will address all aspects of fabrication, characterization and modelling of both semiconductor and superconductor mesoscopic structures and coupled systems.  This is a field which continues to burgeon and promises vastly improved for the next century.  ***",
