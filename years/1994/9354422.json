 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354422  Amador  The proposed curricular development project, \"The Physics of  Medical Technologies\" addresses two serious concerns: the  scientific education of college students not majoring in the  natural sciences, and the enrichment of standard freshman physics  laboratories. The interdisciplinary field of medical physics offers  an exciting opportunity to create general audience courses which  teach a great deal of basic physics in the context of learning how  sophisticated medical instrumentation works. Importantly, the  physics is limited in scope to relatively few topics, but these can  be explored in depth. For example, geometrical optics plays a role  in the understanding of fiber optic scopes, laser surgery, and  ultrasound, while the concept of energy occupies a central place in  the discussion of both laser surgery and radiation therapy. The  main outcome of this project would be curricular materials for  dissemination: a complete set of lecture notes, written at the  appropriate level for a general audience course, supporting  materials such as sample problems and demonstrations, and five  original discovery-oriented laboratories which blend the essential  science with medical applications. The latter will be appropriate  for either a general audience course or for introducing topical  applications into standard freshman physics. All three components,  lecture notes, problems, and labs, have been designed to emphasize  conceptual learning in conjunction with core quantitative  techniques, such as estimation, modeling of data, and engineering  design concerns. A detailed evaluation plan involving feedback from  three off-site peers and a graduate assistant will assist in  refining these course materials before they are advertised through  mailings and journal articles. By encouraging instructors  interested in teaching such a course and providing them with  material help, the project will have an impact beyond its immediate  student audience.",
