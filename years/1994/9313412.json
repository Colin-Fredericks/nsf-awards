While NOx and NOx  and HOx are predominantly of natural origin, concentrations of the  halogen oxides in the stratosphere are thought to be increasing due  to anthropogenic uses of organic halides, mainly the  chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), halons, and methyl bromide.  The  inherant non-linear coupling of these radical families complicates  interpretations of stratospheric photochemistry that rely either on  isolated measurements of a single species in the atmosphere or on  measurements using a single detection technique.          This research project will focus on the design and deployment  of a new instrument for in situ measurements of reactive chlorine  (ClO and Cl2O2) and reactive bromine (BrO), one based on the  technique of chemical-conversion resonance fluorescence and one  which has flown successfully on aircraft and balloons.  This  instrument will be sufficiently lightweight that it could be  deployed easily in conjunction with existing balloon- or aircraft-  borne payloads, especially those to be flown on a new class of  unmanned aircraft.         Two major objectives will direct this project.  First, these  researchers will work closely with investigators who measure the  halogen oxides with remote techniques from the ground, balloons,  and space to provide a critical intercomparison of the available  techniques  and an evaluation of the uncertainties of the  measurements over the altitude range from 12 to 35 km.  They are  also interested in interactions with those members of the Network  for Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) and of the Upper.   Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS).  Second, the project  scientists will seek collaborative investigations of the chemical  and dynamical processes that determine the abundances of ozone-  destroying radicals in the lower stratos phere.  Their main interest  will be the influence of aerosols on the balance of NOx, ClOx, and  BrOx chemistries, especially near the tropical tropopause and at  mid-latitudes.  This instrument will be sufficiently lightweight  that it could be deployed easily in conjunction with existing  balloon- or payloads, especially those to be flown on a new class  of unmanned aircraft.",
