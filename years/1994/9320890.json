 "awd_abstract_narration": "The digital communications industry is currently investing a  plethora of resources towards the development and experimental  verification of prototype antenna arrays to be deployed on mobile  communication vehicles, including the commercial automobile of the  future, as a means of discriminating amongst signals co-located in  frequency based on their respective spatial locations.  Given the  small aperture on a mobile communications unit, the uniform  circular array (UCA) geometry is ideal due to its rotational  invariance with respect to azimuth.  This research is based on a  recent breakthrough by the principal investigator: the development  of a simple, closed form algorithm for use in conjunction with a  UCA that provides automatically paired source azimuth and elevation  angle estimates.  In contrast, the algorithms for 2D arrival-angle  estimation to date have required expensive spectral searches,  iterative solutions to multidimensional optimization problems, or  ad-hoc schemes for pairing direction cosine estimates with respect  to each of a number of different array axes.  Note that UCA-ESPRIT  is fundamentally different from ESPRIT in that it is not based on  a displacement invariance array structure but rather is based on  phase mode excitation and hinges on a recursive relationship  between Bessel functions.    A theoretical performance analysis of UCA-ESPRIT is being  conducted.  This will prove extremely useful for predicting its  performance in a mobile communications environment.  Novel  strategies for incorporating mutual coupling effects are being  developed as well.  The real world performance of UCA-ESPRIT will  be assessed with experimental data from a prototype circular  antenna array currently being built at the Polytechnic University  of Madrid for mobile sea communications with the INMARSAT satellite  system.  Adaptations of UCA-ESPRIT for filled circular arrays are  also being developed.",
