 "awd_abstract_narration": "Garnett  9401269         The research supported by this award focuses on problems  arising in the mathematical theory of functions of one complex  variable and one-dimensional Schrodinger operators.  The work  continues investigations in four problem areas.  In the first,  work will be done investigating the density of Blaschke products  whose roots are restricted to interpolating sequences for the  algebra of bounded analytic functions.  It is expected that all  Blaschke products are uniform limits of the restricted ones  and that the closed convex hull of these Blaschke products is  the unit ball for the algebra.  A second line of  investigation concerns analytic capacity to help understand the  nature of sets having positive Hausdorff dimension but which have  zero capacity.        Work will also be done on determining for which powers  the derivative of a conformal mapping is integrable along  straight lines in simply connected domains.  Related  investigations will consider the same question when the integrals  are taken with respect to area measure.  Efforts to understand  the gap sequences (bands) in one-dimensional periodic Schrodinger  operators will be taken up for operators with complex potentials.   Recent work has shown that the spectrum can be realized in terms  of Riemann surfaces.  The purpose of this work is to obtain a  more intrinsic description of the spectrum.       Complex function theory is the study of the analytic and  geometric properties of differentiable functions of a  complex variable.  The subject has grown in time to include  ancillary lines of investigation such as quasiconformal  mapping, quasiregular mapping and potential theory.  Work in the  field is motivated by problems in geometry, differential  equations, fluid dynamics and control theory.  Recent work also  involves studies of computational conformal mapping through new  applications of circle packing.   ***",
