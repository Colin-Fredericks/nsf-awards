 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361290  Mills    For most students, assessment means a single score or grade.  Such  one-dimensional assessments fail to convey information about the  student's creativity, originality, ability to do independent work,  problem solving skills, or ability to work cooperatively.  As  curriculum reform occurs across the country to meet the National  Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards, innovative and  alternative methods of assessment of student learning and progress   must also follow.  Student work itself should serve as the context  for rubrics for evaluation. In this SBIR Phase I project, Key  Curriculum Press will research and create such alternative  assessment materials for four technology-rich curricula to support  teachers who wish to align their assessment practices with  mathematics curriculum reform.  Specifically, the research will  involving linkages with national assessment reform efforts; surveys  of teachers using traditional and alternative assessment  techniques; interviews of teachers to develop case studies of  teachers who change assessment methods; development and refinement  of prototype assessment tasks; and pilot studies and evaluation of  these prototypes.      This project will make a contribution to the generation of  practical assessment materials--practical both in the sense that  they will be implementable and that they are derived from classroom  practices--that are complementary to the development of technology-  rich curricula and thus go beyond the traditional methods.  ***",
