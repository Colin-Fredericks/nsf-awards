Although most people assume that faxing is a spontaneous spinoff of  the electronic and computer revolutions of the 1980's, in reality,  fax technology has existed for 150 years.  Major companies in the  US, Britain, and France had the opportunity to promote fax  technology.  Yet the social needs in Japan, which has an \"alphabet\"  that is not easily accommodated to the keyboard, led to its  commercial success in the past twenty years.  Dr. Coopersmith is  examining why it took so long for people to develop and utilize a  machine that has revolutionized the way we communicate.      The fax machine appears to be a free-standing device, but it is  intricately embedded in a system of telephone and computer  networks, standards, business and social mores, and legal and  economic structures.  Studying the fax machine provides a gateway  into understanding the construction and evolution of this system of  communications.  Dr. Coopersmith is using a comparative  international approach to capture the evolution of fax technology.   His main themes are innovation and diffusion, failure and the  development of niche markets, the role of large organizations in  shaping technical evolution and personal choice, and changes in  communication.  The recent widespread use of fax machines resulted  from a convergence of technical, economic and social factors.  To  understand this convergence and the failure of prior efforts,  comparisons among the United States, Great Britain and Japan will  illuminate how different social and economic systems shaped the  debates and development of fax technology.  By analyzing how faxing  has changed the way people communicate and work, this research will  deepen our understanding of the evolving shape of  telecommunications on the \"information revolution.\"  For decades  predi ctions about the uses and importance of fax machines outpaced  the reality, but when widespread acceptance came in the mid-1980's,  the plethora of applications and further innovation surprised  everyone, including proponents of the \"electronic office of the  future.\"    Dr. Coopersmith's study is not a narrow history of a machine, but  an exploration of how technologies, economics, politics, and  societal values shaped the evolution of the fax machine and how fax  technology influenced societies in which it is embedded.  This  research will contribute to the growing literature on innovation  and further the study of the information revolution.  ***",
