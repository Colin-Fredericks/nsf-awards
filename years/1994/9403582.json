 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall thrust of the research objectives is to make progress  towards providing, for a wide variety of applications and  experimental designs, a semiparametric alternative to the popular  parametric regression methods used in the analysis of data.  Methodology is proposed for discrete and continuous data as well  as for independent and correlated responses. The objectives are  to study: i) nonparametric estimation of a regression function  when the explanatory variable is discrete, ii) estimation of the  dose effect given observations over time in a dose-response  experiment, and nonparametric detection of interactions between  dose and time, iii) estimation in conditionally specified  distributions. Decisions and recommendations based on data  analysis using the wrong parametric model are not reliable.  Therein lies the need for the development of methodology for  fitting semiparametric models to data. The basic research efforts  outlined in this proposal include: i) theoretical work, ii)  computer simulations to validate the procedures, and iii)  application of the semiparametric methods to biomedical data  obtained from researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University -  Medical College of Virginia, The University of Texas - M.D.  Anderson Cancer Center, and The Eye Institute of The University  of Wisconsin, Madison. This project also includes an  undergraduate student mentorship and community outreach  component. Undergraduate students in the Department of  Mathematical Sciences will assist with the research projects and  with mathematics outreach activities designed for the El Paso  area Middle School students.",
