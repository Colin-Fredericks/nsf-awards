 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400243  YANG      Three main projects are proposed. The first project is a study  of the cosmic string solutions of the coupled Einstein and  Yang--Mills--Higgs equations. Problems such as the structure of  coupling in view of physical constants and gauge groups,  existence and nonexistence of regular stationary solutions will  be investigated. Solutions of this type have applications in  early universe physics and the theory of galaxy formation. The  second project is a study of a variational problem arising from a  field-theoretical framework of nuclear interactions. The main  problem is to minimize an energy functional among all  configuration maps in various homotopy classes. The homotopy  class plays the role of a topological constraint which takes an  integral form. Existence, regularity, and behavior of the  minimizers will be investigated. The third project is a study of  the energy gap equation in the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer  microscopic theory of superconductivity. Problems such as the  determination of the critical transition temperature, the  uniqueness of a full space solution, and numerical approximations  of superconducting states will be investigated.  The proposed  research considers nonlinear problems arising from several  important areas of theoretical physics, including  superconductivity, cosmology, and nuclear systems. The  mathematical analysis and solutions will help better understand  these problems, open new areas of mathematical research, and  enhance the interactions of modern mathematics with physics. The  methods developed will also be useful and stimulating to other  related fields of applied, numerical, and pure mathematics.",
