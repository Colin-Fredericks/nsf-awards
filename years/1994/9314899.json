 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314899  Gwinn  The dynamical response of quasi-3D electron gases will be probed  using linear and nonlinear techniques.  These types of electron  gases are of fundamental interest since they exhibit metallic  behavior (rs~2.5) but at much reduced plasma energies (~4 meV)  compared to typical metals.  The materials are molecular beam  epitaxially grown AlxGa1-xAs superlattice structures which are  specially designed to yield a 3D electron gas with widths which are  less than several Fermi wavelengths (hence quasi-3D).  The  electronic ground state of the electron gas will be probed using  low temperature capacitive profiling and Shubnikov-de-Haas  oscillations.  The linear studies, using standard Fourier transform  spectroscopic techniques, will expand the understanding of the  interplay between the excitation of the electron gas and the  spatial variation of its ground state density.  Proposed density  variations include internal gradients, as in the bi-metallic gas,  near surface perturbations, and lateral modulations induced by  optical illumination through a grating.  The nonlinear studies will  be carried out using an intense tunable far infrared free-electron  laser source.  The experiment will measure the harmonic emission  generated by the quasi-3D electron gas for frequencies above as  well as below the plasma frequency.  Modeling of this emission will  yield information about nonlinear dynamic screening in an  inhomogeneous electron gas.  %%%  Layered semiconductors can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy to  provide electronic systems which are models for a three dimensional  gas of free electrons.  Because of its finite lateral dimension  such a structure is referred to as a quasi-free dimensional  electron gas.  Proper growth control can establish an inhomogeneous  distribution of electrons.  Study of the response of such  inhomogeneous quasi-3D electronic distributions to low level and  high intensity radiation is proposed.  The angular frequency of the  radiation is comparable to t he fundamental electronic response  frequency of the electron gas (plasma frequency).  The expected  measurements will likely lead to an improved understanding of the  dynamic surface response of free electron materials, and be  important for the development of tunable electronic materials that  take advantage of the high degree of control over the electron  density that can be achieved within these semiconductor structures.  ***",
