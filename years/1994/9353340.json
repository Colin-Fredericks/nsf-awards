The planning process consists of  three steps: defining and achieving consensus on a vision;  collecting data to analyze strengths and weaknesses of the school  district; and developing an implementation plan.    Two groups of consituents, the Leadership Council and the USI  Staff, comprise the Planning Team. The Leadership Council will  review collected data, make recommendations based on this data, and  garner additional support from other stakeholders. The USI Staff  will gather data, prepare reports for the Leadership Council and  draft the implementation plan.     At the conclusion of the self study, Columbus will have developed  a documented study of existing programs, reached consensus on the  priorities for achieving comprehensive reform, obtained the  commitment of key constituencies to support systemic change in the  Columbus Public Schools, articulated a vision for mathematics and  science education; identified a detailed plan to guide their  reform.   ***",
