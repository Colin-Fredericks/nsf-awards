A workshop will be held in  which leading social scientists who conduct research on violence  will discuss ways to integrate studies from different theoretical  perspectives and different levels of analysis.  A recent National  Academy of Sciences report stated that federal support for  violence research was insufficient, short-term, and fragmented  across specific problem areas.  The report recommended a  coordinated effort with long-term support so that information  gained from individual projects could be developed into a  cumulative knowledge base for planning effective policies.  The  present project will provide the basis for a coordinated  knowledge-building effort in the conduct of scientific research  on violence.  ***",
