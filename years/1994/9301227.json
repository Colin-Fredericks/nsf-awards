 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301227  Chen       The interactions of atmospheric flows with mountains is an  important issue in atmospheric sciences.  Orography plays a role in  both local weather as well as influencing the larger scale flow.   The isolation of the mountainous Island of Hawaii provides a  natural laboratory for these studies.       In 1990 a cooperative project among several researchers, the  Hawaiian Rainband Project (HaRP), was executed to study the  influence of the island on local weather and fundamental  mountain/atmospheric flow interactions.       The Principal Investigator will continue and extend his  previous research on the relationship between rainbands and the  mesoscale environment using data collected during the HaRP.  Using  results from prior observational studies and extensive numerical  simulations, he will examine the diurnal evolution of the  rainbands, which are a consistent atmospheric feature on the  windward side of the island of Hawaii.  The Principal Investigator  will focus on the larger scale forcing that controls the location  and strength of the convergence zone responsible for the rainbands.   Specifically, the researcher will attempt to verify previous  numerical model results pertaining to dynamic forcing of rainbands  and will reexamine the role of thermal forcing.  ***",
