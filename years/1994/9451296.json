This has reawakened a new emphasis on engineering  education geared towards design and production. This project  proposes to enhance the manufacturing laboratory and curriculum of  Southern University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana by adding Computer  Numerically Controlled machines. The proposed equipment would  enable the faculty: to provide undergraduate students with quality  training opportunities and skills that reflect the technological  advances in the manufacturing industry; to develop new laboratory  courses in computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing  - CAD/CAM; to take a step further in developing a strong  manufacturing option for undergraduate Engineering and Technology  students as well as graduate students in computer science; to  strengthen the curriculum, offer students hands-on practical  experience, and a familiarity with equipment they will use in the  industry; and to enhance the capacity of Southern University to  contribute immensely towards the engineering and science  educational goals for minorities in Louisiana, and the United  States.",
