Scientists at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics  (BUAA) and Auburn University will form an international research  team to investigate the interactions between electromagnetic (EM)  waves and advanced fiber reinforced composites.  The reflection,  transmission, and absorption effects of EM waves in a composite  will be correlated with the characteristics of the constituent  fiber, matrix and their interfaces.  Models will be developed to  analyze EM wave-composite interactions in terms of correlations  between basic EM parameters (permeability and permittivity) and  the constituent materials properties.  This investigation will  initially  be concentrated on a model class of functional fibers  and composites that can exhibit an unusually wide spectrum of  electrical behaviors, covering more than 12 orders of magnitude  in conductivity ranging from highly insulating to highly  conducting.  The fibers, termed \"quasi-carbon\" (QC) fibers, will  be obtained by oxidizing (stabilizing) and then partially or  fully carbonizing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers.  The QC fiber  reinforced QC matrix composites (QC/QC) will be prepared by  impregnating QC fibers with a PAN or phenolic resin and then  stabilizing and carbonizing the matrix resin.  Correlation  between the electrical properties and the molecular and crystal  structures of these thermally treated fibers and composites will  be established.  Proper heat treatment conditions will be  identified for the fabrication of advanced composites with good  structural integrity, high thermal stability, and a unique EM  wave-absorbing capability.",
