The study  aims  to  make  a  contribution to filling  a  gap  in  knowledge  relating  to  the direct and indirect effects of  earthquakes  by  undertaking  a  systematic  investigation  of  building   damage,  business   interruption  and  recovery  involving  a  significant  inventory  of  buildings and businesses in the epicentral  region  during   the   first  twelve  months  following  the   Northridge  earthquake.   The  study inventory consists of approximately  170  business  members of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, together  with  approximately 200 stores at Northridge Fashion Center.   It  is  intended that the results of this study will provide  greatly  improved  understanding of the effects of such earthquakes  on  a  prototypical business community, significant input into  economic  models used for estimating direct and indirect economic losses in  future  earthquakes, and valuable insights into the  significance  of types of structural and nonstructural damage and their effects  on business viability.  ***",
