 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313835  Hinton  The transport of matter through membranes is a basic phenomenon of  life.  All organisms are separated from their environment by  special membrane barriers which control the exchange of matter with  their surroundings and act as an electrical resistor.  In addition,  nearly all life processes are intimately involved with membrane  function.  Thus, membrane functions play a central role in  communication between and within cells, in the transformation of  metabolic energy into osmotic, electrical, and to some extent  mechanical work.  In living cells an electrical potential  difference exists between the cytoplasma and the extracellular  medium because of the unequal distribution of ions on both sides of  the plasma membrane surrounding the cell.  The cell membranes are  equipped with special transport mechanisms which accelerate the  passage of ions across the lipid barrier.  An understanding of  these transport mechanisms is a vital link to the ultimate goal of  the comprehension of some types of membrane function.  The transport of monovalent cations, such as Li+, Na+, and K+,  through cell membranes plays a key role in many different  physiological processes.  These processes involve the maintenance  of transmembrane potential, conduction of nerve impulses down the  axon and across the neuromuscular junction and the differentiation  and growth of cells.  There are relatively few physical techniques  available for the characterization of the interaction of monovalent  cations with biological molecules responsible for cation transport.   However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has proven  to be an exceptionally powerful technique for the study of the  transport process and the molecular systems responsible for the  transport.  NMR methods may be used to determine the 3-dimensional  structure of the channel, to determine the thermodynamic parameters  for the integration of transport system into membranes, to  determine the thermodynamic parameters for the binding  of the  cations to the channel and for determining the activation enthalpy  for the transport process.  %%%  The objectives for the requested funding period involve the use of  multinuclei multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, structure  determination through the use of NMR determined proton distance  restrained molecular dynamics/simulated annealing and peptide  synthesis to: (1) study the effect of single amino acid  substitution on channel structure, the integration into a membrane  as a channel, cation binding and transport in the channel system,  gramicidin.  The objective is to determine how the structure is  related to channel formation and selective monovalent cation  transport; (2) to obtain the structure of the model membrane bound  individual helical components of the pentameric helical bundle that  is related to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel.   Monovalent cation binding and transport selectivity will also be  investigated.  ***",
