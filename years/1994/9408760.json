Using a mixed-motive paradigm and face-to-face  interaction, the PIs have previously established a reliable  discontinuity. That is, repeated interactions of two people are  typically characterized by high rates of cooperation, whereas  group on group interactions typically produce high rates of  competition. Such discontinuity occurs even though competition  yields worse results than mutual cooperation. The past research  has provided evidence that such discontinuity between  interindividual and intergroup behavior is a very robust  phenomenon. It is explained partially by the greater tendency of  groups than individuals to distrust, or fear, each other and  partially by the fact that group members can provide each other  with social support for acting in a self-interested, or greedy,  manner whereas individuals have no way of obtaining such social  support. The present research has three foci which will identify:  (1) ways in which discontinuity can be reduced, by increasing the  cooperativeness of intergroup interactions, (2) individual  cognitive processes that support discontinuity,  and (3)  situational characteristics relating to the outcome domain that  is a necessary condition for the occurrence of discontinuity.       The violent resolution of intergroup conflict has plagued  the world for all of known history, and continues to this day.  Witness, for example, the intergroup conflicts in Bosnia and  Rwanda. The major focus of the proposed research is to identify  ways to decrease the competitiveness that is more characteristic  of intergroup relations than of interindividual relations. Past  research has demonstrated that such discontinuity between groups  and individuals is explained partially by the greater tendency of  grou ps than individuals to distrust, or fear, each other and  partially by the fact that group members can provide each other  with social support for acting in a self-interested manner. The  proposed research will attempt to identify ways of reducing this  discontinuity. Although a research tradition exists for reducing  the consequences of intergroup conflict by \"decategorizing\" the  participants' group affiliations, it is often not feasible or  even desirable to do this. Instead, cooperation between intact  groups will be induced by interventions that increase trust  without increasing vulnerability and that make group's more aware  of the long-term consequences of their actions. In order to  understand the conditions of applicability, the proposed research  will also attempt to identify the reasons for the distrust  between members of different groups, and the characteristic of  the social setting that is a necessary condition for the  occurrence of discontinuity. If the research is successful it  will be possible to specify the conditions under which  discontinuity will occur and the methods by which it can be  reduced.",
