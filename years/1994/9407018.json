Although Sahel seasonal precipitation is  associated with these waves, GCM studies of the interannual  variability of sub-Saharan rainfall have not explicitly considered  their influence.  The research is based on preliminary work which  found a reasonably realistic representation of African waves in the  GISS GCM.  The project will study wave behavior in the model at 4x5  degree and 2x2.5 degree horizontal resolution, and the relationship  between this modeled behavior and the principal circulation  features of the African summer monsoon, namely the tropical and  African Easterly Jets.  An archive of GCM simulations of some 10-20  summer seasons will be created from model runs forced with observed  global SST for selected years during the 1950's through the 1980's  (including years of anomalously sparse or abundant Sahel rainfall).   In addition, wave characteristics will be analyzed from an ensemble  of three equilibrium simulations with doubled CO2 concentration.   For each run, model winds and precipitation will be saved as six-  hour averages for grid boxes over northern Africa.  These data will  be used to construct wave composites of winds, divergence and  precipitation rates for different locations, months and years.   Power spectra of meridional wind and precipitation time series will  show the spectral peaks that are related to African wave  periodicities.  Cross-spectra will document the mutual correlations  of circulation and precipitation and spatial mapping of selected  spectral amplitudes will highlight the geographical areas of  preferred activity.  Interannual variations in the composites,  spectra, cross-spec tra and spatial and spatial distributions of  spectral amplitudes will reflect variability of wave behavior for  contrasting scenarios of drought and heavy precipitation and for  the warmer, double-CO2 climate.  Model results will be compared  with analyses of observations in the literature and with analyses  of time series of corresponding twice-daily observed ECMWF winds.    This research is import because it seeks to increase our ability to  simulate and predict climate variability.",
