 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404905  McAloon    This award provides funds to permit Drs. Kenneth McAloon and  Carol  Tretkoff, Department of Computer and Information Science,  Brooklyn College of The City University of New York, to pursue  with Dr. Geun Sik Jo, Department of Computer Science and  Engineering, Inha University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on constraint methods and inference engines  for expert systems.  The goal of this collaboration is to build a  new kind of programming tool for formulating and controlling the  solution of complex operations research and artificial  intelligence applications.  This project has three immediate  aims: (1) developing new algorithmic and logical control  strategies using 2LP (Linear Programming and Logic Programming),  MIP-Prolog (Mixed Integer Programming in Prolog), and related  systems, (2) linking rule-based programming and constraint-based  programming to achieve new advances in expert systems technology,  (3) making the underlying logical and mathematical compilation  more efficient, and (4) exploiting the knowledge representation  power of constraint programming to make this technology more  broadly applicable and usable.    The proposed research is at the confluence of several  disciplines: constraint logic programming, operations research,  artificial intelligence, mathematical logic, and distributed  computing.  This research will emphasize increasing both the  modeling power and the computational power of this technology in  order to include more varied and more challenging applications.   The collaborators have considerable complementary research  experience in the field of their proposed project.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  particip ation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No. CCR-9115603.  ***",
