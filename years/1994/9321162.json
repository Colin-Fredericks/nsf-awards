Formerly Yugoslavia's frontier with the West,  Slovenia declared its autonomy on June 26, 1991.  Economists have  been working throughout Eastern Europe to advance democracy and  market reforms, and in Slovenia the role of economists has risen  to prominence in unexpected ways.  The importance accorded to  these reforms and to the specialized knowledge used to define  them has allowed economists in Slovenia to emerge as a powerful  intellectual elite accorded a crucial role in the construction of  an independent and stable nation.  This study will examine their  role and analyze how their activities influence other spheres of  change.      Slovenia's transition has been considered thus far a success, due  to its relatively peaceful independence form Yugoslavia, its  successful preliminary economic reforms, and its current  political and economic stability.  This study will provide a rare  opportunity to probe the political and cultural aspects of the  construction and implementation of economic reforms, allowing for  a better understanding of the political, economic and cultural  changes redefining nations across Eastern Europe and the former  Soviet Bloc.  Preliminary research has been done to develop  contacts and arrangements in Ljubljana, and to review relevant  documents and conduct interviews at the World Bank and other  sources in Washington DC.  These funds will allow research in  Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, for a year, beginning in  March 1994.  ***",
