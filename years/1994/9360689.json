 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360689  Waight         The objective of this project is to improve the short-term  electrical load forecasts required for the efficient operation of  an electric utility by developing a technique to utilize a high  resolution atmospheric simulation model to generate information  about the variation of meteorological conditions over areas which  use a considerable amount of electrical energy (i.e. urban areas).   The current electrical load forecasting techniques utilize very low  resolution information generated by subjective modifications of  output from relatively coarse resolution operational forecast  models.         The Phase I research is designed to determine the ability of  a high resolution atmospheric dynamical model to provide the  information about the variation of meteorological conditions over  an urban area that is necessary to explain a greater portion of the  weather-related variance in electrical usage that can be done by  current techniques.  The central hypothesis of the proposed  research is that the variations in temperature associated with the  urban heat island should have a large impact on energy use and  electrical loads in large urban areas, which is unaccounted for by  current short-term load forecasting methods.  The PIs propose a  technique for simulating urban areas at high spatial resolution  which will be able to objectively predict the distribution of  atmospheric variables in an urban area, correctly determining the  magnitude of urban effects and quantitatively relating them to  energy use in a way which is operationally useful to electric  utilities.  ***",
