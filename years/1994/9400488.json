 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst  supports interactive research in three major groups with  emphasis on polymeric and bimolecular materials.    Researchers in the group investigating polymers in  restricted geometries seek to understand the behavior of  polymers at interfaces and in porous media.  This work is  motivated by the critical role of interfacial phenomena in  determining the performance of advanced materials.   The  group focusing on biomolecular materials aims to develop and  analyze well-defined artificial proteins and biodegradable  bacterial storage polyesters.   The group investigating  advanced polyolefins and blends proposes to develop new  synthesis and processing routes to high performance  materials based on simple olefins such as ethylene and  propylene.  This particular work is motivated by the  availability of a new generation of catalysts that enables  petroleum feedstocks to be converted directly into high  performance materials.    The MRSEC supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research  and  fosters research participation by undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is associated with an educational outreach program  with special emphasis on attracting and keeping women and  underrepresented minorities in science.   The Center for  UMass-Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP) provides  industrial liaison.  The MRSEC currently involves 24 senior  investigators,  3 postdoctoral research associates,  3  technical staff members,  21 graduate students, and 12  undergraduates.  The MRSEC at the University of  Massachusetts at Amherst  is directed by Professor David A.  Tirrell.",
