 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315333  Chu    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S.  scientists in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Quantum  Electronic Devices and States of Matter,  scheduled for August 1994 in Napa, California.   The co-organizers are Professor Steven Chu,  Department of Physics, Stanford University, and  Professor Tsutomu Yabuzaki, Department of  Physics, Kyoto University.  In addition to  participants from the United States and Japan,  scientists from France and Germany will attend  the meeting.    Research developments in atomic, molecular, and  optical (AMO) physics continues to develop at a  rapid pace.  In particular, newly developed  techniques to control and manipulate particles  such as atoms, ions, and micron sized particles  have caused much excitement both in the AMO  community and beyond.  These developments are  enabling the design and construction of a host of  fundamentally new instruments capable of  unprecedented sensitivity.  At the same time, the  methods are being used to study fundamental  interactions between matter and light, the  creation of new states of matter such as ionic  crystals, and better insights into the quantum  nature of the physical world.  The theme of the  meeting is the development of new quantum  electronic devices based on new understanding of  light/matter interactions and the application of  new AMO techniques to the creation of new states  of matter.  The seminar will emphasize the  interplay between basic research and the creation  of new devices and scientific instruments.  ***",
