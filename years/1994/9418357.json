 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418357  Bender  The aim of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive technology transfer program for integrating scalable parallel computing into US and strategic academic research.  Industry has very little knowledge of, or experience with, parallel computing and even in academia, parallel computing knowledge and expertise if limited.  The Metacenter Regional Alliance formed by this proposal will demonstrate the advantages of parallel processing and how to take advantage of this technology.     The Alliance will:    - develop and/or convert key industrial and scientific applications to parallel and heterogeneous computing environments in collaboration with industrial partners and academic users.      - take advantage of the similarities of Alliance computing resources and collaborate on code conversion and development projects to ease the burden of implementing parallel and heterogeneous computing systems.  The Alliance centers have similar Cray Y-MP/C90 and T3D systems of differing configurations that will allow users to better match applications needs with metacenter resources.  The T3D Showcase Applications will be used as a clear demonstration of the value of parallel computing for potential industrial users.    - the Alliance will evaluate Infrastructure Development needs in terms of the T3D and other parallel environments, data storage strategies for parallel computing, and identify industrial applications for conversion during years two and three. The results of infrastructure development planning will be shared with other HPCC users.    The alliance-wide focus on Cray T3D and vector architectures simplifies the sharing of software, expertise and training materials and the development of a well-focused, critical mass of expertise.",
