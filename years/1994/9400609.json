 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400609  Martin  This project supports the dissertation research of a  cultural anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University.  The  student will observe and interview workers in several  Department of Energy (DOE) sites where nuclear weapons are  dismantled and hazardous materials managed.  The project  will show how the cultural assumptions of workers affect  their conceptions of the value of their work.  Specific  hypotheses to be tested are that the conversion from weapons  to peaceful technology (from \"making weapons\", a masculine  activity, to \"cleaning up\", a feminine job) is seen by  workers as a feminization and deskilling of their activity.  Methods include formal interviews of active and retired  workers, to assess changes in interpretations of the work  over time, as well as interviews with administrators and  participant observation in community life.       This research is important because the transformation  from war-production to civilian goods involves changes in  the cultural context of the work place.  Increased  understanding of how workers conceptualize the value of  their work can help decision makers design programs of  increased efficiency.  ***",
