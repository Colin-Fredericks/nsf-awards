 "awd_abstract_narration": "Special laboratory equipment has been obtained for use in JMU's  newly formed College of Integrated Science and Technology. The  focus is on the freshman and sophomore years where engaging  students in the excitement of science is particularly important. A  special effort is being expended to attract more women and  minorities into science and science teaching careers.  The project  addresses the need to develop laboratory facilities in direct  support of the curriculum.  This is being done with an innovative  instructional approach that combines hands-on exercises with  specially prepared instructional technology units. The approach  promises better instructional quality, accommodates a wide range of  student preparation, reduces the need for large multiple station  labs, and insures the creation of an integrated laboratory  experience that can be adapted and used in other institutions.  Fewer student stations are required, because state-of-the-art  instructional technology is used to produce demonstrations that are  photo-recorded for interactive learning. A multimedia authoring  system is used to develop learning modules that familiarizes the  student with the experiment, the procedure, and the  instrumentation. The result not only enriches the laboratory  experience, but it also prepares the student to perform the  experiment without constant faculty supervision. Products of the  authoring system will be in the form of CD ROMs, video tapes,  interactive software packages, and/or presentation packages. The  authored experiments may also be disseminated to other schools and  for distance learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the program  is accomplished through a series of laboratory experiments in  environmental science, biology, modern physics, lasers and optics,  and automation.",
