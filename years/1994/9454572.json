 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seven community colleges in South Texas are planning for the  development of the South Texas Advanced Technological Education  Center in order to implement a new paradigm for teaching and  learning.  The project is ensuring an environment which fosters  inventive curricular revision and faculty development; increasing  the productivity of education and training by using computer-based  multimedia and telelearning systems; expanding resources for  innovations; empowering all faculty and students to learn how to  learn, and expanding collaboration between regional alliances.  The application of the paradigm is being accomplished through a  long-term, comprehensive, systematic restructuring process which  involves secondary school teachers; two-year and four-year college  and university faculty; administrators; practicing scientists and  engineers; business and industry representatives; community and  governmental agencies; and professional organizations.  The  following goals form the core initiatives of the South Texas  Advanced Technological Education Center: (a) develop of model  curricula which reflect both integration and application of  concepts within the real-life/work-related context of a dynamic  global society; (b) establish a faculty enhancement program which  provides faculty with development options so that they can become  the force behind curricular changes and innovations; (c) create a  student outreach and support program which recruits, retains, and  supports underrepresented populations for science, mathematics, and  technological careers; (d) broaden collaborative endeavors with  present partners and increase efforts to forge new regional  partnerships; and (e) support a teaching and learning environment  which incorporates state-of-the-art equipment for laboratories and  multimedia and telelearning technology in the classroom.",
