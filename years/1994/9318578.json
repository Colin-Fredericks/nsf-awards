The  Symposium will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, July 17-22,  1994. The scientific program will consist of 15 one-hour  Plenary Lectures, 10 one-half-hour Invited Lectures and two  poster sessions with as many as 300-400 posters. Participants  will be drawn from research institutions all over the world.  With photochemistry as the common theme, papers will be  presented which cover organic, inorganic, physical,  biochemical, polymer and industrial photochemistry.  %%%  This international symposium is a forum for discussion of  photochemistry broadly and will provide an environment for US  scientists to meet and hopefully establish collaborations with  foreign scientists, particularly Eastern European Scientists,  whom they would not likely otherwise contact. NSF support will  provide partial participant costs to young US investigators.  ***",
