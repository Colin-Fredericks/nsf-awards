The primary research objective of this project is to complete the development of a cross indexed Chinantec Spanish English lexical database and to produce from it (a) a published bilingual Chinantec Spanish Spanish Chinantec dictionary, for use by both the Palantla Chinantec speaking and academic communities, and (b) a trilingual, Chinantec Spanish English electronic version specifically designed for the academic community. The completed trilingual version of the lexicon will be made available to language database distribution systems such as are being developed at various Universities. The provisional markup conventions now being used by the PI will be made to conform to standard guidelines for lexical markup currently being designed by the Text Encoding Initiative when they are ready.           From the point of view of scholarship, this research should be done to provide a complete and well rounded recorded record of an important Native American language. A considerable quantity of documentation of the language and culture has been assembled, but lexical information remains scanty. It is important that several of the extant Chinantec languages receive such documentation while the languages are viable and experienced scholars are available to assist in documentation . From a humanitarian point of view, the scholarly community has an obligation to share its resources in ways that benefit the human subjects they depend upon in the pursuit of the academic objectives. The provision of a document as valuable as a bilingual dictionary to a marginalized community such as the Palantla Chinantec, is in its own right ample motivation to do this work.",
