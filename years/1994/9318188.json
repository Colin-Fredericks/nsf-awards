 "awd_abstract_narration": "To contribute to the knowledge on uncommon and rare insect herbivores, which are poorly understood, eight species of sawflies will be studies in a landscape defined by the watershed of Rio de Flag, Arizona. These sawflies are particularly valuable subjects for study because they all leave characteristic damage which can be found and recorded, and even cryptic species can be discovered by their damage. The distribution and abundance of these species in space and time will be studied for three years in natural populations on scales of the landscape, host plant populations, and host individuals. Experiments will examine female sawfly behavior to determine site preference (plant species, age, and growth rate) and its impact on larval performance. These experiments will provide mechanistic explanation for the distribution and abundance of sawflies in the field to the extent that the bottom-up forces through plant quality, to female behavior and larval survival, are important. Top-down effects from carnivores on the distribution and abundance of sawflies will also be examined in natural populations and experiments.   %%%  With the understanding gained from this research on uncommon and rare insect herbivores, the PI can develop a theory on why species such as these sawflies remain uncommon, and ultimately to gain understanding on why some insect herbivore species become very abundance and outbreak species that reach the status of pests.",
