Walton, Chemistry Department, Purdue University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for an investigation of the redox reactivity of rhenium polyhydrides and compounds containing rhenium-rhenium triple bonds. The mechanism of reductive coupling reactions induced by the Re-Re triple bond and the reactivity of complexes containing the 3-metallafuran ring will be examined. The reactions of rhenium-heptahydrides with various organic acids will be explored as routes to stereochemically rigid 8-coordinate molecules. The unusual isomerization of internal to terminal alkynes which occurs in some of the hydride systems will be utilized to prepare rhenium-alkylidyne complexes.    A portion of this project is aimed at developing the ability of compounds which contain two directly bonded rhenium atoms to supply electrons to small molecules such as carbon monoxide. The addition of these electrons will cause the small molecules to bond to one another, or to other nearby molecules, thereby forming more exended structures. Such behavior is important in both industrial and laboratory processes. In the second part of the research, rhenium compounds surrounded by 8 other groups will be prepared. These very crowded molecules are expected to be capable of inducing a number of new reactions in molecules with which they interact.",
