In  addition to five hours of weekly lecture material, CS16 students  participate in a two hour weekly lab. The practical experience  gained in the laboratory activities is an essential component of  the course. The proposed laboratory would be used for the  development and implement of new course lab activities.  Currently  the department is revising the course's content to integrate  multimedia computing, data visualization, and networking concepts.  A basic understanding of these concepts is essential for our  graduates who enter careers in science, industry, education,  government, and the professions. All of these fields will  experience significant changes as a result of the rapid growth of  digital information technologies. This curriculum development  effort represents a significant upgrading of the traditional  undergraduate literacy course in computing. Consequently, it serves  as a potential model for other computer science departments who are  seeking ways to make this \"bread and butter\" service course more  relevant, more exciting, and more useful for their students. We  expect to publish course materials (a textbook with accompanying  disk containing laboratory activities is already under contract) to  enhance this potential.",
