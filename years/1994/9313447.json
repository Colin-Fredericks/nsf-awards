 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown    The Department of Agricultural Engineering, Oklahoma State University, is recognized as  one of the nation's leaders in Biosystems Engineering research, the application of engineering  principles to biological systems.  While agriculture remains an integral aspect of the research  program, Biosystems  includes environmental, natural resources and biological applications.   To reflect this broader scope, the Department will be renamed Biosystems and Agricultural  Engineering.  In addition to the programmatic changes, the facilities housing ongoing  research activities will be renovated and replaced to complement the new priorities of the  Department as it completes its transformation to Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.    Existing facilities were built in an era when agricultural mechanization research primarily  involved the construction of heavy mechanisms and soil and water research.  These facilities  are inadequate to perform Biosystems research that requires high quality labs with special  provisions. This award will provide funding for the modernization of laboratory space that  will allow for the proper support of programs in machine vision, sensors and controls,  intelligent machines and bioenvironmental engineering.  The relocation of the shop facility to  the main campus will be adjoined to the research laboratory, providing more effective and  efficient shop services for faculty.  Specific renovations will include upgrading the HVAC,  electrical, and mechanical systems.  The modernization of the research facilities at Oklahoma  State University will have maximum impact on the human resources needed for the nation's  continued leadership in science and engineering into the twenty-first century.",
