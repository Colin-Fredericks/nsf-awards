 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405784   Bralower       This project is designed to test several hypotheses regarding  climate dynamics of, and marine biotic response to, gradual and  abrupt global warming in the late Paleocene and early Eocene (ie.,  across the Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary).  We have collected  closely spaced sediment samples from across this boundary at two  holes of site 865, atop Allison Guyot in the western equatorial  Pacific Ocean.  Our primary objectives are to establish late  Paleocene through middle Eocene changes in tropical sea surface  temperature and thermocline structure, vertical carbon isotope  distributions, net productivity, bottom water redox conditions (as  recorded by benthic foraminifera), and the effect of these changes  on micro-organism evolution.  To this end, we will reconstruct at  high resolution: 1) carbon and oxygen isotope records from several  species of planktonic (surface and deep dwelling) and benthic  foraminifera, 2) quantitative planktonic and benthic foraminiferal  assemblage records, 3) quantitative nannofossil assemblage records,  and 4) an integrated chemobiostratigraphic record.  Our overall  intent is to develop a better understanding of the environmental  dynamics of the tropical oceans during periods of rapid global  warming.  Our comprehensive, multi-parameter data set will be  integrated in existing data sets from mid and high latitudes,  alleviate the lack of data from the tropical Pacific, and help  define    the boundary conditions for global climate  reconstructions and modeling.  We will investigate  the biological  and chemical consequences of the largest disturbance of the global  carbon cycle in the last 90 million years,   and its affect on  tropical climate.  By defining the physical, chemical, and  biological responses of the tropical ocean to the rapid global  warming at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, we can test hypotheses  relating to the stability of tropical SST, and address the paradox  in modeling early Eocene climate: warm high latitudes  (requiring  high heat transport from the low to the high latitudes), at low  temperature gradients and low overall wind speeds (thus no  mechanism for the high heat transport).",
