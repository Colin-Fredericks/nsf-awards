 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jordan             This award funds the research of Professor Bruce Jordan  into the Hecke structure of Shimura varieties.  Recent advances  in crystalline cohomology make it possible to control the action  of inertia on p-adic cohomology groups of varieties over  unramified extensions with good reduction over the rational  p-adic field.  Prof. Jordan expects to apply these techniques to  Shimura varieties.             This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic   geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,   algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the   plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number   theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as   divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,  seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from   the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual   influence has increased greatly. The result has been an increased  understanding of both areas of mathematics. ***",
