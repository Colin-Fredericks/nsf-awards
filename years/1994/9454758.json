The study's planning  focus will be on the use of Viacom's Castro Valley experimental  cable system as a test bed for developing models for using  interactive cable to support education reform, for developing  products and tools, for evaluating the long-term impact of the  system on home and classroom learning, and for assessing the  sustainability of providing educational products and services  through interactive cable. SRI proposes:         To determine the current and future educational and learning       needs of three sets of consumers in Castro Valley: students;       school district teachers, principals, and administrators; and       parents and other community users.         To identify prospective matches between technological  advances       offered by the Viacom system and those educational and  learning       needs.         Through systematic analyses, to specify educational products       and services that (1) match the needs of the consumers, (2)  are       in accord with Viacom's overall mission to the community, and       (3) are sustainable.         To develop strategies for effective implementation of       educational products and services over time, including       preliminary recommendations on rate structure issues.    These outcomes will be achieved through a series of activities  including  a needs assessment, a review of relevant literature, and a 2-day  Innovation Search Workshop. During the w orkshop approximately 20  participants - including persons from Castro Valley schools, the  community, and Viacom - will, through a series of workshop  exercises,  focus on the needs indicated by the needs assessment, and freely  generate  ideas.  The set of ideas will then be converted by the group into  a  smaller set of usable and structured ideas and concepts and finally  reduced to a small number of concrete ideas for viable, useful  educational products and services.    Products from the project will include the results of the  literature  search, the Innovation Search Workbook, the innovation search  results, a  summary report of project activities, and a detailed plan for the  work to  be undertaken in Phase 2 of the project. The plan will include a  description on how SRI proposes to explore the role of the network  in  support of educational reform and innovation and to assess its  impacts on  classroom, home, and community learning patterns.",
