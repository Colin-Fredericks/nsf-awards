 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417468  Datye    The primary objective of this research is to study the effects of  grain size on the phase transitions and dielectric properties of  important dielectric and electrostrictive materials including:  barium titanate, lead titanate, and lead magnesium niobate.  The  research is being performed jointly between the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Microengineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico and the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics at  Rutgers University.  Precursor powders, with controlled  microstructures and chemical purity and nanosized dimensions, are  being produced via a novel aerosol decomposition process at the  University of New Mexico.  The powders are characterized using  spectroscopy, microscopy, and surface area techniques.   Processing techniques being employed include dry pressing,  hot  isostatic pressing, and doctor blade tape casting.  Densification  behavior will be studied using dilatometry.   The dielectric  properties are being characterized also.    This joint effort is a natural collaboration , as it utilizes the  strengths of each institution, and results in more than the sum  of the output for each working separately.  The research is very  timely for the electronic ceramics industry.  The results of this  research will be of use to manufacturers of thin film multilayer  electrostatic/piezoelectric devices.    Additional funding is provided to augment the ongoing research  program and provided for a membership in the Center with funds  provided by the U.S. Department of Air Force, Kirtland AFB.    The Program Manager recommends the University of New Mexico be  awarded $75,000 for 36 months through a \"TIE\" project with  Rutgers University.  An additional $29,448 is recommended for one  year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Air Force,  Kirtland, AFB.",
