 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404058  Thomas    Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is important to industry since it  is a means to assure safety, product quality and a company's image.   Advances in the interdisciplinary scientific areas that make up NDE  can have a direct effect on improving productivity and profits.    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Nondestructive Evaluation was started in 1985 to develop a research  program thru industry/university interaction.  Wayne State  University plans to become an addition to this Iowa State  University Center expanding its research base.    This award provides funding for a planning meeting at Wayne State  University to determine if sufficient industrial support can be  developed for merging the two research programs.    The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally  recognized experts in their fields.  The Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation and its  industry members have concurred in this proposal plan.    This proposal has been coordinated with Dr. Cheena Srinivasan,  Program Manager, Division of Design and Manufacturing,  Manufacturing Machines & Equipment.    The Program Manager recommends Wayne State University be awarded  $9,880 for 6 months for a planning meeting.",
