The approach emphasizes learning and teaching through  investigation, critical reasoning and problem solving.  To  achieve these goals New York University plans to 1) develop a  collaborative relationship with the City University of New  York, several science museums and pubic colleges in the city,  and a school district.  2) initiate a pilot program for  teaches in training that will involve the formation of a team  mentoring group, 3) review current course offerings for those  preparing to be teachers, and 4) enhance the participation of  science faculty through workshops.  ***",
