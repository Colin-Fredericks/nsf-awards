 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nancy Makri is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue her research in the   development of propagator path integral methodology.  Makri is using this   theory to treat systems with few quantum degrees of freedom in a heat   bath where the bath degrees of freedom can be treated classically.  This   is accomplished by expanding the time evolution operator in truncated   basis sets and results in propagators that are valid over large time   increments and which do not suffer from the usual highly oscillatory   behavior.  Proposed applications include hydrogen transfer reactions in   (and on) solids, tunneling, and non-adiabatic hopping probabilities of   quantum particles.    A great deal of progress has been made in the theoretical treatment of   gas phase chemical reactions of systems consisting of relatively few   atoms.  Using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, it is now possible to   explain a great deal of the experimental detail for such systems.    However, the large majority of reactions which are of interest to   chemists occur in condensed phase systems in the presence of solvent.    The theoretical models for treating such complex systems are in a much   earlier stage of development.  Makri is developing new theoretical   approaches for dealing with solvated chemical systems undergoing chemical   reactions where quantum effects may be important.",
