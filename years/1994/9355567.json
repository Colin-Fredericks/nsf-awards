Technology, Discovery, and Communication in Secondary School  Mathematics    This 2-year project features two cycles of a 1-year professional  development program, reaching a total of 52 in-service mathematics  teachers and 8 graduate/undergraduate students in mathematics  education at the University of North Florida.  The programs focuses  on preparing the participants to introduce: (1) classroom uses of  computers and graphing calculators; (2) learning through discovery,  problem-solving, and group effort; and (3) writing as an essential  part of the mathematics curriculum.  Each program consists of:  (Summer 1) a 4-week summer institute focusing on Algebra/Pre-  Calculus/Calculus; (School Year) monthly meetings to discuss  classroom implementation of new lessons and teaching techniques,  critique samples of student work, etc.;  (Summer 2) an institute  focusing on General Math/Algebra I/Geometry.  Three participants  from the first-year program are selected to serve as adjunct  instructors for the second program cycle.  The 52 teachers  particpating in the program are expected to impact some 200  additional teachers in their home schools and districts; the  student participants are expected to use the experience as a basis  for dissertations and/or research papers.     Cost sharing is 30% of the NSF contribution.",
