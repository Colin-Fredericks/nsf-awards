Several damage indices have  been proposed and are being used in the earthquake  engineering community.  However, these are based on  initiative rationale and unverified assumptions.  This  project will examine the applicability and consistency of  various currently used damage indices based on experimental  work.  Several specimens will be prepared, both with  symmetric and asymmetric lateral load deformation  characteristics, and tested under monotonic, cyclic and  randomly sequenced cyclic loadings.  The calculated damage  indices will be compared with the observed values.  If the  currently used damage indices are found inadequate to  represent the experimentally observed behavior, the new  methods to calculate damage indices will be developed.  ***",
