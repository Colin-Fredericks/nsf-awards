Participants will include health researchers, basic scientists, federal agency personnel, legislators, health care providers, educators, and the media. This conference has three objectives: 1) To critically review current research and theory on psychosocial and behavioral factors in women's health; 2) to evaluate implications of psychosocial research for disease prevention and health promotion across the life span of women; 3) to translate research on psychosocial and behavioral issues into community-based initiatives and interventions promoting women's health. Keynote addresses, panel discussions, and poster sessions will focus on: a) theoretical models/frameworks for conceptualizing women's health; b) issues in research methodology, measurement, and evaluation; c) new research on psychosocial and behavioral factors in women's health; d) implications of psychological factors in treatment, health policy, interventions; and e) special issues of underserved populations",
