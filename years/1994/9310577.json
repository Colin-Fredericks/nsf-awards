Cycles of production in this region are driven by  the  ocean's response to monsoon winds and therefore exhibit large and  regular  seasonal  oscillations,  During  the  southwest  monsoon  season   (June-September  inclusive),  primary  productivity   is  maximal owing to strong winds which not only cause the uplift  of  deep  water rich in nutrients, but also deliver aeolian  dust  to  the  surface layer of this tropical ocean.  During the  northeast  monsoon  (October-November inclusive) and  intermonsoon  periods,  primary productivity is markedly reduced.  A major rationale  for  the  choice  of the Arabian Sea as a process study  site  is  the  strong  and seasonally reversing physical forcing of the  region.  It is safe to say no investigator working in this program will be  able to properly interpret her/his data without understanding the  physical   regime.  For an expedition of the scale  of  the  U.S.  JGOFS  Arabian Sea Process Study, 9 cruises spread over an annual  monsoon  cycle,  it is necessary to provide a consistent  set  of  measurements  of  the  background density,  tracer  and  nutrient  fields.   These  data  are  crucial for  the  interpretation  and  resolution  of  the  seasonally changing, background  mean  flows  which  are  the  setting  for the more  specialized  pelagic  and  benthic  studies of the expedition.  These measurements are  also  needed  to estimate the transport of nutrients into the  euphotic  zone  and to provide insight into the chemical constraints placed  upon  physiological  processes.   This project  will  provide  the  basic, background observational program which will include  ship-  based   measurement  of  depth-resolved  temperature,   salinity,  nutrients, oxygen, and currents.  The methods to be employed will  be  standardized and consistent throughout the expedition,  using  protocols  already established either by U.S. JGOFS or U.S.  WOCE  or  protocols  agreed  upon  by all investigators  prior  to  the  beginning of the expedition.  ***",
