Most cells contain many types of G protein-  coupled receptors, a host of G protein subtypes, and  numerous effectors.  The ability to respond to a given  agonist with activation of the appropriate range of effector  enzymes may be controlled by subcellular localization of  signaling pathways, variable activation of G protein  subtypes and effectors by receptors, by modulation of the  levels of expression of components of the various signaling  pathways, or most likely, a combination of these and other  measures.  We have extensively characterized the kinetics of  muscarinic receptor-mediated activation of an inwardly  rectifying K+ channel in bullfrog atrium via a pertussis  toxin-sensitive G protein, Gk1, and have developed a minimal  model for regulation of muscarinic K+ current activation and  desensitization.  With the recent cloning of the muscarinic  K+ channel (GIRK1), we now have the means to test the  hypotheses derived from studies in intact myocytes by  expression of the complete signal transduction pathway (m2  muscarinic receptor, inhibitory G proteins and GIRK1) in a  heterologous system.  The experiments in this proposal will  yield significant new information about the protein-protein  interactions involved in G protein-mediated signal  transduction.  We will examine muscarinic K+ current  activation in a heterologous mammalian expression system,  which will allow kinetic analysis of G protein-channel  interactions with high time resolution, under conditions in  which the levels of expression of the various components in  the signal transduction pathway are known.  We will also  make GIRK1 - IRK1 chimeras, by exchanging the conduction  pore regions, to examine the r ole of cytoplasmic domains in  channel gating.  These chimeric molecules will be  transiently expressed in the mammalian cell line containing  m2 mAChR, to assess the functional consequences of the  cytoplasmically-localized domains on channel gating.  The  techniques implemented during the accomplishment of these  two aims will establish the approaches which can be used for  a more extensive examination of the role of protein -  protein interactions in membrane signaling.  %%%  Cells are capable of responding to a variety of signals  carried by small molecules which bind to specific receptors  on their surface membranes.  The mechanisms by which these  events at the cell surface are translated into appropriate  alterations in cell function are the focus of this study.  Many distinct receptors have been identified, and a large  number of them interact with a family of \"signal  transducing\" proteins, called G proteins, which carry the  signal from receptor to the appropriate enzyme which must be  activated or inhibited.  The ability to respond to a  specific small molecule (agonist) with activation of the  appropriate enzyme is a complicated process which may be  regulated in a variety of ways.  We have extensively  characterized the kinetics of activation by acetylcholine of  an inwardly rectifying K+ channel in bull frog atrium.  This  ion channel has  now been cloned, which permits us to insert  this signal transduction pathway into a cell type which does  not normally contain it, and to study it under controlled  conditions.  The experiments in this proposal will yield  significant new information about the interactions involved  in G protein-mediated signal transduction.  We will examine  how channel activation is regulated in a well-controlled  system in which the amounts of each protein in the signaling  pathway are known.  We will also examine the role of various  regions of the channel molecule in the activation process by  producing hybrid channels in which various regions are  intercha nged with similar, but distinctly regulated channel  types.  The techniques implemented during the accomplishment  of these two aims will establish the approaches which can be  used for a more extensive examination of the role of protein  - protein interactions in membrane signaling.  ***",
