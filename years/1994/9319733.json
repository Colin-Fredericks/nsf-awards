Pterocarpans exist as either of two stereoisomers  in nature although the (-) isomer is more common.  Recent results  suggest that the biosynthesis of (+) pisatin and (-) pterocarpans  share an intermediate that has a (-) chirality.  Synthesis of (+)  pisatin is also unusual in that the oxygen on one of its asymmetric  carbons derives from H2O, whereas the oxygen on the analogous  carbon of (-) pterocarpans is derived from O2.  These observations  imply that fundamentally different mechanisms establish the  chirality and incorporation of oxygen in (+) pisatin compared to  the (-) pterocarpans.  Genes that encode the enzymes which produce  the (-) chirality intermediate and the putative terminal step in  pisatin biosynthesis have been cloned.  These genes, and the  enzymes they encode, will be used to resolve the origin of  chirality in (+) pisatin by combining traditional tracer studies  and biochemical analyses with the production of transgenic pea  tissue lacking each of these enzymes.  Such experiments should  establish conclusively whether the enzymes are involved in pisatin  biosynthesis and, if so, will subsequently be used to identify the  novel steps in this pathway.  Furthermore, this work will define an  experimental system in which the biological function of this  phytoalexin can be delineated.  %%%  Many plants synthesize antibiotics, called phytoalexins, in  response to microbial infection.  Production of these antimicrobial  compounds is believed to be one mechanism used by plants to defend  against disease.  The objective of this grant proposal is to  identify the biochemical steps involved in the production of the  phytoalexin pisatin made by garden pea.  We will use standard  biochemical procedures in addition to making specific mutations in  suspected steps to characterize the pathway.  The information  gained f rom this research may eventually be used to clone genes  involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.  The cloned genes  could be used to engineer new biosynthetic pathways in plants with  the goal of augmenting the plant's disease resistance mechanisms.  This research program is funded jointly by the Metabolic  Biochemistry Program, Division of Molecular & Cellular Biosciences,  and the Integrative Plant Biology Program, Division of Integrative  Biology and Neuroscience.  ***",
