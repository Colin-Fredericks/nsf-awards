 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318744  Sanchez    There are two broad areas of research:  polymer equations of state  and the interaction of polymers with compressed fluids.  Previously  funded National Science Foundation research has shown that the  compression response of polymers, solvents, and polymer solutions  to hydrostatic pressure satisfies a strong corresponding states  principle.  This work will be used as a basis to develop a new  universal equation of state for polymers that will be nearly as  accurate as experimental data.  Related computer simulations (Monte  Carlo) will also be carried out.  A search for other universal  features of polymer thermodynamics will also be pursued.  A  specific objective is to determine what thermodynamic properties of  a polymer solution in the vicinity of the lower critical solution  temperature phase boundary are universal.  The latter will require  pressure volume temperature and cloud point measurements at  temperatures approaching the critical temperature of the solvent.    Previously funded National  Science Foundation research has also  shown that the solubility of supercritical carbon dioxide in a  polymer can be modeled.  In addition, a semi-quantitative  prediction of the variation of the glass temperature with carbon  dioxide is possible.  The simultaneous control of both kinetics and  solubility raises the possibility of a new route to morphological  control in certain types of polymer blends.  In principle, using  carbon dioxide as a common diluent for an immiscible polymer pair,  followed by controlled removal of the carbon dioxide can yield an  interesting variety of morphological structures.              Polymer physical properties are ultimately related to interactions.   Equation of state properties such as density, thermal expansion  coefficient, isothermal compressibility, etc. are intimately  related to polymer self-interaction.  Miscibility of polymer pairs  depends sensitively on the polymer-polymer interaction.  The  solubility of a polymer in a solvent or  the solubility of a gas in  a polymer depends on the small molecule-polymer interaction  The  goal in the research is to contribute towards this understanding.   It builds on previously supported National Science Foundation work  and involves a combination of experiments, computer simulations,  and theory.  ***",
