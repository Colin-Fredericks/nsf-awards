 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404771  Abstract  Clues to the mechanisms of long distance activation have come from  the gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila.  Several naturally-  occurring mutations are gypsy insertions into gene control regions.   The unique feature of these mutations is that the enhancers that  are promoter-distal to gypsy do not activate transcription while  enhancers promoter-proximal to gypsy still function.  This  position-dependent blocking of enhancers by gypsy is suppressed by  mutations in the suppressor of Hairy-wing  su(Hw)  gene.  The  su(Hw) gene encodes a zinc finger protein (SUHW) that binds to  gypsy DNA.  Only the SUHW-binding region of gypsy is required to  block enhancers, demonstrating that SUHW is the enhancer-blocking  agent.  SUHW can be used, therefore, to investigate enhancer-  promoter interactions.  It is postulated that SUHW interacts with  the factors that support long distance interactions between  enhancer-binding factors and the promoter.  Gypsy insertion alleles  of cut partially suppressed by leaky su(Hw) alleles have  intermediate cut wing phenotypes.  Mutations in other genes that  modulate these intermediate phenotypes will be generated and  mapped.  Both dominant suppressor and enhancer mutations that are  not su(Hw) or cut alleles have been isolated in preliminary  experiments.  These mutations will be tested for the ability to  modulate other SUHW-blocked transcription enhancers.  Genes that  modulate the activity of more than one gypsy-blocked enhancer  without affecting expression of su(Hw) will be cloned after  generating breakpoint or P element insertion alleles.  The effects  of the mutations on gypsy insertion allele phenotypes, additional  phenotypes associated with the mutations, and the identities of the  encoded products will be used to assess the roles of the genes in  long distance activation and to formulate molecular models.  %%%  Many genes in higher eukaryotic organisms contain control regions  with multiple enhancers that activate transcription in dif ferent  tissues and stages of development.  In some cases, enhancers are  many kilobases away from the promotor.  The ability to activate  over such long distances is not an intrinsic property of the  activator proteins and promoters.  We will characterize this  phenomenon in the fruit fly, Drosophila, by finding appropriate  mutants and analyzing their effects on long distance activation of  genes.  ***",
