 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408830  Crooke       Bacterial DNA replication is carefully controlled at  the initiation stage , possibly by the regulation of the  essential activity of DnaA protein.  The cellular membrane  has long been hypothesized to be involved in chromosomal  replication, with accumulating evidence that indicates that  membranes have a profound influence on DnaA protein.  Escherichia coli membrane liposomes can convert an inert  form of purified DnaA protein into a replicatively active  form.  Characterization of the membranes has identified  fluidity and acidic phospholipids as essential features.  The importance of membrane fluidity for this activation has  been seen in vitro, and for DNA replication in vivo.  The long term goal of this research is to  elucidate  the  physiological significance of the influence of membranes on  chromosomal replication.  To directly test the hypothesis  that membranes participate in the regulation of DnaA protein  activity, the following specific objectives were addressed:  1.  Subcellular localization of the DnaA protein.  Localize  DnaA protein within the cell by subcellular fractionation  and electron microscopic immuno-thin sectioning.  Determine  whether a flux in the cellular location of DnaA protein  between the membranes and the cytosol occurs during the cell  cycle and with different growth conditions, and whether such  a change is a means of regulating DnaA protein activity.  2,  Replication activities of membrane bound DnaA protein.  Investigate the initiation activities of chromosomal origin  recognition, strand opening and prepriming complex formation  by membrane -bound DnaA protein.  Examine how these  activities are altered when compared to those known for  soluble DnaA protein  to gain insight into how membranes  influence DnaA protein.  3.  Initiation of DNA synthesis in  cells with altered levels of acidic phospholipids.  Examine  the ability of liposomes prepared from cell having varied  ;levels of acidic phospholipids to rejuvenate DnaA protein.  C orrelate the rejuvenation activity with initiation rates in  vivo.  Determine whether constitutively stable DNA  replication alleviates the growth arrest of acidic  phospholipid defiant cells.  %%%  This work should provide insight into the regulation of the  initiation of DNA replication, which is a key control point  in the prokaryotic cell cycle and in the determination of  eucaryotic cellular quiescence proliferation.  Therefore,  results of this work may be applied toward other, higher  organisms as this proved to be the case with other aspects  of cellular events.    ***",
