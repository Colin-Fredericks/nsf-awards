 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT          Funding is requested in the amount of $700,000 toward the purchase of a 17.6 Tesla NMR  magnet and toward the design and construction of an accompanying NMR console. The 750 MHz. NMR console that we propose to construct, will be capable of performing the wide variety of NMR experiments required by the research programs of the participating faculty. These experiments include: homonuclear two dimensional experiments like NOESY and ECOSY, used by Brian Reid's group to study nucleic acids solution structure, heteronuclear multi-dimensional experiments like HMQC-NOESY, used by Rachel Klevit's group to study the structure of proteins, protein-protein and protein-nucleic acids complexes, solid state NMR techniques like deuterium wide line NMR, Rotational Resonance (R2) and RFDR, used by Gary Drobny's group to study the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids and of very large nucleic acid-protein complexes, and high resolution tritium NMR, used by Michael Heinekey's group to study the kinetics of inorganic metal hydride complexes and by Heinz Floss' group to study the structure of natural products and metabolites.        For the groups of Klevit, Drobny, and Reid, which use NMR as a primary tool for probing  molecular structure, the need for higher field is driven mainly by a requirement for higher sensitivity.  A common theme running through all three programs is the interest in studying the structure of nucleic acids and proteins in complexes. However, protein-nucleic acid complexes are notoriously insoluble, hence the need for higher sensitivity to study very low concentrations of complexes in solution. Solid state NMR experiments have been used by the Drobny group to measure internuclear distances in labeled nucleic acids, making possible the study of DNA and RNA structure in very large complexes with proteins, but a number of important solid state NMR experiments, i.e. multiple quantum experiments, are simply too low in s ensitivity to be practical for use in large complexes of biopolymers. We estimate that the factor of roughly 2.8 improvement in sensitivity will greatly expand the domain of molecular size that we can study using such methods. In addition, a number of other faculty will find a 750 MHz. spectrometer useful or crucial for their research programs. These faculty include: David Baker, who studies protein folding, needs high sensitivity NMR instrumentation because folding intermediates are very insoluble. Pat Stayton, who studies bio-materials, requires high sensitivity NMR equipment to study the solution structure of the 13000 molecular weight protein Streptavidin, which is an important component in biosensors, and which tetramerizes in solution. J. Michael Schurr, who plans to study the solution dynamics of high molecular weight DNA, also requires high field NMR instrumentation.        The University of Washington is qualified to carry of the development of high field NMR  instrumentation. Three NMR spectrometers have been designed and built since 1985 including: two 500 MHz. consoles (both capable of performing high resolution and solid state NMR experiments), and a 400 MHz. solid state NMR spectrometer (used primarily for high speed magic angle sample spinning experiments). In addition, the U.W. has recently received a contract from Battelle's Pacific Northwest Lab to design, prototype, and construct a 900-1000 MHz. NMR for the DOE-funded Environmental and Molecular Sciences Laboratory. The design work for the 900-1000 MHz. NMR console is already in progress, and can be easily adapted to a 750 MHz. console. Finally, a collaborative effort is planned with Resonance Research Inc., aimed at applying matrix shim technology to produce pulsed field gradients for multi-dimensional NMR experiments and micro-imaging. In the first phase of this planned effort, we will attempt to use matrix technology to produce pulsed gradients in an 11.75 Tesla magnet. Applications to higher field systems will follow.",
