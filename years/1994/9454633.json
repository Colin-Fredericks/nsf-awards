 "awd_abstract_narration": "Native American Tribal environments have often historically been  neglected; and tribes have inadequate resources and expertise to  deal with cleanup and prevention of further pollution.  Because  tribes need to know how to measure and analyze their own  environmental risks, a technologically educated and trained Native  American environmental work force is needed.  This project is using  existing resources to create and transfer an interdisciplinary  environmental technology associate degree curriculum for tribal  colleges and other community colleges with roles in educating  American Indians.  It is also providing faculty enhancement,  instructional materials, and a rotating equipment program.  The  curriculum focuses on those technologies used for environmental  monitoring, site assessment, solid waste management, and pollution  prevention, as these are the prominent environmental issues facing  tribal lands.  From incorporation of support disciplines  (mathematics, science, communications), students are developing  analytical skills for situations for which they are not  specifically trained.  Mesa State College, Navajo Community  College, and Northern New Mexico Community College are the resource  colleges, each with different established environmental technology  programs.  The pilot group of tribal and tribally related colleges  are Navajo Community College, Northern New Mexico Community  College, Crownpoint Institute of Technology and Southwest Indian  Polytechnic Institute.  Two additional tribal colleges may be  added.  The project methodology is interactive, using workshops,  site visits, iterative writing/review, and hands-on training.  The  tribal colleges are part of the process from the beginning and will  take ownership of the curriculum.  Baseline data on the tribal  colleges will be gathered and progress will be evaluated over a  three-year period.",
