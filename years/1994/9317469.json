 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317469  Driever    The organisms best suited to study fundamental principles of  vertebrate development should allow the application of large  numbers of  different experimental approaches: classical  genetic analysis, experimental embryology, and molecular  genetics, especially the generation of transgenic animals.  Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio), a small tropical freshwater  teleost, is most amenable to the former two approaches, but  methods for controlled and efficient generation of germline  transgenic zebrafish have not been developed. The objective  of the proposed research is to optimize methods for the  infection of zebrafish germline cells with retroviruses  which are pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus  (VSV) G glycoprotein. Preliminary experiments have  demonstrated that the VSV-G protein broadens the host range  of murine leukemia virus derived vectors to zebrafish cells  and other non-mammalian hosts. These methods will be applied  to perform insertional mutagenesis screens in zebrafish to  identify novel genes that are important for pattern  formation and organogenesis in the embryo. Specific aim 1 is  to optimize conditions for infection of zebrafish germline  cells with VSV-G pseudotyped murine leukemia virus-derived  vectors and to study germline transmission of integrated  DNA. Specific aim 2 is to construct viral vectors for a)  cell marking experiments to allow high resolution lineage  analysis in the developing embryo, b) over expression of  known proteins to study their function in development, and  c) gene transfer of cloned zebrafish genes back into  zebrafish hosts mutant for developmental regulator genes to  allow tests for complementation. Specific aim 3 is to  construct promoter trap and enhancer trap retroviral vectors  and to perform initial screens for expression patterns that  might reveal integration of the virus into developmental  control genes. Retroviral vectors are superior to other  means of insertional mutagenesis because of the defined  s tructure of the integrated DNA, and the high efficiency at  which the vector is delivered into the host cells. Because  the VSV-G pseudotyped vectors infect a broad range of host  cells including fish, Xenopus laevis, and insect cells, the  methods and vectors developed during this project can also  be applied to other non-mammalian developmental systems.  ***",
