 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze three sets of major  policy issues in education: 1) the distribution of education  resources, 2) the distribution of educational outcomes, 3) and  the distribution of the benefits of education reform.  Regarding  the distribution of educational resource, special attention will  be paid to the move in recent years to equalize school  expenditures across taxing jurisdictions.  The questions to be  addressed include to what extent has the inequality of spending  been reduced, and what evidence is there that changing the  distribution of spending has had important education benefits.  With respect to the second issue, the distribution of educational  outcomes has changed significantly over the past 25 years. For  example, the gap between black and white test scores and high  school graduation rates has narrowed sharply.  Special attention    will be focused on the determinants of these patterns.  The third  issue of education reform will focus on the implication of  increasing school choice and increasing the role of the private  sector in providing public education.  In particular, little is  know about who the likely winners and losers would be if the  choice movement continues.  Special attention will focus on the  analysis of the distribution of benefits from expanded choice.",
