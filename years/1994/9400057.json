 "awd_abstract_narration": "Layton         The investigator studies solution algorithms for viscous,  incompressible flows at high Reynolds number.  This problem  includes the interrelated difficulties of: boundary and interior  layers, dominating and sensitive nonlinearities, highly  nonsymmetric and possibly indefinite linear systems and the  incompressibility constraint.  Solution algorithms are studied for  each of these difficulties from one aspect to another. (For  example, it would not be satisfactory to simplify the linear  system at the expense of increasing the difficult of resolving the  nonlinearity.) The general approach is (1) higher order methods  (2) point adaptivity and unstructured meshes, (3) stabilized  finite element discretizations, (4) stabilized, multi-level,  multi-step Newton methods for the nonlinearity, (5) robust (=  uniform in Re), parallel, iterative solvers for the linear  systems, and (6) full mathematical support for all algorithmic  developments.       Fluid flow problems at high Reynolds number arise in many  technological and scientific applications, such as convection in  the melted region in the solidification of materials, transport  and dispersion of pollutants in air and groundwater and  simulations of climatic changes.  Since exact solution of these  equations is impossible, computer based simulation of fluid flow  problems is essential in accurately predicting, and ultimately  controlling the quantities which are of interest.  Accurate and  reliable simulation of high Reynolds number flow problems is a  very challenging scientific problem which is studied in this  research.  In large scale applications this involves the study of  algorithms which are highly parallel.",
