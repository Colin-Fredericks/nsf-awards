The project will include 16 original  science documentaries and 21 programs repackaged as special  broadcasts distributed to over 200 public radio stations in the  United States, reaching over 750,000 listeners, and ten countries  around the world.  The programs also will be distributed on  Internet Talk Radio.              The 16 new Programs will be grouped around three themes:  \"The Butterfly Effect\" which will bring large scientific concepts  describing global change to a more human level, \"Technology and  Culture\" which will consider the implications of technology, and  \"The Consequences of Science\" which will look at the broad  implications of scientific research.  The Executive Producer for  the project is Moira Rankin.  Neenah Ellis will serve as Senior  Producer and will work directly with independent producers in  story and script development.  The Science Editors will be Ann  Finkbeiner, a freelance science writer, and Barbara Culliton,  Deputy Editor of \"Nature.\"",
