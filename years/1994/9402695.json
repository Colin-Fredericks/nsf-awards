 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9402695  In crosses involving either pro- or eukaryotes, genetic exchanges  may be nonrandomly distributed with respect to each other, i.e.,  they may show \"interference.\"  The investigation of two systems in  which interference is manifest will continue.  In both systems,  interference may depend on a \"machine\" that moves along  chromosomes.  Understanding of these machines will contribute to  our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genetic recombination.  (1) When the RecBCD recombination pathway of E. coli operates on  phage lambda carrying the recombination hot spot Chi, recombinant  chromosomes recovered in phage particles have sometimes indulged in  a pair of exchanges, one reciprocal and one not.  The nonreciprocal  exchange occurs not at random but to the right of the reciprocal  one on the standard lambda linkage map.  The basis for this  nonrandom relationship resides in the RecBCD protein, which enters  DNA at a double-chain break and travels destructively along the  duplex, changing from an exonuclease to a \"recombinase\" when it  encounters the sequence 5'GCTGGTGG3' (Chi).  Models for the  mechanisms of the two exchanges and for the relationship between  them are being tested.  (2) In many eukaryotes, the presence of  one exchange in a meiotic bivalent reduces the probability of  finding an exchange in nearby intervals (chiasma interference).    A simple model that unites observations on gene conversion with  those on chiasma interference has been developed.  The model  supposes that conversions occur at random with respect to each  other, but that those with associated crossing over are invariably  separated by several conversions that lack associated crossing  over.  Thus, the two kinds of recombination events(one of which is  sometimes called \"reciprocal\" and the other not) are nonrandomly  distributed with respect to themselves and each other.  Development  of the model and testing of it continues.  Hypotheses regarding  mechanisms underlying the model are being te sted.  Such mechanisms  may involve a \"machine\" that travels along the synaptonemal complex  resolving double-chain break-repair intermediates such that a fixed  number of repair events unaccompanied by crossing over fall between  neighboring crossovers.  %%%  Recombination occurs in almost all organisms, and is responsible  for leading to new combinations of genes in offspring as well as  protection against damage to DNA and genes.  A better understanding  of this process should be applicable to many organisms, and could  lead to the development of better ways of introducing foreign genes  into organisms (\"genetic engineering\").  ***",
