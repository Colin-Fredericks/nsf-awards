Furthermore,  these methods when combined with high quality computer graphics,  which allow students to manipulate and rotate structures, can  provide insights into many concepts of structure and bonding. This  proposal requests support for the purchase of a network of four  Silicon Graphics Indy workstations equipped with the software  package Spartan. The use of these workstations and program will be  implemented in both lecture and laboratory in the sophomore organic  chemistry courses. Building on this foundation, we will use the  workstations for student projects in Advanced Lab courses and in  Physical and Medicinal chemistry courses. Because SGI has developed  a GUI that will allow students to operate the system without  knowledge of UNIX and because Spartan has graphical features that  will allow students to easily perform calculations and manipulate  3D structural and orbital representations, we believe that this  program is appropriate for sophomore organic students. Since the  relationship between structure and reactivity are covered through  the topics of frontier molecular orbital theory, stereochemistry,  conformational effects, and steric strain in organic chemistry,  this course provides an ideal entry point. Students will receive  supervised and structured training on the use of these instruments  in fall term organic. Having become familiar while sophomores with  the operation of the program running on the workstation,  upperclassmen will be encouraged to use these tools for more  sophisticated applications in advanced level laboratory and lecture  courses.",
