The theoretical work  builds on models of imperfectly competitive markets to draw  out the tensions between the set of attractive forces that  lead to the clustering of particular industries at regional  centers, and the repulsive forces that limit the size of  such concentrations. It is expected that the modeling would  explain the hierarchial structure of cities with higher-  order cities engaged in the production of goods and services  that reflect greater economies of scale or lower transport  costs. The empirical research will use data on Mexican  manufacturing to test the effects of, for example, NAFTA on  Mexican urban systems. The models on industry clustering are  used to study whether regional economic integration in  Europe will promote a greater degree of industrial  concentration.  This project is of significant interest because it attempts  to link international trade and interregional development  patterns. The results from the study promise to give us a  better understanding of the internal geography of major  urban areas as well as the adjustment issues raised by  economic integration prospects in Europe.  ***",
