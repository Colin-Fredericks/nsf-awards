 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304487  Markson         This project involves investigating use of an electric field  radiosonde (Electrosonde) carried aloft by a weather balloon to  measure the potential of the ionosphere, which the PI postulates is  controlled by tropical temperature.  Such data may provide a new  way to monitor global temperature and test numerical models.  Each  single measurement provides a proxy index of the integrated  temperature and convective activity over the Earth at tropical  latitudes, the region which controls global temperature, the  general circulation, and various other global aspects of the  weather.  Another advantage of this technique is that a naturally  occurring phenomenon is being observed - integrated deep tropical  convection - vs. existing methods for observing \"global warming\"  involving thousands of temperature measurements with associated  uncertainties.  The results of the Phase I effort were that a  reliable electric field instrument was developed and 31 V1 soundings  were obtained.  The temperature - V1 relationship was significant  at the 99% confidence level.  In Phase II, 3 widely separated  stations will be used for simultaneous measurements and to sample  different air masses.  The measurement of air conductivity will be  added to the electrosonde to detect aerosols and radioactive  material, each of which can affect the global atmosphere.  ***",
