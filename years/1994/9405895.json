 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research examines the molecular mechanisms by  which coordinate gene activation is regulated during the  embryonic formation, maturation, and diversification of  mammalian skeletal muscle tissue.  In recent years,  tremendous progress has been made towards understanding the  molecular mechanisms that activate muscle-specific genes as  committed myoblasts undergo the transition to terminally  differentiated myotubes.  A fundamental, but much less well  defined, aspect of myogenesis is the maturation of muscle  cells into specific types of myofibers.  During the past NSF  support period, the PI characterized the gene encoding the  human slow-twitch isoform of troponin I (TnIs) and has shown  that multiple cis-acting components are involved in the cell  type-expression of the TnIs promoter; an upstream muscle-  specific enhancer, a second muscle-specific enhancer within  intron 1, and a muscle-specific minimal promoter.  In  conjunction with collaborators, the PI demonstrated that a  TnIs promoter/CAT construct exhibits appropriate muscle  fiber type-specific expression in transgenic mice, but  preliminary results have indicated that the transgene (which  lacks the intron enhancer) is aberrantly regulated during  embryogenesis.  The hypothesis to be tested is that gene  regulation during early and late stages of muscle  development requires separate regulatory elements which bind  different combinations of trans-acting factors; the upstream  elements may play a major role in the innervation dependent  restriction of TnIs gene expression to slow twitch muscle  fibers and the downstream sequences, such as the intron 1  enhancer, may play a major role in earlier stages of  myofiber formation.  In order to map the upstream sequences  conferring fiber type-specific gene expression, the PI  established an in vivo muscle injection assay with which to  study differential gene expression in fast versus slow  twitch muscles of adult rats.  This system enables the PI  the unique opportunity to un derstand the molecular  mechanisms by which fiber type specificity is regulated.  The PI will use the in vivo injection assay to delineate cis-  acting components involved in the fiber type-specific  expression of the TnIs gene.  Once such cis-elements are  narrowly defined in vitro mutagenesis studies will be used  to monitor the consequences of modifying these fiber-  specific regulatory elements.  Additional lines of  transgenic mice will be produced in order to study the role  of these sequence elements in the regulation of gene  expression during muscle development and maturation.  The  expression of transgene constructs in embryonic and adult  mice will be monitored by reporter gene activity assays  along with Northern blot, immunohistochemical, and in situ  hybridization analyses.  The following questions will then  be addressed:  1)  What are the cis-acting sequences and  trans-acting factors that restrict TnIs gene expression to  slow-twitch fibers in adult skeletal muscle, and how might  these be related to the components governing muscle-specific  expression in vitro?  2)  How do \"muscle-specific\" and  \"fiber-specific\" regulatory elements contribute to the  spatial and temporal control of gene expression during  muscle development and maturation in vivo?  3)  Do the  upstream and intron enhancers mediate separate aspects of  TnIs gene regulation in primary versus mature myofibers?",
