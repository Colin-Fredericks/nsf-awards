 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system must develop more intricate functional  connections between its cells that any of the other systems of the  body.  To understand mechanisms providing such specificity, model  subsystems of the brain often are used.  The fruit fly, Drosophila,  has large compound eyes that provide an excellent model for  development because classical and molecular genetic analysis can be  used, and certain cell types are easy to identify.  Within this  compound eyes are repeating subunits containing eight photoreceptor  cells, labelled R1 to R8.  The first one to appear differentiated  during normal development is R8, and it is thought to play a  critical role in the subsequent specification of the remaining 7  photoreceptor cells.  A mutant has been found that produces a  retina aberrant in pattern, so named \"rap\" gene, including cloning  and sequencing.  Results will clarify how inductive interactions  can regulate cellular specificity, and will have impact on  developmental biology as well as neuroscience and visual science.",
