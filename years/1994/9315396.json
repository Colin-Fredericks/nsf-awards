 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315396  Fitch  This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry  and focuses on the electrochemical investigation of the transport  properties of clays.  During the tenure of this three year continuing  grant, Professor Alanah Fitch and her students at Loyola University of  Chicago will use clay-modified electrodes to investigate the diffusion  of ions through well characterized clay layers.  The effects of pressure  and electrolyte concentration on the swelling and transport properties  of the clay materials will be examined.  Also, the influence of multiple  solutes on these properties will be explored to determine the extent of  cooperative or synergistic transport.  This experimental investigation  is designed to further our understanding of the soil-based transport of  typical pollutants, including both hydrophobic organic materials and  anionic radiochemicals, through clay containment beds.  %%%  This research is expected to provide an enhanced understanding of  several important processes which take place within the clay materials  that are used to line chemical waste disposal repositories.  Among the  issues to be explored are the effects of various toxic chemicals on the  characteristics of these clay materials, including their swelling and  transport properties.  The successful pursuit of the goals of this  project should enable more accurate prediction of the rates of escape of  pollutants from containment sites.  ***",
