 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316125  Fluck    The PI and his students will continue to study the roles of  cytoskeletal systems and cytosolic calcium pulses, waves, and  gradients in ooplasmic movements and cytokinesis in the medaka egg.   The objectives of the research are:  a) to describe the spatial and  temporal organization of microtubules during ooplasmic segregation;  b) to determine whether microtubules and a microtubule-associated  motor (kinesin) are involved in the segregation of a specific class  of cytoplasmic organelles (oil droplets) toward the vegetal pole of  the cell, c) to determine whether the artificial induction of a  cytosolic calcium gradient will organize ooplasmic segregation, d)  to determine whether there is a causal relationship between zones  of elevated calcium and microtubule organization, e) to determine  whether calcium pulses, waves, or gradients accompany specific  mitotic and cytokinetic events, and f) to determine whether  dissipation of cytosolic calcium gradients near the developing  cleavage furrow will inhibit cytokinesis.  %%%  Dr. Fluck and his students will continue to study the mechanisms by  which structural rearrangements and cell division take place in  fertilized eggs.  The egg of the medaka fish provide an excellent  system for these studies.  In particular they will study the roles  of the internal skeletal structures of cells (cytoskeletal systems)  and pulses, waves and gradients of intracellular calcium in  regulating the movements of the egg's internal structure, and in  the division of the egg into two daughter cells.  The results of  these studies will give us important new insight into the  physiological and structural bases of these two critical events in  the early development of a fertilized egg.  ***",
