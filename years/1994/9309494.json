 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309494  Irwin  The purpose of this research is to analyze the portfolios of  wealthy slave owners in antebellum Virginia, and to determine how  they allocated their assets among slaves, land, and all other  forms of wealth.  A data set will be assembled of estate-  inventories of wealthy decedents from the probate records of  Virginia County Courts, and these records will be linked to  federal census schedules, county land-tax and deed records, and  to personal records such as family letters, histories, and  account books.   The research will analyze the resulting linked  data set drawing on modern finance theory of portfolio choice.   Of particular interest is whether rich southerners were over  committed to slaves and land and averse to investing in  manufacturing and commercial finance.  The economic issue of  considerable historical significance is the role planter's  portfolio choice played in the economic growth and development of  the antebellum south.  This research may help explain the  relatively minor role of manufacturing in the development process  during that period.  ***",
