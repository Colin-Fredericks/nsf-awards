Single crystals  of nickel-base superalloys have demonstrated excellent performance  in high-temperature gas turbines.  This grant supports a  university-industry collaboration on the growth of shaped single   crystals of nickel-base superalloys by pulling from liquid melts.   Single crystals are grown at the University of Wisconsin and tested  at Howmet Corporation, a major producer of single crystals of  nickel-base superalloys for high-temperature gas turbines in the  U.S.  The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of growing  low-cost, high-quality single crystals of constant cross-sections  (rods, bars, sheets and tubes).  These crystals are useful for  applications where complicated shapes are not required, e.g.,  single crystal sheets for turbine engine combustor liners (where  gas mixtures ignite).  An advantage is that numerous steps involved  in the preparation and removal of ceramic shell molds are not  required and the crystals are not limited to relatively short  lengths, unlike conventional crystal growth of nickel-base  superalloys by investment casting.  Attention is focused on growth  of single crystal sheets up to 2 feet long.  An improved technique  for pulling shaped crystals, recently developed at the University  of Wisconsin's crystal growth laboratory, is used and heat treating  and preliminary screening tests of the single crystals are  conducted by Howmet.    %%%  A videotape movie showing the results of the proposed work will be  made and copies distributed to the superalloy industry.  It will  also be used in two undergraduate materials processing courses at  the University of Wisconsin.  ***",
