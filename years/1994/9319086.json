The conference will present studies on various  aspects and connections of wavelets and fractals; wavelet  decomposition, reconstruction and sampling of functions and  fractal measures; existence and regularity of the two-scale  dilation equations; self-similarity in harmonic analysis;  multifractal structure of measures and multi-dimensional wavelets  and self-similar tilings.        Wavelets is a recently new development in the  mathematical area of harmonic analysis.  It combines traditional  Hilbert space methods with new constructions of bases from  dilations and translations of a single function (the wavelet).   In addition to computational advantages in this approach, it has  been found that wavelets can be found which are local in both  time and frequency making their application to signal processing  particularly effective.   ***",
