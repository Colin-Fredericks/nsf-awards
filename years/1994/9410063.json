 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410063  Li  This proposal research is to study the system architectural model  and system software support of network of personal workstations  (NPW) connected by SCI (Scalable Coherence Interface, IEEE  Standard 1596).  Oppose to the traditional LAN-connected NPW, SCI-  connected NPW can provide physically shared memory and cache  coherence among workstations across a network with high bandwidth  (1Gbyte/sec) and low latency (microseconds).  The research will  provide the understanding of the new parallel architecture which  is highlighted by contradiction between its closely-coupled  nature due to shared memory and cache coherence and its loosely-  coupled nature due to the physical distance between workstations  and independent operations of the workstations.  This research  will result in models of various designs of SCI-connected NPW and  their comparisons, operating system designs to support such  architectures, and performance data based on typical parallel  applications.  The result will be an important step towards  inexpensive but powerful and widely available parallel computing  platforms.  The work will be done in three steps:  (1) Model the  architectural characteristics of SCI-connected NPE.  (2) Design  and implement operating system software supports based on the  hardware and applications requirements.  System level performance  will also be studied.  (3) Design and implement application  prototypes to obtain performance data.  Simulation will be used  to predict the performance of large scale SCI-NPWs.  ***",
