 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451560  Videtich  A long-term project is investigating hydrologic and chemical  changes that occur in ground water, wetlands, and ponds as a new  golf course on the campus evolves from a newly-seeded to a  well-established course.  This project involves students taking  geohydrology, geochemistry, field methods,  sedimentation-stratigraphy, geomorphology, and glacial geology  courses.  Students in each class perform an appropriate part of the  project.  Microbial degradation of selected pesticides is studied  by students in microbiology, who benefit directly from the project.   The data set is used in other science courses as a local example of  an environmental assessment project in progress. Geology, biology,  chemistry, health sciences and natural resources management  students are encouraged to take part in the project through  independent research projects.  The primary goal of the project is  to enhance earth science programs through providing a \"hands on\"  and applied science experience.  At the same time, the project  creates an interdisciplinary bridge between the sciences.  In  addition, the project (1) involves students in an environmental  study located on their campus, (2) enables them to help assure that  the university golf course will not adversely affect the  environment, and (3) provides valuable data to the scientific  community and the public on the evolution of the geohydrology and  geochemistry of ground and surface water associated with the aging  of a golf course.  The equipment purchased (e.g., hole digger,  water sampling systems, piezometer, water analysis kits, and field  computer) also enhances the overall equipment holdings of the  geology department and thereby benefits geology students involved  in other projects.",
