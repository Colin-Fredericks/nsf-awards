 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412238  Owen  Auburn University requests support from NSF for connection of  five universities and colleges including: Birmingham-Southern  College, Judson College, Huntingdon College, Stillman College,  and Talledega College to the NSFNET.  This connection is a basic  part of an overall teaching improvement project described below.   The accessibility of the network to all the schools is critical  for the coordination of that project and accomplishment of its  goals, such as development of shared teaching resources and  improvement of the quality of teaching.  In addition, those  schools to be connected expect to see significant benefit from  the wider access to information to both faculty and students.    Auburn University is providing the project direction for the  network connection portion of the overall project.    Each of the universities has written a description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access  that it expects including: greater functionality and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the  links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to  explore innovative educational resources.",
