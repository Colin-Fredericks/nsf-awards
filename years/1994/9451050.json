Such a system  would permit this exciting new development in separation science  and chemical analysis to be incorporated into our undergraduate  chemistry curriculum through a defined set of laboratory  experiments. As designed, these experiments will impact our  Analytical and Biological chemistry laboratories in a way likely to  provide a model used by other institutions. Our plan of development  includes:  an introduction to CE principles and methodologies in both  laboratory experiences;  the development of experiments which demonstrate the micellar  electrokinetic chromatographic mode for the separation of neutral  molecules and the effects of chiral selectors for the separation of  enantiomers in our Analytical Laboratories;  an emphasis in the Biological Chemistry Laboratory on capillary gel  electrophoresis as applied to the separation of proteins and  nucleic acids and as a biophysical tool to assist in measuring the  interactions between biological macromolecules.  The requested instrument will have a significant impact on the  training of our students and will provide cutting-edge educational  opportunities that do not currently exist in our undergraduate  curriculum.",
