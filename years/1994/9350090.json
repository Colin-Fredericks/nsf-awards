NOPS will determine the present state of K 12 Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) education in the district and then develop a reform plan, informed by the self study data, to implement a K 12 system which will provide a high quality SMT education for all students.  The planning process will be led by an Executive Committee (EC) chaired by the Superintendent and composed of NOPS representatives and other key stakeholders.  The EC will supervise the development of the implementation plan and recommend necessary changes in district policies and procedures.  The plan will be produced by an Advisory Board (AB) composed of members of the EC and the chairs of six review committees (RC).  The RCs, each charged with examining specific elements of the SMT education system, will collect, organize, and analyze data and submit recommendations to the AB.",
