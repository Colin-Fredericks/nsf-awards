 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361746  Casstevens    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the general area of analytical and  surface chemistry and in the subfield of biosensors. The main Phase I objective is the  development of a fluoropolymer based immunoprobe where biological recognition elements are  immobilized onto the surface of a transparent film of polytetrafluoroethylene-co-  hexafluoropropylene (FEP). The advantages of an FEP-based probe are better biocompatibility  and less denaturation or loss of activity of the antibody protein induced by traditional glass or  quartz substrates. Three areas which will be explored in order to optimize the surface chemistry  are (1) initial surface modification which incorporates reactive surface hydroxyl functionality to   a film of FEP; (2) a comparison of monofunctional vs difunctional covalent linking ligands; and  (3) evaluation of the density and activity of the antibody protein and its effect on the  fluorescence response.  %%%  More than four billion dollars are spent annually on immunochemical based analyses.  The  successful development of a versatile fluoropolymer immunoprobe will provide the basis for   their incorporation into a wide range of devices that are sensitive, economical and compatible  with fiber optic technology.  ***",
