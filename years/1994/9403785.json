 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403785  Goldstein       This award supports mathematical research in the generalarea  of operator-theoretic functional analysis, differential equations  and mathematical physics.  The work focuses on problems from  three overlapping areas.  The first area, quantum theory,  involves Thomas-Fermi theory with the Fermi-Amaldi correction for  spin polarized systems, scattering theory (including obstacle  scattering for elastic waves), nonrelativisitic limits and  mHartree-Fock theory.  The second area, nonlinear partial  differential equations, involves the anisotropic porous  medium equation, degenerate parabolic equations (including  the Kompaneets equations of plasma physics), the Wentzell  boundary condition, reaction-diffusion systems, the  Korteweg-deVreiss equation and higher dimensional dispersive  equations, singular conservation laws and factored equations of  Euler-Poisson-Darboux type.  The final area, semigroups of  operators, involves Favard classes and degenerate parabolic  problems, extremal characterizations of eigenvectors, singular  perturbations and hemion-Cosine functions.  The problems are  mostly well-posed, but also of concern are ill-posed problems,  including inverse problems, nonconvex minimization and numerical  solutions.       Differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
