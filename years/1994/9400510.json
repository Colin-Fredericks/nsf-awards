 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400510  Stanton       This award funds the work of Prof. Dennis Stanton in  Combinatorics.  Prof. Stanton will study the monotonicity of  integer partitions.  Classes of orthogonal polynomials will be  studied as an aid to enumeration.  Prof. Stanton will also  investigate questions in representation theory,  in particular  the representations of the symmetric and general linear groups.   The techniques used on these problems should be both  combinatorial and analytic.        This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,  which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting.   Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods  for overcoming these difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes  use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern  mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several  centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past  few decades.  This growth comes from its importance in  communications and information technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems of counting.",
