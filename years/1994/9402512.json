 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402512  Landsberger  This award supports dissertation-related research in Western Europe  by a PhD student of Dr. Sheldon Landsberger from the University of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The graduate student, Mr. Steven  Biegalski, will carry out atmospheric chemistry research at the RISO  National Laboratory in Roskilde, Denmark.  Dr. Landsberger and Mr.  Biegalski are actively involved in research using source-receptor  models to characterize the airborne pollutants in the Arctic and also  to study the influence that halogens have on the destruction of  ozone.  Dr. Landsberger has received funding from Denmark to visit  and collaborate with Dr. K. Heydorn and Dr. Kare Kemp of the Neils  Bohr Institute.  They are directing a Danish project to develop  receptor models based on analyses of Arctic aerosols.    Funding from the Western Europe Program of NSF will enable Mr.  Biegalski to accompany Dr. Landsberger and to stay for two two-month  periods to carry out research that will contribute to his  dissertation.  Participation in the ongoing research at RISO National  Laboratory will give Mr. Biegalski access to field samples and  specialized equipment and procedures not available to him at the  University of Illinois.  These will give him further insights into  the role that the long range transport of atmospheric aerosols,  particularly trace elements, play in global change.  He will also  gain experience in international collaboration at an early stage of  his research career, and establish solid professional contacts with a  leading atmospheric chemistry research group and its network of  European collaborators.  ***",
