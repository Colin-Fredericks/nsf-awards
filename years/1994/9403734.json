The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Urbashi Mitra to work with Professors Pierre  Humblet and Dirk Slock at Institut EURECOM in France.    Wireless communication networks are proposed for fixed site  sources such as local area networks.  The shared radio  channel necessitates the development and analysis of  efficient receivers for signals from a multitude of users.  These new multi-user receivers must operate synergistically  vis a vis concerns for bandwidth efficiency, radio spectrum  allocation, the receiver technology complexity, quality of  service and privacy issues.  The object of the proposed  research is to augment newly proposed multi-user receivers  to be adaptive structures.  Further extensions are proposed  to accommodate interference from time-dispersive  communication channels.  The possibility of creating  adaptive multi-user receivers that operate without the use  of training signals will also be investigated. ***",
