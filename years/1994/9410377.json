 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on architectural-level simulation using field-  programmable gate arrays as hardware accelerators.  The goals of  this research include the development of a paradigm for  architectural specification that is both general-purpose and can be  used to produce fast and efficient simulators, development of a  graphical user interface-based entry tool, development of tools for  automatic translation of an architectural description to FPGA  programming information, and implementation of a trace-driven  execution environment to run the simulations.  The key idea behind  this work is to use FPGA's to simulate a system above the gate  level, at the level of events, dependencies, resources and delays.   FPGA's place a limit on the size of the hardware-implemented data  structures, which will be extended via a software monitor to allow  virtual, unlimited-length structures.  The simulation will be  automatically translated from a high-level description by use of  methods adapted from high-level synthesis and the compilation of C  programs.  To aid in entering the architectural description, a  graphical user interface tool will be developed.  The paradigm for  system description will be based on a discrete-event architectural  model of system behavior.  This paradigm will be hierarchical and  provide a library that takes advantage of existing fast simulation  techniques for cache and processor simulation.",
