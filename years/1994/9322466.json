 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322466  NASH  This award provides funds for a Research Experience for  Undergraduates Site project to involve students in the ongoing  study of contemporary socio-cultural change among the highland  Mayan and Mexican national (ladino or mestizo) communities of  Chiapas, southeastern Mexico.  The project director is a seasoned  investigator with career-long experience of research in this  area.  Eight students will be selected from among applicants in  the undergraduate colleges of the City University of New York and  the State University of New York.  Students will be trained in  the methods of anthropological field research.  They will be  involved in development projects such as artisan cooperatives,  reforestation, cash crop production, tourism, bilingual  education, midwifery, and other initiatives that the Mexican  government is now promoting.  In addition to the field research,  students will attend a week of orientation classes, weekly  seminars by the project director on field techniques, and weekly  meetings with field workers who are carrying out research in the  region.  At the end of the summer, students will be expected to  share research findings with colleagues through publication and  translation.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
