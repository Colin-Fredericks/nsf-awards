 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412417  Hadden  This project will examine ways to expand participation in the  selection and ranking of national goals for national science and  technology policy.  It will organize and sponsor a one year process  to initiate and institutionalize a national forum on science and  technology goals, with participation from a broad cross-section of  the United States population and representation from groups not  traditionally part of science and technology policymaking,  including nonexpert citizens.  This project will develop a mission  statement, governing structure, and set of procedures for making  decisions, including how decisions will be made about who will be  asked to participate.  In order to identify, develop and sponsor  specific programs, the national forum must have a structure, a set  of procedures that allow for orderly and fair decisionmaking and a  clear sense of how participants will be chosen and recruited.   Answers to these questions entail critical choices about values  that will be reflected in the national forum's character and  mission.  There are three phases of work in this year.  The first  phase will set up three committees corresponding to the three  questions to be answered:  mission, structure, and participation.   These committees will be made up of people from an \"interim  governing council,\" twenty members of which have already committed  to the project.  The committees will each develop proposals that  will be delivered to all participants.  The complete interim  council will meet for three days in Austin, Texas, to come to  conclusions about the committee proposals.  The last phase will be  dissemination of results to professional, scientific, technical,  business, trade union, academic, and public interest groups,  government officials, and the scientific and technical press.  At  the end of this process, the national forum should be ready to  start one or more trial programs.  ***",
