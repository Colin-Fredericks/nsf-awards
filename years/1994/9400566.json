These problems involve the following  topics: joint hyponormality, especially k-hyponormality and weak  k-hyponormality for weighted shifts; related problems in the  theory of moments, including the complex truncated moment  problem; majorization, factorization and invertible factor  theorems in the theory of C*-algebras. One aspect of this  research concerns structural and computational models for  subnormal, k-hyponormal, and weakly k-hyponormal operators, with  emphasis on unilateral shifts. This study also concerns  multidimensional power moment problems, including the truncated  complex moment problem and the extension problem for positive  moment matrices. Another facet of this research concerns the  description of the spectral picture of an elementary operator  acting on a prime C*-algebra. This research also concerns  solubility of the equation a = bx in a C*-algebra, including the  case of solubility with x invertible.       Operator theory is an infinite dimensional version of linear  algebra and matrix theory. One of the important applications of  linear algebra is in solving a system of a finite number of  linear equations. The problem of solving operator equations can  be considered as an attempt to solve a system involving a very  large or infinite number of equations. Part of this project  involves solving operator equations. Other portions of the  project involves using operator theory to solve classical moment  problems. The basic problem here is to determine a measure or  mass distribution from various moments of mass. It is important  to note that this research will be conducted at an undergraduate  institution and will have significant impact in mathematics  education.  ***",
