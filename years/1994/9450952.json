 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450952  Garcia  This project proposes the development of a course to train  undergraduate students in thru-hole technology and surface-mount  technology. This course would be made available to students from  four programs of study including Electronic Technology, Electronic  Servicing Technology, Biomedical Equipment Technology and  Instrumentation Technology. New trends in electronic soldering,  assembly, rework, and repair have brought about a revolution of  soldering techniques. Basic hand skill soldering techniques of the  past are being replaced in industry by sophisticated High  Reliability Interconnection Technologies. These changes have  resulted in the need for students to become familiar with new  equipment, learn new procedures, and become competent in new  soldering techniques in order to be a marketable employee.  Very  few undergraduate institutions are teaching new soldering  techniques. Most industries are sending their employees to  speaialized learning centers where they can master tasks required  to be certified in thru-hole soldering and surface-mount  technology. This project is unique in that it not only proposes  curriculum for thru-hole soldering and surface-mount technology, it  also includes an arrangement where students can gain certification  in these areas of specialization upon successful completion of the  course.",
