Addressing the core mission of the museum, the  exhibit will promote understanding about \"the interdependence of  scientific, environmental, and technological activities in the  Great Lakes Region.\"  The exhibit will focus on the Great Lakes as  an ecosystem.  By means of interactive activities, visitors will  learn how this ecosystem was formed, the web of life it supports,  the stresses it receives, and the efforts to restore its health.    The Great Lakes Museum is a new 165,000 sq. ft. facility located in  downtown Cleveland on the Lake Erie Shore and is scheduled to open  in 1996.  The exhibit area will cover 50,000 sq. ft. and will be  fully accessible.  An entire floor will be dedicated to the Great  Lakes Environment.  Complementary educational programs will consist  of the following: take home activity guides to encourage the  discovery and exploration of ecosystems in backyards or  neighborhoods, pre and post visit activities for school groups, and  teacher enhancement activities.  Museum staff are participating in  the planning process for the Urban Systemic Initiative of Cleveland  and activiites and content of exhibits will be developed to  complement the curriculum.  The museum will develop a menu of  activities and databases for electronic networking with homes and  schools.  They will have video conferencing capabilities to connect  the museum with classrooms.",
