 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416266  Lu  One of the significant issues that were brought forth, quite  unexpectedly, by the Northridge earthquake is the  vulnerability of some welded moment connections in steel  frames subjected to dynamic ground shaking.  It has been  reported that in more than 50 low- and high-rise buildings  cracks were found in the beam-to column connections.  Two  distinct types of cleavage cracks were observed to form at  the beam bottom flange groove welded connection to the  column flange face.  Both types of cracks had their origin  at the natural crack-like condition that results with a left-  in-place steel backing bar.    Preliminary investigations indicates that the deposited weld  metal has unusually low fracture toughness.  However, the  mechanical and chemical properties of the structural steel  generally meet the AISC and ASTM standard requirements.  Of  concern is whether a connection should be retrofitted if it  has not detectable change.  The issue of how to \"protect\"  critical connections has been raised as well as approaches  to lessen strength and deformation demand on these  connections, has been raised as well as approaches to lessen  strength and deformation demand on these connections.  It is  vitally important that reliable connection design and  fabrication methodologies be established as soon as possible  so that structures constructed in the future would not  experience similar failures.    The research under this project has the following  objectives: (1) to determine the probable causes of  cracking, (2) to evaluate the adequacy of the recommended  repair methods, (3) to find rational and cost-effective ways  to improve connection performance and/or to reduce demand on  connections, and (4) to develop reliable design and  fabrication procedures for welded connections.  The research  plan includes six tasks: (1) studies of welding procedure  and quality of weld metal (including performing procedure  qualification tests on electrodes to be used for repairs to  insure adequate  fracture toughness), (2) dynamic experiments  on large-size connections, (3) dynamic experiments on  repaired connections, (4) dynamic experiments on modified  connections with enhanced ductility, (5) analytical studies,  and (6) development of recommendations.    A total of 16 tests will be conducted on 8 large-size  connection specimens with cyclically applied dynamic load.  The experiments will be performed in the ATLSS Laboratory at  Lehigh University.  The experiments will be performed in the  ATLSS Laboratory at Lehigh University.    An interdisciplinary team including structural engineers and  welding metallurgist will carry out the study.  The results  will permit the development of definitive recommendations  related to:  weld metal and welding procedure, repair of  cracked connections, and performance enhancement of  connections.  The study will also establish probable causes  of connection cracking.  ***",
