 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320785  Slocum  A novel polarizing thin film material was designed for use as a high performance polarizer in Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCD. The metal film polarizer (MFP) material consists of evaporatively deposited Ag metal spheroid layers laminated with transparent dielectric layers.  The MFP material replaces the plastic polarizers which are currently attached to the outer surfaces of a LCD cell.  The MFP material is a non-organic sheet polarizer which is formed by a proprietary process developed by Polatomic, Inc.  for use in a NASA solar observatory.  In Phase I we established optical specifications for LCD polarizers and designed by means of computer simulation a MFP material suitable for AMLCD use.  Experiments were performed to produce monolayer spheroid films with contrast of 30 at the desired peak wavelength of 525nm.  Computer design of a MFP material with 90% transmission and contrast greater the 35 in the band from 450 nm to 625 nm along with design of narrow band polarizers with contrast greater than 10,000 at 530 nm established the feasibility of fabricating a high-efficiency MFP material in Phase II.  A Process Development Plan was prepared describing the research and development road map for developing the fabrication process in Phase II.  ***",
