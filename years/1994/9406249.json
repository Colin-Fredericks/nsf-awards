The  evolution of the unusual pre-mRNA processing pathways which produce  the antigen receptor, membrane-bound form of the IgM is not  understood, and neither is the nature of the transcriptional  control elements (particularly the enhancer) that drive the  expression of this gene.  As the major objective of this  application, it is proposed to define the core enhancer element in  the catfish heavy chain gene in terms of its precise location,  structure and specificity of cell-type expression.  An  understanding of both the structure and expression of the catfish  heavy chain gene could permit the successful design of genetic  approaches to manipulating the antibody response in a commercially  important fish.  The catfish IgH enhancer will be investigated  initially by functional criteria:  the core enhancer will be  defined as that minimal segment of DNA from the catfish Ig heavy  chain locus that will drive expression of a reporter gene (e.g.  chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) in a B cell-specific manner.   Reporter constructs will be transfected into cloned, in vitro grown  channel catfish cell lines of B cell, T cell and macrophage lineage  and their transcriptional activity measured in transient expression  assays.  Once the core enhancer region of the catfish IgH locus has  been located, then the specific sequence motifs that bind the  transcription factors will be defined by a combination of mobility-  shift, footprinting and functional analyses.  The functional  analysis will consist of utilizing fragments of the enhancer, in  various combinations, in reporter constructs in which it is  attempted to reconstruct the tissue specific activity of the native  IgH enhancer.  %%%  These molecular level studies of the regulati on of catfish antibody  gene expression will provide insight into the evolution of immune  function and generate fundamental information that will lay the  groundwork for our future ability to  enhance fish immune responses  by genetic means.  ***",
