These studies will provide quantitative  information about binding and import that is not currently  available using radiolabeled precursor proteins.  The  approaches may also be useful in the characterization of  import intermediates that span the mitochondrial membranes.  The precursor under study is a fusion between the amino-  terminal 25-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence of  yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (CoxIV) and the complete  amino acid sequence of mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).  The pCoxIV-DHFR fusion protein is efficiently imported by  mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo and has been used  extensively to study the import process.  The protein has  recently been labeled with the NBD fluorophore specifically  attached to cysteine-19 of the presequence.  The labeled  precursor can now be used in studies similar to those  developed with the fluorescent presequence peptide.   In  addition, the laboratory will test whether or not the full-  length precursor can be imported in Paracoccus  denitrificans, a gram-negative bacterium that is typically  used as a model for the ancestral mitochondrion and which  has recently been shown to be capable of importing a  synthetic mitochondrial presequence.    This ability would  be important in the context of understanding the evolution  of the protein transport system in the mitochondria of  modern eukaryotic cells.  The results obtained in the import  experiments with mitochondria will be used to develop  optimal conditions to look for import with the bacteria.  Even if the precursor is not fully translocated, the  fluorescent approaches should provide information about the  extent and type of interaction of the precursor protein with  these bacteria.  %%%  Eukaryotic cells are believed to have evolved from  endosym biotic relationships between certain protistan \"host\"  cells and other \"endosymbiont\" protists.  Modern eukaryotes  contain specialized organelles (mitochondria and plastids)  which still retain substantial vestiges of autonomy (genomes  and protein-synthesizing machinery).  The successful  function of a modern eukaryotic cell hinges on the  interdependence and appropriate exchange of proteins and  other information between these organelles and the the rest  of the cell (nucleus and cytoplasm).   This project  addresses not only the mechanism whereby nuclear-encoded  proteins get into the mitochondrion in order to carry out  their proper functions, but also begins to address, at the  biochemical and molecular levels, the question of how this  mechanism may have evolved.   The kind of information that  is expected to come from such studies will be valuable in  biotechnological applications that require specific  manipulation of transport phenomena involving proteins  inserting into or crossing membrane barriers.  ***",
