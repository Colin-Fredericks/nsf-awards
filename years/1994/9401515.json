To obtain nonstable  K-theory results for AH algebras. The completion of the first  project would be a major step in the classification problem of  separable nuclear C*-algebras by invariants. The completion of  the second project will give a positive answer to an important  conjecture of Blackadar and will provide important information in  itself and also concerning the classification of nuclear  C*-algebras.       Operators are infinite dimensional generalizations of  matrices that possess a natural addition and multiplication.  There is a natural involution called the adjoint operation on  operators that behaves much like the transpose operation  (reflection in the diagonal) on square matrices. A collection of  operators that is closed under addition, multiplication, the  adjoint operation and has a certain topological property is  called a C*-algebra. These algebras are important in several  branches of mathematics as well as in mathematical physics and  dynamical systems theory. The C*-algebras investigated here are  ones that are built out of matrix algebras in a limiting manner.  The basic goal is to classify these important algebras using  simple invariants.  ***",
