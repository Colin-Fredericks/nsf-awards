 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353969  Smith  The proposed project would support a coalition of two- and  four-year institutions (The Washington Center Coalition)  interested in helping faculty learn about new advances in their  disciplines and new ways to incorporate these into their  classes. The project emphasis is on interdisciplinary science  curricular designs. Four, eight-day interdisciplinary summer  institutes would be team-taught over the two year period of the  grant. Each Institute would be residential and have 30 faculty  participants. Follow-up activities after the institutes include  a two-day retreat, involvement in on-going Washington Center  activities, and communication among the participants via  InterNet and written publications. The Summer Institutes, which  are the core of the project design, are miniature versions of  some of the most successful interdisciplinary programs in the  state. They provide a \"high challenge\" curriculum and are based  upon pedagogical principles of student involvement that are  recommended by an increasingly convergent literature on  improving education in the sciences.  ***",
