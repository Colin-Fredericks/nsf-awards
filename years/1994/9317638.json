 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several theoretical and numerical studies are proposed in  gravitational collapse, critical phenomena in general  relativity and relativistic astrophysics.  The major focuses  of this program include:  (1) a vigorous investigation of  the critical phenomena recently discovered to be associated  with gravitational collapse in general relativity, (2) an  investigation of several steps toward modeling the orbital  decay and coalescence of black hole binaries, (3) several  investigations of the physics of eclipsing pulsars and  relativistic pulsar winds, and (4) numerical studies of  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds and magnetically-confined  jets.    The objectives of work in critical phenomena are to  understand the connections to critical phenomena in other  areas such as statistical physics, to explore analytic  properties of the simplest examples of critical behavior in  collapse, and to discover additional, physically-distinct  examples of critical phenomena through numerical  experimentation.  The objectives of work on coalescing black  hole binaries are to develop and explore in two spatial  dimensions (2+1) the use of an apparent horizon inner  boundary condition for black holes and to develop algorithms  that efficiently utilize massively-parallel architectures.  In both cases, knowledge developed in 2+1 will be extendible  to three dimensions (3+1).  Work on eclipsing pulsars will  focus on investigating simple analytic/numerical models of  nonlinear plasma instabilities, which may be relevant for  short-period, low-mass systems, and investigating the  interaction between relativistic pulsar winds and normal  stellar winds.  Continued development of a general purpose  MHD code (AVATAR), begun in the last grant period, will be  pursued, with application to the study of self-collimation  of MHD winds and propagation of magnetically-confined jets.",
