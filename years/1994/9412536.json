Organized by the American Chemical Society (ACS),   the program will be under the supervision of Dr. John Malin of  the ACS and Prof. Ernest Eliel of the University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Through these summer fellowships, Latin  American chemistry faculty, at the start of their research  careers, will be invited to spend two months on mutually-designed  projects at U.S. institutions.    The program will be coordinated with the chemical societies and  scientific academies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico,  with cost sharing from the research agencies of these countries.   Each of the national chemical societies will recommend up to four  candidates per year; approximately six will be chosen by an ACS  panel, with at least one participant from each country per year  of the program.  This support will help to develop and strengthen  cooperative research in the chemical sciences by fostering  strong, new, and early interactions between U.S. and Latin  American researchers.  ***",
