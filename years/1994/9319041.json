 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319041  Sanger     Cytokinesis is a fundamental cellular process whose  corrrect execution is essential for the normal development  of muticellular organisms.  It requires the transitory  assembly of an actin/myosin contractile system, the cleavage  furrow, that shares some of the properties of myofibrils in  muscle cells and of stress fibers in non-muscle cells.  Each  of these assemblages is formed by the recruitment of actin,  myosin and associated proteins to sites on the cell membrane  where they become organized into contractile units that form  attachments to the membrane.  In each system, contraction  requires ATP, and in muscle, at least, contraction is  mediated by factors such as calcium ions.  Each of the three  contractile systems is dynamic and capable of reversible  assembly and disassembly in response to a variety of  signals, but the cleavage furrow is unique in the close  coupling of its contractility and disassembly.  The long  term goals of the proposed research are to understand the  factors responsible for the site-specific assembly and  functioning of the cleavage furrow.  The specific aims of  this proposal are: 1, to test the hypothesis that the actin  filaments in the cleavage furrow are attached to the  membrane by a mechanism similar to that used by the cell for  its interphase actin-myosin structures; 2, to examine the  role of myosin phosphorylation in recruitment of myosin to  the forrow and test the hypotehsis that actin and myosin can  be recruited independently of one another; 3, to examine the  sites of incorporation of actin in cleaving cells; and 4, to  determine if fluctuations in calcium levels are evident  during the assembly and contraction of the cleavage ring in  dividing tissue culture cells and cardiomyocytes.  A number  of microscopic imaging methods will be used with living  cells that have been microinjected with various probes to  analyze the distribution of the major component molecules of  the cleavage ring.  All of the proposed experiments are   designed to define some of the parameters responsible for  the proper functioning of one of the most basic processes in  cells: cytokinesis.  %%%  This project focuses on the mechanisms by which a single  cell literally divides itself into two.  In animal cells, we  already know that this process involves the assembly of a  ring of cytoskeletal filaments at the equator of the cell  (or, if not equatorial, then at a position which defines the  plane of cell division).  These filaments are attached to  the cell membrane.  A mechanical contraction of that ring  then occurs, which results in a constriction of the cell  membrane at that plane.  As the contraction of the ring  continues, the constriction becomes greater and greater  until the cell pinches itself off into two daughter cells.  This project aims to learn in detail the mechanism by which  the contractile filaments are attached to the membrane, the  mechanism by which the protein building blocks of the ring  are recruited to the site of the ring, and the biochemical  mechanism whereby the cell regulates this process.  This  work is significant for many reasons.  First, cell division  is one of the most fundamental processes of life, and a  better understanding of the mechanism would permit the  development of in vitro and in vivo  methods for  manipulating the process for various biotechnological ends,  both biomedical and non-medical.   Second, the process is an  excellent example of highly regulated, specific  biomacromolecular polymer assembly/disassembly  and  chemomechanical energy transduction.  A better understanding  of this process would permit its exploitation by engineers  and materials scientists, either directly as a biomolecular  \"smart\" material or indirectly through biomimetic  nanofabrication engineering.  ***",
