 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407350  Kron       The blueberry or heath family (Ericaceae) is a remarkably  diverse group of horticulturally and agriculturally important  plants.  It has a broad geographic distribution that spans both the  temperate and tropical regions of the world.  Many of the patterns  of diversity seen throughout the flowering plants as a whole can be  seen within the blueberry family alone.  For example, whereas most  of the members of the family are woody shrubs and trees, several  are herbs; most members are green and photosynthetic, but several  lack chlorophyll and are essentially parasitic; many are insect  pollinated but some are wind pollinated or pollinated by birds.   This diversity presents questions about the relationships among the  members of the family.  Using both morphology and DNA sequence  data, Dr. Kathleen Kron of Wake Forest University will provide an  assessment of the phylogenetic relationships of species of  Ericaceae.  DNA data are being collected from both chloroplast and  nuclear sources, and will in turn be integrated with morphological  characters used in traditional taxonomies of these plants.       The determination of phylogenetic or genealogical groupings  within the family will provide a framework for future studies in  such areas as biogeography, fungal host/parasite specificity, and  pollination biology, as well as provide reference data for detailed  taxonomic studies at genus and species levels.",
