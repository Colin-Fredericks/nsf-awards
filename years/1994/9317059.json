Because it is also one of the best  understood complex metalloproteins, it is an excellent system for  understanding how metal cluster are formed and inserted into  apoproteins.  This proposal addresses a central issue in that  phenomenon, namely, the requirements and role of a protein (termed  gamma) that associates with the apo-dinitrogenase (ApoI) and is  necessary for the insertion of the iron-molybdenum cofactor  (FeMoco) which serves as the active site of the enzyme.  The  results will have broad implications for protein folding and  maturation,  as well as for the mechanisms by which trace metals  are efficiently utilized by cells.  Active dinitrogenase is a A-2-B-2 complex comprised of the products  of nifKD.  The gene products of nifKD, N, E, and H are necessary  for the synthesis of FeMoco and strains defective in any of these  genes accumulate an active, apo-form of dinitrogenase.  In the case  of nifB, N, and E mutants, the apo-dinitrogenase is an A-2B-2  hexamer that is capable of being activated by purified FeMoco.  In  the case of nifH mutants, the apo-dinitrogenase exhibits as A-2B-2  structure and requires treatment with dinitrogenase reductase and  MgATP before it can be activated by FeMoco.  Because FeMoco is  \"buried\" approximately 15A below the surface of active  dinitrogenase, this insertion process must involve substantial  alterations of Apol conformation.  In Klebsiella pneumonia the gamma is the product of the nifY gene;  in A. vinelandii, the identity of the gene encoding gamma is  unknown, but it is not nifY.  We have evidence that gamma is  critical for insertion FeMoco in vitro and that it serves to  stabilize Apol in vivo.  We have also demonstrated that d  dinitrogenase reductase is necessary to promote the association of  gamma with Apol .  Finally, we have partially purified an activity  that stimulates the dissociation of gamma from the whole complex  follo wing activation by FeMoco.  We therefore have substantial body  on information on the entire pathway by which FeMoco is added to  ApoI and the aim of this proposal is to further define each of the  steps in this pathway at a molecular level. The goals of this  proposal are to (i) Define the mechanism by which gamma becomes  associated with ApoI.  This will involve purification of gamma from  A. vinelandii, characterization of other proteins and small  molecules that are involved in the association reaction, and  identification of the gene that encodes gamma. (iii) Define the  nature and requirements for the dissociation reaction.  For this  aim, we will purify the dissociation factor to homogeneity,  characterize the requirements of the reaction, and identify the  gene that encodes the protein.  In each case, the proposed analysis  specific will both address the specific aspects of dinitrogenase  maturation and lay the groundwork for determining the larger  cellular roles for the proteins involved.  The information gained  will provide a uniquely defined insight into metalloprotein  maturation, but it will also addressed larger questions in the  growing area  of how certain proteins help others attain their  final active conformation.  %%%  Dinitrogenase is an important enzyme because of its role in the  global nitrogen cycle.  It is also one of the best understood  complex metalloproteeins and is an excellent system for  understanding how metal clusters are formed and inserted into apo-  proteins (proteins lacking their metal centers or cofactors).  This  proposal addresses a central issue in that phenomenon, namely, the  requirements and role of a protein (termed gamma) that associates   with the apo-dinitrogenase (Apol) and is necessary for the  insertion of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) which serves as  the active site of the enzyme.  The results will have broad  implications for protein folding and maturation, as well as for the  mechanisms by which trace metals are efficiently util ized by cells.  The information gained by this project will provide a uniquely  defined insight into metalloprotein maturation, but will also  address larger questions in the area of protein folding which is an  active area of scientific investigation.  In these studies the  proteins and genes encoding the proteins will be isolated from  bacterial models such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Azotobacter  vinelandii which are easily manipulated systems and part of the  global biosphere involved in the nitrogen cycle.  ***",
