The  solutions are variational solutions, that is, minimizers or  higher critical points of energy or some other cost function.   The methods employed are symmetry and invariance in the form of  Fourier analysis, rescaling and iteration, curvature and  convexity, maximum principle and comparison functions, Green's  formula and more elaborate integration by parts formulas,  asymptotic analysis and perturbations and trial functions for  energy estimation.  The first problem is to estimate eigenvalues  of eigenfunctions defined on convex domains or on positively  curved surfaces.  Good estimation necessitates locating the nodal  line, that is, the arc where the eigenfunction vanishes.  The  problem of locating the nodal line is viewed as a two-phase free  boundary problem.  In addition, it work will be done on the  evolution to equilibrium for two-phase free boundary problems.  A  second problem to be addressed is a classical allocation problem  first proposed by Monge in the 18th century.  The problem can be  viewed as a linear programming problem.  It can be formulated as  one of deciding how to retrain a group of workers to fit new jobs  at minimal cost.  The approach to be used is geometric and  related to the study of volume-preserving maps of N-space and the  theory of the Monge Ampere equation, a fully nonlinear partial  differential equation.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these  approximations.  ***",
