An introductory  physics laboratory will also be affected. Short timescale (50 ns -  10 ms) events heretofore inaccessible in the laboratories will be  investigated using chopped or pulsed lasers. In the physical  chemistry laboratory a chopped helium-neon laser beam will be used  to study the thermal lens effect and measure the heat capacity of  a solvent. A pulsed nitrogen laser will function as the excitation  source in two other physical chemistry experiments. In one, the  kinetics of a colorful photoisomerization reaction will be studied  using the pulse-probe method. In another experiment students will  measure luminescence lifetimes to learn about factors influencing  radiationless electronic relaxation of excited metal ions, with  special emphasis upon collision-induced energy transfer. Chemistry  and physics students in an introductory physics laboratory will  receive an early exposure to modern optical methods as they use the  pulsed nitrogen laser to determine the speed of light. Several  benefits will accrue from this project. Topics previously  encountered only in the lecture portion of physical chemistry will  be brought to life in the laboratory. The instrumental backgrounds  of North Central College chemistry students will be greatly  enhanced by their encounters with the modular (rather than \"black-  box\") experimental apparatus, and students will get a taste of  modern experimental research methods in physical chemistry.",
