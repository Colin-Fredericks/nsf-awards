Engineers, Social Scientists, Planners, Construction  Professionals and Policy Makers will all be involved. In March of  1993, a delegation from the Earthquake Resistance Office.  Ministry of Construction (MOC), PRC, visited NSF in Washington,  DC. This proposed symposium/workshop is approved as a high-  priority activity endorsed by both agencies. This is a US-China  cooperative earthquake engineering research project.  ***",
