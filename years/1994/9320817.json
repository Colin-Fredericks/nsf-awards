Understanding the sources of  international trade, and the impact of policy on trade, continues  to be an important topic of academic and government inquiry.   Essential to this study are large data sets on trade flows and  other aspects of trade that span countries, industries and time,  and not only span them but are comparable across countries,  industries, and time.  Unfortunately, data of this type are not  readily available to researchers.  Each country collects trade  figures for its own purposes, particularly tariff collection and  the administration of other trade regulations.  Each country's  system is different, and has changed over time.  Even the  collection of many countries' data by the UN according to  successive versions of the Standard International trade  Classification (SITC) does not produce data that are consistent  over time or that fit the industry classifications of the United  States or the United Nations.  The result is that each trade  study involves heavy expenses, and investments of time and effort  to manipulate these extremely large data sets and ;put them in  analytically useful forms.  These expenditures of time and effort  are overlapping and duplicative, but despite the expenses  involved for researchers and agencies that finance research,  there is little carryover or sharing of information, and much  effort is wasted.  The purpose of this project is to construct,  assemble and concord a number of large data sets on international  trade and on country commodity and industry characteristics that  determine trade flows, and make them widely available.    The project will provide well-annotated and convenient trade sets  in machine readable form on U.S. imports and exports, world  trade, world prices, country resource supplies, and industry  inputs.  The data on country resource supplies is  especially  exciting.  It could be come a key data source for the study of  international trade patterns and global environmental change.   These data have also been used to study the determinants of  growth in capitalist versus socialist economies.  The existing  data set contains data on trade flows and such resource  characteristics as land differentiated both by use (arable,  pasture) and by climatic area for 34 countries in three year  intervals from 1958 to 1975.  The data exist in published form to  permit the number of countries int his database to be expanded  from 34 to over 90 with annual coverage to the present.",
