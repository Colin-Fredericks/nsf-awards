 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316975  Ayme-Southgate    Projectin is a giant protein present in Drosophila muscle,  which has been shown to share structural homologies with two  other giant muscle proteins, titin (from vertebrates) and  twitchin (from a nematode, C. elegans).  Their similarity is  found at the level of two amino acid domains present in all  three proteins and repeated many times in a regular pattern.  The functions of these proteins are under intense  investigation and titin is, at this time, the best  understood.  The different isoforms of projectin have been  implicated in several possible functions which are related  to the functions proposed for either titin or twitchin.  However, no specific role has been definitely demonstrated.  Partial information is available on the structure of  projectin but the complete amino acid sequence is still to  be determined.  The long term objective of this project is  to understand the structure and functions of projectin and  how projectin participates in the assembly and maintenance  of the myofibrils.  The specific aims are to: 1, determine  the projectin gene structure and splicing pattern for the  indirect flight muscle (IFM) isoform; 2, determine exons  specific for the IFM isoform; 3, determine the orientation  of the IFM isoform in the sarcomere (i.e., whether the N-  terminus is towards the Z band or the A/I junction).  To  achieve this last aim, two monoclonal antibodies will be  exploited which, by immunoelectron microscopy, have been  shown to specifically recognize epitopes at either the Z  band or the A/I junction.  %%%  Muscle cells possess a highly-organized subcellular  structure, with cytoskeletal elements and \"motors\"  exquisitely arranged to subserve the specific function of  contraction, and internal membranes arranged to subserve the  function of regulation of the contractile activity.  Although a great deal is already known about the  organization and structure of muscle cells, some unsolved  problems remain.  One of these unsolved problems conce rns  the role(s) of certain very large proteins (600,000 to  2,000,000 daltons), recently discovered, which are situated  within the A and I bands of the sarcomeres.  These large  proteins are arranged in periodic arrays in conjunction with  periodic arrays of proteins whose roles have been well  characterized in muscle function,  myosin (the \"motor\") and  alpha actinin.  Circumstantial evidence suggests that, for  one or another of these very large proteins, they may confer  elasticity to the muscle cell, or be involved in regulation  of contraction, or be involved in the general assembly of  myofibrils (the subcellular units of cytoskeletal  organization in muscle cells).  In the model insect,  Drosophila, there are at least two isoforms of projectin,  one found in synchronous  muscle and the other found in  asynchronous muscle.   These muscle types have significantly  different contractile properties: synchronous muscle is  \"regular\" muscle, and contracts once per nerve impulse,  whereas asynchronous muscle (also known as \"indirect flight  muscle\") contracts several times per nerve impulse, allowing  for the high frequency wing beat necessary for insect  flight.    The two different projectin isoforms are  distinguished by different molecular sizes and they have  somewhat different subcellular localizations in their  respective muscle tissues.  The experiments to be carried  out in this project will address key aspects of the  structure and function of these very large muscle proteins.  The information obtained from these studies should be  helpful in understanding the functions of these large muscle  proteins, not only in the very interesting case of insect  flight vs. regular muscles, but in all animals, including  humans.  ***",
