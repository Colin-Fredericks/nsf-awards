 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program will bring together two exciting, but previously  separate, approaches to the study of environmental biology:  modeling and experimental investigation of processes, versus the  analysis of spatial pattern.  The first approach (strongly  represented among UCSB's biologists) seeks to understand the  dynamics of ecological systems by analyzing the mechanisms that  determine the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems.   The second approach is well represented among geographers at UCSB  and involves an impressive range of techniques aimed at analyzing  pattern over a very large range of spatial scales.  We propose a  program involving which takes advantage of the potentially strong  synergism among quantitative geography, and experimental and  theoretical ecology.    The program involves (a) new cross-disciplinary courses, (b)  mechanisms and funding for students to gain industrial experience,  and (c) opportunities for thesis research in collaboration with  off-campus organizations.  Matching funds have been offered from  industry and from a state-funded program in toxicology.    To promote greater minority student enrollment in the program, we  propose a consortial relationship between UCSB and California State  University, Los Angeles (CSULA), a designated Minority  Undergraduate Institution that grants Bachelor's and Master's  degrees, but not the PhD degree.  Our efforts will focus on  students in CSULA's Environmental Research and Education Center,  whose acting head is an accomplished ecologist with expertise in  the research theme we propose, and with experience in developing  minority student research groups.",
