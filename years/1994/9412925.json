This project will inventory and quantify types of  ethical abuses involving technology in televised political ads.   The project will emphasize content analysis methods to inventory  and quantify types of technological abuses.  The project will also  use experimental methods for a preliminary testing of whether such  technological distortions affect voter judgments of political  candidates.  The findings of the project will provide researchers,  policy makers and political and media professionals with a better  understanding of the ways in which technology can affect the  American democratic process.  A pilot project has found that  sixteen percent of sampled political spots from 1952-1992 contain  ethically-suspect uses of technology, and that such distortions  occur more frequently in negative ads.  Results from this project  will be disseminated in traditional ways (journal articles and  professional convention presentations).  A videotape discussing the  problem of political ethics and video technology, providing samples  of misleading technological applications, will also be produced.  ***",
