The  major application of the lathe will be in a required junior level  mechanical engineering course titled Manufacturing Methods. The  proposed CNC lathe would be used in the SPC module of this course.  Using the lathe, student teams will conduct an experiment to  determine if a manufacturing process is capable and in control.  Each student team must determine what should be measured and how to  make the measurements. The CNC lathe permits the timely replication  of a sufficient number of parts required for these experiments.  Additionally, the CNC lathe requested has an on board computer  which can be programmed to produce \"good\" or \"bad\" identical parts.  This latter aspect is a necessary ingredient for the students to be  able to determine the effect of variables, such as feed rates and  spindle speeds, on process control. This is a unique approach (and  something that is lacking) from most current mechanical engineering  curricula. Knowledge and practical experience in CNC/CAM and SPC  are critical tools for today's mechanical engineering graduates  planning to pursue a career in manufacturing.",
