Representatives from academia, industry, and government will  participate in this conference to be held January 9-14, 1994.   An international audience is expected.  In particular, numerous  researchers from Pacific Rim and European countries have already  committed to participating in the conference.    The conference has multiple objectives.  First, to convene a  truly multi-disciplinary group of top quality researchers from  academia, industry and government to consider advances in  surface characterization of adsorption and interfacial  reactions.  Second, to provide a broad based forum for these  researchers to aid in cross-fertilization of their current  findings and ideas.  In particular, the Conference will focus on  utilization of new surface science technologies in the areas of  biomaterials, natural resources/environment, and materials  fabrication.    Support is requested for transportation, lodging, and  registration costs of invited U.S. speakers at the Conference.   It should be noted that only modest NSF support will be required  to augment substantial support already committed by industrial  sponsors.  ***",
