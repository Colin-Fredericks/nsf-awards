 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomass burning is a key component of past and future global change.  Fire profoundly affects atmospheric chemistry, the carbon cycle, and climate and may have done so for millions of years.  Literature estimates place carbon sequestration during biomass burning in excess of 20% of the total anthropogenic C releases to the atmosphere, which, failing oxidative losses, could tie up the globe's surface C in less than 106 yr.  Past fire is suspected to have been one of the dominant forces shaping existing patterns of biodiversity, past changes in C and O2 cycles, air quality, and climate.  Changes in the structure, distribution, and productivity of biomes forecast for the near future are contingent on poorly understood changes in burning practice.    Analysis of burning transitions that have attended past environmental change has become a tool for assessing its potential importance with climate and cultural change.  I propose to determine the role of fire and to quantify biomass burning emissions that have attended regional changes in climate and changing cultural practices of last 15,000 yr.  This interval spans rapid changes in global climate at the end of Pleistocene, changes in seasonality that have forced the glacial/interglacial modes of atmosphere and ocean circulation and therefore fire seasons, subcontinental scale changes in fuels with shifting vegetation types, cultural burning patterns, including slash-and-burn (swidden), modern agriculture, and industrialization.  The role of fire during past times of rapid climate change is especially relevant to challenges faced by modern resource managers in the face of environmental transformations of the next decade.    Lake sediments contain a legacy of past biomass burning in the form of combustion products that can be extracted from sediment cores.  By analyzing changes in the abundances of those constituents in successively older sediments we can determine how the importance of fire has changed together with other aspects of the environment.  I  plan to address several aspects of the paleofire record, including i) improvement of extraction methods for combustion products in sediments, ii) expansion of an incipient global data base on past emissions, and iii) extension of fire analyses from those currently underway in eastern North America and Siberia to tropical woodlands and grasslands in Brazil and east Africa, currently threatened by changing climate and intensive management, including widespread burning.  Together with previous results, we expect to establish a global picture of biomass burning back through the past.  Those estimates will be used with our knowledge of changing climate and cultural transition to determine whether fire was among the agents responsible for rapid environmental change.  These results will aid our interpretation of its potential role in future global change.",
