 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452407  Coler  The proposed project will establish a CAD Lab for the Drafting and  Design Program as well as the Electronics, Manufacturing  Engineering Technology and Automation/Robotics. Students will  benefit significantly from increased learning opportunities due to  three key aspects of the project; (1) advanced computer aided  design capabilities, (2) the networking of computers, and (3) the  interdisciplinary laboratory experiments. The equipment requested,  fifteen (15) 80486DX33 System Unit computers, fifteen (15) Autocad  Rel 12 software packages, Softdesk software, and Novell Network  software will be utilized with current equipment to establish a  drafting and design laboratory capable of replicating advanced  industry level design experiences. In the CAD Lab, students will be  able to solve problems related to manufacturing tolerancing, part  fit, and dimensioning factors which cannot be taught with manual or  two-dimensional techniques due to the tedious, repetitive nature of  those methods. Students will spend more of their time on problem  solving and projects requiring critical analysis and utilization of  design principles. Networking the equipment will increase each  student's access to design information and enhance opportunities  for teamwork in the design process. In addition, the project  proposes innovative experiments, incorporating equipment from other  related programs, that offer students the opportunity for  interdisciplinary cooperation in the production process. Thus, the  proposed laboratory improvement would both upgrade the education of  technical students in the disciplines affected by the project and  prepare a model for interdisciplinary curricula for other colleges.",
