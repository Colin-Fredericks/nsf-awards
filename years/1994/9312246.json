 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312246  Heskett    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research  in surface science between David R. Heskett, University of Rhode  Island, and Jesper Andersen, University of Lund, Sweden.  The  objective of their research is to investigate alkali atoms that  are adsorbed on metal.  They will use high resolution core level  photoemission spectroscopy.  The U.S. investigator brings to this  collaboration expertise in the properties of the adsorbate atom.   The project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the  Swedish investigator and provides access to a synchrotron  radiation source not available in the United States currently.    Alkalis are widely used in the chemical industry as promoters for  catalysts. They are also used in many devices and processes which  require the emission of electrons either thermally, chemically or  by photoemission.  This research could provide a basis for new  and improved uses of alkalis adsorbed metals in industry.  ***",
