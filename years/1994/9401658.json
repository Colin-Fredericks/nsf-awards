The principal investigators, in cooperation  with a similar team of researchers from the European Community,  define and organize the effort.  The objectives of the project  include but are not limited to assessing research that consider  empirical verification of the effectiveness of computerized speech  and language processing, that promotes further development of  natural language understanding, processing, modeling, and of speech  analysis, synthesis, and recognition, and that point to the most  salient research opportunities under the present circumstances in  the US and Europe.  The project also supports the collection of  information and the writing of a report and its dissemination.",
