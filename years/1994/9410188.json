The major goal for this project is to decide  which system of equations is best suited for the modelling of  physical problems in fluid mechanics.  The investigator will  study the systems both theoretically and numerically, and compare  results with laboratory experiments.  The investigator will also  be involved in developing and implementing an efficient algorithm  for the computer modelling of water waves through numerically  integrating the full Euler's equations.  The numerical results  obtained here will also provide a source for the verification of  Boussinesq systems.  In addition, the investigator will continue  research on the recently developed idea of Inertial Multigrid  Algorithms.  The dynamical behavior of the algorithms will be  studied from the perspective of bifurcation theory.        The investigator will study the bifurcation diagram  generated by the numerical approximation and compare it with that  of the underlying continuous problem.  In practice, this means  examining the numerical method for all range of the physical  parameters at once.  ***",
