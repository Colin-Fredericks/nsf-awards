 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project entitled  \"Electric Field  Interaction With Neuronal Tissue\" is to study the mechanisms  by which electric fields can control and modify the activity  of neurons.  Electric fields can be easily generated near  and around neurons in the brain by placing electrodes in  specific locations and injecting known amounts of current.  Previous experiments have shown that currents applied at  very small amplitudes are capable of preventing the activity  of neurons and to interfere with their firing patterns.  The  research is aimed at the determination of the basic  mechanisms underlying these effects.  The results of the  research proposal will allow us to better understand how  electric fields can control the activity of neurons and may  lead to the design of a method to prevent abnormal neuronal  activity such as in epileptic seizures.",
