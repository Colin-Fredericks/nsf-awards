The teachers includes content lectures and demonstrations, laboratory work,  chemical safety information, new ideas in pedagogy, practical teaching sessions with students  in an associated science camp, relationship of chemistry to the other sciences, chemistry and  technology, outreach techniques, and group projects.  It is anticipated that these 'enhanced  teachers' will on average reach out to an additional 35 teachers.  This results in a total of 3500  teachers being impacted.  In addition to the basic training in the workshops, those teachers who  provide local training are eligible to apply for and Affiliate Incentive Award program which is  used as seed money for obtaining much higher support from local sources to carry out the  ICE-like workshops at the local level.  In addition the ICE Network of more than 2500 teachers  will be maintained by a newsletter and a new computer-network communications which will link  ICE Field Centers, Affiliates, and participants via the Internet.  The cost share is $148,443 or  20.5% of the face value of Foundation support.  The project begins in 1994 and will run through  1995.",
