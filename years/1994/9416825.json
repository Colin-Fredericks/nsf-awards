The attendees will present, review,  debate, and summarize the principles which are thought to underlie  the perceived success of the German system and relate these  principles to the education system in the United States.   Recommendations will be made for educational institutions,  government agencies, and industry.       The purpose of the workshop is to contribute to the  acceleration of education and training related to design and  manufacturing.  It is intended to provide the opportunity for the  United States to learn from the German experience and to cause  thoughtful consideration of related approaches in the United  States.",
