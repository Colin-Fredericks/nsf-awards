 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317133  Rosenbaum     A new motility system in the flagella of the alga  Chlamydomonas has been discovered.  This motility, termed  IFT (intraflagellar transport) can be observed by DIC optics  as the bi-directional translocation of granule-like  particles beneath the flagellar membrane.  Electron  microscopy shows raft-like arrays of ball-and-stick-like  structures between the flagellar membrane and microtubular  axoneme that appear to connect the membrane to the flagellar  outer doublet microtubules.  There are sufficient numbers of  these arrays to suggest that they are the structures  observed moving with DIC optics. Epitopes for actin, myosin-  I, cytoplasmic dynein, and kinesin-related proteins have  been found in the isolated flagella, and a gene encoding a  flagellar kinesin-like protein has been cloned.  IFT looks  very much like neuronal axoplasmic transport, but there are  no vesicles in the flagellum.  Since axoneme assembly occurs  at the tip of the flagellum, IFT may be involved in the  translocation of proteins or protein complexes to the  assembly site, and also in the maintenance of the flagellum.  The nature of the motors responsible for IFT will be  determined, with emphasis on the possibility that  cytoplasmic dynein may be involved.  An in vitro IFT system  in permeabilized flagella will be developed. in order to  better characterize the newly described transport, and in  order to provide a rapid assay for movement.  This assay  will be used to test the nucleotide specificity of the  motility as well as the effects of specific inhibitors,  which may help identify the motors.  %%%  It is not often that a new type of motile subcellular  behavior is described, and particularly not often in a cell  type as well studied as Chlamydomonas.  Chlamydomonas is a  free-living, photosynthetic, motile, single-celled  eukaryotic alga, which has been valuable as a model system  for studying a variety of important cellular properties and  functions, including motility.  The best-studied mo tility  mode in this organism is its ability to swim by flagellar  beating, and studies on Chlamydomonas flagellar organization  and beating have often led to pioneering advances in the  field with direct applicability to understanding the  mechanism of beating in flagella and cilia of other cell  types, including sperm and respiratory epithelia.  The  organism is also capable of gliding, on the membranes of its  flagella, although this form of motility is not as well  studied as flagellar beating.  Now, a new type of motility  has been discovered in the flagellum, which appears to  consist of the transport of particles up and down the length  of the flagellum in the region just beneath the flagellar  membrane (between the flagellar axoneme and the membrane).  It is possible that this motility is similar to the movement  of particles along microtubular arrays in the axons of nerve  cells.  It is likely that other flagella and cilia also  possess this type of motility, and that the movement is  essential for normal flagellar function and/or maintenance.  The studies to be performed in this research project will,  first, establish a convenient in vitro assay for this  motility, and second, begin to use this assay to identify  the functional components of the system and determine the  mechanism.  Although the long-term practical applications of  this knowledge cannot really be predicted at this stage,  some possibilities may include issues of male fertility,  respiratory function, and nerve function, growth, and  regeneration.  ***",
