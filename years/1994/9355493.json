 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Physics will host  the eighth National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS) in  February 1994.  NCBPS'94 will be the continuation of a sequence of  such annual conferences that began in 1987.  The motivation for the  NCBPS is to assist and encourage those African-American students  who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter and  complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research and teaching  careers in Physics.  The idea for this conference series originated  with a group of African-American physics graduate students at MIT.   The conferences have been organized and implemented by students  (with faculty and staff assistance) at various host institutions  throughout the country.      The core information of the conference is transmitted through (1)  lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2) technical  presentations by current Black graduate and undergraduate students,  (3) workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on  graduate financial aid, and (5) forums on successfully completing  a graduate program in Physics.    The primary audience for the conference consists of undergraduate  students who are majoring in physics, or who have expressed a  genuine interest in the subject.  A principal goal of the  conference is to permit these students, who are in the process of  making career decisions that will shape the course of their working  lives, to meet and interact with Black graduate students, and Black  scientists who can serve as mentors and role models.***",
