The  student, a Puerto Rican native, will study how local \"cultural  centers\" in Puerto Rico define what it means to be Puerto Rican  in light of contesting claims for support and influence by  diverse groups.  Using participant observation, in-depth  interviews and a survey of a sample of Centers, the student will  study how \"cultural nationalism\" is influenced by these public  institutions.       This project is important because it will help explain how  local ethnic communities develop feelings of \"cultural  nationalism\" in contrast to a larger, dominant group.  Understanding how claims for legitimacy and resources arise among  ethnic groups is important to help society react to such claims  fairly.  In addition, dissertation research projects increase the  scientific capacity of the nation, and this particular project  will help train a minority scientist and so will add to the base  of minority scientists in the U.S.  ***",
