 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400232  Preparata  Recent research on parallel computation has focused primarily on  algorithmic design, and, more specifically, on the elucidation of  the inherent parallelism of a wide variety of problems.  This  approach has frequently de-emphasized the communication aspect of  parallel computation, and has placed no bound on the number of  deployed processors (granularity).  As parallel computing systems  appear on the market, a more global view than the identification  of parallelism is called for.  To contribute to this emerging  outlook, the following research topics are addressed in this  project:  (1) Since it appears that the more plausible parallel  systems of the near future are coarse-grained, (i.e.,  interconnections of moderate number of large, powerful  microprocessors), algorithms for this model must be  systematically developed to gain insight into general paradigms  (routing), and general communication primitives are to be  studied, for incorporation into the run-time system; (2) As  devices become smaller and faster, physical limitations become  increasingly relevant.  In a limiting technology, mesh-like  architecture's are the only scalable ones.  On such networks, it  is important to devise practicable shared-memory emulation  schemes (the P-RAM assumes an increasing role as a programming  model) to evaluate the effect of memory granularity and  hierarchy, and to investigate the structure and functionality of  the most suitable most modules.  (3) Locality has been long  recognized as an important source of efficiency in parallel  computing.  An intriguing relation between locality and area-time  theories of VLSI deserves careful scrutiny, since exploitation of  locality and emulation (of an architecture by another) appear to  be the key to program portability.  ***",
