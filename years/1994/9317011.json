 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317011  Burhans       Cis-acting sequences that promote initiation of DNA replicaton  reside within a 14 kb fragment of DNA derived from a broad region  where multiple initiation events occur downstream of the hamster  dihydrofolate reductase gene locus.  The specific aim of this  project is to determine the precise sequence requirements for  initiation in this locus by analyzing the ability of various  permutations of cloned sequences from this fragment to promote  initiation of DNA replication after the cloned sequences have been  integrated into the hamster genome.  To analyze these sequences  independently of position effects, they will be targed to a single  locus of the hamster genome by the bacteriophage P1 Cre  recombination system.  Origin activity will be measured by  application of several newly developed techniques that are capable  of detecting origin function in chromosomes containing single  copies of origin sequences.  Information provided by this study  should further our understanding of how cis-acting sequences  function in initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells.  %%%  A fundamental prerequisite to cellular reproduction is the precise  replication of the genetic information encoded in cellular DNA  molecules.  Replication of these molecules begins at specific  locations of the chromosome which are apparently determined by  sequence information at these locations.  This project will  determine what sequence information is required for initiating DNA  synthesis in a particular region of the hamster genome where  initiation of DNA replication has been observed to occur.   Determining what these sequences are will allow us to address the  question of how they work, and of how initiation of DNA replication  is coupled to regulation of cell proliferation.  ***",
