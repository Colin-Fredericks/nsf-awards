The co-  organizers are Professor Mulchand Patel,  Department of Biochemistry, State University of  New York at Buffalo, and Professor Yasuo  Kagawa, Department of Biochemistry, Jichi  Medical School.  Included among the U.S.  participants are several postdoctoral fellows  and graduate students.    Since the last international meeting on this  subject in 1988, there have been many important  developments in various aspects of the  structure-function relationship of component  proteins, the characterization of the genes,  and their involvement in several inherited  metabolic diseases.  The objective of the  seminar is to bring together leading U.S. and  Japanese scientists who have been responsible  for much of the recent development to discuss  current investigations of the structure,  function, regulation, and genetic aspects of  the alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes.   It is anticipated that this meeting will set  the stage for future research and enhance  collaborative research among scientists from  the two countries.  ***",
