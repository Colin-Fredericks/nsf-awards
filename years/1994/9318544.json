The structural polymers of plant defensive  barriers, cutin and suberin, will be examined using a new  technology, atomic force microscopy, that gives images at molecular  dimensions and thus could directly reveal for the first time the  molecular architecture of these complex polymers.  The nature of  the enzymes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cuticular  components will be elucidated by direct isolation of the enzymes  and by cloning genes uniquely expressed in the epidermis, the site  of synthesis of the cuticular components.  Molecular mechanisms  involved in the fungal penetration into plants will be elucidated.   How cuticular components and the ripening hormone, ethylene,  trigger germination and differentiation of fungal conidia to form  appressorium, the infection structure, will be studied by  elucidating the structure, function and regulation of expression of  the unique fungal genes regulated by the plant signals.  How the  unique cutin monomer acids trigger fungal cutinase gene expression  will be studied by isolating the transcription factors that bind  the promoter elements and by cloning the kinases that activate the  transcription factor binding.  After breaching the cuticular  barrier the fungal pathogen penetrates the pectinaceous barriers  using pectin degrading enzymes including pectate lyase.  The role  of regulation of expression of the various members of the family of  fungal lyase genes in pathogenesis will be studied by elucidating  the conditions under which each gene is expressed and by assessing  the effect of inhibition of expression of the genes by gene  disruption and antisense on the virulence of the pathogen.  The  results of the proposed studies will help to elucidate the basic  mechanisms involved in the interaction of pathogenic fungi with the  defensive barriers of pl ants.  Manipulation of these interactions  could provide new approaches to plant protection.  ***",
