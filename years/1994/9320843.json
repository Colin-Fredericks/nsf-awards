 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320843  Shleifer    Privatization of state enterprises has been one of the most  important economic changes that the world has seen in the last  two decades.  In several dozen countries, including France,  Britain, Italy, the United States (Conrail), as well as many  countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, public enterprises  have been transferred to the private sector.  An even more  striking change is privatization in Eastern Europe and Russia,  where almost whole economies are being transferred from public to  private ownership.  While it is generally believed that private  enterprise operates more efficiently than state enterprise, there  is very little work to explain why this is so.  For example, is  it the fact that politicians have direct control over operating  decisions in public sector firms or is it the fact that any  residual cash flow accrues to the Treasury?  This project  investigates empirically and theoretically the relative  efficiency of state and private enterprises in different  countries depending on such factors as public vs. private  ownership of cash flows, political vs. managerial control of  firms, levels of political corruption, degree of political  competition and the nature of the electoral system, and the  importance of the civil service.    The institutional and empirical work focuses on the privatization  process and its aftermath in Russia and Eastern Europe with  particular emphasis on Russia.  The broad areas of focus are: 1)  trends in the privatization process itself; 2) the evolution of  ownership structure and corporate governance; and 3) the credit  and subsidies to newly privatized vs. public firms.  The project  uses firm-level data available through Russian government sources  as well as data from a survey conducted by the investigators.",
