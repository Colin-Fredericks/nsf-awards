The  student will investigate political conflict in the Maldives.  Using ethnographic techniques of participant observation and in-  depth interviews, the student will examine how the local state  legitimates its actions by claims to religious authority, and how  that claim is contested by local religious practitioners of magic  and other informal religions.         This research is important because political power in many  states is legitimated by official claims of religious  authorization or legitimacy.  Advances in our understanding of  how this legitimization comes about, and how it is defended  against counter-claims, can help us deal with like situations of  political-religious conflict in other places.  The project will  also advance our scientific capacity by training a student in  social science techniques and in regional studies of the  important area of South Asia.  ***",
