The objective is to  study the sedimentation and subsidence in the  delta plain formed by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-  Meghna rivers on modern (100 years) time scale,  and since the glaciation (Holocene).  This vast  floodplain may be the sink for 40-80% of the  sediment discharged from this river system,  which is the world's largest.  An understanding  of the overall sediment budget for this system  has local as well as global relevance.   Quantifying and mapping sedimentation and  subsidence patterns is a prerequisite to  implementing flood control engineering in  Bangladesh where 35-40% of the country is  flooded annually.      Scope:  Extensive scientific and logistic  planning is required to integrate this study  with an existing joint Bangladesh-European  study of river hydrodynamics and morphology.   The visit will allow that coordination through  meetings with Bangladesh scientists and  government officials, and through field  examination of potential sampling sites.    ***",
