 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318232  McLaughlin       Among the estimated 16,000 species of basidiomycete fungi, the  familiar mushrooms and puffballs and bracket fungi of the world,  are forms without conspicuous fruiting bodies but possessing  microscopic spore-bearing structures.  The taxonomic relationships  of these numerous fungal forms are little studied, although many  economically important crop pathogens and ecologically significant  saprobic groups are included here.  As well, the phylogenetic or  genealogical affinities of these fungi, among themselves and with  the ascomycete fungi, are poorly known.  New molecular methods of  DNA sequencing promise large quantities of comparative data for  integration with current morphological and ultrastructural findings  for eventual taxonomic and phylogenetic synthesis.  Dr. David  McLaughlin at the University of Minnesota and postdoctoral  associate Dr. Eric Swann have started a major project to acquire  DNA sequence data for numerous representatives of the simple  septate groups of Heterobasidiomycetes, and to integrate these new  molecular data with traditional taxonomic characters.       Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the fungi hold great  promise for improving taxonomic recognition of the major lines of  evolution and for resolving longstanding controversies about the  origin and morphological diversification of saprobic and pathogenic  groups of basidiomycetes.",
