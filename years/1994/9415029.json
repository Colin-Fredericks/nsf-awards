 "awd_abstract_narration": "New College, the Honors College of the University of South Florida, is the recipient of ARI  funds to replace 9,778 square feet (911 square meters) of deteriorating marine biological research  space.  This project is part of a general enhancement of the natural science facilities.  Since the  inception of New College in 1960, independent research studies on marine organisms have been  an important part of the scholastic activities pursued by biology faculty and students.  The  marine facility reflects the central role that marine biology plays in the mission of a college that  borders Sarasota Bay.  Currently, research areas, seawater systems, and field equipment are  scattered across five building some distance away from the bay.  Completion of the facility will  increase productivity of research activities by permitting:  increased number of projects;  possibilities for studying a wider range of marine organisms and ecosystems; and better control  of environmental variables for maintaining and investigating a variety of organisms.  The new  facility will also have a significant impact on the number of New College graduates entering the  professional biological science pipeline, not only in traditional marine biology, but also in the  areas of behavior and community ecology, population genetics, reproductive and conservation  biology and neuroscience.",
