 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Guild Associates, 9360485      High quality paper, e.g., magazine paper, accounts for millions of tons of product per year.  A large portion of this paper consists of mechanical pulp which has characteristically weak fiber strength.  Newer paper machines and printers demand increasingly stronger pulp which is leading to stronger chemical (Kraft) pulp displacing weaker but less environmentally intrusive mechanical pulp.  Chemical (Kraft) pulp is more costly than mechanical pulp and chemical pulp plants are plagued with pollution problems.  The plants emit noxious sulfur containing gases.  Kraft plants can also discharge chlorinated hydrocarbons into receiving bodies of water, with unknown consequences for downstream communities and for the natural environment.  The objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to utilize ozone treatment of mechanical pulps to improve their strength properties while maintaining high optical and printing quality.  The results of the research will confirm whether such targeted ozone treatment of a fraction of mechanical pulp can sufficiently improve its characteristics to enable it to be substantially substituted for chemical pulp.    Ozone is a very strong oxidizing agent.  When exposed to mechanical pulp, it reduces the molecular weight of the lignin content in the pulp without loss of yield.  It is therefore surmised that ozone will promote fiber collapse, increase internal fibrillation and increase fiber to fiber bond strength.  These alterations will cause the relative bonded area in the pulp to increase and the strength properties to improve in the final paper products.  This is the basis for the ozonation treatment that is to be tested here.    The process will involve screening mechanical pulps to remove the long fiber fraction of the pulp from the medium and fine fractions.  The recovered long fiber fraction will be ozonated to increase its flexibility and blended back into the medium and fine fractions for use in paper making.  The fundamental condi tions required for the ozonation process will be determined, the characteristics of the pulp will be delineated, and the economics of the process will be evaluated.  The properties of the paper manufactured  from the pulp will be compared to high quality publication paper available in current markets.  If it meets or exceeds the same performance properties, a comparatively inexpensive mechanical pulp, manufactured by environmentally benign methods, will become a candidate to substitute for chemical pulp in publication paper markets.",
