 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416449  Freeman  Tilt-up construction is widely used throughout the U.S. for  lowrise industrial and warehouse facilities.  Tilt-up  buildings are economical to construct, however, they are  susceptible to seismic damage.  Approximately 25% of the  tilt-up buildings in the epicentral area sustained  structural damage during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.    The objective of this project is to develop procedures for  evaluating existing tilt-up construction and designing cost  effective rehabilitation schemes.  Establishing a link  between the structural characteristics of the building and  the expected performance during an earthquake is emphasized  in this study.    In-situ tests of tilt-up buildings will be conducted to  evaluate diaphragm stiffness, damping characteristics, and  displacement distributions.  The results of these tests,  together with data collected on tilt-up buildings damaged in  the Northridge earthquake, will be used to validate detailed  analytical models under development.  Existing retrofit  requirements as well as the latest proposed changes will be  reviewed and summarized.  Typical rehabilitation schemes  will be evaluated.    Alternate analytical models and design methodology that are  consistent with dynamic behavior of tilt-up construction  will be developed.    The results of this investigation will provide a basis for  evaluating the seismic vulnerability of and developing cost  effective rehabilitation schemes for the large number of  potentially hazardous tilt-up buildings throughout the U.S.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project, involving  complementary efforts between the University of Illinois and  a consulting engineering firm, Wiss, Janney, Elstner and  Associates.  ***",
