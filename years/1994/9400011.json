 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400011  Stevenson  Migration is a widely recognized but poorly understood phenomenon in the tropics.  Species that migrate need special consideration when developing conservation plans because they depend on at least two seasonal habitats and they may rely on resources at stopover sites allow the migration paths.  Recently the east-west migration of butterflies over the mountains near Monteverde, Costa Rica.  A surprising large fraction, approximately 80% (260 species), of the extant Pacific slope and lowland fauna move seasonally to the Atlantic side.  We will quantify the magnitude, direction and temporal components of migrants in the Monteverde region.  Changes in population levels and local resources of four focal species will be studied along the entire migration route.  A comparison of life-history, morphological, and physiological traits will be used to rank habitat specialization and the migration capability of species.  Comparisons will also be made between migrants and residents of the dry forest to examine their relative sensitivities to habitat fragmentation.  A broad geographic perspective on butterfly migration will be provided by surveys in other parts of Costa Rica.  Together these studies will advance the conservation of tropical invertebrates and increase our ability to identify the unique resource needs of migrant species.",
