The specific objectives are to: complete the  theoretical development of the three-dimensional, static,  biomechanical model combining the comprehensive effects of  strength capability, stability, and coefficient of friction,  develop the computer software to evaluate the model by  mathematical programming methods to deliver numerical  solution, perform bench top evaluation of the model, and  facilitate industry interaction and classroom evaluation of  the model to assure the relevancy of the research.    This research has potential utility for any situation in  which humans exert forces on an external environment.  Potential settings will be found in industry, aiding the  disabled, rehabilitating injured workers, and athletic  performance.  ***",
