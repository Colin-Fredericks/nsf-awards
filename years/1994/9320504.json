The work will include  theoretical models, empirical estimation and testing of theories,  and the construction and distribution of related data sets.    One data set contains panel data for 138 countries over the  period 1960 to 1990.  A major element of this set is information  on educational attainment by level and sex.  Other variables  cover national accounts, demographics, political variables,  government activities, and foreign trade.  Another data set will  include figures on income and migration across the U.S. states  and for regions of the major European countries, Japan, and  Canada.  Preliminary results on the growth rate of real per-  capita Gross Domestic Product for about 100 countries from 1960  to 1985 reveal a \"conditional convergence\" effect: countries that  begin with low per-capita GDP tend to grow faster if one holds  constant measures of initial human capital (in the forms of  education and health).  Government policies are shown to  influence a country's long-run position.  The results indicate  that growth is enhanced by better human capital, reduced market  distortions, a greater degree of political stability, and smaller  government spending in nonproductive areas.  The propensity to  invest is also positively related to growth, but it appears that  much of this relationship reflects the reverse impact of growth  on investment, rather than vice versa.  This empirical work will  be continued and additional research will be carried out on  regional data and on the long-period information that is  available for about 30 countries.",
