It is the purpose of this  research to continue to quantitatively examine and conceptualize  the effect of these activities on the rates of diagenetic  reactions, sediment-water solute exchange, and storage of organic  or mineral phases in sedimentary deposits.  A variety of field and  laboratory observations demonstrate that particle reworking and  irrigation activities of benthic fauna promote the remineralization  of organic matter.  Of the many simultaneous factors involved, two  may be particularly important: (1) repetitive oscillation of redox  conditions in the bioturbated zone, and (2) low metabolite build-  up. Both factors likely decrease eventual storage of organic  matter, or specific groups of organic compounds, in marine  sediments.  Experimental diffusion cells which mimic redox and  diffusive transport conditions in the bioturbated zone will be used  to further investigate these processes and test conceptual models  of remineralization in surface sediments.  Macrobenthic  bioturbation also enhances the importance of secndary oxidants  sucha s MN O2 and controls relative rates of coupled redox  reactions in surface sediments. These cycles couple strongly with  other elements, such as a variety of trace metals.  Detailed  experimental measures of Mn oxidation and reduction rates will be  used simultaneously with measures of particle reworking, net  fluxes, and solute profiles to develop a model of Mn cycling and  associated redox balances in bioturbated deposits.  The potential  semipermeability of biogenic structures to components of the  dissolved organic carbon pool (DOC) has major implications for  models of sedimentary DOC distributions, microbial activity, and  net sediment-water fluxes.  Diffusion cell measurements will be  performed to examine possible DOC fractionation across tube and  b urrow walls.  The long term goals of this research are a  quantitative description (model) of the types of transport and  reaction balances during early diagenesis and the exploration of  the corresponding geochemical and ecological implications.",
