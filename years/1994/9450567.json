 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 567  Armstrong  Idaho Native American Outreach Education    This NSF-Idaho EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Improvement (ESI)  initiative targets members of one of Idaho's educationally  disadvantaged minorities--the Native American (NA).  This is a  twelve-month science/mathematics/engineering/technology (SMET)  education partnership involving the University of Idaho (UI), the  Nez Perce and Coeur d'Alene tribes, the school and community  organizations affiliated with each tribe, the American Indian  Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and North Idaho College  (NIC).    The project focuses on four basic, systemic changes to the manner  in which SMET instruction is presented, supported and accepted in  small rural communities.  Under this initiative, scholastically  qualified NA high school students, plus high science/mathematics  teachers, a parent of each student, and two NA student teachers  will participate in an active hands-on summer of environmental  research, education and university experiences at UI.  The  environment is a topic of extreme interest to NA tribes in Idaho.   NA school and community professionals will assist in selection of  the participants and will provide team support and mentoring.   The summer experience will have a positive scholastic career  influence on the student, provide the teacher with a research  experience and additional classroom skills, encourage supportive  parental participation in the student education process, and  provide extraordinary pre-service experience for the student  teacher.  The summer laboratory and instructional period will be  followed by SMET-related educational activities throughout the  next academic year.  The post-summer team activities, coordinated  by the UI Project Director and supported by the school districts,  AISES and NIC, will include assessments, scholastic  guidance/counseling and professional group activities.  Pre-,  mid-, and post-summer support and mentoring will be provided to  the teacher-student-parent te am by respected members of  established NA community and professional groups.",
