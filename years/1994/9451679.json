 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451679  Haresign  There are two major, interrelated objectives of this proposal: 1)  To introduce and familiarize students to computer-based technology  in the life sciences, and 2) To use this technology to improve  laboratory instruction in three specific courses: Bioacoustics will  be an introductory level course in which students will make field  and laboratory recordings of acoustically active animals.  The  recordings will be digitized and analyzed in the time and frequency  domains using custom-written software.  Again, using custom  software, students will be able to manipulate specific parameters  of the sound, play the altered sounds back to the animals and so  determine the behavioral relevance of specific acoustic parameters.   Students will learn techniques and methods of science mainly  through hands-on experience.  In Physiology, an intermediate level  course, students will use the equipment to study such diverse  physiological phenomena as: extracellular multiunit activity,  properties of skeletal muscle, mechanical and electrical activity  of the heart, blood pressure and pulse rate, and neural responses  to visual stimulation.  Using the computers, students will not only  acquire data, but will also analyze and display it in ways not  available for data obtained with polygraphs or oscilloscopes.   Experimental Neuroscience is an intensive laboratory course for  upper level students.  Laboratory exercises will demonstrate a  number of neurophysiological concepts (electroreception, signal  transduction and mechanoreceptor activity, muscle spindle  properties, central visual processing) and techniques (single and  multiple unit extracellular recording, level discrimination, raster  displays, detailed analysis of extracellular spike activity).   Students taking these courses will show improved computer literacy  and an increased understanding of the concepts presented in lab  exercises.",
