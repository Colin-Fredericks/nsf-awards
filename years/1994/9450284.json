(MassPEP) in  collaboration with Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), the  Boston Housing Authority (BHA) and the Boston Public Elementary  Schools propose the model program Camp Tech II.  The purpose of  this program is to stimulate the curiosity and interest of students  (grades 7-9) in math, science and technology, Camp Tech II presents  an integrated math and science curriculum through hands-on projects  in robotics, computer applications, architecture, construction  science, electronics and environmental science.  The program format  includes a 6-week full day summer camp and 5 Saturday programs  during the school year.  The underlying theme of the camp  curriculum is how thing break, how things work, how things are  built and how people solve problems.  The curriculum is a joint  effort of MassPEP, WIT faculty, classroom teachers from the  collaborating school zones and industry professionals.  The Camp  Tech II program completed its pilot year (1993).  The academic  components of this program are balanced by physical fitness program  that enables students to learn about the importance of good health  and team efforts as they use math and science principles to chart  their scores, speeds and distances.  No country can afford to  pretend that a majority of its citizens are barely able to learn  simple arithmetic, everyday science and technology applications.   Young students need to be encouraged to maintain their natural  interest in the world around them and they need to see how this  world can be measured, predicted, and changed through the  application of various technologies and systems of discovery.",
