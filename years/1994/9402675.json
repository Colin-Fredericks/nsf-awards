 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402675  Sillen    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Sillen and his  colleagues will conduct biochemical work in the Pilanesberg Game  Reserve in South Africa. This technique development research will  provide information on a modern African food web and yield data  important for paleodietary research. The study will focus on  trace element variation at the base of food webs (plants) and  will also include interspecific and intraspecific variation in  primary and secondary consumers. The research design incorporates  controls for species, plant part, soil substrate, and season, and  sufficiently large numbers of specimens will be analyzed to  determine variability. Animal specimens will be examined to  ascertain trace elements for a number of species.     Paleodietary research plays an important role in archaeology  since scientists believe that the diet consumed during an  individual's lifetime leaves a chemical imprint on skeletal  tissues. Amounts of trace elements such as strontium are believed  to provide insight into the relative contribution of meat  consumed by an individual. However detailed studies which  indicate how trace elements in fact move through the diet web are  lacking and without them it is impossible to move beyond  generalizations based on rough empirical data. This work is  important because it will help to refine techniques of major  anthropological importance.",
