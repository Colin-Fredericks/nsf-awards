At the  same time, this instrument is being heavily utilized by students  (mostly majors) in more advanced laboratory courses in structure  elucidation, organic and inorganic synthesis, physical chemistry  and undergraduate research.  One instrument is meeting the  differing needs of students in these courses because modern FT NMR  spectrometers are so flexible.  They can be programmed to permit  the fast turnover needed to obtain many \"routine\" spectra while  retaining all of the potential needed for the full range of  experiments needed in more advanced work.  In the basic  (\"sophomore\") organic laboratory, we are able to give students the  opportunity to apply NMR to their own laboratory work, which  increasingly involves an \"investigative\" approach.  The logistics  of handling large numbers of students on one instrument are not  trivial.  In the advanced courses, where we deal with smaller  numbers, students have adequate instrument time, including  \"off-hours\", not only to obtain high-resolution spectra, but also  to do many other sophisticated experiments, including double  resonance decoupling, l3C-off resonance, NOE, 2D-NMR, variable  temperature and relaxation phenomena, etc.  In addition, we provide  students with our own library of spectra, recorded on \"their\"  instrument, to be used in lectures and associated study. This  instrument is having a major impact on the education of many  students - several hundred per year - by giving them access to a  modern FT NMR system.",
