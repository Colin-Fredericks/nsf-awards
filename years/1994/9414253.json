 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414253  Krusell    One of the implications from the recent literature on economic  growth is that economic policy, and particularly taxes which  affect the accumulation of physical and human capital, may have  important effects on economic growth and welfare.  The new  literature on political economy offers a theory of how policies  are chosen in which the interaction between politics and  economics is brought to the fore and used to address a series of  questions regarding the interaction between economics and policy  choice.  More specifically, this project addresses four aspects  of the political economy of growth:   (1) how politico-economic institutions explain time series data  on the income and wealth distributions, capital accumulation, and  tax rates;  (2) the political economy of the economic and political  transition taking place in Eastern Europe;  (3) the effects of political uncertainty on economic growth; and  (4) the development of new conceptual and computational tools for  politico-economic equilibrium theory.    This research could make important contributions to our  understanding of economic transition and transitional politics in  the former socialist countries.  This project develops a dynamic  model that formalizes the important properties of economic and  political transitions.  Preliminary results suggest that a simple  move to democracy will, besides creating an initial recession,  lead to relatively poor long-run performance due to the dynamics  of policy determination.  Under what conditions will vested  interests against rapid economic expansion build up and persist  over time and across generations?  The research focuses on the  political economy of adoption of new production techniques and  costly investment in human capital.",
