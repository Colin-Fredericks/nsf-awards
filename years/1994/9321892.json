These analyses should  reveal the long-term effects of interactions that may be  crucial in determining how natural communities are  structured;  4) to test with controlled field experiments  some hypotheses about mechanisms: a) that produce the unique  species composition of corals at the Inner Reef Flat site,  b) that cause contrasting patterns of algae after  disturbances, and c) that determine precisely how each  colony affects its neighbors;  5) to build mathematical  models and computer simulations of the dynamics of these  populations and communities of corals and algae: a) to  investigate the influence of past and present conditions on  future changes, b) to characterize temporal and spatial  dynamics, and c) to test hypotheses about the consequences  of these dynamics to the community.  The models will be also  used to asses the degree to which community structure and  dynamics may or may not be influenced by details of spatial  relationships.         The field methods will use the standard sampling  techniques used over the past 30 years, to assure continuity  in the long-term data base.  The experimental methods, using  coral  transplanting and cages to exclude larger herbivores,  have also been used before in this study and are well-  established.  Larval  choice experiments and new recruit  t ransplants have been carried out successfully by the co-  investigators elsewhere on the Great Barrier Reef.         The significance of this proposed research to the  advancement of knowledge is that: 1) it deepens the general  knowledge of how natural communities of corals and algae  (the dominant sessile organisms on tropical and sub-tropical  reefs), are assembled and structured in the face of changes  in their environment over extended periods of time; 2) it  reveals some of the mechanisms that link the environment  with these community changes, and how both vary over short  and long time periods and between small and larger spatial  scales; and 3) it helps to predict the effect of  environmental changes, including those caused by human  activity, on these natural communities.",
