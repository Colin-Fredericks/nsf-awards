The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr.Carla  M. Koehler of  Iowa State University to  work with Dr. Gottfried Schatz at the University of Basel in  Basel, Switzerland.    This research proposal concerns fundamental questions of  cell biology related to biogenesis and protein exchanges.  In particular, it intends to characterize the mitochondrial  outer membrane import machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Dr. Koehler will use genetic techniques to clone suppressors  of one mitochondrial import receptor.  Specifically, the  goal  is to see how Mas20p and Mas70p, two import receptors,  function as receptors.  Use of the two hybrid system and  biochemical techniques will reveal whether they interact  with each other and imported precursors.  Other proteins  located at the import site and in the cytosol will be  identified by screening a cDNA library using the two-hybrid  system, and the interaction between cytosolic factors and  the receptors will be examined further using biochemical and  biophysical  methods.  This research is likely to advance  current understanding of events at the cell membrane. ***",
