 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an Academic Research Infrastructure project to upgrade an  existing lidar system at Utah State University (USU).  It is a  collaborative effort that includes investigators from USU, the  University of Maryland, Clemson  University, the University of  Pittsburgh, and University College London.  The lidar system  provides measurements from which continuous profiles of atmospheric   temperatures, densities and winds can be derived.  The results will  be used to study the transport of energy and momentum from the  lower atmosphere to the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  The  continuous observations over a long period of time will shed light  on climatological questions relating to global change.  The upgrade  to the lidar system will increase the sensitivity of the instrument  by about a factor of thirty.  This is to be accomplished by  constructing a telescope with a collecting area of 5 square meters.   The project includes the construction of a building to house the  lidar on the top of the Science and Engineering Building at USU.   After the upgrade the lidar system will be one of the most powerful  of its kind in the world.  The data will be made available to  atmospheric scientists and students.",
