 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Duke University requests $700,000 to enhance capabilities of  the National Phytotron by the addition of 18 new controlled  environment (CE) chambers.  The Phytotron, an NSF-funded  national research facility established in 1968, consists of  40 artificially lighted CE growth chambers and 6 glasshouses  that provide more that 477 m2 of controlled environmental  space for advanced research in environmental plant biology.  These CE units are used to reproduce different types of  environments -- ranging from the arctic to the desert to the  tropics.  This allows researchers to have precise control  over environmental conditions, e.g., air temperature,  irradiance, carbon dioxide, relative humidity, and nutrient  concentration, thereby providing an opportunity to gain  increased understanding of the complex interactions between  plants and their environment, which is virtually impossible  to do under natural, uncontrolled field conditions.  The  Phytotron hosts, on yearly average, 17 students, 4  postdoctoral scientists, and 20 senior scientists, 73% of  whom are off - campus users.    The Phytotron's current CE growth chambers have operated  continuously for 25 years.  While some have been upgraded,  their limited analog controls are not adequate for precise  and flexible control of multiple environments variables,  e.g., temperature, light, and humidity.  In addition, these  older chambers lack sophisticated computer-based monitoring  capabilities, thus limiting researchers' abilities to  monitor experiments and to reproduce short-term, variable  environmental conditions, which are critical to  understanding processes like carbon allocation,  photosynthesis, and acclimation.  Over the past decade, the  environmental factors that researchers have most frequently  manipulated in the Phytotron are the effects of carbon  dioxide and temperature -- other factors include drought  stress, nutrient availability, photoperiod, UV-B radiation,  and salinity.  With Excelle nt lighting, digital controls,  and real time monitoring, the 18 new controlled environment  chambers will provide the flexible, quality-controlled  environment needed by a range of projects, including  molecular, whole-plant (including such as areas as leaf  physiology and growth dynamics), biotic interactions (e.g.,  plant-plant and plant-animal interactions and pathogens),  population genetics, and ecosystem microcosms.    Acquisition of these 18 state-of-the-art chambers will have  an immediate and substantial impact on U.S. ecological  research, particularly studies on the effects of global  change on plants and ecosystems, efforts to scale processes  across biological levels of organization, and basic  molecular and physiological studies of carbon fixation,  allocation, and respiration.  This instrumentation will  build upon and enhance NSF's investment in ecological  research and allow the National Phytotron to address  national needs in the biological sciences, including  graduate and postgraduate education, and to remain one of  the most important centers for controlled environment  research in ecology in the United States.",
