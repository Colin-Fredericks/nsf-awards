 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401740  Mather       Mather intends to continue his work on dynamics of  Hamiltonian systems.  In the past, much of his work has been on  dynamics of area-preserving mappings and autonomous systems in  two degrees of freedom.  More recently, he has extended part of  this work to more degrees of freedom, in his recent paper,  \"Variational Construction of Connecting Orbits.\"  However, this  paper is only a beginning in this direction, in the sense that it  should be possible to obtain similar results under much more  general hypotheses.  Proving the existence of connecting orbits  between minimal sets under more general hypotheses will be a  major part of Mather's research.       As an example of what one might do with such results,  consider the restricted three-body problem in the plane, i.e. the  mechanical problem with a Newtonian gravitational potential, two  massive bodies and one body of zero mass, all in the plane.  In  the case that the two massive bodies move about one another in  circular orbits, Moser showed, in the early 60's, that if the  zero mass body moves in an approximately circular orbit a long  distance from the massive bodies, then it does not escape to  infinity.  Thus one has stability.  This is part of KAM theory.   In contrast, if the massive bodies move about one another in  elliptical orbits, no such result is known.  Mather's methods  might lead to a proof that such a result is false.  There are,  however, major hurdles to be overcome before this program can be  carried out.  ***",
