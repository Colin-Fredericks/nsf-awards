 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chin    The Wilmore Laboratory, constructed in 1947, houses the research programs of  Chemical, Civil, Materials, and Mechanical Engineering on the campus of Auburn  University.  The majority of laboratory space is utilized for research and research  training in Chemical and Materials Engineering.  In addition, the building houses two  university  service facilities, electron microscopy and chemical analysis laboratories,  which support activities of faculty members engaged in  engineering and physical  science research.  Approximately  300 scientific personnel use the facility to conduct  research activities.  However  due to the age and the deteriorating condition of the  Laboratory, the quality of research and research training performed in the facility has  been severely restricted.    This award will provide funding for the renovation of engineering research space.   Specifically the renovations will include: improving the electrical, HVAC and plumbing  systems, modernizing fire safety systems, providing handicapped accessibility in the  building and replacing the roof.  Installation of clean rooms, new chemical fume hoods  and fume extraction systems will allow faculty to participate in new avenues of  research such as the development and fabrication of intrinsically adaptive materials.   Certain activities that were curtailed due to safety considerations will resume once  renovations are completed.  Because the College of Engineering is the largest in the  state of Alabama and minority groups are strongly represented in the state, this  infrastructure project will significantly improve Auburn's efforts in recruiting minorities in  engineering.",
