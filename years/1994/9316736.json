 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316736  Raymond  Recently it has been shown that diatoms from sea ice platelets in  McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, release a proteinaceous, ice-active  substance that, at natural concentrations, causes dense pitting  on the basal surfaces of growing ice platelets.  At present, only  fish, insects and bacteria are known to produce an ice-active  substance.  Thus, the ice-active substances associated with sea-  ice algae are of interest because it is the first to be associated  with algae, and it may provide new insights on how biomolecules  interact with ice.  The objectives of this project are to  biochemically, biophysically and physiologically characterize the  ice-active substance.  On a biochemical and biophysical level,  the objectives are to purify the ice-active substance, to  determine its chemical composition and structure, and to  characterize its effect on the growth of ice crystals.  On a  physiological level, the objective is to determine the  relationship between algal production of ice-active substance and  the environment.  More specifically, what is the temporal and  spatial distribution of the ice-active substance in McMurdo  Sound, how is its production influenced by temperature and light,  and among which species and habitats is it found?  The long-term  goal of project is to understand what role ice-active substances  play in the sea-ice algal community.  ***",
