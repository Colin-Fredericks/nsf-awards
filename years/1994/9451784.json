The project addresses a serious  deficiency in the optics curriculum within the physics department.  This project will establish a modern optics laboratory course and  complete the equipping of a recently constructed teaching  laboratory. The aim of the project is to improve the physics  curriculum by initiating a laboratory-based course centered on  modern optical devices and techniques, with signal detection and  processing. The project is significant in that it provides an  important next step in an intentional plan to improve the physics  program and utilize the interests, commitment, and expertise of new  faculty in the department. The project also has the added benefit  of encouraging students to pursue graduate study by exposing them  to contemporary topics in physics. A variety of experiments will be  performed with equipment provided for this project, which include,  as major pieces, an optical table and breadboards, a photon-counter  and associated detector, an air-cooled Argon ion laser, diode laser  heads and controllers, an acousto-optic modulator, and a data  acquisition and analysis system. The experiments to be performed  include \"single photon\" diffraction, optical fiber communication,  heterodyne and Mach-Zender interferometry, coherent back  scattering, diode laser characterization, quasi-elastic light  scattering, and optogalvanic spectroscopy. The impact of the  project will also be felt in courses such as Life Science Physics,  Classical Physics II, and Experimental Modern Laboratory, as well  as in faculty-student research. The PI is committed to the  successful completion of the project and the department has an  outstanding record on previous NSF ILI grants.",
