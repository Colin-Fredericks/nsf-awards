The term \"applied intelligence\" refers to the technologies: expert (knowledge-based) systems, fuzzy logic systems, and artificial neural system (ANS).  These supporting technologies combined with robust control and automated modeling techniques offer a tremendous potential when confronted with unstructured environments like manufacturing processes.  Real-world (unstructured) operating conditions, such as those found in manufacturing processes, are characterized by noisy sensor and actuators, as well as  process noise, drifts, system faults, and external disturbances.  This project will construct a \"nervous system\" for a machining center that will observe various states of the machining system, :learn\" the dynamics of a machining process, construct corrective codes, and initiate control.  The approach will incorporate the \"experience\" into a knowledge base leaving an insightful trace about the signal processing capabilities of artificial neural networks, knowledge representation tools like fuzzy systems, and robust nonlinear control techniques like sliding mode control, is designed to be \"intelligent\".  ***   v       s  t     M    (  9313947  Fernandez  According to the report of the Office of Science and Technology Program, Executive Office  of the President o    f   u                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a   f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          $                                (                  F                    /                                                                                                          f                         u         f     1    Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica  5 Courier New                     \" \"             \"             h      B e B e          (             S   R:\\WW20USER\\ABSTRACT.DOT abstract    Alicia E.
