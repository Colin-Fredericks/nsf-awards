 "awd_abstract_narration": "UNIAX has developed a series of ester-substituted soluble                       poly(para-phenylenes) PPP for use as active layers in blue and                  violet light emitting diodes (LEDs).  The synthetic route is                    simple, conducive to large scale, and allows for a wide variety of              derivatives - making other routes into blue luminescent conducting              polymers seem awkward or obsolete.  Derivatives have been tailored              to have solubility in non-polar solvents such as hexane or in polar             solvents such as ethanol.  Films spun-cast directly from solution               are pinhole-free and transparent, but take on a violet or blue hue              in reflected sunlight.  Photoluminescent spectra for all                        derivatives prepared are reported (luminescence energies for some               derivates exceed 3.0 eV), and the fabrication of a prototypes LED               device using one of these stable room-temperature processible PPP               derivatives has been achieved.                                                                                                                                  The goal in developing this preliminary research into a                         commercially attractive portable display involves purification of               the conducting polymer active layers to optimize the efficiency,                and to systematically investigate diode characteristics                         (efficiency, or \"brightness,\" and light emission turn-on voltage)               as a function of active layer thickness, nature of the transparent              electrode contact, and nature of the metal electron-injecting                   contact.  The research will also include research into synthesizing             a green luminescent PPP, making use of the finding that electron-               releasing groups red-shift the luminescence.",
