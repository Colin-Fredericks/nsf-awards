 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hardware and software requested in this proposal will help  Heritage College achieve its 5-year goals and supply equipment  needs not covered by other funding.  It will 1) enhance the content  of Environmental Science curriculum, 2) to provide opportunities to  put classroom knowledge into practice and provide the tools needed  for meaningful student research, 3) also to prepare students for  successful internships, and 4) help students contemplating a career  in environmental science to visualize its exciting possibilities.   The specific equipment requested will include:  1)  Silicon  Graphics workstation with 32 meg RAM, UNIX OS, 2 Gbyte disk  storage, CD-ROM reader, and 8 mm tape backup drive, 2) Dynamic  Graphics data visualization software; 3) FORTRAN and C compilers;  $) ARC/INFO software; 5) Digitizing board; 6) Plotter; and, 7)  Color and Postscript monochromatic Laserwriter.  The Silicon  Graphics workstation (item 1) is the basic processor unit mass  storage, and input/output equipment needed to assemble the  workstation and use all GIS software at the data file size level  and with a processor speed comparable to Federal agency and private  environmental science organizations.  This workstation will help  train students on equipment that they are most likely to use on the  job, fully integrate the College with the Pacific Northwest  Laboratory computational network, and provide minimum level of  computational platform required by faculty in research.  Dynamic  Graphics data visualization software, FORTRAN and C compilers, and  ARC/INFO software (Items 2, 3, and 4) are required for GIS software  and data visualization, and to write pre-and post-processing code  and allow for general programming tasks and instruction.         The digitizing board (item 5) is required to enter map based  data and hard-copy spatial data into the GIS program.  The plotter  (item 6), and the Color and Postscript monochromatic Laserwriter  (item 7) will allow for larger scale maps that can be taken into   the field or used for presentation, briefings, and publication.",
