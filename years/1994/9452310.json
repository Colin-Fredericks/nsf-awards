 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Weather Graphics and Simulation Laboratory (WGSL) at San  Francisco State University (SFSU) is being expanded.  Operated by  the Meteorology Program of SFSU's Department of Geosciences, the  WGSL currently provides real-time weather data, graphics, and  simulation software in support of the Meteorology program  curriculum.  The WGSL is used by the faculty in their preparation  of lectures and laboratory exercises to help students visualize the  evolution of weather features and to enhance their understanding of  the basic physical principles that control the behavior of these  events.  We identified the following major needs in the Meteorology  curriculum: (a) to help students simultaneously visualize the  evolution of atmospheric phenomena and analyze their physical  causes and (b) to foster an environment in which students will  engage in \"what if\" discussions that involve the manipulation of  real weather data to construct different scenarios that involve the  manipulation of real weather data to construct different scenarios  and predict their outcome.  We have observed that students learn  difficult concepts best when they can work in small groups,  together visualizing atmospheric data, articulating problems and  working out solutions.  New computer equipment and software are  being used to augment the SGSL facilities to provide students with  a collaborative learning environment in the affected classes where  they have simultaneous access to weather data and a variety of  analysis software.",
