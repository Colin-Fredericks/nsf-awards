 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extracellular serine proteases are required in several  signal transduction systems in order to generate  extracellular ligands.  These include some relatively well  characterized systems involving EGF, TGF-a, CSF-1, and KL-1.  The proteases involved in these systems, however, have not  been extensively characterized.  A newly described signal  transduction system is one which specifies the dorsal-  ventral axis during the embryonic development of Drosophila  melanogaster.  The available data suggest that at least  three serine proteases are required in this signaling  pathway.  This investigator is interested in elucidating the  role of these proteases and understanding how their  activities are regulated.  These serine proteases are  encoded by the maternal effect genes snake, easter, and  gastrulation defective.  These proteases are secreted into  an extracellular compartment called the perivitelline space  as inactive proenzymes (zymogens).  Activation of the  zymogens involves a protease cascade and the end product of  the cascade is proteolytic cleavage of the spaetzle protein  into a ligand for the Toll receptor.  This investigator has  developed a method of producing biologically active  recombinant proteases; he has set up several in vivo and in  vitro assays for the activities of these enzymes.  The  biochemical interactions of these components are fundamental  to the mechanism by which a signal is produced in the  perivitelline space.",
