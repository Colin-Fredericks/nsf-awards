To this end, EDC plans to develop an  \"associates-in-residence\" program that would allow  mathematics educators to spend a non-trivial period of time  at EDC in order to observe and participate in the life of  some of EDC's on-going teacher enhancement projects .  Such  a residential program would serve to provide the associates  with both the intellectual, as well as the \"nuts and bolts\"  background needed to design and direct viable projects of  their own. The present project is a 6-month planning project  that includes a small pilot version of such a program.   The  project invites 2 mathematics educators from under-  represented and under-served groups to spend 5 weeks at EDC  during Summer 1994 to observe and participate in the work of  3 of its teacher enhancement projects.  In addition, project  staff provides support to the 2 associates in designing  their own projects, and writing proposals to fund them.    The in-kind contributions from non-NSF sources equal 8% of  NSF's contribution.",
