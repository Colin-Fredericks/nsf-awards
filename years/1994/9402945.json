 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402945  Shen    Shen proposes research in two areas:  time almost periodic parabolic  equations and lattice dynamical systems. Both areas are frequently  encountered in applications, for example, time almost periodic  parabolic equations often occur in the theory of nerve pulse  propagation and population genetics, coupled map lattices serve as  useful models to describe various spatio-temporal structures in fluid  dynamics, chemically reacting systems, biological networks, etc.  Though much research has already been devoted to these two areas,  many important and fundamental issues are still far from being well  understood. In doing research on time almost periodic equations, Shen  will focus on the long term behavior of general bounded solutions, the  existence of specific  solution types and their stability and  bifurcations, the existence of global attractors and their structures.  Meanwhile, Shen will pay particular attention to those properties of  almost periodic equations which do not arise in the  periodic case  (there is strong evidence in her recent work and the work by many  other researchers that time almost periodic equations are  distinctively different from periodic ones). In doing research on  lattice dynamical systems, Shen plans to develop general ways to study  the existence of chaotic solution structures and to establish  stability criteria and bifurcation scenarios for these classes of  solutions. Moreover, Shen intends to give a detailed  description of  the dynamical behaviors for discrete versions of certain differential  equations related to nerve pulse propagation, fluid dynamics,  chemically reacting systems, etc.    Shen proposes  research in two areas: time almost periodic parabolic  equations and lattice dynamical systems.
