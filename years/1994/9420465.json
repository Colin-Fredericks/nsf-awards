Particular focus will be on chemical issues  associated with the rapidly expanding and technologically relevant  areas of nanotechnology and chemical sensors.  Additionally there  will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties  between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is  expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the  Symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate  the critical scientific issues in this research area, and to  consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address  them.  %%%  An evaluation of the status of chemical aspects and perspectives of  microelectronic materials, and especially the critical chemical  issues in nanoscale technology, and recommendations by the  Symposium participants for the emphasis of future work, and their  assessment of the most important contemporary research issues will  be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of  chemical methodology in the field of microelectronics.",
