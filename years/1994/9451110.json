 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451110  Foos  This proposal request funding for an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP) and field equipment  necessary for collection of aqueous geochemical data for a geochemistry class research project. The  objective of the project is to increase undergraduate exposure to sophisticated analytical equipment and  provide them with a research experience within the context of a traditional geochemistry laboratory  course. The class research project will be integrated into a series of existing computer based laboratory  exercises. The class will develop a sampling plan, attend a field trip where they will collect samples plus  make on site measurements and they will analyze the samples for major, minor and trace elements in the  laboratory. Students will incorporate these data into exercises on data quality, graphical presentation of  data, ionic strength, ionic activity, carbonate equilibrium, Eh-pH diagrams and WATEQ4F. The final  results of the project will be presented by the students as a poster at a regional scientific meeting. The  first year of the program the students will determine the water quality at Silver Creek Metro Park  (Summit Co Ohio). The objective of the study will be to determine if acid mine seeps of a reclaimed strip  mine, within the park, adversely effect the quality of surface water.",
