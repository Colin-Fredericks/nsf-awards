There are five specific aspects   of these diiron complexes that will be studied. The first is   the synthesis and resolution, if necessary, of optically pure   chiral complexes. Second is the investigation of reductive   cleavage of the metal from the inital products which will allow   the metal portion of the molecule to be recycled. Third is the   study of the utlity of the formation of thioesters from the   oxidation of the diiron acyl complex. Fourth is the examination   of these complexes as asymmetric Michael acceptors. Fifth is   the investigation of the chemistry of the decarbonylation   product.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Scott R. Gilbertson of the Department of   Chemistry at Washington University. Professor Gilbertson will   focus his work in the area of synthetic methodology by studying   the use of diiron organometallic complexes to accomplish a   number of novel synthetic transformations.  ***",
