The first part is concerned with a new finding on  the stability of oscillatory two-phase Couette flow.   It has  been shown that periodic modulations in the background state can  completely stabilize interfacial modes in the long wave regime.   These results will be extended to all wavelengths by use of  Floquet theory and numerical integration of the governing system,  and with analysis where appropriate.  A parallel project will  address oscillatory two-phase core-annular flow both in the  linear and nonlinear regime by study of dissipative partial  differential systems and use of tools taken from dynamical  systems theory.  Nonlinear evolution equations in both two and  three dimensions will be derived and solved numerically in order  to model the nonlinear stability of two-fluid flows in  cylindrical geometries.    There are numerous technological and natural processes where  instabilities in two-fluid flows are important and need to be  understood.  Examples include, among others, lubricated  pipelining for the transport of viscous crudes, extrusion  processes, enhanced oil recovery, coating processes, directional  solidification in melt-grown crystal technologies, and production  of photographic film.  Biological applications include the  collapse of pulmonary vessels in new-borne babies due to  interfacial instabilities leading to rapture of the fluid  covering of the tube walls.  There are a number of other evolving  technologies both ground-based as well as in microgravity  environments which require a fundamental understanding of  interfacial instabilities and rheology.",
