 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Texas at Austin  Gustavo A. de Veciana  RIA: Resource Management for Networks: Service Provisioning, Flow  Control, and Robustness    This focus of this work is the development of resource management  schemes for communication networks.  Model based approaches using  effective and decoupling bandwidth constraints that guarantee both  individual and aggregate quality of service requirements are  investigated. The emphasis is on practical issues, as well as on  understanding the accuracy of these approximations at the network  level.  Further study of these concepts should elucidate the impact  of flow control on network capacity.  Since, in practice, traffic  statistics and demand may be unknown or time varying, methods for  on-line estimation and control are also investigated.  For example,  a self-tuning rate control throttle is proposed which could in  principle minimize a traffic stream's burstiness subject to a loss  or delay constraint by monitoring the arrival process.  This is a  first step towards intelligent networks that monitor, learn, and  adapt to the traffic statistics and demands.  The final goal of  this research is to develop comparison methods based on the  \"robustness\" of a performance guarantee for a given traffic stream.",
