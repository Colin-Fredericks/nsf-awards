The CsgA gene  product, the C-signal, is a novel type of developmental timer whose  extracellular concentration rises steadily during fruiting body  formation of the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus and induces  successive stages of the developmental pathway at successively  higher concentrations.  These studies are expected to reveal how  the C-signal is perceived by developing cells to express rippling,  aggregation, and sporulation genes.  The CsgA receptor gene will be  identified and cloned using one of four approaches : dosage  suppression, construction of heterologous signaling systems  containing components from different myxobacterial species, reverse  genetics following purification of the receptor protein, or  molecular recognition. Putative receptor genes will be sequenced  and examined for amino acid homology with known receptors.  The  chromosomal wild type allele will be replaced with a disrupted  allele to determine if a receptor null mutation blocks development  at the same point as a csgA null mutant.  Radiolabeled CsgA will be  used in binding studies to determine the associate constant and  receptor number during different stages of development.  The  cellular location of the CsgA receptor will be determined by  colloidal gold electron microscopy.  Genetic analysis of the socA  (for suppressor of CsgA), and socB suppressor loci will continue,  to learn the normal developmental roles of the wild type suppressor  genes as well as the mechanisms by which the mutant alleles  suppress csgA mutations.  %%%  This research allows the techniques of bacterial molecular genetics  to be used to answer fundamental questions about how cell  differentiate.  Dr. Shimkets is studying a type of cell- to cell  communication that  up until know was only known in higher  organisms.  ****",
