 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307909  Klinzing    An advanced control system to optimize the operation of pneumatic  conveying equipment will be investigated, using as input the  pressure fluctuations which is naturally induced by two-phase  solids-gas flow in pipes.  The flow pattern to be optimized  determines the energy consumption, the operation life of the  equipment, and the stability in operation.  Computer control, fuzzy  logic analysis and neural network techniques will be developed and  applied, in order  to obtain a stable and economical flow pattern  in operation.  The recommended control techniques will be  transmitted to industrial partners, who will form an \"industrial  advisory board\" to review the research progress and its transfer to  industry.    The proposed research may have important results for increasing the  efficiency and reliability of pneumatic transport in chemical  manufacturing, mining sites, pharmaceutical and food industry.   This is a university-industry collaborative research project, as  defined in the NSF Announcement GOALI (Grant Opportunities for  Academic Liaison with Industry, NSF 93-149).  ***",
