This research is carried out at the High Pressure Laboratory at the  University of Alabama at Birmingham and the National High Pressure  Beam Lines at the CHESS and NSLS Synchrotron Facilities.  Metals  and alloy samples are studied at high pressure/high temperatures in  diamond anvil cell devices and probed by x-ray diffraction and  laser spectroscopic methods.  The fundamental aspects are the  profound changes in the bonding in metals by compression, and the  technological potential is in retaining these new modifications at  ambient conditions.  The focus of this research is the prototype  classes of metals and alloys with different initial bonding  configurations.  In f-electron systems, the focus is on the cerium-  thorium alloy system.  Here the motivation is to understand the f-  delocalization under pressure in rare earths and actinide metals.   In d-electron systems, the focus is on molybdenum-ruthenium and  titanium-vanadium alloy systems to investigate phase  transformations predicted from theoretical considerations and  quenching novel phases at ambient conditions.  Synthetic diamonds  have shown great potential as anvils in diamond cell devices due to  lack of stress induced fluorescence as compared to natural  diamonds.  Development of synthetic diamond anvil technology for  high pressure/high temperature research is continued.  The research  facilities supported by this grant have been utilized in the past  during the summer in the research projects for undergraduates in  the Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program in Alabama.   Training of undergraduate and graduate students in metallurgical  transformations, synchrotron based research, and fundamental  understanding of phase changes in metals and alloys continues to be  the primary mission.  %%%  This grant e xplores metallurgy phase stability at high pressures  and temperatures of potentially important technological materials.  ***",
