The three colleges have formed a  consortium to purchase the laser system, which each individual  institution could not make available otherwise. This laser system  will make it possible to demonstrate contemporary activity in  physical chemistry, with the result being improvement in our  students' laboratory skills and attitudes toward physical  chemistry. The system will be compact, durable, and portable,  allowing us to move it around, so that each college will have  immediate access to the equipment every third semester. We also  will bring students to another college to use the system when it is  not located at our individual institutions. The laser system will  be versatile -- we have four experiments planned for the project  and others are possible. This project will have a significant  effect on the chemistry programs of the three colleges, since all  of the chemistry majors from the consortium members will use the  laser system. The project also will be significant because our  consortium, which will pool resources to obtain expensive  laboratory equipment, could serve as a model for other institutions  in a time of tight budgets and rising equipment costs.",
