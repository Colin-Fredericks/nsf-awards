These UBVRI images of the central 7' x 7' core  regions have allowed study of the initial mass function to  lower mass limits than previously determined.  In many of  these OB cores there is a central, luminous O-star, or  multiple system, that dominates the brightness.  From CCD  images it is apparent that these central O-stars have many  more companions than has been cataloged in existing double  and multiple star catalogs (e.g. ADS and IDS).  The  brightness of the central star and the size of the point  spread function results in considerable contamination of the  secondary star image.  Accurate multi-band photometry of the  companions would allow for estimation of their spectral  types and thus the mass function, and from this is a better  understanding of the massive star formation process and the  possible origin of runaway stars.  The use of the Phillips  Laboratory Starfire Optical Range to obtain high resolution  images of these central stars, and their companions, in a  number of OB clusters, and to permit the reduction and  analyses of this data.  * * *",
