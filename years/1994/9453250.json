The Mid-Atlantic  Center for Advanced Technological Education (MCATE) will include  design input from major regional and local leaders in business,  government and education.  The plan will delineate a modern Center  where leaders and innovators in technological education assemble to  devote their combined talents to creating new academic models,  enhancing partnerships, testing new prototypes, researching and  sharing results to transform technological education in the  Mid-Atlantic region. The senior personnel, supported by additional  College resources, will determine appropriate MCATE activities to  provide the development of new curricula,improvement of faculty  competence, and provision of a clearinghouse for informAtion,  methods, and materials affecting technological education, starting  from basic mathematics and science core courses and addressing  student development plus expanded opportunities and  experiences.   Activities will build from and develop partnerships with leaders  from public and private schools, colleges and universities,  business, industry, and government agencies.  The standard for the  determination of the Center's activities will be the ultimate  impact upon the education of students in the region as they select  and prepare for careers in the science and engineering  technologies.  Each potential activity listed will be ranked to  develop the final array.",
