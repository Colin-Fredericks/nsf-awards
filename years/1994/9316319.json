 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316319  Assmann       Application of Ca++ to plants prevents stomatal  opening.  One effect of Ca++ is to inactivate the inward K+  channels that mediate K+ uptake.  Evidence has recently been  obtained that this activation results from Ca++ activation  of a phosphatase analogous to animal protein phosphatase 2B.  The proposed whole-cell patch clamp experiments will test  whether the protein phosphatase 2B acts \" downstream\" of  abscisic acid and/or activated G-protein and/or  inositoltriphosphate in a signal transduction pathway.  Parallel biochemical studies utilizing guard cell  protoplasts and guard cell protein extracts will determine  whether abscisic acid, Ca++ and protein phosphatase 2B cause  dephosphorylation of the same protein, as would be predicted  if protein phosphatase 2B is a second mesenger for the  abscisic acid response.  Microinjection experiments on  intact guard cells will address the possibility that protein  phosphatase 2B is, alternatively or in addition, a second  messenger for other environmental signals that prevent  stomatal opening.  %%%  Stomatal guard cells are vital control points in the  regulation of photosynthetic CO2 uptake and transpirational  water loss.  Stomatal appertures are regulated by osmotic  swelling and shrinking of guard cells, driven by ion fluxes  across the guard-cell plasma membrane.  Several reports  implicate Ca++ as one of the second messengers for abscisic  acid, a plant hormone that prevents stomatal opening and  also reduces inward K+ current.  In this proposal  complementary electrophysiological, cell biological and  biochemical experiments are outlined to test the hypothesis  that environmental signals which regulate stomatal opening  act on inward K+ channels via a phosphatase 2B homologue.  Results from these studies will provide insight into the  second messenger systems utilized by plants to translate  environmental signals into alterations of ion channel  activity.  Results will also be of interest to environmental  physiologis ts who would like to understand how the external  and internal environments affects stomatal apertures and  thereby impacts plant productivity.  ***",
