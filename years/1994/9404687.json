 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404687  Trenary    This award supports the foreign travel expenses  for Dr. Michael Trenary, Chemistry Department  at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to  spend a year in Japan conducting collaborative  research studies on metal boride surfaces with  Professor Chuhei Oshima of the Department of  Applied Physics at Waseda University in Tokyo.    Metal borides are intriguing materials;  extremely hard, chemically inert and possessing  very high melting points. Many also have unique  surface properties making them useful in  various applications such as use as an electron  emitting cathode in a variety of electron  optical devices. Dr. Oshima is a recognized  leader in the surface science of rare-earth  hexaborides. Dr Trenary and his students have  recently conducted a scanning tunneling  microscopy study of the atomic structure of a  lanthanum hexaboride surface and a  mass spectrometric study of oxide evaporation  from the oxidized surface. The experiments to  be conducted at Waseda University  consist of studies of adsorption and  dissociation of carbon monoxide, water and  hydrogen on the lanthanum hexaboride surface,  and the growth and characterization on metal  diboride surfaces of graphite-like monolayers  containing boron and carbon atoms.  The principle technique to be used will be high  resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy.  This research work should result in a long term  collaborative interaction between  the two research groups in Tokyo and Chicago.      This award is funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP  Science Fellowship Program.  ***",
