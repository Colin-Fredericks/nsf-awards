The  models are developed to capture the more realistic features  of the health care market, including those measures that are  proposed by the Health Care Reform Task Force. The health  care market consists of patients, providers, insurance  companies, \"limited provider plans\", such as HMO's and  PPO's, and government agencies. Given this complexity, the  study is designed to pay particular attention to  institutional details. One part of the study examines the  extent to which the provider  focuses on quality versus  price competition with other providers. Another part  examines the implications of the reimbursement rules and the  malpractice law upon the choice of a particular treatment  that is selected by the provider. The last part relates to  the design of an optimal reimbursement rule aimed at  inducing the provider to allocate appropriate resources to  improved quality and improved efficiency in delivering the  service to patients.       This study is important because it examines different  dimensions of the decisions that could be made by health  care providers. Moreover, this framework makes it possible  to evaluate the implications of various proposals that are  currently being considered and to predict how the decision-  making process efffects health care costs, the quality of  care provided to patients, and the size of the uninsured  population.",
