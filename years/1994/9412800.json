Its  purpose is to explore promising new areas of research with Indian  scientists such as the effect of the equatorial electrojet on  magnetic field satellites, marine magnetic data from the Indian  Ocean, rock magnetism, and biomagnetism.    The symposium is an activity resulting from a workshop initiated  by the U.S. Geodynamics Committee and supported by NSF, \"The  Global Magnetic Environment: Challenges and Opportunities,  Washington, D.C., March 1992.\"  Workshop topics included: 1) the  scope of geomagnetic research as applied to the deep Earth, the  Earth's crust, the oceans, the ionosphere and near Earth  Environment, 2) new areas of research, 3) identification of more  optimum locations for observatories/shared facilities, and 4) the  global aspects of emerging programs.       Scope:  Considering the strong interest expressed by American  geomagnetists in learning about the work of their Indian  colleagues, as well as India's long standing desire to  collaborate with US scientists, the proposed symposium is a  highly effective vehicle for beginning communication between  Indian and U.S. geomagnetists.  NSF will provide travel support  for five US participants at this workshop.  India's location at  the geomagnetic equator provides unique opportunities for  collaboration in this field for the U.S.  ***",
