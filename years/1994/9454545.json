 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) Planning  Project is planning for a Center to be operated by the Maricopa  County Community College District, Phoenix, Arizona, in  collaboration with other educational and business/industry  partners. The planning process involves representatives from three  educational levels-high school, community college, and  university-and industry partners who are stake holders in  implementing new educational approaches which prepare students for  the high performance workplace. Planning assumptions, based on an  environmental scan, provide the framework for a collaborative  Steering Committee to develop the vision/mission and strategies for  MATEC. Faculty teams, with members from the various educational  levels and support from business/industry representatives, are  developing the Operational Plan. Emphasis is on approaches which  integrate the teaching/learning of academic concepts in science,  mathematics, and technology with the development of workplace  competencies, including the skills/abilities necessary for  continuous learning/adaptation after entry into the workplace. The  overall goal is to implement MATEC which will serve as a national  model and clearinghouse for secondary/postsecondary advanced  technology education.",
