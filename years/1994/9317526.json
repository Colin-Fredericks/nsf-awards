 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317526  Harada  The long range scientific role of this project is to obtain a  mechanistic understanding of the processes that specify the  function and structure of glyoxysomes, subcellular organelles that  compartmentalize critical metabolic reactions in a cell.  In this  proposal, two key questions about glyoxysome formation are  considered.  First, how is the induction of glyoxysomal function  regulated during plant development?  This question will be  addressed by dissecting the processes regulating genes encoding two  glyoxysome-specific enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase,  that are required for glyoxysomal function.  Previous studies from  this lab established that transcriptional processes play the  primary role in regulating accumulation of these enzymes in  glyoxysomes.  Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the  processes regulating expression of these two genes will provide  insight into the physiological signal(s) and pathway(s) that  control glyoxysomal function during plant development.  The second  key question will focus on glyoxysome assembly. What are the genes  that are required to establish the structure of the organelle and  to import proteins into peroxisomes, and how are these genes  regulated during development?  Genes involved in glyoxysome  assembly will be identified by selecting plant cDNA clones that  complement mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In the long term,  these approaches will provide a global overview of the processes  involved in glyoxysome formation.    The proposed studies will provide significant basic information  about the processes that establish an organelle's structure and  function.  Furthermore, infomation obtained from these studies may  be directly applicable to the design of strategies to improve crop  plants using genetic engineering protocals.  ***",
