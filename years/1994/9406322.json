 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9406322  Tetrahymena thermophila is the only organism in which the rDNA is  not redundant in the germline genome and in which complete  replacement of the functional rDNA has been achieved by this  laboratory. It thus represents a unique model system in which to  study rRNA function by genetic means. We will continue and expand  our study of rRNA function in several ways. We will continue our  analysis of the D8 variable region, a conserved region which  preliminary experiments indicate is essential for cell growth and  will then analyze three other regions to determine if the sequence  and structural features that are important for cell growth in the  D8 region are found in those regions. We will do phylogenetic  analysis of comparative sequences of the D8 region in Tetrahymena  chosen to represent groups with varying evolutionary distances from  T. thermophila. We will test whether the conserved features of the  D8 region reside in their secondary or tertiary structures by  selectively altering limited sequences and determining their  ability to support cell growth after transformation. We will  continue several approaches in order to further define the possible  function of the D8 region and the peptidyl transferase center. We  will also study the effects of rDNA mutations on nucleolar  organization. The results of this study should give a greatly  expanded view of the function of rRNA in eukaryotic cells.  %%%  The ribosomal RNAs are among the most characterized molecules in  the cell. The complete nucleotide sequences of these molecules are  known from nearly 200 species of organisms including both  eukaryotes and prokaryotes as well as a number of chloroplasts and  nitochondria. Despite this knowledge, very little is known about  the function of these ubiquitous and important molecules.  Essentially nothing is known about how rRNAs are involved in  protein synthesis or other cellular activities. They may actually  be involved in the catalytic process of the ribososme, thus  repre senting the largest and most ancient ribozymes. Past studies  of rRNA function have been limited in part by diffculties in  genetic manipulations. The rRNA genes are present in multiple  copies in almost all experimental organisms. Tetrahymena  thermophila is the only organism in which the rDNA is not redundant  in the germline genome and in which complete replacement of the  functional rDNA has been achieved. It thus represents a unique  model system in which to study rRNA function by genetic means.  ***",
