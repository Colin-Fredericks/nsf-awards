Not only does their  work greatly increase the scientific quality of the data  collected, but it also provides valid measures of the variable  quality of data from one research site to another.  The resulting  data set will offer deep understanding of the processes of  democratization and radicalization currently in progress in  Russia.  For example, the survey collects rich data about the  individual and social characteristics that lead to support for  the competing political parties.  %%%       This research will test competing theories of the factors  that promote or impede transition from authoritarian to  democratic systems of government, and of the social courses of  political radicalism.  If the United States is to navigate  successfully the ocean of problems and opportunities that lie  ahead in its relations with Russia and other nations of the  former Soviet Union, we will need far more complete and accurate  scientific information than currently exists about the factors  that facilitate or destroy democracy.  In addition, this grant  will strengthen ties between American social scientists and their  colleagues in Russia.    ***",
