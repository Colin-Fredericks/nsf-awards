The  award provides partial support for a panel on the subject and for  a roundtable discussion on how to include values issues in  education and training for people engaged in public communication  of science and technology.  These activities will occur at the  meeting on \"Science Literacy and the Global Village,\" sponsored  by the International Network on Public Communication of Science  and Technology, scheduled for April 21-24, in Montreal, Canada.   This award will enable the participation of approximately eight  specialists from developing countries and three, including  minority scholars, from the United States.  The panel will be  asked to address questions of individual rights and communal  goods in approaches to communication about science and  technology, and the relation between values in journalism and  cultural values.  The roundtable will be charged to identify  existing education and training efforts on values and public  communication of science and technology, and to consider future  initiatives that might be suggested or recommended.  Scientists,  engineers, and specialists in public communication about science  and technology in the U.S. need exposure to these international  perspectives inorder to prevent misunderstandings and to develop  better educational programs in this field.  Results are expected  to be published as part of a collection of papers from the  meeting and, perhaps, as a special issue of the journal Public  Understanding of Science.  The final report to NSF will include  copies of the presentations and associated documents.  ***",
