 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401848  Spitkovsky       The project involves work on operator theory and matrix  theory. Five specific projects are outlined: 1. Fredholm theory  of Toeplitz, Weiner-Hopf and pseudodifferential operators on  spaces with general Hunt-Muckenhoupt-Wheeden weights. Almost  periodic factorization of matrix functions and its applications  to extension and interpolation problems of Analysis. 3. Explicit  solutions of integral equations and boundary problems emerging  from applications to diffraction theory, elasticity and  thermodynamics. 4. Further analysis of the structure of Banach  algebras generated by two projections. 5. Contragredient  canonical forms of pairs of Hermitian matrices and their  applications.       The project centers around the theory of systems of singular  integral equations. Historically, these equations grew out of the  study of the equation of the airfoil and other applications in  the mechanics of materials. The basic tool for solving these  singular integral equations is the method of Wiener-Hopf  factorization. The matrix form of this factorization was  developed independently by electrical engineers to study linear  systems theory. A part of the project deals with explicit  factorization and this would have application in engineering  problems. When completed, the theoretical portion of the project  will be a significant advance in the theory of matrix function  factorization.  ***",
