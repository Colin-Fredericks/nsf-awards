 "awd_abstract_narration": "The McCullough building, erected in the 1960's, is the home for materials  research at Stanford University.  Currently the building houses the Center for  Materials Research, an NSF Material Research Laboratory.  It is the goal of the  Center to created a new Laboratory for Advanced Materials that will bring 15  faculty from Applied Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical  Engineering, Physics and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory to form  a multidisciplinary advanced materials research and education community.   However, present infrastructural conditions within the building have created an  unsafe facility that lacks proper ventilation, electrical, plumbing and air  conditioning systems.  The building is not in compliance with existing codes for  the type of research activities it currently houses nor the for the planned program  activities in advance materials.      ARI funds will provide support to assist Stanford in its efforts to renovate  laboratory research space in McCullough, specifically, the HVAC, electrical and  plumbing systems.  The major objective is to ensure that the building is upgraded  to occupancy code to accommodate the research and research training activities  required in the facility.  The project is critical to the long-range plans of Stanford  in the area of materials research, a research area of national importance.  New  renovated space for advanced materials will be dedicated to research in the  synthesis, understanding and application of advanced materials, and to the  education of students from various science and engineering disciplines in the  multidisciplinary style essential in materials research.",
