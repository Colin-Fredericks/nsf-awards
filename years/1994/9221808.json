An important component of any numerical model is the  accurate mathematical representation of atmospheric processes.  As  computer power has increased and the spatial resolution of  atmospheric forecast, climate and research models has improved, so  the need for more accurate numerical advection schemes has  increased in significance.  This is because higher spatial  resolution allows representation of sharper gradients and changes  in gradients.       The Principal Investigator will pursue the development of a  highly accurate, computationally efficient scheme for  advection-dominated flows typical of atmospheric processes.   Specific objectives include extending to three dimensions the  Principal Investigator's previous work on a third order,  one-dimensional advection scheme.  He also will investigate the  development of a multidimensional universal limiter.  Successful  completion of this research should result in improved  representations in numerical models of a variety of atmospheric  phenomena.  ***",
