During a six month visit,  Professor Hinata will conduct research on ohmic  heating of the solar atmosphere.  The  collaborators will calculate the dynamical  response of the whole loop plasma (from lower  chromosphere to corona) heated by the  dissipation of force-free currents, where the  currents density is determined by the  requirement that the coronal energy loss is  balanced by local ohmic dissipation.  Dynamical  calculations are necessary to obtain a  meaningful interpretation of the variable  UV/EUV fluxes, because the transition layer  plasmas are almost always in dynamical states,  probably due to heating in the other parts of  the atmosphere as well as in the transition  layer itself.    Results of the research should contribute to  knowledge concerning environmental issues in  the chemistry and dynamics of ozone.  In  addition, it could contribute to studies of  climate change that also depend on the  variation of the total and UV/EUV solar  radiative output.  Professor Hinata's expertise  lies in the area of electric fields in the  solar atmosphere.  Professor Hirayama is a well  known solar physicist who first suggested  chromospheric evaporations.  Two other  scientists in Professor Hirayama's laboratory,  who are experts in dynamical behavior of  transition layer plasma and magnetic field  calculations, are participating in the project.   This project is supported by the NSF-CGP  (Center for Global Partnership) Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
