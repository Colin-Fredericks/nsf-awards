 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403699  Heinkenschloss    This research is concerned with the development and analysis of  fast and robust methods for the solution of optimal control and  parameter identification problems governed by nonlinear partial  differential equations.  These problems are usually formulated in  infinite dimensional function spaces; a discretization of these  problems leads to large sparse nonlinear programming problems.   Many of these problems, in particular, parameter identification  problems, have an inherent ill-posedness.  These structures will  be utilized in the design and analysis of the optimization  methods.  The algorithms operate on a sequence of nested  discretizations.  They use mesh-independence properties and grid  refinements to compute good starting values in an efficient way.  Moreover, they will incorporate multilevel ideas to obtain  inexpensive and good derivative information from coarse grids.  Iterative solvers will be used for the inexact solution of  subproblems to address the large scale structure of the problems.   To globalize the convergence and to address the ill-posedness,  trust region strategies will be used.  The algorithms will be  formulated in a rather modular form allowing the incorporation of  application dependent efficient solvers, such as domain  decomposition methods and multigrid methods.    The mathematical formulation of many problems in development and  production leads to optimal control and parameter identification  problems.  Examples include the design of aircraft wings, the  control of heating processes, and the nondestructive testing of  materials.  These mathematical models are complex and their  numerical solution is very time consuming and often nearly  impossible if 'of-the-shelf-methods' are used. The goal of this  research project is the development of new, efficient and robust  algorithms for the solution of these problems exploiting their  inherent structure.",
