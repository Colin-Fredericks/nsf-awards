This is true not only because of its increase, but because of the associated health problems for young women and their babies.  In the U.S., adolescent mothers are characterized by having a high prevalence of obstetric and neonatal complications.  These are linked to maternal behaviors, especially  to inadequate antenatal care and poor nutrition.  It is also clear that the urban context affects pregnancy outcome by influencing both health-related and reproductive behavior.    In South Africa, adolescent pregnancy has also become a major problem.  South African studies have revealed an association between late or non-entry into antenatal programs and poor preganncy outcomes among urban teenagers.  However, almost no research has addressed intermediate factors affecting clinic attendance patterns.  Similarly, there is little data on adolescent diet.    This project will assess antenatal care and nutrition (diet and energy reserves), and examine the relationship between clinic attendance, nutrition and pregnancy outcome among urban South African primigravida adolescents.  Project objectives will be achieved by 1) the examination  of demographic and socio-behavioral factors and 2) investigation of nutritional status and 3) collection of pregnancy outcome data.    This study relates to the anthropological concern with human adaptation to specific environments - in this case, the modern urban environment.      The graduate student already has been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship and is in th e field.      ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9319680.abs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                f   h                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            !         !         !         !
