 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452624  Movasseghi  CUNY Medgar Evers College is establishing an advanced mathematics  computer laboratory for instruction in the calculus sequence and  higher level mathematics courses. The laboratory is staffed by a  full-time laboratory technician, presently on the staff of the  Department of Mathematics. The labs are being supervised by a part  time lab technician during the evenings and on Saturdays. The ends  for hiring this staff member are requested in this proposal. The  laboratory is being used as a teaching classroom as well as a  working laboratory, permitting instruction to take place there or  in other existing laboratory for courses that including  precalculus, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and  other higher level mathematics courses. In particular, minority  students who make up a large component of the student body, are  being prepared for careers in mathematics, engineering, and science  related fields.  With the acquisition of new equipment and  utilization of Mathematica and Maple, they are demonstrating  important ideas for mathematics courses and allowing students to  experiment and discover mathematics for themselves. In addition,  students are learning two powerful software which is better  preparing them for their professional careers.",
