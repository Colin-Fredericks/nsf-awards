 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451165  Bart  The field of geological education has changed dramatically in the past 2O years. Part of this progress is  reflected in the incorporation of environmental and hydrogeologic courses in the curriculum.  Undergraduates engaged in geologic study throughout our nation are moving into these endeavors because  of the strong employment possibilities created by a growing industry. Until recently, environmental and  hydrologic study were not part of the curriculum at La Salle University. The Department of Geology is  hoping to correct this deficiency in our program by purchasing the necessary equipment to add hands-on  environmental and hydrogeologic experiences to our curriculum. This equipment will be used by  freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior majors, in earth science teacher preparation, and freshmen  introductory classes, and will serve as an important part of our curriculum in: Introductory Geology,  Environmental Geology, Hydrogeology, Sedimentology, Environmental Geology, and Student Research.  With this laboratory equipment our students will be complementing their intensive use of standard  geologic investigation equipment and will be capable of investigating the earth in ways never before  possible in our program. Subsurface interface radar will be used for conducting studies such as bedrock  depths, soil profiles, water table information, fracture and fault mapping. Water studies will include water  analysis for characterization of surface and subsurface quality. The gas vapor soil probe and organic  vapor meter will be used for investigations of possible hydrocarbon contamination of soils. The radon  detector will give students the chance to evaluate radon levels of soils throughout our region. If  supported, this project will create a new and exciting dimension in geologic investigation at La Salle; and  the students we serve will be better prepared for the challenges of graduate studies, teaching, employment  in environmental sciences, and research.",
