Fluorescence in situ  hybridization experiments will be done to visualize the  positions of telomere DNA and nuclear proteins which  interact with this DNA.  Mutant strains of the yeast with  aberrant telomere structures will then be used to identify  roles for individual components of the telomere complex.  The investigators have already identified mutations in four  different genes which impact telomere function.  The  principal activity supported by this award is the immuno-  microscopic visualization of the telomere interactions with  nuclear proteins.  %%%  The ends of chromosomes are termed telomeres.  They have  unique properties and can dramatically impact the stability  of chromosomes.  The DNA in a telomere is known to have a  well defined, repeating pattern which facilitates its  replication. Interaction of this DNA with a variety of  proteins found in the nucleus of the cell is also critical  for proper chromosome behavior.   These interactions have  not been characterized to the extent that we understand what  they are and how they work.  Previous work has focused on  genetic and biochemical investigations of these questions.  This project will extend this work to examine, at the  microscopic level, what happens in living cells where  telomere function has been disrupted by mutations.  ***",
