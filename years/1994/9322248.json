This REU site supports six students on a full-time basis during each summer and six students on a part-time basis during each academic year, allowing them to participate in research within the group.  Activities of the group include all system aspects from theoretical analysis to prototype hardware implementation and evaluation. Basic research is performed in the areas of distributed fault-tolerance, neural networks, synthetic vision, and learning systems in control and signal processing.    The organization of the Intelligent Structures Group provides a combination of structure and diversity to enhance the student experience. Group members often collaborate on research, and meet to discuss research objectives, organize workshops for industry, and to coordinate equipment proposals and acquisitions. Through such interaction, student participants become familiar with the research programs of a number of faculty and graduate students as well as general issues of research administration. The diversity of the group's research offers a wide range of projects from neural network based learning in robotics to machine vision to VLSI design and implementation. This diversity makes it possible to stimulate students with a broad spectrum of professional interests.    u     Miller  A Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is being formed by the Intelligent Structure s Group based with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                x   z                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      !           !           !           !         !
