The  University is committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary for the acquisition.       Use of the modern x-ray diffractometer will be mainly  devoted to the research and teaching projects of the  Principal Investigator and colleagues in the Department of  Geological Sciences and also by members of the Department of  Physics. Examples of  current research projects include: (1)  Studies of cation disorder in natural and synthetic  amphiboles, (2) Mineralogy of low-grade metamorphic  reactions in layered silicates, (3) petrologic studies of  mineral distribution in layered igneous rocks, (4) Studies  of the mineralogy of  salt minerals from evaporite deposits,  and (5)  X-ray studies of stacking sequences in transition-  metal/graphite intercalation compounds to determine the  stacking sequence influence on their magnetic properties.  ***",
