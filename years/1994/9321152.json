Douglas  SBR-9321152    Extensive archaeological research among peoples living around the Mediterranean and in prehistoric America has been conducted in an attempt to document the transition to agriculture and its subsequent effects on human health.  One very common new hypothesis is that the transition to dependence on one or a few agricultural crops   from gathering a large number of wild fruits and vegetables had a number of detrimental effects on the health of early agricultural populations.  However, very little attention has been given to these same issues in human populations found living in the unique tropical monsoon enviornment of Southeast Asia, where the domestication and early intensification of rice agriculture is believed to have occurred.  It may well be, for example, that dependence on rice, rather than maize, may not have been so detrimental to the health of the population.     Through a study of human skeletal remains from northern Thailand, this dissertation research project will address the health status of the ancient inhabitants of this critical comparative area of early agriculture, from the beginnings of rice cultivation through its intensification and population dependence.  ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9321152.abs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      :   <   s   x                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  !         !         !
