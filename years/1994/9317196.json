 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317196  Davis  NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the structure of RNA  oligonucleotides corresponding to structural domains in tRNAs.   Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the anticodon stem-  loop region and the dihydrouridine stem-loop region will be  synthesized using synthetic phosphoramidite methods.  The  naturally occurring modified nucleosides pseudouridine, 2'-O-  methylcytidine, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenosine, 1-  methylguanosine, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, and  dihydrouridine will be incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides.   The structures for the modified oligonucleotides will be  determined and compared to the structures of the unmodified  analogs.  Structural changes induced by RNA modification will be  correlated to changes in the stability, both in terms of overall  structural integrity, and local conformational dynamics.  The  effect of divalent metal ion coordination on the structure and  stability will be determined for unmodified and modified  oligonucleotides.  In cases where  high affinity magnesium  coordination sites are indicated by KD measurements, the specific  metal ion bindings sites will be determined in subsequent high-  resolution structural studies.  Traditional 2D NMR methods along  with newer, homonuclear 3D NMR experiments will be used to assign  RNA resonances and to derive structural information.  Distance  geometry and molecular dynamics calculational methods will be  used to convert NMR structural constraints into well-defined 3D  structures.  The structural data obtained for tRNA  oligonucleotide analogs will be used to explain the role of  modified nucleosides where these particular nucleosides have been  implicated in tRNA function.  %%%  Transfer RNA is a unique biological molecule that performs an  integral role in translating the genetic message contained in  DNA.  The DNA code in a gene is ultimately used to construct  specific proteins, tRNAs specific for each of the amino acids  that go into a protein are part of th e ribosomal protein  synthesis machinery.  The three-dimensional structure of each  amino acid specific tRNA is unique and this structural diversity  is the basis for assuring that the correct amino acid is inserted  into the protein sequence in response to the appropriate message  from the DNA.  tRNAs are composed of the ribonucleosides  adenosine, uridine, cytidine, and guanosine as well as an  enormous array of chemically \"unusual\" nucleosides that are  derivatives of the four common ribonucleosides.  These \"modified\"  nucleosides appear to play a critical role in defining the  structures of tRNAs.  The modified nucleosides are important in  assuring that tRNAs function correctly and also in discriminating  between tRNAs that code uniquely for each of the common amino  acids.  The goal of this proposal is to further the understanding  of the function of modified nucleosides in tRNA.  The way in  which chemical modification influences structure is likely to be  critical to the correct function of tRNAs.  We will use a  powerful tool for elucidating the structure of tRNA, NMR  spectroscopy, to produce three-dimensional structures of modified  RNAs.  The information derived from these studies will aid in  understanding the complex function of a biological macromolecule  that is central to all life.  ***",
