 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409633  Imamoglu  The quantum control of photon generation processes in semiconductor  stuctures is of substantial interest both from a fundamental and a  practical point of view.  The goal of the proposed work is to  investigate the fundamental limits to quantum control and noise  suppression in light emitting mesoscopic semiconductor  heterojunctions.    This proposed research will emphasize the generation of heralded  single-photon states, which represent the ultimate limit in the  quantum control of light generation. Using a semi-classical  analysis, the principal investigator has already predicted that  strict regulation of the photon emission times can be achieved by  utilizing the Coulomb blockade of electron and hole injection in  mesoscopic semiconductors.  Theoretically, the emphasis of the  proposed work would be on the newly developed quantum Monte Carlo  wave-function approach to dissipative electron dynamics in  semiconductors and its application to the quantum analysis of  heralded single-photon state generation.  The experimental work  aimed at the regulation of the photon generation process in  mesoscoptic P - I - i - I - N quantum well structures will also be  pursued concurrently.    It is anticipated that the novel features of heralded single-photon  states will find many applications, which include reliable  information encoding at the single-photon level and noise-free  amplification.  ***",
