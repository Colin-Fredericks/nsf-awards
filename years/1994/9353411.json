To this end, the project prepares some  155 teachers at 4 large San Francisco High Schools to implement two  new exemplary mathematics curricula: Course A of the California  Mathematics Framework, and the 3-year Interactive Mathematics  Project (IMP) materials.  The program provides the teachers  appropriate content background (including topics from probability  and statistics, geometry, trigonometry, and mathematical modeling),  as well as stressing problem-solving, applications of graphing  calculators, cooperative learning, the uses of journals and  portfolios, and alternative assessments.  The project has 3 basic  components: (1) a 1-week summer program focusing on mathematical  content; (2) intensive support during the school year (including a  daily, special, common preparation period for participating  teachers); on-site visits by staff; group meetings and conferences  with staff; and on-going staff efforts to maintain and nurture  support from school administrators; (3) an \"After the Bell Program,  \"especially for at-risk students, featuring after-school  involvement of parents, peer tutoring, field trips, a homework  \"hot-line,\" and the like.  In order to prepare the participants to  become leaders in mathematics reform in San Francisco, the program  provides them with many opportunities to develop, exercise and hone  their leadership skills.  An external evaluation not only looks at  the effectiveness of the implementation model, but also focuses on  student outcomes, such as increased enrollment, and success in,  demanding college-track mathematics courses.    Cost-sharing is 64% of the NSF contribution.",
