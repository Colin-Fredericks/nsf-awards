A team of 29 people, most of which are faculty at Dartmouth  College, are working together to create ways of simultaneously  teaching mathematics and at least one other subject. The team comes  from the departments of mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology,  psychology, social science, education, music, geology and computer  science, as well as the medical and engineering schools. Also  included are a fine artist, a performing artist, a writing teacher  and the director of the local science museum.  The goal is the  design of a curriculum project which will change completely the way  undergraduate mathematics is taught across the curriculum, across  the population and across the nation.",
