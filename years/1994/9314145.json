 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pawlik  9314145    Sponges are important components of benthic marine  communities, particularly on coral reefs.  Organic extracts  of their tissues have yielded a wealth of unusual chemical  compounds that are not known to be involved in primary  metabolism.  These secondary metabolites have a diversity of  pharmacological effects in laboratory assays, but it is  unclear why sponges produce them.  The most commonly held  theory is that these compounds are distasteful to potential  predators.  The proposed research will provide an assessment  of the chemical  defenses of Caribbean demo sponges, a group  whose taxonomy and chemistry is fairly well described.  The  investigation will proceed within a theoretical framework  established by previous research on the chemical ecology of  terrestrial plants and marine algae.   Overall, this  research project represents the first systematic  investigation of the chemical defenses of tropical marine  sponges.  The results will be useful in judging the general  applicability of optimal defense theories based on studies  of terrestrial ecosystems.    ***",
