 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409827  Zilberstein       This project is aimed at developing a decision-theoretic,  adaptive approach to building systems that can perform robustly a  variety of real-time tasks.  Such tasks include medical diagnosis  job scheduling, and robot navigation.  In almost all cases, the  deliberation required to select optimal actions degrades the  system's overall utility.  It is by now well-understood that a  successful system must trade off decision quality for deliberation  cost.  Over the past several years, work by Dean, Horvitz, Russell,  Zilberstein, and others has shown that anytime algorithms are a  useful tool for real-time system design, since they allow  computation time to be larger systems from smaller, reusable  anytime modules.  The proposed solution to this problem is based on  novel off-line compilation process and run-time monitoring that can  maximize the overall utility of the system.  This research will  produce a new architecture for resource-bounded reasoning.  The  study will cover the problem of constructing anytime algorithms,  the representation and manipulation of conditional performance  profiles, and the development of efficient compilation and  monitoring procedures for systems composed of anytime algorithms.",
