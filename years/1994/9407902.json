 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407902  Browse  The acyl lipids of chloroplasts contain characteristically high  proportions of trienoic fatty acids.  However, the free radical by-  products of the photosynthetic light reactions can lead to  oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Because this might be  expected to mediate against a high degree of unsaturation, it has  been inferred that trienoic fatty acids must have some crucial role  in supporting photosynthesis.  Other unusual lipid features typical  of chloroplasts have provoked similar speculation about membrane  structure and function.  To approach this research area in a novel  way, a series of Arabidopsis mutants with specific alterations in  leaf fatty acid composition have been isolated.  In the last six  years, these have provided a means to study both the synthesis of  chloroplast glycerolipids and the physiological significance of  membrane lipid composition.  This proposal describes experiments in  which the mutants and the desaturase genes will be used together to  produce plant lines with progressively more severe alterations in  thylakoid lipid composition.  These lines will be studied under a  range of environmental conditions using non-invasive chlorophyll  fluorescence techniques, assays of photosynthetic electron  transport, and measurements of membrane fluidity.  These  experiments will provide data on the minimum levels of particular  fatty acid types that are needed to sustain chloroplast function.   They should also reveal which photosynthetic processes are most  susceptible to membrane disruption.  The improved understanding of  membrane lipid metabolism and photosynthesis that will result from  this work are important prerequisites to modifying these processes  for increased plant productivity.   ***",
