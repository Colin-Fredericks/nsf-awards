The surface vibrational amplitudes of  well ordered metal surfaces of silver and copper will be measured  in the anharmonic regime and correlated with structural changes.   Further studies will focus on systems that undergo displacive  surface phase transitions and metal overlayers on oxides.  An  atomistic understanding of these effects can have a beneficial  impact on a large number of areas of applied nature, such as  magnetic films, chemically passive coating, tribology, and  bimetallic catalysts.    %  %  %  %      The goal of these studies is to determine the geometric and  vibrational structure of clean and adsorbate covered surfaces.  Our  main experimental technique is medium energy ion scattering, a very  powerful, but not widely available, quantitative method for the  determination of surface structure.  The specific systems to be  studied include low index surfaces of silver and copper, as well as  metal overlayers on oxide surfaces.  The experiments will  contribute towards an understanding of emerging technologies, like  bimetallic catalysts, optical and magnetic films, chemically  passive coatings and tribology.  ***",
