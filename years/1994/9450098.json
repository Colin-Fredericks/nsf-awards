 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the use of optical coherence techniques,  such as photon echo and hole-burning experiments, to study rare  earth doped glasses in which a refractive index change or second  harmonic generation has been optically induced.  These  photoinduced phenomena are being used in a number of fiber optic  devices, but a detailed understanding of the underlying  microscopic mechanism is lacking.  The objective is to gain  insight about the microscopic nature of these photoinduced  changes.  One part of the research focuses on the local structure  and dynamics of the rare earth ion whereas a second part deals  with the dynamics of the host glass.  The results of these  experiments will provide insight into the microscopic changes  associated with photoinduced phenomena in glasses and may lead to  the development of more efficient materials and devices.    The interactive activities consist of teaching an advanced  undergraduate courses in Physical Chemistry, advising and  mentoring of undergraduate students, organizing a seminar series,  and organizing a seminar series for students and faculty in the  Chemistry department.",
