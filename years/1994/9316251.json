 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316251  Reed  Support is requested to assist academic personnel, particularly younger researchers and graduate students, who are engaged in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) research by providing either wholly or partially for travel to and subsistence at the 1994 IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems Workshop, which is to be held in Oiso, Japan, January 25-28, 1994.    The 1994 MEMS Workshop is an international research meeting, seventh in a series begun in 19987 (originally entitled \"IEEE Micro Robots and Teleoperators Workshop\").  The site of the 1994 MEMS Workshop is in Japan; this will place a financial stress on established as well as new academic entrants in the field.  Adequate funds for attendance at the 1994 MEMS Workshop is therefore not included in the budgets of many, particularly younger, researchers.  Likewise, adequate travel money is often not in the budgets of some of the more established advisors whose students would benefit by attending.  The presence of these researchers and students would enhance the value of the meeting to the engineering and scientific community in the United States.  ***",
