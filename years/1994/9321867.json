 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methyl bromide (CH3Br, or MeBr) is important in atmospheric  chemistry as the single largest source of Br atoms for the  stratosphere and probably as the largest carrier of Br atoms in the  free troposphere.  Sources of atmospheric MeBr include both natural  and industrial processes, but the proportions are not clear.  Of  human MeBr usages, agricultural pre-plant fumigation is the largest  application and it is growing world wide but national and  international bans on further usage are being considered so as to  limit ozone-layer damage.  The goals of this research are to obtain  quantitative information on atmospheric MeBr - its sources, its  atmospheric amounts and variations.  Through field measurements,  fumigation of agricultural fields will be investigated as a  potential source.  Fluxes of MeBr escaping from these soils will be  measured through the use of static chamber, while vertical profiles  of gaseous MeBr will be measured in the soil form zero to 90 cm  depth.  These field-fumigation studies will be performed as part of  actual commercial fumigations; several such experiments will be  performed yearly so as to span a range of practices in California,  a large MeBr-using state.       Atmospheric amounts will be measured against a new absolute  NIST calibration standard (independent of previous standards).  Two  California sites and Cape Grim, Australia will each be sampled  twice biweekly so as to determine the north/south ratio of MeBr,  its seasonal variations and differences from the Pacific Coast  through an agricultural valley.  Flame-ionization gas  chromatography will be used in field-fumigation measurements and a  GC mass spectrometer will be used for high-precision atmospheric  measurements.  Low resolution global atmospheric models will also  be used to investigate surface source and mixing ratio patterns and  the roles of hypothesized sources and sinks.  Model calculations  will be performed with an extended 2D model and with a 3D model.         The results of this  research are expected to improve the basis  for MeBr regulations (or the lack of them) and to contribute  significantly to our understanding of atmospheric bromine cycling.",
