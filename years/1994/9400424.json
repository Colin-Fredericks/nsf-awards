 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400424  Wadzinski    Normal signal transduction from the cell surface traversing the  cytoplasm and to the nucleus in response to an external stimulus  requires pathways which are acutely regulated by the  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins.   Activation of most cell-surface receptors initially results in the  generation of second messenger or stimulation of a protein tyrosine  kinase.  This signal, however, is rapidly converted via a protein  kinase network into activated protein serine/threonine kinases.   Many of these kinases have been studied extensively, but much less  attention has been given to the reverse reaction catalyzed by  specific serine/threonine (ser/thr) protein phosphatases (PP).   Furthermore, the majority of studies of these signal transduction  pathways studies have focused on cytoplasmic events even though the  concentration of phospho-proteins in the nucleus is thought to be  much higher than in the cytosol.  The importance of protein  phosphatases, especially nuclear protein phosphatases, in the  control of cell phenotype, growth and differentiation is just now  being appreciated.  The long term goals of this research are to  define the subcellular distribution of phosphatases, characterize  specific nuclear phosphatases, identify specific nuclear  phosphatase substrates, define the regulation of protein  phosphatases, and to define regulatory and effector sites of  protein phosphatase catalytic subunits using a mutagenesis  approach.  %%%  This is a starter grant to help set up the laboratory and launch  the independent career of a promising new investigator who, for the  past two years, has been supported by an NSF Post-Doctoral  Fellowship.  The overall goal of his research is to study the  function and regulation of certain enzymes, called protein  phosphatases, in signal transduction pathways of cells.  The long  term results of this research will contribute to our fundamental  understanding of the regulation of cellular function.  ***",
