 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321289  Danchi    The Infrared Spatial Interferometer developed at the University of  California at Berkeley is at present the world's only multi-  aperture stellar interferometer operating in the 9-12 um  atmospheric window.  This instrument, involving two movable 1.65 m  aperture Pfund telescopes, offers unprecedented resolution in the  10 um wavelength region with an ~30 milli-arcsec (mas) resolution  at the longest currently available baseline.  Support is provided  for upgrades to the hardware of the ISI in four areas that would  significantly add to its capabilities.  The first area is to extend  the quantum efficiency and bandwidth with a new type of heterodyne  detector.  The second area is to upgrade the autoguiding system to  use the near-infrared radiation from the stars rather than visible  light.  This would allow sufficiently short integration times for  tip-tilt stabilization of the image for the stars in the present  observing program.  In addition, this would allow guiding on stars  which radiate very weakly at visible wavelengths and yet are  intense enough at 11 um to be observed with the ISI, such as some  proto-planetary nebulae, OH/IR stars, and proto-stellar sources.   The third area involves upgrading the delay line and correlator to  match the bandwidth of the present detectors.  The effective  bandwidth of the correlator and delay line is about 1600 MHz, while  the present detectors have bandwidths exceeding 3000 MHz.  Thus a  significant gain in sensitivity can be achieved through an  improvement to this part of the system.  The fourth area is to  develop the site at Mt. Wilson to increase the baseline length in  at least two directions to the maximum allowed by the site, which  is about 100 m, increasing the maximum resolution to about 10 mas.  ***",
