 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410693  Hayes    The physiological functions of animals (e.g., their ability  to produce heat in cold environments or sprint away from  predators)are widely thought to impact their ecology and  evolution. Despite this widespread belief, differences among  individual animals of the same species rarely have been  shown to affect their survival and reproduction.  Data on  whether individual differences in physiology affect survival  and reproduction are essential to understanding the  evolution of organismal function (i.e., physiological traits  of organisms). Hence, the effects of whole animal  physiological performance on survival and reproduction will  be studied in a high altitude (3800m) population of deer  mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). These mice are particularly  suitable for study because their physiology is well known  and because the extreme cold and low oxygen availability  they experience at high altitude makes it likely that  natural selection on their physiological running performance  occurs. Survival, reproduction, ability to produce heat in  the cold, and sprint running performance of individual mice  will be measured.  Because physiological functions may vary  substantially with the environment encountered (i.e., are  plastic or flexible), it is usually unclear whether  physiological differences among individual animals are  genetic or environmental in nature. Previous studies  indicate that differences in the heat producing capacity of  high- and low- altitude deer mice are genetically based.  However, the effects of the developmental environment on the  ability of deer mice to respond to subsequent environmental  change are poorly understood. This information is critical  to understanding the relative importance of genetic versus  environmental effects in coping with environmental change.  The effects of developmental environments will be studied by  comparing physiological performance of siblings raised at  high versus low altitude. Ultimately, the proposed research  will lea d to a better understanding of the relative  importance of genetic variation versus physiological  plasticity in coping with environmental stressors, will  provide insight into developmental constraints on mammalian  lung function, and will elucidate whether the broadly held  belief that individual variation in physiological  performance has ecological and evolutionary significance is  valid.  ***",
