Work will be done on the  formation of estimates of solutions to boundary value problems of  elliptic operators with constant coefficients.  The tools  employed include singular integrals and Sobolev and Hardy spaces  on lower dimensional Lipschitz surfaces.  The lower dimensional  theory, which is just developing, seeks to yield new maximum  principles for higher order equations and systems.  One of the  underlying goals of the research is that of understanding which  properties of dilation invariant solutions might be considered  operator independent.  Classical theory fails to distinguish  those properties of solutions that are operator dependent from  those that are domain dependent.  Boundary value problems such as  the Dirichlet problem are to be generalized in an algebraic way  to higher order operators and systems that may not conform to  intuition on how values at the boundary should control values  inside a domain.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
