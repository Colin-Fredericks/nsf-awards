 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318061  Bloch       Funds are requested to establish a multi-user confocal  laser scanning microscope (CLSM) facility for the basic  science departments at the University of Maryland at  Baltimore.  Such a shared instrument is not available.  The  applicants have been using fluorescence techniques to study  cell structure and function, but progress in some aspects of  their research has been limited by the resolution afforded  by the optical microscope.  With a confocal laser scanning  microscope, the resolution in the x-y plane can be increased  ~2-fold and in the z-axis, ~1.4 fold. The increased  resolution provided by the confocal microscope should  facilitate more definitive studies by the applicants of some  important questions in modern cell biology.  In particular,  the confocal microscope will be used to study the  organization of cellular membranes and how they change with  differentiation or during endocytosis; how cell populations  change during development of the brain; and how viruses and  microbes enter cells and alter cell structure.  All the  applicants hold federal grants for their research, and  several are recipients of grants from the NSF.              The facility will include a CLSM system for data  collection, and a separate workstation for image analysis.  The CLSM system will consist of a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal  laser scanning unit and an Olympus fluorescence microscope.  The microscope will be configured to permit conventional  epifluorescence and phase contrast for correlation with  confocal images.  The workstation, consisting of an IBM 486  running the same CoMOS program that controls the CLSM, is  requested to maximize the availability of the CLSM for data  collection.  Both the CLSM system and the workstation will  be provided with identical optical disk drives, to  facilitate the transfer of image data acquired by the  individual users.  The hardware selected for this facility  represents a reasonable balance between costs, our  requirements for the highest res olution available for  confocal microscopy, and the flexibility that is important  for a multi-user facility.              This equipment will be housed in the Department of  Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland at  Baltimore.  It will be administered by an interdepartmental  Internal Advisory Committee consisting of the P.I. and two  regular users, and supervised by Dr. Paul Luther, a  co-investigator with experience in quantitative fluorescence  techniques.  The facility will be made available to all  members of the university community, including students and  postdoctoral fellows. Instruction in confocal microscopy  will be provided by regular, practical training sessions and  through an interdepartmental graduate course on imaging  methodology. Realizing the importance of confocal microscopy  to the research and teaching activities in the basic  sciences, the Graduate School, University of Maryland,  Baltimore, and the Dean of the School of Medicine have both  committed matching funds to help establish the CLSM  facility, should this grant be funded.",
