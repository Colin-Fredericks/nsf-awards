These highly reproducible cell fate  decisions must be executed in a spatially and temporally  specific manner.  The goal of this work is to understand, at  a molecular and cellular level, how cell fate decisions are  regulated during development.  Several consistent themes  emerge from the study of cell fate decisions in both  vertebrates and invertebrates:  Cell fates are often arrived  at by a process of gradual or sequential restriction of  developmental potential.  This restriction of potential is  due to specific gene expression or activity.  Cell-cell  communication is a critical component of developmental  decisions in all organisms in which the process can be  studied.  Finally, proteins identified by genetic analysis  of simple organisms as being critical for specific events in  development often play similar roles in higher organisms.  Development of insect sensory organs requires that cells  make a spatially specific choice between two alternative  fates, epidermoblast or sensory organ precursor.  This study  will use genetic, cellular and molecular approaches to  determine the role of a specific gene in this cell fate  choice.  In mutants lacking normal gene function,  inappropriate cell fate choices are made resulting in the  presence of extra sensory organs.  Thus, this gene must be  an important component of the mechanisms that regulate  formation of sensory organ precursors.   This work will  provide fundamental information about gene regulation and  cell-cell communication.",
