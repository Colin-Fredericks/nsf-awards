 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will research the relationship between incompressible  and compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, including  observable consequences in the solar wind, such as characteristic  anisotropies in the inner wind and scalings of various fluctuations  in the outer heliosphere.  A transport theory for description of  the long wavelength and low frequency variations of local MHD  turbulence will be further exploited to address important  observational issues in the solar wind.  Extensions of this theory  will describe assimilation of waves injected by wave-particle  interactions associated with upstream waves, as well as waves  associated with pickup and assimilation of newborn cometary and  interstellar ions.  Further work in basic MHD theory will include  development and refinement of a phenomenology of MHD relaxation  processes based upon an information-entropy description which has  recently shown promise in the context of two dimensional  hydrodynamics turbulence.  Finally, the investigators will  construct models for including turbulence effects in self-  consistent models of solar wind acceleration, and self-consistent  models for charged particle-wave turbulence dynamics near comets  and shocks.",
