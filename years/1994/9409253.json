 "awd_abstract_narration": "940925  Shaker                    We study a singular semilinear elliptic boundary value  problem in a bounded domain in the n dimensional real space. The  importance of this problem in scientific applications has been  widely recognized (see  W ).  The motivation for this proposal is  three-fold.  First we wish to generalize the existing theorems by  relaxing the coefficient function in the equation from being  Holder continuous to Lipschitz integrable. Second we are  interested in possibilities of achieving similar results for  systems of equations. A third impetus proceeds from our numerical  results on the unit interval and unit square which have shown  that multigrid methods can provide an efficient means of  solution for reasonable choices of the coefficient function.  However, an actual convergence proof for the multigrid Full  Approximation Scheme (FAS) is very hard to obtain and the  literature is remarkably sparse in the area of founding  theory for the FAS method. Our future research into solution  methods for the discussed problems will be to fill this gap and  to investigate new and perhaps more efficient techniques such as  the Multilevel Projection (PML) methods to deal with this type of  nonlinear problems.  ***",
