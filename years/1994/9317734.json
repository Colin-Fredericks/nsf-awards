This is particularly the case  in marine systems where novel associations are being routinely  discovered.  Whether the bacteria reside externally to the host or  endosymbiotically the functional role of the association have  remained poorly understood. This research project seeks to  understand the structure and function of the diverse epibiotic  bacterial populations found associated with the Alvinellid  polychaete, Alvinella pompejana, which inhabits the high  temperature environment surrounding deep-sea hydrothermal vents.   The polychaetes are considered the most thermotolerant eukaryotes  known.  The primary thesis of the project maintains that within the  evolutionary confines of this symbiosis the symbiont and host have  evolved unique adaptations to survive this harsh environment.    The primary objective of this research project is to metabolically  characterize the predominant symbionts within the mixed population  in order to determine their functional role in the symbiosis.   Specifically the project will: 1) phylogenetically characterize the  dominant symbionts in the population, 2) determine the spatial  orientation and metabolic state of these symbiont in situ, 3)  determine the metabolic capabilities and segregation of activity  within the structure of the symbiont population.  In order to  achieve these goals two powerful molecular techniques which were  developed with the philosophy that bacteria from natural  ecosystems, like organelles, can be studied without cultivation  will be integrated.  Past studies have demonstrated the utility of  nucleic acid probing technology to identify and localize target  sequences in situ with a high degree of specificity.  The utility  of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) vectors to characterize  mixed marine microbial communities by preserving their genomic  content in the form of \"environmental libraries\" has recently  bee n  demonstrated. This project proposes to combine these technologies  to genetically dissect the predominant symbionts from the mixed  population and to identify and quantify in situ the expression of  metabolically important genes implicated in the symbiosis.  The  descriptive nature of these techniques will provide not only  valuable insights into the ecology of this symbiosis but will  provide characterization of novel genes that confer adaptation to  the extremes of the hydrothermal vent environment.  ***",
