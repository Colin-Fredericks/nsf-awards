 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Education Commission of the States, in   collaboration with the Association of State Supervisors of  Mathematics, the Council of State Science Supervisors, and the  Mathematical Sciences Education Board, will host a three-day  learning, networking, and planning event designed to further  statewide systemic change efforts in mathemantics, science, and  technology education.    Key objectives of this event include facilitating cross-group  collaboration and communication, and promoting policy and resource  alignment within states. Participants will be provided with  opportunities to learn about successful models and key elements of  systemic change in mathematics, science, and technology education.   There will also be time for participants to share information,  acquire new skills and tools, discuss alignment of resources, and  refine state action plans for implementing systemic change.  To  ensure that the event responds to the needs of the participants, a  design team of participants will develop the event agenda and  format.    Intended outcomes for the event include improved communication  within and across states, increased collaboration within and across  states, alignment of initiatives and supporting resources, and  continued progress toward statewide systemic change.  The  organization of this event will also advance federal-state  relations by serving as an effective model of large-scale  collaboration.",
