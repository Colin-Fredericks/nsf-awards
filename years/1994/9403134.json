Dr. Lieberman received her doctoral  degree from the University of Washington under the supervision  of Professor Tomikazu Sasaki. Dr. Lieberman will continue  research at the California Institute of Technology under the  sponsorship of Professor Nathan Lewis. Her postdoctoral  research will focus on the semiconductor-electrolyte interface,  specifically on the synthesis and characterization of a coating  which, when illuminated, injects electrons into the conduction  band of a semiconductor. Longer term, she plans to design,  synthesize and characterize at molecular resolution, composite  materials consisting of layered metal organophosphonates and  organic spacer molecules. These designer solids will find  application in catalysis, molecular recognition and signal  transduction.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.",
