Flavodoxin  commonly substitutes for the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin as an  electron carrier in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain of  algae and cyanobacteria under iron limited conditions.  Flavodoxin  appears to have the attributes of a good molecular marker of iron  limitation because: (1) it only accumulates when iron is limiting,  (2) it is stable enough to allow isolation and quantification, and  (3) it shows a strong signal in response to iron limitation.  In  addition, flavodoxin may be quantitatively accumulated under Fe-  limiting conditions allowing estimation of relative growth rate if  the complicating effects of interactions with irradiance and  nitrogen source can be taken into account.    An antibody to a diatom (Phaeodactylum  tricornutum) flavodoxin  that cross reacts with flavodoxins from other diatom species has  already been developed.  The project will proceed along three  related lines.  First, flavodoxins will be extracted from other  taxa (cyanobacteria, cryptomonads, prasinophytes, chlorophytes), to  test for cross-reactivity with the diatom antibody, and to develop  taxon-specific antibodies as needed.  The antibodies will be used  to develop quantitative immunoassays for flavodoxin in total  protein extracts of marine particulate matter to examine bulk  flavodoxin concentrations, and to develop single cell  immunofluorescence assays to examine heterogeneity in the iron  status of natural phytoplankton populations. Second, the project  will examine the ecophysiology of iron limitation in diatoms using  flavodoxin synthesis as a measure of the internal iron status. The  project will also use measurements of the concentration of  dissolved \"available\" iron below which flavodoxin synthesis is  induced to develop a bioassay for measuring \"available\" iron.   Diatoms will be used for these experiments.  Third, the project  will u se immunofluorescent techniques to measure flavodoxin  abundance in samples of opportunity from natural phytoplankton  assemblages.  In addition, DNA amplification and sequencing  techniques will be employed to examine heterogeneity in the genes  encoding flavodoxin in natural phytoplankton assemblages.  ***",
