 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451775  Parks  The objective of the proposed project is to construct a  state-of-the-art software development laboratory which will support  three courses in large scale software development with emphasis on  manufacturing applications. Learning software engineering concepts  is a vital educational experience for modern engineers and this  educational experience is largely being ignored in engineering  education. Further, engineering students cannot get the appropriate  experience by taking just a couple of computer science courses,  since most computer science departments (with a few exceptions)  focus primarily on algorithm development and database research.    In order to correct this deficiency, we are proposing to offer our  engineering students three courses in software development with an  appropriate laboratory experience. The students will be required to  design large software systems illustrating team programming  concepts, software maintenance issues, and systems integration  principles.    This proposal is a joint effort of the Industrial and Systems  Engineering (ISE) and the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)  Departments. The courses will be taught and maintained by faculty  from both departments. The planned laboratory will give engineering  students experience in the three major software paradigms used in  today's manufacturing software development: functional and data  modeling, object oriented analysis and design, and real time  programming. We plan to expand this experience to all engineering  disciplines.",
