This is particularly true for parallel systems in which the  controlling agent has the additional goals of maximizing the  utilization of parallel resources.  The proposed research studies  the issues of control in parallel knowledge-based systems through  the development of a theory of control based o an analysis of task  interactions and the influence of the environment.  The theoretical  approach to control issues is based on the observation that control  is a knowledge-based on an understanding of the interactions  between the problem-solving process, the problem domain, and the  specific environment in which a problem-solving episode takes  place.  This effort will be an extension of previous efforts to  develop a formal model of how the structure of a domain influences  ad constrains the choice of methods used to develop solutions  within that domain and in developing stochastic models of  environments.  These efforts will be extended towards modeling  effects that are particularly significant in parallel computations.   Specifically, the nature of task interactions will be explored.",
