 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Marjatta Lyyra of Temple University will investigate the   long range interactions, at separations in excess of 10 Angstroms,    between pairs of alkali atoms in order to map out the potential surface   near the dissociation limit of  alkali diatomic molecules.  The sodium   molecule is the principal species to be investigated.  The molecules are   prepared in their long range states by multiple laser excitation.   A new   multiple resonance technique, stimulated radiative dissociation, will be   used to study photodissociation dynamics state selectively as function of   molecular rotation and and energy in order to achieve full understanding   of long range nonadiabatic mixing of states.  The correlation of the   initial internuclear distance prepared as dissociation begins with the   strengths of the nonadiabatic couplings will also be studied.  As part of   this work new methods will be developed to enhance the detection of   continuous wave multiple resonance signals.    This research contributes to the understanding of behavior of atoms at   large internuclear separations  at the onset of chemical reactions.  At   large internuclear separations many electronic energy states are often   closely spaced, making for couplings betwen them which affect the   bond-breaking photodissociation, and bond-forming associative ionization   processes.  The information gathered in this work will be of assistance   in understanding the results of contemporary research on atomic   collisions at ultra low temperatures.",
