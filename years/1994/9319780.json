Specifically, the investigators  will collect and analyze intrasentential codeswitching in  naturally-occurring languages in particular language pairs, some  in the United States and others in Africa or Europe. The language  pairs have been selected because apparent differences in the  structure of their lexical items will test the hypotheses  contained herein. While this study will further our knowledge  about intrasentential codeswitching, it is more important for the  information it will provide about the nature of lexical entries  in some universal sense.       This information becomes available from codeswitching data  because the existence of sentences containing codeswitching seems  to depend on compatibilities between the languages involved  regarding Lexical-Conceptual Structures and Predicate-Argument  Structures. The playing out of these compatibilities in  codeswitching, in turn, provides a uniquely available 'empirical  window' on the viability of key theoretical claims about the  structure of language.       The proposal's eight hypotheses extend the analysis found in  the Matrix Language Frame Model of codeswitching (Myers-Scotton  1993b). Under this model, one of the languages participating in  codeswitching is more dominant (the Matrix Language) in  structuring codeswitching utterances. The less dominant language  is called the Embedded Language. The distinction between content  and functional categories is also critical in this model. While  that model successfully predicts the form of Embedded Language  material in sentential frames prepared by the Matrix Language, it  is not sufficiently constrained to explain why one option rather  than another occurs and the form which Embedded Language material  takes. The hypotheses in this proposal provide necessary  constraints.       This research will provide evidence for or agai nst theories  about the nature of the abstract features of lexical entries,  including semantic content, and their relation to actually  occurring forms. In addition, the results may provide motivations  for language production modeling in psycholinguistics, especially  in regard to the nature of lemma entries in the mental lexicon.  Finally, the project has a material objective. It will provide a  large-scale computerized data base of diverse codeswitching data.  It is expected that collecting preliminary analysis, data base  entry, formal analysis, and a presentation of the results of this  study will require three years.  ***",
