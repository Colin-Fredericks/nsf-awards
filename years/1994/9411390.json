 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411390  Liu    This award supports a research planning visit by Dr. S. Liu,  Florida Institute of Technology, and Dr. W. Yang, Tsinghua  University, China to develop collaborative research on the  reliability of microelectronic packaging and interconnects. VLSI  semiconductor devices continue to utilize larger chips (dies) in  progressively smaller packages than previously produced.  From  the material and structural point of view, a microelectronic  package is a highly complicated composite microlaminate,  consisting of silicon chips (dies) and die coatings, various  passivation layers, encapsulant such as mold compound, die  attach, leadframe, and various material interfaces.  Various  failure modes can occur during fabrication, testing, storage, and  operation. For instance, typical failure modes in plastic  packaging include metal line smearing, metal and passivation  cracking, die cracking, and various material interfacial  delaminations, which are mainly due to elevated temperatures and  high moisture concentrations.  The reliability of a semiconductor  device is closely related to the mechanical properties of its  constituent materials and its associated interfaces.  Therefore,  the first part of the proposed research is to conduct  experimental and analytical studies on the measurement of the  material response  and the interfacial strength for various bi-  material combinations.  The second part of the present  investigation involves damage tolerance analysis of packaging  devices based on analytical/numerical modeling.  The predicted  results will be compared with data obtained form experimental  test chips.",
