 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408127  Alber  Carbohydrates are a major component of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in natural waters.  The purpose of the projected research will be to examine carbohydrate dynamics in aquatic systems from both a biogeochemical and a trophodynamic (e.g., microbial loop) perspective.  The biogeochemical perspective involves comparing the carbohydrate composition of various source materials (terrestrial and aquatic plants, macroalgae, phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria) to determine whether there are biochemically consistent compositional differences that would be useful indicators of sources of DOC in natural waters.  There has been only a limited amount of work to date on this question, in large part because of the analytic difficulty of detecting individual carbohydrates.  The proposed work will seek to extend previous studies on the carbohydrate composition of source material and to test the utility of using carbohydrate signatures as geochemical tracers by comparing them to measurements made in field samples.  If this approach proves fruitful, it will improve understanding of the relative contribution of various sources of DOC to natural waters.",
