 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408432  Tannor  Univ. of Notre Dame  This project in quantum theory of reactive scattering is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  Conservative scattering processes in the gas phase will be studied using Tannor's recent formulation of scattering theory in terms of Gaussian wavepacket solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation with absorbing boundary conditions.   In this approach, S-matrix elements are calculated by Fourier analysis of a time correlation function between reactant and product wavepackets propagating in the transition state region.   The  theory will be applied to the calculation of state-to-state reaction probabilities for elementary gas phase reactions.    Dissipative scattering processes in liquids will be studied using a similar flux-flux correlation function computed from a quantum density matrix obtained by solution of a quantum Liouville equation containing relaxational operators corresponding to frictional forces.  These methods will be applied to the analysis of laser experiments, performed by other investigators,  including phase sensitive detection of transient dichroism and birefringence.    It is possible to obtain a very detailed understanding of chemical reactions of small molecules in the gas phase in which one measures, or calculates, the rates for molecules in individual quantum states.  The first component of this research project is the development of mathematical methods leading to faster and more accurate computations of the speeds of these state-to-state transitions.  A chemical reaction in a liquid is the net result of a vast number of such processes so one seeks a theory in which these molecular details are averaged out yielding the net chemical reaction rate expressed in terms of temperature and bulk solvent properties such as viscosity.  The second component of this project is directed toward this type of theoretical description. In this fundamental research project, the results of lengthy computer calculatio ns will be compared with results of recent laser experiments to begin to test the validity of the underlying concepts and methods.",
