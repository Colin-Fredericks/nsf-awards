Five   natural products are identified for the purpose of defining the   specific goals of the project. They fall into two groups, one   consisting of a set for which bond reorganization involving a   cyclobutane is the focal step, and another in which elaboration   of a heterocyclic subunit plays a pivotal role. The first group   contains rubratoxin B, verrucarol, and huperzine A. The second   group contains the alkaloids cylindrospermopsin and koumine.   The major emphasis in all of the syntheses is the ability to   complete efficient routes to structures containing a high   degree of complexity.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. James D. White of the Department of   Chemistry at Oregon State University. Professor White will   focus his work on the discovery of new synthetic methods and   their application to the synthesis of certain carbocyclic and   heterocyclic compounds of natural origins. The molecular   architecture of the designated target compounds presents a   significant challenge to contemporary methods of synthesis   which will be addressed by exploring unconventional and, in   several instances, unprecedented approaches to their   construction.  ***",
