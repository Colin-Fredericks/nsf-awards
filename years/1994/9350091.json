The District will established a Self-Study Steering  Committee and seven Action Committees to assist the Project  Director in the study.  The Steering Committee will include members  with math, science, and/or technology backgrounds representing the  School Board, teacher's association, universities, and local  cultural institutions.  The Action Committee members will come from  the mathematics and science communities at Purdue University,  Indiana University, Ball State University, and other area  universities.  They will assist in the collection and analysis of  data and in developing recommendations.    The Self-Study will use the NCTM Standards, AAAS's Science for All  Americans, and the benchmark from Project 2061 as criteria and  points of reference to determine the status and direction of the  mathematics and science programs.  The Project Director will  coordinate the work of the Steering Committee and Action  Committees.  The study process will have three phases:  the self-  evaluation phase, the visiting committee phase (1 year), and the  follow-up phase for implementation (5 years).  It will follow the  principles of the National Study of School Evaluation and adapt it  approach to data collection.  ***",
