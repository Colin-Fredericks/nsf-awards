 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina of the eye continues to be a part of the nervous system that provides important advances in our knowledge about information processing mechanisms, including neuronal microcircuitry and synaptic communication, computational studies, neural development, and how perceptual psychophysics is related to sensory biology.  This symposium concentrates on recent advances in understanding these aspects of vision, and provides a unique opportunity for intensive discussions among a small group.  The focus is on events occuring in the retina directly related to information processing, including information flows in retinal networks, biophysics of synaptic communication, and computational and modeling approaches.  Participants include those with primary interests in sensory physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, anatomy and ultrastructure, engineering, and computational modeling.  The discussions in interdisciplinary group will have substantial impact on the future directions of visual studies in the retina, with likely added impact on areas of artificial vision and network analysis for information processing.",
