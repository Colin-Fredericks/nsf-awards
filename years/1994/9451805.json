The computer laboratory is designed to radically change the current  mode of instruction and the assessment of learning in these  courses.  The project is developing innovative ways of using  symbolic computational software in instruction and significantly  enhance student understanding of basic ideas. Under this project,  the software Derive is used extensively to teach linear algebra and  numerical analysis. The built-in utilities of Derive as well as  those written by students and teachers is used for all the work in  these courses.  Courses are project oriented and require  cooperative learning; student assessment is changed radically to  reflect the new emphases.  The laboratory is being equipped with 20  networked Intel-486 based PCs and software to augment the 8  existing PCs in the mathematics department's computer laboratory.   Dissemination of newly developed utilities, on-line instruction  manuals, and student projects is through anonymous ftp.  Discussion  over the internet is used to modify and improve the project and the  materials produced.  An extensive evaluation also is used for these  purposes.",
