 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406969  Amero    The project is directed towards understanding the mechanism of action of a unique transcription factor, PEP, isolated from Drosophila.  The protein is associated with RNA in the nucleus and therefore termed an hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein.  Biochemical characterization of the protein suggests that it may play a role in activating transcription while associated with RNA.  This is a very unusual function for an hnRNP and will be investigated more thoroughly.  Genetic studies and in vivo analysis of  PEP function are difficult in Drosophila.  The award will be used to identify and characterize a comparable gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  A colleague, Dr. Johns Lopes, has agreed to assist the PI in learning the appropriate yeast manipulations.  %%%  The project deals with a very unusual protein isolated from fruit flies.  The protein is found tightly bound to RNA but seems to also affect the expression of information from DNA.  The preliminary characterization of the protein has been carried as far as is reasonably possible using the insect system.  To more completely understand the mechanism of action of the protein, the yeast homologue will be characterized and the corresponding gene cloned and mutated.  Studies of mutant forms of the protein will greatly facilitate the identification of protein affects gene expression in living cells.  ***",
