The  major  areas  include:   (1)  analytical  evaluation  of  bridges  (loads,   system  identification  methods,  damage   accumulation  models,  time  history  models), (2)  bridge  management  systems  (optimization  models, decision making strategy,  BMS  data  set,  bridge  expert  systems,  strategic  long  range  planning,   (3)  diagnostic procedures (bridge tests, weigh-9n-motion, performance  monitors,    nondestructive   techniques,   signal    processing,  integrated  sensor  systems,  microwave,  acoustic  and   optical  techniques),  (4)  materials  and  techniques  for   repair   and  rehabilitation  of  bridges  (steel, reinforced  and  prestressed  concrete,  masonry  arches, timber, new materials).   Accordingly  the  Bridge  Study tour will attempt to review state of  the  art  summary of main topics as reviewed on one hand in the U.  S.  and,  on  the  other hand, in Poland, Czech Republic,  Slovak  Republic  and Hungary, identify the research needs, in particular  topics  for cooperative projects; and derive some recommendations  that  reflect  the  need  in manpower,  technology  transfer  and  education  for the near future.  The Study Tour will involve  the  US  group  of bridge researchers, consultants and representatives  of  bridge  authorities, visiting Poland, Czech Republic,  Slovak  Republic and Hungary.  the local organizers will organize special  conferences, meetings and field trips to the construction  sites.  The results will be presented in the report.  ***",
