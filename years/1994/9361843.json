Simple unconstrained molecular dynamics  simulations need to use small steps to track the high frequency dynamics that result from stiff  springs representing chemical bonds and angles. To increase the step size, constraints are often  introduced in the particle equations by including a term representing the constraint gradient  multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier. While rigorous, this method introduces new computational  overheads, which has led to the approximate and not entirely satisfactory SHAKE algorithm.   SHAKE works well with bonds and angles, but fails to generalize arbitrary constraints. In this  feasibility research, an algorithm, called EXACT which represents an exact constraint technique,  will be developed which will handle open and closed loops, is highly efficient, can generalize  arbitrary constraints and will be well-suited for parallel implementation.  %%%  Computationally efficient molecular dynamics algorithms are an enabling technology to deal with  practical problems such as rational drug design and design of advanced polymer composites. The  EXACT algorithm will be directly useful for real-world applications and, if successful, by the  end of Phase II will be incorporated into various commercial software systems for dissemination  to the computational chemistry community.  ***",
