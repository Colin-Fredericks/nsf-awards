 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310936, PI-Shapiro:  With this project, the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology will improve its seawater system.  The facility has undergone a recent expansion, resulting in a doubling of resident faculty.  The number of active research programs has tripled, and an additional new faculty position will begin in September 1993.  The expansion has also resulted in an increased use of the present seawater system, along with increased need for reliability in support of funded research programs.  Specifically, the plan is to improve the seawater intake system, construct a second pumping system to be placed in parallel with the existing system, duplicate the piping from pump to  storage tanks, provide a back up air compressor system, and provide a monitoring and alarm system.  The improvements were designed with redundancy, serviceability, and performance as prime criteria, and should result in a much increased level of security for on going research programs.  The workplan is excellent.  The facility is growing at a rapid rate in terms of productive research use.  Research projects supported by the facility are significant to modern understanding and management of marine resources as well as to fields of basic biology.",
