 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406870  Khuller    Over recent years, the Capital Area Theory Seminar has been  particularly active, hosting a talk every other week.  Some of  the speakers for the seminar are local, and others are visitors  to the DC area.  The mailing list has 107 entries, some of which  are other mailing lists.  The goal of the seminar is to stimulate  activity in theoretical computer science.  In this regard, the  seminar has been relatively  successful.  The seminar is often  attended by researchers from Univ. of Maryland at Baltimore  County, Johns Hopkins Univ. and Georgetown University.    The Workshop on Algorithmic Research in Midsouthwest (WARM) has  been sponsored by the National Science Foundation, under Grant  CCR-9104017, so that, in the last three years, researchers from  Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma could hold biannual workshops to  exchange the latest developments in algorithmic research and  related areas and provide a forum for exchange of ideas.    This grant will allow a continuation of WARM meetings twice a  year in Spring and Autumn.  There will be between 4 and 6 talks  each time including 1 or 2 talks from visiting leading  researchers from other areas of the country.  A portion of each  meeting is allocated on informal discussion.  ***",
