During Phase I, United States Senators Bob Kerrey and Paul Simon  will present a dilemma for debate, \"National Priorities: should tax  dollars be spent for health care or space exploration?\" This  interactive session with the senators, 100 on-site teachers, and  teachers on-line in Iowa, Kansas, and Illinois, sets the stage for  the four rotating hands-on training sessions with the award winning  education/technologists.  Teachers will develop and implement  application skills in global technologies, such as internet, CD-  Room, digitizing imagery, remote sensing imagery, E-mail, file  transfer, and Gopher sites.    Phase II is the implementation follow-up phase and occurs in the  classroom as children use the internet resources and software to  research information on health care and space exploration.  The  three week Great Debate occurs on-line with children among four  states.    This unique workshop and on-line debate will result in having 100  teachers and 4,000 children actively accessing internet resources  and direct connect software from NASA.  These teachers and children  will serve as trainers for other teachers.  Additionally, a viable  network will be in place among teachers, researchers, scientists,  and education technologists.  An action plan is already in process  to refine and replicate this technology/interdiscipli nary  curricular model in other schools in other states.  Another major  accomplishment to result from this project is having children  explore careers in science, mathematics, and technology and  begin  to fill the need of 700,000 more experts in these fields b 2010.   It is intended for this project to also motivate and excite  children about studying mathematics, science, engineering, and  technology to propel United States children to be first in the  world:  a step toward the American 2000 goal.  ***",
