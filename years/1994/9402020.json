By using   niobium  arrays  we  will  explore  a new physical regime where the penetration depth is  smaller  than the unit cell of the array. These investigations will be used  to  model  vortex  motion, to study coherent motion of  vortices,  and  to  study  novel  phase-locked solutions of non-linear dynamical  systems.  With  sub-micron  size  junctions, the arrays  can  exhibit  ballistic  motion of the vortices and give rise to mesoscopic transport which.    Non-technical abstract:  Josephson  junctions form the basis of most devices in superconducting  electronics. We will study a lattice of such devices coupled together.  In  such a lattice the magnetic field is bound in bundles of quantized  magnetic flux called vortices. These arrays allow one to study  vortex  motion in new regimes where motion can be ballistic and can give  rise  to  novel  collective  states  that  are  coherent   or  even  quantum  mechanical.  By understanding such motion one will be able  to  design  more  efficient and novel superconducting electronic devices. One  can  also  add    to the understanding of quantum mechanical effects  which  occur  on  macroscopic  (rather  than  atomic)  lengths  and  to   the  understanding of new non-linear effects in dynamical systems.  ***",
