 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322427  Rodriguez  This is a Minority Research Initiation award to conduct theoretical  research on strongly correlated electrons in two dimensions within  the context of high temperature superconductivity.  Within the  framework of a lightly doped antiferromagnet, the experimentally  relevant question of the magnetoresistance expected in such systems  will be explored.  Existing data on magneto-transport will be  interpreted within this scheme.  Spin-charge separated  superconductivity itself will be studied in two dimensions with  particular emphasis on uncovering the Kosterlitz-Thouless  transitions that exist in such systems.  Suggestions that Mott  transitions in strongly interactiong two-dimensional electron  systems may induce corresponding structural phase transitions will  also be studied.  The objective of the research is to provide a  theoretical understanding of the structural transitions present in  oxide superconductors.  An additional project will involve studies  of two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets having static defects.  %%%  This Minority Research Initiation award involves theoretical  research relating to the high temperature superconductors.  The  Principle Investigator will use sophisticated theoretical  techniques to study systems of strongly interacting electrons in  two dimensions, i.e., in a flat plane.  These models are thought to  be relevant to the oxide superconductors which consist of planes of  atoms.  Contact will be made to experimental measurements.  ***",
