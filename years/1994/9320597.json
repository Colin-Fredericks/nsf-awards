 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baer         Using theory and experiment, the investigator and his  colleague study the integration of multiple electrical inputs into  excitable neuronal structures. A new cable theory, developed by  Baer and Rinzel (1991) to study large populations of dendritic  spines, is adapted to fit the reality of a particular biological  system:  the multiterminally innervated muscle fiber of the insect  Manduca.  The mathematics involves the formulation and analysis of  reaction diffusion models for multiple populations of spines, to  model the amplitude and timecourse of potentials arising in  cylindrical structures (dendrite or muscle fiber) receiving  synchronous input from multiple clusters of synapses.  Important  biological properties considered are the amplitude of the quantal  currents, shape of the postsynaptic process, the inherent  uncertainty of an input actually occurring (probability of  release), and the precise distribution of voltage gated channels.  Theory is related to experimental data and drives new experiments.       The functions of all excitable cells, both nerve and muscle,  are regulated with precision by transmembrane potentials.  This  project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between a  mathematician and a neurobiologist to study, using experiments and  mathematical modeling, the spatial and temporal distribution of  electrical potentials in complex neuronal structures.  A  mathematical model is developed to simulate amplitude and  timecourse of potentials arising in cylindrical structures  (dendrite or muscle fiber) receiving synchronous input from  multiple clusters of synapses. The investigators use  multiterminally innervated muscle fibers to test the predictions  of the model, and conversely use the model to augment their  understanding of synaptic physiology.  The multiterminally  innervated muscle fiber allows an unusual array of experimental  and morphometric measurements, and has the added advantage of  being the topological equivalent of a dendrite having clust ers of  input spines.  Consequently, both the conclusions of the  simulations and the methodology being developed have broad  applications to central nervous system structures.",
