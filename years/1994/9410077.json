 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on two important inter-related issues in  the design of large scale parallel computers:  inter-processor communication  and fault-tolerance. The nature of  the research is one of synthesizing  theoretical and  practical approaches to parallel computing.    Efficient  inter-processor communication is at the heart of  efficient parallel computing.  With some exceptions, much  of the theoretical work has focused on provably  optimal  algorithms that are often too complex to implement.  On the  other  hand, much of the implemented routing hardware have  simpler designs but lack  theoretical guarantees as to their  performance.  This project will attempt to  bridge this gap  and focus on simple routing schemes that are provably good  (though not always optimal).    Fault tolerance is becoming ever-increasingly  important in  the world of parallel computers with a large number of  fallible  components.  The study of fault-tolerant routing  schemes  focuses on algorithms  that can route packets  efficiently even in the presence of faulty switches.  The  two research directions represent very important but largely  uncharted  territory.  The first concerns the question of  intrinsic limitations on the  fault tolerance of networks.  The second research direction concerns  reconfiguring in  increasingly important class of parallel computers known as  heterogeneous parallel computers.",
