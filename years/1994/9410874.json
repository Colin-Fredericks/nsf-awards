 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410874  Kareiva       Corridors for animal dispersal are being increasingly examined  as a management option for reducing the risk of extinction in  threatened species.  The idea is that these corridors encourage  genetic diversity by the exchange of individuals between different  regions, and offer a vehicle for recolonization of local  populations that might go extinct due to chance catastrophes.   While corridors could clearly in theory be a cost-effective means  for promoting biodiversity, their biological efficacy is not  established.  In fact, ecologists have not even devised a clear  protocol for evaluating corridor effectiveness.       This research will assess the effectiveness of habitat  corridors for a threatened species in Oregon, where in fact local  governments are considering establishing corridors.  Protocols will  be developed for converting observations of how animals move  through habitats into predictions about the likely value of  corridors in conservation efforts.  Small-scale experimental  corridors will be created and individuals will be moved into  different habitat types (or edges between habitat types) for  observations of movement behavior.",
