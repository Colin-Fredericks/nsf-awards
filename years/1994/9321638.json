 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321638  Bramble    This is a comparative morphological study that addresses the  functional relationships between thoracic design and locomotor  behavior among highly cursorial, moderately cursorial, and non-  cursorial members of the order Lagomorpha (hares, cottontails,  and pikas). A novel approach will be take to understand the  functional morphology of the thoracic complex: the mechanical  role of the lungs and the interaction of lungs, heart, and ribs,  during locomotion will be examined. A previously unexplored  function of the lungs within the thorax will be modeled:  pneumatic stabilization. This study will test the hypothesis that  lungs, in addition to their role as gas exchangers, may act as  pneumatic stabilizers of the chest walls and heart and that this  mechanism will be positively correlated with running ability. A  model will be developed which describes the integrated function  of the mammalian thoracic complex during exercise based on the  morphology, material properties, and mechanical interactions of  its constituent elements. High speed cineradiographic analysis  will be used in dynamic tests of both cadavers and live rabbits  in order to describe the interactions of elements of the thoracic  complex and to test essential predictions of the pneumatic  stabilization model.  ***",
