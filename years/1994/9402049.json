 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402049  Chou  The neural network's capability of making reasonable response  (output) even  when it was presented with incomplete, noisy or  previously unseen input has significant impact in engineering  applications. Many times, due to physical or environmental  limitations such as after a natural disaster, not all forms or  types of data are collected for safety analysis. In this  situation, tradition reliability analysis could be halted,  terminated or greatly compromised. In addition, neural network  accepts relationships between input and response that are  deterministic, probabilistic or fuzzy. The Career Advancement  Award for Women Scientists and Engineers provides the  Investigator an opportunity to expand her current research area  of structural safety utilizing probabilistic, statistical and  fuzzy set theory to civil engineering, particularly structural  engineering. Neural network is an artificial intelligence tool  that has shown to be more flexible than expert systems. From  studies performed in other engineering disciplines, they show  great potential that the concept is applicable to civil  engineering problems as well.  ***",
