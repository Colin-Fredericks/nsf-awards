Until recently, information in computers was almost always in alpha-numeric form, but today, alpha-numeric information seems very restricting in our interactions with computers.  We need multimedia systems that will seamlessly manage audio, video, graphics, alpha-numeric and several other forms of information. To meet these new demands, many aspects of multimedia computing are being addressed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego.       This award provides equipment to support active research projects in the emerging areas of multimedia computing in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. The massive storage equipment will be used for several research projects covering many important areas of multimedia computing: multimedia servers, networking, operating systems, and databases. This equipment will also facilitate joint research projects in distributed multimedia information systems. The massive storage will help to take some of the algorithms and studies to the level of realistic prototypes.  In addition, the equipment will also be available to other researchers developing multimedia tools in robotics, artificial intelligence, health care, manufacturing and other related areas.    ***",
