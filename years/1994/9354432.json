With this approach, new  topics would be introduced first in the laboratory and then  discussed more fully during the lecture. The central objective is  to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a comprehensive  set of instructional modules that will address the concerns of  chemistry educators and satisfy the needs of introductory chemistry  curricula. The modules will include student handouts, a teacher's  guide, and suggestions for their implementation. The modules will  be appropriate not only for science majors but also for non-science  majors.  Initial development has initiated in the students a  positive response and attitude towards chemistry.  Five colleges and universities involved are collaborating in  testing the discovery exercises and the instructional modules.   Dissemination will be through this broad outreach and materials  development.  Evaluation will be carried out during the project and  with students after their graduation.  ***y",
