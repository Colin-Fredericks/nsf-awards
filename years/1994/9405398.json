 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405398  Abbott         In view of the excellent science and  engineering capabilities that exist in many  countries in all parts of the world, it is  increasingly important for U.S. scientists and  engineers to remain in close touch with the  activities and plans of their foreign  colleagues, in part as a means for planning  joint research programs with them.  Additionally, gaining an understanding of many  important scientific problems, such as those  associated with the global environment,  requires cooperative scientific efforts on a  multinational basis. U.S. scientists and  engineers have a number of available mechanisms  to maintain close communication with scientists  and engineers in other countries.  Among the  most extensive of these mechanisms are the  non-governmental international disciplinary  unions which today comprise the International  Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in which  more than 70 countries are represented.   National members of these unions, as well as  ICSU-proper, are private scientific bodies  whose activities are normally determined by  committees of working scientists.  In the  United States, the National Academy of Sciences  (NAS) is the official adhering body to ICSU and  its unions.  This grant will support U.S.  participation in the ICSU complex by enabling  the NAS, in cooperation with the National  Research Council (NRC), to manage the  activities of the U.S. National Committees for  ICSU and 20 its 23 associated disciplinary  unions for a period of three years.  ***",
