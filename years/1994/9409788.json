The most general  condition of Markov chains related to the above properties is  associated with Harris recurrence, which requires the Markov  chain returning to every set of positive measure infinitely  often, with probability 1.  The properties of Harris recurrent  Markov chains are well studied.  However, there are examples of  common Markov chains (e.g., some simple auto-regressive models)  which are not Harris recurrent.  It appears that Harris  recurrence is a strong condition.  A.V. Skorokhod suggests  another type of recurrence --- topological recurrence.         Topological recurrence requires the Markov chain returning  to every open set infinitely often with probability 1.  Topological recurrence is essentially weaker and more natural  than Harris recurrence.  Skorokhod's work should have impact in a  lot of applications. But so far, this result is still a  heoretical advance only.  Further understanding of topological  recurrence should give us insight into  the essence of  convergence of Markov chains.  The proposed work here is to make  a preliminary study of further applications of topological  recurrence.  ***",
