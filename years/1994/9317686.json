DahlenID,u   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9317686  The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) needs to  significantly expand its intra-campus connections to resources  available through the NSFNET.  At the same time, the University  needs to provide a means of integrating Internet resources and  networked connectivity into its existing information services.    An integral part of this plan is to educate nursing students,  educators, researchers, and practitioners to the advantages of  campus and Internet resources by promoting access and networked  connectivity and mechanisms for improving communication,  increasing information access, and for sharing knowledge.  The  long-term goal is to extend this prototype to the other health  professional schools and to the campus as a whole.      The main objectives are: to streamline library operations and  connectivity; to improve patron service; to develop new forms of  collaboration and knowledge-sharing among nursing practitioners  in the field; and to test educational strategies to integrate  Internet resources into both the curriculum and practice of  nursing.",
