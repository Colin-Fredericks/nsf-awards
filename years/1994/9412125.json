The Workshop will be attended by representatives of the cognitive science community who do research on the description and development of those abilities, concepts, and processes underlying mathematics and science skills, representatives of the educational community who are researcher-practitioners, and representatives from Federal agencies.  The workshop will consider how the Cognitive Science and Education Research communities can more fruitfully interact to provide the research underpinnings for strengthening mathematics and science education.  The final report will issue recommendations for future research initiatives that promote such an interaction.  Such research will strengthen American economic competitiveness by educating a workforce better prepared for the technological demands of the 21st Century.    ***",
