 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a marine geophysical investigation of the  Bransfield Strait and the Shackleton Fracture Zone and environs in  the Scotia Sea in an effort to understand the neotectonic evolution  of the region.  Multibeam swath mapping and sidescan sonar mapping  will be used along with multichannel seismic imaging.  The main  goal of this proposal is to collect multibeam and sidescan sonar  data to map the structural character and tectonic fabric of the  evolving plate boundary in Southwest Scotia Sea, Shackleton  Fracture Zone, and Bransfield Strait.  Follow up multichannel  seismic surveys will be done in the Southwest Scotia Sea.  The  secondary goal is to use sidescan sonar reflectivity images to  generate detailed structural maps of the seafloor of these regions  and to integrate the new data with existing seismic reflection,  Geosat gravity, Hydrosweep and Seabeam bathymetric data.  Once the  base maps are produced they can be used by other researchers to  help interpret multichannel and single channel seismic reflection  records.    The neotectonic evolution of the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea  is extremely complex. Understanding the recent evolution of the  Drake-Scotia-Antarctic-South America plate intersections will  provide important information as to how major plate boundaries  reorganize after demise of a long-lived spreading center and the  consequential reduction in the number of plates.  The plate  reorganization probably resulted in the uplift of the Shackleton  Ridge which may have effected the sedimentary patterns in both the  Scotia Sea and possibly the Weddell Sea.  If the break of the  Shackleton transform fault can be traced with multibeam and  sidescan sonar as it intersects the southern end of South America  then the orientation and geometry of the faults, fractures and  deformation as the transform fault intersects the South American  continent will help to interpret the structures in that complex  region.     Bransfield Strait is presently undergoing extensi on based on high  heat flow, active volcanoes and inferences from seismic reflection  work.  Seismic refraction indicates thick crust similar to the East  African Rift or passive volcanic margins of continents.  In  contrast, analysis of isotopes and rare earth elements of the  recent volcanics shows seemingly no continental contamination.  The  active extension in Bransfield Strait must be related to the plate  reorganization but it is unclear exactly what tectonic processes  are occurring.  Besides elucidating the tectonic fabric of  Bransfield Strait, the multibeam and sidescan sonar survey will  identify potential dredge targets and DSRV Alvin dive sites.",
