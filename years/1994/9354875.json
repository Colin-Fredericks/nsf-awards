 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary, inter-institution graduate study program  involving Hampton University and Virginia Tech (VPI) (see  appendix I) is proposed to enhance the possibility for minority  students to obtain the Ph.D. degree.  In the program students  will obtain the M.S. degree at Hampton University and will  complete advance study by obtaining the Ph.D. degree at Virginia  Tech with research on environmentally significant and relevant  topics.  A unique student and faculty exchange program is  incorporated into the overall traineeship effort.  The research  areas and education in environmental science and chemistry  provide a balanced program for advanced study.  Research topics  available for students in the program include 1) synthesis of  organic compounds using environmentally benign supercritical  solvent media (carbon dioxide), 2) conversion of aromatic and  chlorinated aromatic compounds via microbial oxygenation and  transformation into medicinal and pharmaceutical materials,   3) synthesis and characterization of porpyrins, the development  of polymeric materials for use in organic synthesis, 4) synthesis  and characterization of nitrated heterocycles, 5) transition  metal catalysis in organic synthesis, 6) studies of organic free  radicals and radical ions, 7) trace element speciation in aqueous  media; analytical methods development with atomic absorption  spectroscopy, ion chromatography, and high performance liquid  chromatography, 8) studies of trace element transport in ground-  water by suspended particles, 9) development of slurry injection  analytical methods for the direct elemental analysis of  geological samples, 10) design of extraction procedures and  analytical  methodology using environmentally benign  supercritical fluids for the analysis of hazardous chemicals in  marine and estuarine samples, 11) chromatographic methods for the  analysis of organic contaminants in water, 12) assessment of  placer heavy-mineral resources, nutrient influx in natural water,  13) studi es of crystal growth and surface adsorption reactions of  interest in chemical oceanography, 14) investigation of non-  solvent and non-organic solvent methods for treatment of and  adhesive bonding to adherend surfaces, 15) environmental  awareness in materials selection and processing methods for the  preparation of high performance adhesive and composite materials,  and 16) noise-induced transitions in nonlinear, dissapative, and  physico-chemical dynamical systems.",
