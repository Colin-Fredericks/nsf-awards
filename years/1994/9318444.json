Manter Laboratory, University of Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln.  There, the specimens will be curated, integrated into the collections, added to the computer database, and serve the international parasitological community by continuing to receive hapantotype, parahapantotype, and voucher specimens of avian blood parasites, as well as lend specimens to qualified investigators.  The name will be retained as a subunit of the Harold W. Manter Laboratory.  The International Reference Center for Avian Haematozoa was established in 1968 by the World Health Organization at Memorial University of Newfoundland with Dr. Gordon F. Bennett as Officer in Charge.  Acute financial problems forced WHO to close most of its International Centers in 1974, but Memorial University agreed to support the Center with Dr. Bennett as Professor and Head.  In 1978, this unique Center was designated by the World Federation of Parasitologists as the international repository for avian blood parasites.  The Harold W. Manter Laboratory is one of three U.S. National Resource Centers for Parasitology.  Having \"rescued\" other threatened collections in the past, it offered to serve as repository and curator for the International Reference Center collection.  The invitation was accepted within hours of its receipt.",
