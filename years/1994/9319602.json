How external signals  transmit information to the nucleus to regulate these processes is  a fundamental question of cell biology.  The long range goal of  this research is to understand the biochemical mechanisms that  mediate cellular responses to these signals.  This project focuses  on the two calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes, micro- and milli-  calpain (EC 3.4.22.17), and a protein inhibitor that specifically  inhibits them, calpastatin.  These enzymes may play a direct role  in calcium-linked signal pathways and also may mediate integration  (cross-talk) between signalling pathways.  The proteins susceptible  to calpain represent each phase of signal transduction including  receptors, kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors.  It is  not known whether these signalling components share common features  that are recognized by calpain.  These studies will characterize  the substrate recognition determinants for calpains by 1)  identifying the calpastatin binding site within calpain; 2) testing  the hypothesis that either calmodulin-binding domains, PEST-  regions, or both, mediate substrate recognition; and 3) analyzing  the amino acid sequences surrounding calpain-cleavage sites within  potentially, physiologically significant protein targets.  Results  of these studies will provide new approaches for experimental  manipulation of calcium-linked signal pathways.  Another objective  is to discover how calcium regulates calpain activity.  It is   hypothesized that the regulation of calpain by calcium is analogous  to calmodulin regulation of its target enzymes.  A first step  toward testing this hypothesis will be to examine the effects of  calmodulin antagonists on calpain. Further tests of the hypothesis  are envisioned, but are beyond the scope of this project.  The  results of these experiments should provide important insights  towards a general understanding of  how calcium regulates the  functions of the proteins and enzymes that can bind calcium ion  directly.  %%%  Cells receive environmental signals which determine their  development, growth and differentiation.  How external signals  transmit information to the cell nucleus to regulate these  processes is a fundamental question of cell biology.  One major  internal messenger in signaling is calcium.  Intracellular calcium  levels have been found to go up in response to a variety of signals  in many types of cells, but the mechanisms by which calcium acts in  various signaling pathways are not yet understood despite much  research.  This project focuses on two calcium-dependent enzymes  that break down specific proteins, and an inhibitor that  specifically inhibits them.  These enzymes may play direct roles in  calcium-linked signal pathways and also may mediate cross-talk  between different signalling pathways. A primary goal of this  research is to characterize the mechanisms by which the calcium-  dependent enzymes recognize and act on other proteins in the   signaling pathways.  The results will be an important contribution  to our understanding of the role of calcium in cellular signal  transduction mechanisms.***",
