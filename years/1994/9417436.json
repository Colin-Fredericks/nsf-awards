 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417436  Cramb            This award is a \"Tie\" project between two Industry/University  Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) designed to evaluate the  effects of alloy additions, added to enhance machinability of the  steel, on the liquid and solid state processing characteristics  of SAE 4120 alloy steel.  The Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Advanced Steel Processing and Products at   Colorado School of Mines is determining the effects of alloying  and solute segregation on the hot working behavior and final  microstructures of the alloys.  The Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Iron and Steel Research at  Carnegie Mellon University is evaluating the effects of these  alloying additions in slag-metal interactions and solidification  characteristics.  The two efforts define independent yet  collaborative studies of selected alloy additions, and the  combined research creates a synergism in the understanding of  machinable steels that would not be possible at either  institution alone.    Environmental and health concerns increase the urgency of  replacing lead as an additive for enhanced machinability of  steels.  A number of chemical elements have potential   substitutes for the lead, for example copper, niobium, bismuth,  tellurium, and selenium.  Some of these elements are known to  adversely affect the hot shortness (a term that describes the  deformability of the steel over a reasonable processing  temperature), brittleness, segregation of alloying elements in  the steel, solidification and casting processes, and the reaction  of the steel melt with the refractory lining in the smelting  furnace.  Any utilization of these alloying elements as  substitutes for toxic lead must be done in a manner to avoid any  of the adverse situations above.  Colorado School of Mines is  investigating the properties of the steel and Carnegie Mellon  University is investigating the melting, casting and  solidification characteristics of the same experimental alloys.    This combination of expertise addresses the complete scope of  issues needed before these new alloys can become commercially  viable.    The Program Manager recommends Carnegie Mellon University be  awarded $80,000 for 36 months for this \"Tie\" project.",
