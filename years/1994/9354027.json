The  project targets teachers in four-year colleges and in community  colleges in the Pacific Northwest region.  The summer component  of this project entails an intensive two-week program in  materials science with lectures, small group discussions,  laboratories and research sessions for a group of 30 college  science, engineering and technology instructors. The variety of  activities built into the workshop sessions enables  participants to gain hands-on knowledge of the materials field  and of working laboratory experiments that can be used in their  home institutions, while insuring that they have sufficient  time to learn and reinforce needed basic understanding in the  materials area.  The academic year follow-up activities in the  program include curriculum development activities by  participants interacting by computer; and a weekend meeting on  campus during the academic year will reinforce these activities  and provide additional background and advanced topic lectures  to participants.  ***",
