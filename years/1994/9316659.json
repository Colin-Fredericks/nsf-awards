 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316659  Maurasse       The Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary beds in the Southern  Peninsula of Haiti are of special interest because of the  stratigraphic continuity of the sequences, and because structures  in the marker beds may offer succession of events that will allow  for the characterization of oceanic disturbances that affected the  deep basin of the Caribbean Sea.  Our most recent investigation of  an extended area of the Beloc Formation suggest that different  outcrops in the area may provide key lithologic and  biostratigraphic data necessary to determine whether or not the  disruptive phenomenon recorded at the boundary is single or  multiple.        Although the genesis of the marker beds is unresolved,  preliminary correlation of diverse sequences in the area suggests  that some of the structures are caused by extraordinary waves of  translation in deep water rather than from turbidity currents.  The  hypothesis of such giant waves is compatible with predicted models  of potential disturbances expected to take place in the water  column in conjunction with an oceanic target site (Gault and  Sonett, 1982; O'Keefe and Ahrens, 1982; Ahrens and O'keefe, 1983;  Sonett et al., 1991).       This project will focus specifically on the detailed analysis  of amalgamated beds that show physical evidence of poorly  understood oceanic disturbances recorded in the transitional series  at several additional locations in the Peninsula.       The results will provide additional data to:  1) further  characterize the oceanic disturbances(s) that led to the genesis of  reworked marker beds in deep-water basins; 2) find a viable  solution for unexplained fossil mixing in deep-ocean basins  observed worldwide at the K/T boundary; 3) better understand the  magnitude of oceanic mixing that could have been caused by an  impact.",
