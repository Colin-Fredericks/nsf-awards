The two instruments will  share computers. Both instruments will be rapidly phased into  existing chemistry lab courses, significantly upgrading experiments  and creating new ones. It is expected that knowledge gained in  constructing the sophisticated thermal gravimetric instrument from  available, rather inexpensive parts, will inspire others to build  similar instruments, thereby expanding participation in the field.  The project, begun in Spring of 1994, should be completed by the  end of that year. Over their projected lifetimes, both instruments  will be used directly by numerous students and faculty. Hands on  experience and expertise gained by students should further their  scientific careers. A goal of the project is to design new  experiments related to thermal analysis for labs in advanced  inorganic, physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, analytical,  and even general chemistry. Another project goal is the compilation  of a library of standard thermograms insofar as possible for  distribution to the scientific community.",
