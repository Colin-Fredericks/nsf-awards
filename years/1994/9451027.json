Reactions often involve new and more restrictive  guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Also, the  implementation of these guidelines and the increased measures  necessary to guard against vandalism require substantial  expenditures of scarce funds. This project therefore  supports an introductory undergraduate physiological psychology  laboratory which uses simple invertebrate preparations and  psychophysiological experiments. Basic computer equipment and  accessories are used. Demonstrations illustrate a variety of  neurophysiological phenomena, and undergraduates learn different  electrophysiological and psychophysiological techniques.  Given the continued controversy over the use of vertebrate animals  in teaching and research, it is also expected that many departments  of psychology and biology will find this approach to the  undergraduate study of neuroscience valuable.",
