The Indian organizer is  Professor J. Maharana of the Institute of  Physics, Bhubaneswar 751 005, India.  The  workshop is designed to bring together most of  the active physicists of India working in the  area, along with some of the most eminent  physicists of the world, to discuss some of the  most fundamental problems of physics.  the  Topics will be: physics of black holes and  their evaporations, evolution of the Universe  at very early epochs, the problem of the  cosmological constant, as well as the question  of unification of fundamental forces of Nature.    Scope:  The scientific field of the proposed  workshop is one in which the Indian scientific  community has made noticeable contributions.   There is a real potential that some of the  Indian participants in the workshop will  contribute to the body of knowledge available  in the field.  This area of theoretical physics  has been popular with scientists from less  industrialized countries where modern  experimental physics facilities are not readily  available.  The workshop will provide for  exchanges of information and stimulate joint  research and collaboration in this relatively  low-cost research.  ***",
