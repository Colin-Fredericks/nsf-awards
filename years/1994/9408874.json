 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of this research is to produce a general and versatile  path  planner  that  can be applied to a wide  range  of  complex  situations  including both multiple redundant robots and  wheeled  vehicles  subject  to obstacle avoidance and  other  constraints.  Currently, path planning is a human--intensive endeavor with long  and  arduous teaching of the robot path by a human operator in  a  simulated  work  environment.   Besides  the  cost  and   quality  considerations  of  such practice, planning for  certain  complex  systems,  such  as  multifingered robot hands  or  tractors  with  multiple  trailers,  are beyond the capability  of  most  humans.  The  approach of this research project is to first pose the  path  planning problem as a finite-time nonlinear control problem,  and  then  transform  it  to  a  static  root-finding  problem  in  an  augmented  space which can be iteratively solved.   The  approach  will  be  extended  to  address issues  related  to  convergence,  penalty  function  selection,  optimality,  and  robustness   and  sensitivity  with respect to the kinematic model.  The  algorithm  will   be   systematically  applied,  in  both   simulation   and  experimentation  n,  to a number of fairly complex  case  studies  involving both redundant manipulators and wheeled vehicles  which  have traditionally been treated as different cases.",
