 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320849  Berry    This research investigation develops and tests a model of state  welfare policy which stresses the interaction of three groups of  participants:  (1) poor individuals who decide whether to  participate in welfare; (2) state policy makers who establish  conditions for eligibility and set benefit levels for programs  like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC); and, (3)  national policy makers who set general guidelines for state  policies.  The model incorporates seven \"submodels,\" each  focusing on a major research question from the welfare  literature.    In most cases, the submodels involve specifications that reflect  the core logic in support of the submodel more accurately than  specifications in the existing literature.  More importantly,  while extant literature tends to investigate these models in  isolation, this research recognizes that this division of labor  has impeded our ability to answer the research questions of  interest by basing conclusions on parameter estimates from  grossly underspecified models.  In contrast, this research  estimates a more reasonable model reflecting combined causal  linkages in all seven submodels.  In effect, their ability to  obtain \"good\" estimates of coefficients in each submodel is  enhanced by statistical controls and identifying restrictions  based on the variables and causal linkages in the other  submodels.  ***",
