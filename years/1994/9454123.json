 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primarily because of extensive use by an increasing population and  a significant building boom following World War II, our nation's  infrastructure is degrading at an alarming rate.  It is clear that  there will not be sufficient funds in the foreseeable future to  address all the needed infrastructure replacements simultaneously.   It is therefore necessary to prioritize the needed repair,  rehabilitation, and replacement strategies.  To prioritize the  custodians of the infrastructure must have knowledge of assessment  technologies, deterioration science, structural evaluation and  analysis, construction methodologies, and new high performance  materials.  This proposal is for the establishment of a five year,  Masters through Ph.D., interdisciplinary graduate research  traineeship program which will provide the future custodians and  educators of the custodians the engineering knowledge to  effectively manage our infrastructure.    The program will be a fully integrated interdisciplinary curriculum  of material science, non-destructive testing, structural mechanics,  construction engineering and management, and sensor and control  activator technologies.  Integration will be achieved through  summer research programs and a fourth year research capstone  course.  A core course curriculum will be developed from existing,  developing, and to be developed courses in statistical data  analysis, electromagnetic sensors and waves, signal processing,  non-destructive evaluation of materials, infrastructure condition  assessment, structural evaluation and analysis, deterioration  science, fiber-polymer composites, health monitoring sensors and  damage control, and construction.  The core curriculum will provide  the breath for the student to understand the problems encountered  in maintaining our infrastructure.  Specialization in one of the  areas will provide the depth to crate solutions.    Research training will be accomplished through industry and  university cost-sharing summer research durin g the first three  years and during the fourth year.  Fourth year research will be  team solutions to industry problems and the fifth year will be  devoted to dissertation research.    A unique faculty-industry mentor program will be established to aid  in the retention of students.  The program will be laden with the  development of communication skills to insure student success.   Student recruitment will be on a personal basis by participating  faculty and graduate students and unique international educational  opportunities will be established.  Program student accommodations  will be under the umbrella of the Center for Infrastructure  Assessment and Management with newly constructed dedicated office  and research facilities.",
