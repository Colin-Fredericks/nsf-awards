 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407217  Stevens   The relationship between DNA at the molecular level and the expression of the developmental abnormality will be examined using the fruit fly Drosphila mercatorum as a model system.  In recent years molecular techniques have been developed facilitating the molecular mapping genes that control particular traits.  The PI proposes to apply these techniques to the abnormal abdomen syndrome in D. mercatorum.  For the past 20 years, scientists have been studying the genetics of D. mercatorum, thus this system allows the PI to investigate the genetic basis of a developmental abnormality.  In the past 10 years, the research has focused on identifying the genes involved in this abnormality and understanding the effect of this abnormality on affected individuals.  The developmental abnormality is controlled by two genes, with modifiers on the other chromosomes.  Experiments have demonstrated that the abnormality is modified by several genes scattered throughout the genome.  That is, the trait is affected by many genes.   The PI's goal is to identify modifiers of these major genes.  For example, we know the major genes for diabetes; however, the expression of this trait seems to depend on other genes.  It is likely that different genes in different people affect the expression of diabetes.  This project is analogous to identifying the other genes.  The PI will determine if the same or different genes in different flies affect the abnormality.  The PI will look for differences within and between populations.",
