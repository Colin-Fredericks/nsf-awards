Pooling information is particularly  important if the combination of members' unique information will  reveal a superior decision alternative.  However, previous work  shows that discussions tend to focus on commonly-held knowledge,  and groups risk overlooking an option supported by their  collective knowledge. This program of empirical work examines how  perceptions of knowledge distribution and task demands affect  information processing and communication styles.  Of particular  interest is the process of tacit coordination whereby members of  a group adjust their selection, rehearsal and communication of  information to obtain varying degrees of informational diversity  depending on perceived task demands.  This coordination can be  based on direct knowledge of others' access to information or on  acquired knowledge of what others have done on similar tasks in  the past.  It is hypothesized that some types of tasks  (collective recall, idea generation, intellective problems) will  encourage diversity of informational input whereas other types  (judgmental tasks) will promote uniformity of input. It is also  hypothesized that concerns about recall accuracy may promote  redundancy of informational sampling in order to provide social  validation.           It has been found that, in the process of decision making,  groups tend to focus on the information that is commonly held by  all members, ignoring information that is not shared by all but  that could lead to a better decision.  By advancing our  understanding of the conditions under which unique information is  likely to be shared, this research will provide knowledge  relevant to improving the quality of decision making in groups.   As such, it will have implications for various initiatives in  industry and government that have emphasi zed the importance of  basing decisions on the best information available from groups or  teams.  At the heart of these initiatives is the goal of  empowering people who are uniquely aware of crucial information  that could be used to improve processes and procedures, getting  them to speak up and make a difference.  The proposed research  will help to provide a sound basis for such attempts to enhance  worker productivity.",
