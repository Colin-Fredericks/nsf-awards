The seismic response of waste  repositories is of concern because dynamic loads may produce  relative movements within the waste, liner and cover  systems, foundation and their interfaces.  These movements  could damage the liner systems, with a consequent loss of  sealing, and/or disrupt the function of the leachate and gas  collection systems.    There is a relative lack of field data regarding landfill  performance during earthquake shaking, particularly with  respect to seismic performance of waste fills constructed  with composite liner systems containing geosynthetics.  The  1994 Northridge Earthquake provides important observational  data on the response of landfills to strong levels of  earthquake shaking.  Landfills which experienced strong  levels of shaking (peak bedrock accelerations of 0.2 g to  over 0.5g), including two with geosynthetic liner systems,  were inspected by the research team immediately after the  event.  None of these landfills showed any signs of major  instability, but several experienced damage due to cracking.    Because of the difficulties associated with laboratory  evaluation of the dynamic properties of waster materials,  these field observations present an invaluable opportunity  to back-calculate dynamic strength and deformation  properties.  One of the landfills (OII) is well instrumented  with survey monuments, inclinometers and a pair of strong  motion recording stations.    The objectives of the project are to:    1. Gather observational data documenting the seismic    performance of solid waste landfills strongly shaken by    the 1994 Northridge earthquake.      2. Organize existing landfill characterization data,    including characterization of the waste fill properties    (composition, age, unit weight, moisture content,    strength, and shear wave velocity) and landfill geometry.      3. Perf orm preliminary one-dimensional (1-D) equivalent    linear and nonlinear dynamic response analyses of five    important landfill case records and 2-D equivalent linear    dynamic response analyses of the OII landfill.  Perform    pseudo-static limit equilibrium and Newmark-type seismic    deformation analyses to back-calculate minimum dynamic    strength values and to calibrate prevalent seismic design    procedures.  ***",
