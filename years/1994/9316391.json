 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316391  Baker    Studies of Holocene paleoenvironments in the northern tier of  states have relied heavily on palynology, which supplies relatively  continuous and detailed records of vegetational and climatic  change.  In the central and southern Midwest, however, sites are  relatively rare, and paleoenvironments are poorly known.  The  objectives of this study are 1) to sample a series of stream  cutbanks along north-south and east-west transects for plant  remains.  These deposit constitute a relatively untouched and  unknown source of excellent paleoenvironmental information;  2) to  analyze these samples for pollen and especially for plant  macrofossils, to provide information on past vegetation; 3) to  reconstruct Holocene vegetation and climate for each site, along  the transects, and for the entire central Midwest; 4) to add these  data to the North American Pollen Database and the soon-to-be-  formed North American Plant Macrofossil Database, so that models of  Holocene vegetational and climatic change can be extended; 5) to  continue to study the alluvial history and pedological development  of these deposits, so that we can evaluate how the pattern of  lithostratigraphy, soils stratigraphy, and landscape development  (produced by E.A. Bettis) extends from Iowa to adjacent states.   The project will be significant in several fields. 1) The  ecological/paleoecological information will provide the first  comprehensive picture of the development of vegetation across the  central Midwest, including the Prairie Peninsula.  2) The  paleoclimatic data will extend greatly the coverage of Holocene  climates in the central United States.  3) The timing and extent of  climatic and vegetational changes will be cross-checked with a  completely independent source of evidence;  carbon and oxygen  isotopes from cave stalagmites across the same area, as outline in  the accompanying Project Summary of the proposal by Gonzalez et al.  4) Both vegetation and climate will be correlated with soil  formatio n and with Holocene changes in stream behavior over a broad  area.  5) Changes in stream behavior and landscape development are  critically important to archaeologists in locating sites and in  understanding how and where to look for sites of specific ages.",
