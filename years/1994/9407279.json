Diatoms  are among the most abundant primary food sources in many aquatic  food chains, and their ability to move within the sediment is  believed to be important to their ecological success. These cells  can generate movement despite being confined within a hardened  glass-like cell wall that restricts any direct contact between  the inner cell and the surface over which it moves. This project  is designed to help determine the ecological functions of diatom  movement and the factors which regulate this movement by: 1)  using a computer-assisted video microscope system to  quantitatively analyze the characteristics of diatom movement  under a variety of environmental conditions; 2) performing  comparative analysis of the movement of different diatom species  displaying a variety of cell wall features and shapes; and 3)  performing competition experiments to determine the relative  abilities of different diatom species in a mixed population to  undergo vertical movements and compete for limited resources  (e.g., space, light or nutrients).       These studies should help to determine a number of diatom  properties including: the environmental cues and conditions which  affect diatom movement; the ability of diatoms to survive or  become acclimated over time changes in environmental conditions;  and the type of movements undertaken by various species to try  and compete for limited resources such as light and nutrients.  ***",
