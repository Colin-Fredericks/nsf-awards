 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312013  Calvert  Auroral electron precipitation is hypothesized to result from  electron pitch-angle scattering by the cyclotron maser instability  during the generation of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR).  The  AKR consists of intense, primarily extraordinary-mode waves  originating on auroral magnetic field lines at geocentric altitudes   of 1.3 to 3.3 earth radii.  Comprising up to one percent of the  total power of the aurora the AKR is now widely believed to be  generated by the cyclotron maser instability which results from the  doppler-shifted, cyclotron-resonant, pitch-angle scattering of  energetic electrons into the loss cone.  Critical to this new  theory of the aurora is explaining the observed triggering of the  AKR by radio waves from the sun, since that phenomenon clearly  confirms the new theory.  The proposed work is to study this  triggering, believed to be caused by enhanced local precipitation  in ambient density minima and the consequent creation of density  depletions in which radio lasing can occur.  Such radio lasing  consists of closed-loop wave feedback oscillations caused by wave  reflections at the source, exactly analogous to those of  conventional optical lasers and likewise producing nearly-perfect  discrete, coherent, and monochromatic emissions.  ***",
