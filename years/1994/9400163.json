One part deals with general varieties, proposes a notion of Hardy-Littlewood variety and defines an invariant for measuring the deviation of such a variety from satisfying a precise asymptotic of Hardy-Littlewood type.  Obstructions of algebro-geometric and arithmetic nature to a variety being Hardy-Littlewood are found.  The other part is concerned with studying examples which are homogeneous spaces for semisimple groups, by combining results about the density of points in orbits of arithmetic groups with versions of mass formulae to obtain asymptotic results of Hardy-Littlewood type.              The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polymonials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.   ***",
