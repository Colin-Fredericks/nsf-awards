 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414398  Lazear    For almost thirty years now, human capital theory has been the  main theoretical model behind most empirical work in labor  economics.  But human capital theory is primarily a supply-side  approach that focuses on the characteristics and skills of the  individual workers.  It pays far less attention to the  environment in which workers work.  The entire notion of a \"job\"  which seems central to the thinking of businesspersons and  administrators, is virtually absent from most labor market  analyses.  The project addresses this deficiency in human capital  theory.  The work is conducted at the theoretical and empirical  level.  Tournament theory will be extended to determine how firms  set up their hierarchical structures.  The investigator has  already lined up firms that will supply the type of detailed  personnel and payroll records needed to provide answers to  questions about the positions in which labor is used.  They  include firms from the financial services industry, an energy  producer, and a durable goods manufacturer.  The empirical part  of the study will be devoted to collecting and examining these  data.         This project focuses on questions that rely on the  importance of jobs as the unit of analysis.  The general  questions are, \"Do jobs matter?\" and \"Do firms behave as if they  have some reasonably well-defined idea of slots in mind when they  make decisions?\"  Some of the specific questions are:  1.   Jobs and Wages:  Do jobs determine wages or do individual's       characteristics determine wages?  It has been argued that       once occupation and industry is held constant, there is       little male-female wage differential.  Is the same true for       all human capital variables like education and prior       experience?  2.   Jobs and Turnover:  It is well-known that workers have       different turnover rates as a function of demographic       characteristics and tenure with the firm.  But jobs may have       different turnover rates, independent of  the incumbents.        How important are demographic effects in sorting individuals       into jobs with different turnover rates?  3.   Careers:  Is there a real distinction between \"line\" jobs,       which are supposed stepping stones to the higher echelons of       the firm, and \"staff\" jobs, which are technical, sometimes       highly compensated, but generally dead-end positions?  How       do background variables such as race and sex affect initial       job assignments?  4.   Promotion:  What determines promotion decisions?  Are       workers who remain in a job for long periods of time the       most productive because long tenure is evidence of a good       match between jobs and skills or the least productive since       the best workers get promoted out early?",
