The laboratory is  a facility dedicated to the analysis of natural materials,  principally terrestrial rocks and minerals. Gamma ray  spectroscopy is used to determined the abundance of many  trace elements, used as tracers to better understand the  processes which have formed the Earth's crust and mantle.  The instrumentation of the facility consists of semi-  conductor detectors, multichannel analyzers, and computer  control. The facility is used for sponsored geochemical  research of the Principal Investigator and colleagues at MIT  and by a diverse group of other U.S. scientists, including  faculty and students from other universities and colleges,  principally in the northeast.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory  in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of  researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces, and Archean and Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods for the quantitative  measurement of the iso topes of hafnium.  ***",
