 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411018  Figueroa  The recent Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, CA generated  extensive damage to buildings, roadway, bridges, and other civil  engineering works and structures.  News reports and  communications from researchers indicated the evidence of  liquefaction at several locations.  Researchers have attempted to  determine the parameters which could better define the  liquefaction potential of a soil deposit and handle random  loading during the past two decades.  Seed and Idriss among  others, proposed a general method for evaluating the liquefaction  potential of a soil deposit using various parameters  representative of the deposit, and the magnitude of the expected  earthquake and the shear stresses induced by the design  earthquake.  More recently, Figueroa, Saada et al. in a project  funded by NSF, established a relationship between the unit energy  imparted to the soil up to liquefaction and the effective  confining pressure, relative density and shear strain amplitude  for a sand.  These findings set the basis for the development of  a new method for evaluating the liquefaction potential of a soil  deposit using the unit energy approach.  Liquefaction observed  during the Northridge earthquake offers the great opportunity to  initiate the validation of this new method of liquefaction  potential evaluation through the torsional shear testing of soils  representative of locations which experienced this phenomenon,  and the analysis of earthquake records.  ***",
