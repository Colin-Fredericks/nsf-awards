 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411244  Chay    In pancreatic beta cells the ion channels, the phosphatidylinositol  signal, and the receptor controlled adenylate-cyclase pathway are  intricately interwoven so as to control insulin release.  Modelling  studies will certainly help clarify the main events that take place  in these complex interwoven phenomena.  The goal of this research  is to formulate a mathematical model that explains the interplay  between the ion channels, receptors, intracellular calcium stores,  and intercellular calcium wave propagation in pancreatic beta-cells  in the islet of Langerhans.  This project has two major goals.  The  first is to incorporate recent patch-clamp experiments and  spectrophotometric data into the mathematical bursting model  developed by this group over a number of years so as to link the  membrane oscillator model with a receptor-controlled calcium  oscillator model.  With this refined model, the role each channel  plays in triggering the bursting and intracellular calcium  oscillations will be quantified, and the coordination of release of  calcium from internal stores with the influx of extracellular  calcium will be investigated.  In addition, how electrical activity  and intracellular calcium concentration change in response to  intra-islet hormones and neurotransmitters released from  sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers will be explored.  The  second major goal is to develop user-friendly software which  simulates beta cell electrophysiology and intracellular calcium  dynamics for researchers studying excitable cells as well as for  teachers in the classroom.  %%%   Insulin is a hormone that plays a key role in regulating the level  of sugar in blood.  Insulin is produced in specialized cells of the  pancreas, the beta cells.  Beta cells release insulin in response  to a number of external stimuli such as increases in the blood  concentration of the simple sugar, glucose, as well as certain  neurotransmitters and some other hormones.  Understanding the chain  of events  between the cell's detection of these chemical stimuli  and the release of insulin is the goal of much research in many  laboratories.  It is known that the chain of events involves bursts  of electrical activity at the beta cell membrane and oscillations  of the cell's internal calcium levels.  Each of these is caused by  certain biochemical changes in the cell and results in other  biochemical changes.  The goal of this research is to develop  detailed mathematical models that will aid in clarifying the  relationships among these complex and interdependent sequences of  biochemical and biophysical events.  Mathematical models are useful  not only in helping to interpret existing experimental data but  also in suggesting further experiments that ultimately will allow  us to understand the transduction of the extracellular signals that  stimulate pancreatic cells to release insulin.  A second goal of  this project is to develop user-friendly software that will  facilitate studies by other researchers and students interested in  similar biophysical and biochemical phenomena.  ***",
