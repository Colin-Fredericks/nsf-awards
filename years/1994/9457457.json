 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457457  Griffith    The origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres will be  investigated by focusing initially on two processes: cometary  impacts and the greenhouse effect.    Collisions of comets and asteroids with planets have recently been  found to significantly shape the nature of the solar system.  These  impacts provide the best explanation for the existence of the moon,  Uranus' tilt and the KT extinction.  Pioneering work by Zahnle et  al (1992) suggests that cometary impact explains the reason why  Titan has an atmosphere and the Galilean satellites have none.  The  idea is that, because of Jupiter's greater mass, impact velocities  are larger on the Galilean satellites than on Titan, and thus more  efficient at eroding the atmospheres.  Monte Carlo calculations  that address the stochastic nature of the problem will be used to  investigate this effect more rigorously. This technique will also  be used to investigate the capability of Mars to retain volatiles.   The ultimate goal is to determine the effect that planetary rubble  has on a planetary atmosphere as a function of a planet's size and  its context within a solar system.  This research will address the  following question: for a given planetary system, on which bodies  might one expect to find an atmosphere?      Dr. Griffith will pursue complementary work, at NASA's Infrared  Telescope Facility, as a member of the science team that will  observe comet Shoemaker-Levy's collision with Jupiter.  The aim  here is, in part, to investigate how the impact energy  is  partitioned into chemical energy and kinetic energy to the  atmosphere.  The partitioning into kinetic energy determines the  efficiency with which comets erode planetary atmsopheres.    The temperature at Venus' surface is 7500 K, almost 4000 K warmer  than the Earth.  The great efficiency with which the greenhouse  effect warms Venus'atmosphere suggests that warm atmospheres would  exist at large distances from the Sun, if greenhouse gases were  present.  This ra ises an interesting possibility for the ecosphere  of the Solar System, that is, the region where liquid water exists,  a necessary ingredient for life.  Greenhouse gases, if present on  a planetary body, may extend the ecosphere out to large distances  from the Sun.  This possibility will be investigated by focusing on  Titan's organic-rich atmosphere.  Titan's atmosphere may have  originally consisted of ammonia (NH3 ultra violet radiation, a  strong greenhouse gas) and subsequently been dissociated by solar  on the nitrogen gas (N2) we presently observe.  In collaboration  with Chris McKay, Kevin Zahnle and Jim Pollack (NASA Ames Research  Center), the possibility that Titan's atmosphere was warm enough to  have had liquid water in the past will be investigated.  This  effort will be extended to consider the greenhouse efficiency of  the highly abundant volatiles in the solar system (of which,  governed by cosmic abundances, there are few).  The larger aim of  this project is to understand the thermal properties of atmospheres    as a function of their composition.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  The award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
