 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317009  Yeh    The importance of field heterogeneities in groundwater pollution  problems has been widely recognized during the last decade.  Many  field and theoretical studies have been conducted to enhance our  understanding of their impacts and to improve our predictive  ability of contaminant migration in the field.  Conditional  simulation is generally accepted as the most logical approach that  can improve our prediction of contaminant transport in the field.   Many studies are, however, adopt simplified and unrealistic  scenarios such as one or two-dimensional steady-state flow.   Studies have never been conducted where contaminants move multi-  dimensionally through the unsaturated zone to the water table and  propagate through the aquifer.  One of the limiting factors is  computational difficulty and the enormous amount of CPU time  required for multi-dimensional numerical simulation.  This problem  is most severe in the case of flow and transport in the unsaturated  zone due to the nonlinearity of the governing flow equation.   Stochastic conditional simulations are even more formidable.  An  approach recently developed by the investigator reduces the CPU  time for simulating transport of solutes in two-dimensional  unsaturated heterogeneous soils by two or three orders of  magnitude.  This technical breakthrough allows conditional  simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous porous media under  unsaturated conditions.  The robustness of the approach compels us  to try it on three-dimensional transport of contaminants from  heterogeneous unsaturated vadose zones to fully saturated aquifers.   The overall objectives of the study are to develop a  computationally feasible algorithm for simulation of contaminant  transport in three-dimensional heterogeneous porous media under  variably saturated conditions and to investigate the potential of  our proposed conditional concept for designing sampling procedures  that improves our prediction of contaminant migration in subsurface  envir onment.  In other words, we would like to assess the degree of  sampling is necessary to predict migration of contaminants in the  subsurface environment.",
