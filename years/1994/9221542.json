Grissom (Central State U.)      Donald R. Falkenburg (Wayne State U.)      Khalil S. Taraman (Lawrence Tech. U.)      Walton M. Hancock (U. of Michigan)       The Coalition for New Manufacturing Education will define a comprehensive paradigm for the education of advanced manufacturing engineering-technologists.  The Coalition is comprised of Focus:HOPE and six universities; Detroit-Mercy, Central State, Lawrence Technological, Lehigh, Michigan and Wayne State.    The Coalition will design, deliver, test and evaluate, adopt, and disseminate new resources and methodologies usable in both industry and university settings.  In consultation with Coalition industry partners, essential course elements in manufacturing engineering and technology will be identified and modularized for presentation through a variety of innovative instructional processes.  Optimal use of electronic media and mentors will support an instructional sequence that is inquiry-driven and customized to the current manufacturing functions and experience of the engineer or technologist candidate.  To foster global technological access, two foreign languages will be required.    Coalition university partners will each develop modules for a knowledge area (course) in which that institution has outstanding expertise.  Upon satisfactory completion of all modules associated with a knowledge area, the university responsible for that content will award appropriate credit.  Partner institutions will mutually recognize all such course credits earned, consistent with procedures for course credit transfer.  Depending on the degree pathway chosen by each candidate, the appropriate accredited institution will confer an associate, bachelor or master level degree.    Focus:HOPE's Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT) in Detroit will be the primary development platform for a six-year curricul um integrating hands-on manufacturing skill mastery and interdisciplinary engineering knowledge within an applications context, i.e., the actual production of industry contracts requiring expert use of advanced technologies at competitive levels of quality, cost, and efficiency.  Other key features include futuristic 220,000 SF CAT facility, it leading-edge manufacturing equipment and information systems, and its target enrollment of young black adults.  Teaching/learning methodologies and specific curricular modules successfully tested and evaluated at both the CAT and the participating universities will be codified and disseminated nationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
