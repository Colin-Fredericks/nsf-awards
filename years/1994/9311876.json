 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311876   Oyama    This is a study  of the reactions of ozone on transition-metal  oxides.  Ozone decomposition on oxide catalysts is observed to  determine the effects of oxide-support and oxide-oxide  interactions; kinetics measurements are made for the most active  systems.  Adsorption/desorption properties of the oxides are  studied using temperature-programmed techniques; the mode of ozone  adsorption is studied using isotope scrambling.  Dispersion, phase  composition, and surface intermediates in single-component and  binary catalytic systems are determined using X-ray diffraction and  laser Raman spectroscopy.  In situ techniques such as the Hall  effect, quartz-crystal microbalance, and surface charge  measurements are employed to show  whether p-type oxides are more  active catalysts and whether the superoxide ion (02-) is a possible  reaction intermediate.  Finally, the reactivities of ozmne/oxygen  mixtures with ethanol or propylene are observed.    It is \"common knowledge\" that transition-metal oxides can catalyze  reactions and decomposition of ozone, but these systems have never  been studied systematically.  This study has not only fundamental  significance, but also practical importance both in issues about  the environmental fate of ozone and in the development of  technology to control ozone levels in environmental or occupational  settings.  ***",
