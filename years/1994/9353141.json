Miami, FL    Chen, Judy, Ramirez, Alberto and Raymond, Catherine     \"Macintosh Using Science Teams (MUST) Summer Camp\"    A collaboration between in Miami Museum of Science and the  University of Miami's Rosenteil School of Marine and Atmospheric  Studies (RSMAS) to introduce and interest minority youth to the  fascinating world of marine science and its many related careers.  The project, entitled Macintosh Using Science Teams (MUST), is a  five week commuter enrichment summer camp for students in grades 7-  9.  Students, organized into four-member cooperative research  trams, study man's impact on the marine environment.  Field  investigations, supervised by Museum project staff and RSMAS  graduate student mentors, take place in nearby locations, in  Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic shorelines.  MUST teams use  scientific methods to collect information about their selected  topic and conduct qualitative and quantitative surveys of the  coastal marine ecosystems information is discussed, analyzed and  processed the following day in a Macintosh computer laboratory.   Each tram produces a culminating research report on their findings  and using multimedia technologies, presents it to their families  and peers at a Family Night at the Museum.  An extensive follow up  academic year component provides students with an internship  opportunity to explore several Museum based science careers as well  as participation in a Saturday science and computer club.   Additionally, students will participate in field expeditions and  interactive seminars with local scientists and mathematicians to  explore science and mathematics college and career opportunities.",
