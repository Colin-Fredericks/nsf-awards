 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405569  Diane Waddle    The issue of modern human origins continues to be a source  of intense debate among paleoanthropologists.  Evolutionary  models that explain the origin of anatomically modern humans  include the single origin and regional continuity models.  While the merits of these two models are continually under  discussion, a test of the hypotheses contained within each  model was lacking.  Earlier work by this young investigator  refuted notions of a significant contribution by  Neanderthals to the modern human gene pool, and provided  information about the levels of gene flow that would be  required to adequately explain patterns of cranial variation  using a regional continuity model.    The current pilot project will validate the robusticity of  video techniques in cranial analyses and enable a  sensitivity test of a series of earlier results.  Should the  findings of the pilot project allay concerns about the new  techniques being developed, a larger application of these  techniques to a more extensive series of fossil hominids  will be performed.    This innovative and very promising work is being performed  by a young professional of great promise.    ***",
