 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321656  Thompson       Many species of North American birds of prey (raptors) breed  in northern North America and fly along several migration routes to  wintering areas in the southern United States and Mexico.  It is  hypothesized that because birds show a strong tendency to return to  their breeding grounds and because migratory habits seem to be  heritable, North American raptor species are composed of  populations which are geographically distinct from one another.  If  populations from different geographic areas use separate migratory  routes, it can be postulated that raptors using different migration  routes will be genetically and morphologically divergent.  The  current research will investigate morphological and mitochondrial  DNA (mtDNA) characteristics of four species of raptors which use  three migration routes.  Possible differences might stem from  unique predatory habits, differences in migratory requirements, or  individual responses to the local environment.  Mitochondrial DNA  provides an excellent tool for investigating differences between  populations within a species because it is a quickly evolving  molecule and can reflect genetic uniqueness which may evolve in  populations that are partially isolated from one another.  Little  is known to date of mtDNA relationships within and between raptor  populations especially as they relate to the geographic  distribution of species.%%%         This study will uniquely combine statistical analysis of  morphology with mtDNA relationships for four species of raptors  using the same migration routes.  This study will establish to what  degree raptors from different geographic areas in North America  have evolved unique morphological and genetic characteristics.  An  understanding of the differences between raptor populations within  species is essential to an understanding of the ecology of these  top predators and to further our knowledge of conservation and  evolutionary biology.***",
