The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite     receivers to pin point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.         The Project Director, Richard Findley is fully qualified to     direct this project having had considerable experience in     overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard     equipment.            This project will allow the institution to acquire a Laboratory  Van, a wire lubricating system, a differential GPS, and two  computer terminals and replace a worn out autopilot.  ***",
