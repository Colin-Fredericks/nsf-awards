 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the acquisition of a state-of-art  ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) sputter deposition system for the  preparation of nanostructured metal films. The system is  equipped with two magnetron sputtering sources, two ion beam  sources (one for deposition and one for simultaneous ion-  beam modification of the microstructure), capabilities for  substrate heating and biasing, two gas supplies (argon for  sputtering, and oxygen or nitrogen), residual gas analyzer,  two crystal rate monitors for thickness measurement, and  computer process control. The combination of the UHV sputter  deposition system with the world-class analytical electron  microscopy facilities at the University will provide a  unique opportunity to investigate and manipulate the  composition and microstructure of metal films on the  nanometer scale. With this system, metal films can be  fabricated that have different composition and impurity  content and different microstructure. The control of  microstructure, composition and impurity content is  important in on-going research addressing: 1) examination of  the role of grain structure and grain boundary diffusion in  multilayer thin films, 2) studies of the mechanism of  segregation of chromium to grain boundaries of cobalt-alloy  films, the effect of impurities (such as oxygen) on this  segregation, and the role that this segregation plays in the  magnetic noise characteristics of cobalt-alloy thin film  storage media (in collaboration with IBM for magnetic  storage applications), and 3) fundamental studies of  interparticulate and interphase magnetic exchange coupling  in nanoheterogeneous thin films (in collaboration with  Brookhaven National Laboratory and General Motors R&D for  energy applications). The sputter deposition system also  will be useful in the education of graduate and  undergraduate students in thin film materials processing.",
