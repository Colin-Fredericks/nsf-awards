The answer to this  question is almost certainly in the affirmative, but balance of  power accounts of international politics have emphasized the  effects of the structure of international power on the strategies  pursued by states and have deemphasized the effects of domestic  variables.  Some extreme accounts have even gone so far as to  deny entirely the relevance of domestic political factors in  accounting for, to take one example, international war.  Yet  clear cut evidence indicates that democracies have not fought  each other in a serious war, a fact that is clearly not in accord  with balance of power theories.    Contrary to structural theories, this research begins with the  hypothesis that domestic politics do in fact have an important  effect on the foreign policy of a state.  The main element of  this can be substantiated by showing that political leaders are  held accountable for their failures in foreign policy.  Of  course, considerable evidence tells us that United States  presidents benefit or suffer politically because of the success  or failure, respectively, of their policies, but evidence for  such an effect in other political systems is either fragmentary  or anecdotal.    To address this question, the researchers will identify all state  political leaders in the twentieth century and collect data on  the extent to which their state participated in international  crises during their tenure, what the outcome of the crisis was,  and what the costs of the crisis were.  The investigators will  also collect data on the basic characteristics of the political  system, recording for example, whether there was a legislative  body that served as a check on the executive, how competitive  elections (if any) were, how the leader came to power and how  long they had been in power.    The application of several powerful statistical methods will  enable the r esearchers to assess the extent to which political  leaders are held accountable for their foreign policy actions  across time, societies and political systems.  Evidence of such  accountability, particularly in non-democratic systems, will not  only inform the theoretical investigation of international  politics, but can provide important evidence to United States  policy makers about the possible constraints under which the  leaders of other states operate.  The researchers also hope to be  able to shed light on the likely expansion of the \"democratic  peace\".",
