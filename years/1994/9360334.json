 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lee  9360334        A critical deficiency in current dielectric materials that prevents their use in the next generations of ultra fast computing systems.  Organic polymers offer the most promise in this area and are already beginning to displace inorganic material such as silicon dioxide in these applications due to the performance advantages offered by organic systems.  New organic materials with the right combinations of properties are desired.    Polyquinolines of not have the deficiencies that plague polymides and polyquinolines are ideally suited to serve as dielectric materials due in part to their inherently low dielectric constants (2.6-2.8), low moisture uptakes (0.15%), and excellent thermal stability's.  In addition, a facile synthesis of polyquinolines has recently been developed at Maxdem which greatly simplifies their preparation and allows for the easy modification of their structure to yield new polyquinoline derivatives.  However, trial and error methods of preparing new derivatives are to time consuming and costly because of the complex interrelationships between polymer properties.  This will establish structure-property relationships essential to the development of optimum polyquinoline derivatives for electronic applications.  ***",
