 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317683 Charlesworth          Mutation of genes to alleles with deleterious effects on survival or fertility occurs in the populations of all living organisms, and the net rate of mutation summed up over all the loci in the genome of any organism is now thought to be very high.  Severely deleterious mutations are the cause of many diseases in human populations, and mutations with lesser effects are probably most important in human disease, though little is known about these as they are difficult to study.          In a preliminary study, the investigators found that the occurrence of deleterious mutations in a region of the genome affects the evolution of DNA sequences in the same region.  They have found that genetic variability at nucleotide sites that themselves do not affect fitness can be greatly reduced in such a region.  The investigators will quantify this effect in relation to distances between the genes on the genetic map, and will extend studies to sequence differences that do have slight fitness effects.  It is important in interpreting such data to include such biologically important phenomena as deleterious mutations of loci nearby in the genetic map to those under study.  This has not previously been done in theoretical studies.   %%%          Results will have implications for the interpretation of data on variability within populations and on evolutionary divergence between populations.  Such divergence in DNA sequences has b een used as a \"molecular clock\" to date the times of origin of species, and has also been used to infer that natural selection caused the observed differences.  When other loci in the genetic background are included in the models, in addition to the loci under study, the inference of natural selection may become less certain, and that the rate of the molecular clock may prove to be influenced by the locations of genes in the genetic map, and by the level of inbreeding populations.",
