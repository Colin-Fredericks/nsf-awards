For most domains, the constants,  such as electrostatic capacity, are impossible to compute.   However, symmetry methods such as those employed in this research  seek to determine the shape of domains where the extremal values  must occur.  The problem then shifts to one of computing the  constant for the extremal domain - which often can be done  explicitly.  Work on this project focuses on three groups of  problems.  The first is to show that for a set in n-dimensional  space with a fixed moment of inertia, the Newtonian capacity is  minimal when the set is a ball.  The analogous results for  logarithmic capacity and for the moment of inertia in dimension  equal to two has been established.  The second isoperimetric  problem considered is that of minimizing the ratio of logarithmic  to hyperbolic capacity for a continuum in a disc which lies in a  fixed concentric subdisc.  A solution to this problem would give  an upper estimate for hyperbolic capacity in terms of  easier-to-compute logarithmic capacity.  The third group of  problems concerns harmonic mappings of a disc to itself.  It is  believed that, when suitably normalized, the coefficients of  power series expansions of components of such mappings have sharp  bounds.  Though the first unnormalized coefficient is believed  to be less than 5/2, the only estimate know so far is greater  than 55.         Classical function theory has introduced geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than  first imagined.  In this project, the methods of  symmetrization, variational techniques and geometric reasoning  lead to results of valuable physical significance.  ***",
