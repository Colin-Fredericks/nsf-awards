 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Edwin S. Gould, Chemistry Department, Kent State University, is   supported in the  Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program, for investigations of solution  phase oxidation-reduction   reactions which emphasize less common oxidation states. Three areas  will   be studied: 1) compromised redox behavior of 2-electron oxidants in which   2e-reductants  react through single electron paths; 2) superoxide-metal   interactions, emphasizing metal  catalyzed reactions with nonmetal   reactants; and 3) polynuclear manganese complexes related  to Photosystem   II, dealing with hypervalent manganese states which are thought to be   involved  in the photosynthetic conversion of water to oxygen.        Reactions in which electrons are transferred between reactants are of   enormous importance in  virtually all areas of pure and applied   chemistry.  One portion of Gould's research addresses how  transfer   occurs in some cases when two electrons leave a reductant through two   separate, but  closely related, pathways. In a second part, he studies   the electron transfer between  superoxide-metal complexes and non-metal   reactants. This is related to the detoxification of  superoxide, which is   an important biochemical process. Third, he is determining the role of    manganese ions in photosynthetic reactions, which is related to the way   plants generate oxygen  during photosynthesis.",
