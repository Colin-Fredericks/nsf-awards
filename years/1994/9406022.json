 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406022  LevI    The goal of this research is to find and to explain new phenomena in  mathematical models of physical systems. More specifically, I propose  to work in two different directions: (1) Dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators and (2) Persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  The first of these directions aims at  understanding what happens when simple oscillators are coupled  together. Systems of this kind arise in numerous physical settings,  particularly in biology and electric circuits.  While an individual  oscillator behaves in a simple and predictable way, several such  simple \"cells\" put together can behave in a totally unexpected and  mysterious way. I propose to study the \"anatomy\" of this interaction  of simple \"cells\" which produces complex and rich behavior of the  \"organism\".  The second topic, in contrast to the first,  deals with  Hamiltonian systems which model many situation where energy  dissipation can be neglected, such as motion of particles in particle  accelerators, geometric optics and celestial mechanics. There are  still deep fundamental unanswered questions in the theory of such  systems due to their richness and complexity, although remarkable  progress has been made in the 1960s (the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser  theory) and in 1980's (the Aubry-Mather theory). It is proposed to  address some of these questions on a particular class of systems  (first introduced by Hedlund) which is more tractable than the general  case on the one hand, but is sufficiently rich to give new insights  and hints on the other.    Two research directions are proposed: first, the dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators, and second, persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  In the first of these areas I propose to develop  qualitative theory of coupled relaxation oscillators, extending the  classical work of Cartwright--Littlewood as well as the more recent  work  on periodically forced relaxation oscillators.  In the last  couple of years two int eresting phenomena were discovered in this  area, and I hope that there are more to be found.  The second of the  two directions deals with understanding the behavior of invariant  sets in symplectic maps of R^4 under strong perturbations from the  integrable case. I plan   to consider a special class of systems,  namely, geodesic flows on a 3D torus with a particular kind of  Riemannian metric introduced by Hedlund. This is sufficiently simple  to be tractable on the one hand and yet sufficiently nontrivial to  give insight into the general situation.",
