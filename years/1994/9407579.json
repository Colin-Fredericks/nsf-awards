Since influx of calcium through  voltage-dependent channels is necessary for neurotransmitter  release, modulation of the activity of these channels by  neurotransmitters is likely to be a common mechanism of  regulating synaptic plasticity.  There is currently no  consensus on the identity of the calcium channel controlling  excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter release, thus  raising the possibility that different synapses may use  different channel types.  Future studies in Dr. Mynlieff's  laboratory will exploit the well-characterized circuitry of  the hippocampus to investigate the identity of the calcium  channels by neurotransmitters.  The first specific aim is to  develop the techniques necessary to dissociate inhibitory  interneurons from the hippocampus suitable for patch clamp  studies.  The second specific aim is to pharmacologically  characterize the calcium currents present in different types  of inhibitory interneurons using whole cell voltage clamp  recording techniques.  A thorough knowledge of the calcium  channel pharmacology in various presynaptic cells is  necessary before any studies are performed on the identity  of the calcium channel(s) controlling release of  neurotransmitters using the hippocampal slice preparation  A  thorough characterization of the calcium currents is also  necessary before performing any studies on neuromodulation  of these channels which may lead to changes in synaptic  function. Many different neurotransmitters are known to  modulate synaptic function and also to modulate calcium  currents but it is not clear that these two events are  related.  By combining experiments in isolated presynaptic  cells where the calcium currents can be easily ident ified  with experiments in the hippocampal slice preparation where  specific synapses can be stimulated in isolation Dr.  Mynlieff hopes to make the connection between modulation of  calcium currents and modulation of neurotransmitter release  stronger. Although the future plans in Dr. Mynlieff's  laboratory includes investigating both excitatory and  inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, the experiments  outlined in this proposal concentrate on the inhibitory  neurons because much less is known about the inhibitory  presynaptic cells than the excitatory presynaptic cells in  the hippocampus. Understanding how neurotransmitters  regulate specific synapses by modulation of distinct calcium  channel types will provide insight into some of the  mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.",
