 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409250  Kimmel    This is a Research Opportunities for Women Planning Grant.  The  project will focus on health-related employment barriers,  including the relationships between maternal and child health  status, health insurance coverage, and employment behavior.  The  project will conduct policy simulations that will include the  examination of potential work-disincentives of publicly-provided  health insurance coverage and the extent to which mandated  employer coverage might be expected to reduce such disincentives.   The motivation for this particular focus is the impact poor  health and the unavailability of employer-provided health  coverage for mothers could have on the probability of their labor  force participation.      The research during the planning period will focus on each  component of the health issue separately, producing separate  estimates of the effects of health status on employment; the  effect of the probability of receiving employer-provided health  insurance coverage on employment behavior; and the effect of  receiving the coverage weighted by the family's valuation of that  coverage on employment behavior.  This research will incorporate  data from overlapping waves of the 1987 and 1988 panels of the  SIPP (Survey of Income and Program Participation), and the 1987  NMES (National Medical Expenditures Survey).    During the post-planning period, these results will be used to  build a more comprehensive model of the linkages between health  care utilization for the mother and her children, the  availability of public and private health insurance coverage, and  maternal employment behavior.  This will provide evidence of the  impact of public and private health insurance coverage  probabilities, and the value of this coverage, on the mother's  employment choices.  For this full model, the underlying  theoretical model will merge the separate literatures concerning  the demand for health insurance, the effect of health problems on  employment, and the welfare/work-disinc entives literature.  Such  a full model of employment barriers will be quite complex, and  implementation will require addressing serious theoretical and  econometric concerns.",
