 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321813  Tong       The objective of this research is to explore theoretical and  practical issues of fast converging \"blind\" channel identification,  equalization, and sequence estimation schemes to combat multipath  fading and co-channel interference.  It aims to eliminate or  significantly reduce training signals for the equalization of time-  varying wireless communication channels.  The research exploits the  second -order (cyclostationary) statistical and algebraic  properties of communication signals and the communication channel;  it leads to a faster convergence rate than those of existing  methods using higher-order statistics.  By combining equalization  and coding techniques, the research identifies a frequency  selective fading channel and suppresses co-channel interference.   Using the so-called signal subspace concepts, an optimal blind  sequence estimation method via the Viterbi algorithm is  investigated; its structure is particularly attractive to time-  varying channels.  The research consists of theoretical  investigation, algorithm development, and experimental  verification.  The significance of the work is that it addresses  the two important limitations of TDMA and GDMA based systems: the  multipath interference and the multiuser interference.  It has the  potential to increase transmission capabilities by eliminating  training sequences.  The techniques developed in this research have  a wide range of applications including identification of periodic  systems and medical image processing.  ***",
