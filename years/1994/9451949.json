 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451949  Cunningham  Recognizing the importance of condensed matter physics in  undergraduate science education, Grinnell College seeks to  acquire a variable temperature, high-magnetic field materials  characterization instrument that will be used to integrate  condensed matter physics experiments into the physics curriculum.  In keeping with Grinnell's emphasis on innovation in teaching and  practical experience for students, the physics department  envisions a highly flexible instrument which can be used to  measure the resistivity, the dc magnetization, and the ac  magnetic susceptibility of a variety of samples. The proposed  instrument will enhance the intermediate and advanced  laboratories with five new condensed matter experiments: the Hall  effect, the quantum Hall effect, the de Haas-van Alphen effect,  Curie's law, and the critical magnetic field of superconductors.  These new experiments will enrich the experience of students in  condensed matter physics by allowing them to explore in the  laboratory phenomena which they currently encounter only in  textbooks. Through this laboratory experience, students will  explore general concepts, observe important physical phenomena,  and learn experimental techniques in low-temperature and  condensed matter physics. In addition, the proposed instrument  will enable advanced students to do independent projects and  summer research in condensed matter physics.",
