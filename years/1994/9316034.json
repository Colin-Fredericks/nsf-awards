 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study of molluscan fossils across the  Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary on Seymour Island in the Antarctica  Peninsula.  Seymour Island contains rich and well preserved faunal  and floral assemblages in a thick stratigraphic section that  encompasses the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, a time of well  documented extinction in other parts of the world.  Previous work  has yielded a rich molluscan fauna but additional work is needed to  understand and correlate the biostratigraphy and sedimentology  immediately above and below the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition.   This work will attempt to recover fossils and examine the  sedimentology on a centimeter sampling scale from 5 meters below to  5 meters above the boundary.  These fossils, in conjunction with  sedimentologic analysis of the measured section, will allow a  determination of the continuity of the boundary section and will  also allow an attempt at high resolution analysis of the molluscan  faunal changes.  This study will lead to an improved understanding  of molluscan changes at the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition in high  southern latitudes and the relation of these changes to Cretaceous-  Tertiary extinction elsewhere.",
