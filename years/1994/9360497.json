 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360497  Westermo  This project will examine the design of peak strain and  deflection-based instrumentation systems for the post-  earthquake health monitoring of buildings and other civil  infrastructures.  The instrumentation systems are intended  to evaluate the local material damage at specific points  within a structure and be used to estimate, among other  things, the level of damage a structure has suffered and the  condition of the structure.    The work will entail designing several types  of sensors,  performing full static and dynamic tests, and investigating  approaches to designing a site-specific system and  interpretation of the sensor output.    The general distribution of high strains (or damage)  incurred during an earthquake event to optimize the location  of the sensors and the accuracy with which the system  predicts the damage will be evaluated.  The new technology  made available through this study can provide for an  economical and reliable means for structural safety  assessment.    There is a potential that prototype instrumentation systems  could be developed and applied.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***",
