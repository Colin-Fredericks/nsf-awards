 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317466  Hansma  DNA can now be routinely and reproducibly imaged with the Atomic  Force Microscope (AFM) in air and in a variety of fluids, including  aqueous buffers.  Building on this demonstrated capability, the  following 5 research areas are proposed:  (1) To image the effects  of drug-binding on DNA conformation, using distamycin and other  peptides that induce conformation-changes in AT-rich regions of  DNA. (2) To increase the resolution of DNA-imaging by using new  improved tips and imaging environments selected for minimizing both  adhesion and repulsion.  Tips will be fabricated with a new AFM-SEM  (scanning electron microscope) combination that is currently being  built.  (3) To label DNA with a variety of reliably distinguishable  labels for AFM-mapping of DNA at a resolution of several dozen  nucleotides. (4) To improve the quality of imaging of single-  stranded DNA.  The ultimate goal of this technology is the high-  speed sequencing of single DNA molecules. (5) To image processes  involving DNA-protein interactions in real time, such as the  cleavage of DNA with a restriction enzyme and the interaction of  single-stranded and double-stranded DNA with RecA protein.  %%%  The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) s a new microscope, invented in  1986, that can feel surfaces with enough sensitivity to map the  size and shape of DNA and other biological molecules.  For many  applications, the AFM combines the convenience and versatility of  optical microscopy with a resolution comparable to electron  microscopy.  Since this high resolution can be obtained even in  aqueous solutions, the AFM can image molecules that are  biologically active and has the capability of imaging these  molecules in action.  Atomic force microscopy of DNA has progressed  rapidly in the last 2 years.  New research can now build on this  foundation.  ***",
