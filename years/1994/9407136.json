This remarkable  influx of calcium occurs with no observable perturbation to calcium  status, an observation that has led to the conclusion that his  influx of calcium must be under homeostatic control.  Embryos may  mediate the influx of calcium by controlling shell calcium  mobilization and/or the transport of calcium into the vasculature.   The mechanism and control of calcium transport during embryogenesis  have been examined extensively, but efforts to elucidate the  mechanism and control of shell calcium mobilization have been  unsuccessful, in part because of the complexity of the in vivo  system and the absence, until recently, of appropriate in vitro  protocols.  This research will use a new protocol for in vitro  culture of the calcium-mobilizing system to examine the mechanism  and control of shell calcium mobilization.  The mechanism of shell  calcium mobilization will be examined by exposing the calcium-  mobilizing system to inhibitors of two enzymes (carbonic anhydrase  and a proton ATPase) that are believed to be important mediators of  this process.  Control of shell calcium mobilization will be  examined by culturing the system with a variety of calcium-  regulating hormones that have the potential to stimulate or inhibit  the removal of calcium from the eggshell.  This research will  answer fundamental questions about how embryos maintain calcium  homeostasis during a period of intense calcium influx, in isolation  from the control systems of the maternal parent, and when their own  control systems are developing and differentiating.  ***",
