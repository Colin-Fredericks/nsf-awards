 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410706  Franklin  The multiscalar processor is a recently proposed execution  paradigm for exploiting instruction-level parallelism.   It  is a collection of sequential processors that are connected  together in a logically decoupled and physically  decentralized manner using ring-type network.  The central  idea is to divide an instruction stream into blocks of  instructions, and then exploit parallelism by executing  these blocks using multiple processing elements.  The  multiscalar processor has generated wide interest, both in  the academia and the industry, and seems to have tremendous  potential to become the processing paradigm of choice for a  circa 2000 intruction level parallel processor.    The purpose of this research is to develop a high  performance fault tolerant multiscalar processor and to  provide an impetus to the incorporation of fault tolerance  in general purpose processors.  The primary manner fault  tolerance will be incorporated in the multiscalar processor  is by run-time replication of software and by executing the  replicas on the processor's multiple execution units, which  are provided for performance reasons.  Two re-execution  schemes (both using the same replication technique) are  under investigation.  Preliminary simulation studies have  been conducted to get an idea of the performance loss  incurred because of fault tolerance.  These preliminary  results indicate that time-redundant techniques are an  excellent choice for providing fault tolerance in the  multiscalar processor.  ***",
