Included will be derivatives designed as alternate substrates,  reversible inhibitors, fluorescent probes, and site-labeling  reagents.  The project will involve the purification of pyridine  nucleotide dependent enzymes followed by characterization with  respect to chemical, physical and kinetic properties, and  identification of functional groups involved in catalysis, binding  and regulatory processes.  Enzymes chosen for study include the  NMN:ATP adenylytransferase, NAD kinase, and selected dehydrogenases  of Haemophilus influenzae, enzymes involved in the unique NAD  metabolism of this organism, and essential for meeting the unique  NAD growth requirement of this organism, and the glucose 6-  phosphate dehydrogenase of Azotobacter vinelandii, an enzyme of  importance for producing reduced pyridine nucleotides as primary  electron donors for nitrogen fixation.  These studies will employ  spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, titrimetry, HPLC, electrophoresis,  affinity chromatography, and a number of general biochemical and  chemical techniques.%%%       The energy requirement for the maintenance and support of growth of   living cells can be met through reactions involving the oxidation  of various cell nutrients.  These oxidative reactions are enzyme-  catalyzed and in most cases, involve enzymes (catalytic proteins)  that function in conjunction with one of two common second reaction  components, namely, the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes.  These  coenzymes are organic compounds that are essential for the  oxidative proce sses to occur and therefore, are of prime importance  for cell metabolism.  the objective of this project is to gain  further understanding of the way in which these coenzymes  participate in the oxidative reactions.  In these studies, several  enzymes that catalyze this type of reaction will be purified  through various fractionation techniques.  As pure proteins, these  enzymes will be studied with respect to specific interactions with  the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes.  To facilitate these studies,  the chemical properties of the coenzymes will be altered by  preparing structural analogs of the natural coenzymes.  The  structural analogs will include derivatives designed to accelerate  or inhibit the enzymes involved.  Attention will be paid to  specific enzyme-coenzyme interactions that could be impotant for  metabolic control of the enzymes in their intracellular  environment.  Enzymes will be chosen for study due to their  involvement in important biological processes.  One such enzyme  will be obtained from Azotobacter vinelandii, a microorganism  currently  under study because of is importance in nitrogen  fixation.  Other enzymes will be obtained from Haemophilus  iinfluenzae, the causative agent of bacterial meningitis in infants   ***",
