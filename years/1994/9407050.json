 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407050  Auslander       There are many ascpects of automated speech  understanding, but the overall problem is often divided into  two main tasks,   The first is the transcription of spoken  language into text and the second is the derivation of  meaning from the transcribed speech.  These tasks are  traditionally addressed separately, assuming a clean  interface at the level of transcription.  However, it is  clear that the acoustic and semantic problems must  be  intimately related.  It is also felt that traditional tools  of acoustic analysis of speech signals, based on the Fourier  spectrum, are insufficient for the robust recognition of  fluent speech.  The substance of our project will be to  study time-frequency feature extraction techniques for the  purpose of clarifying the acoustic-semantic relationship,  with the goal of improving the performance of systems for  spoken language understanding.  Specifically, we purpose the  integration of time-frequency techniques being developed at  CUNY with existing acoustic and semantic processing already  in place at AT&T Bell Laboratories.       A primary issue will be to understand the relationship  of the extracted time-frequency objects to traditional  phonetic subword units, with emphasis on providing improved  acoustic discrimination in regions of semantic ambiguity.  While primary features extracted by the auditory periphery  are innate in humans, the perceptual metric, subword and  word symbols are acquired knowledge.  We want to understand  how  time-frequency feature extraction techniques might  simulate this behavior in a machine, for the purpose of  improving the robustness of spoken language processing.",
