 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403871  Pego         Nonlinear waves play a significant role in systems of  partial differential equations of importance in science and  engineering. A primary goal of the proposed work is to develop  effective methods for understanding the stability properties of  many such waves. The proposer and collaborators have recently  introduced some promising new methods for studying the stability  of simplified models of solitary water waves. We plan to extend  these methods to study waves in various systems of importance,  including the full water wave equations and simplified models of  particle physics and phase transitions. A second major topic of  investigation will be the study of low velocity flow in fluids  near the liquid-gas critical point, both in zero-G and 1-G  conditions. High compressibility and anomalous physical  properties characterize this regime, and several phenomena have  been observed in experiments in spacecraft and on earth which are  unexplained or only partly explained.  The proposed stability  analyses involve the use and further development of several  mathematical tools, including the Evans function, and Krein's  perturbation determinant. Both are analytic functions whose zeros  correspond to eigenvalues or resonance poles. The use of linear  stability analysis to prove nonlinear stability will be further  developed for solitary waves of dispersive equations. Also, a new  way of reformulating Hamiltonian systems, so that constraints  become conserved quantities, will be investigated for: water  waves, flexure of cables in zero-G, and anisotropic materials  that are `stiff' in one direction. Recent developments in applied  mathematics regarding `zero-Mach number flows' in combustion will  be adapted and extended for studying near-critical pure fluids.",
