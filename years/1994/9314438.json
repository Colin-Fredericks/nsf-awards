The NISEE program at the Earthquake  Engineering Research Center, University of California at  Berkeley, achieves this purpose through the EERC Library,  Earthquake Engineering Abstracts database, the Abstract  Journal in Earthquake Engineering, computer software  distribution, and promotional activities.    During the last three-year grant cycle, the EERC library  converted all its bibliographic records to machine-readable  form and began to make its material available through  resource-sharing networks.  The NISEE database (renamed  Earthquake Engineering Abstracts) was expanded  to include current information in earthquake engineering.  In addition to maintaining availability through the Internet  and via modem connections, the database is now also  available to more users through the University of California  online catalog system, MELVYL.  The Computer Applications  group continued to distribute over 100 different  microcomputer and mainframe computer software packages.  Six  volumes of the Abstract Journal in Earthquake Engineering  were published, bringing the publication schedule up to  date.    This award provides renewed funding for NISEE at the  University of California at Berkeley.  Another branch of  NISEE is also being supported by NSF at the California  Institute of Technology.  ***",
