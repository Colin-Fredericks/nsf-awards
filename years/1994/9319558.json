For example,  someone who loses money by selling stocks to buy another one is  believed to regret the loss more than someone who thinks about  switching but hangs onto his or her current stock. As compelling  as this might seem, it conflicts with an observation from  everyday life: when people describe what they regret most, their  regrets often center around things they failed to do. The purpose  of this research is to further our understanding of regret by  reconciling everyday observation with the results of previous  research.  The research has three objectives. The first is to  verify everyday observation. Do omissions in fact predominate in  the biggest regrets of people's lives? A series of structured  interviews will ascertain the most common regrets in people's  lives. The second objective follows from the first. If people's  biggest regrets involve things they failed to do in their lives,  how can we account for previous research that demonstrates the  opposite result?  This research will explore whether there is a  systematic time course to the experience of regret: people regret  their unfortunate actions more in the short term (as current  research suggests), but their unfortunate inactions more in the  long run (as everyday experience suggests). An experimental test  of this proposed temporal pattern will be conducted. The third  objective is to understand why this temporal pattern might exist.  In particular, a series of laboratory experiments will examine:  1) why regret over action tends to diminish with time, 2) why  regret over inaction tends to intensify with time, and 3) why our  regrettable inactions remain more cognitively available to us in  the long run.  By furthering our understanding of the regret,  this research promises to improv e everyday judgement and decision  making.  In addition, the examination of underlying mechanisms  should expand our knowledge of basic social psychological  phenomena such as post-decision dissonance reduction, subjective  confidence, and counterfactual thinking.",
