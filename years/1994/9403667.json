This technique will be used to understand  the site occupation in metallic alloys and compounds, to assist in  the development of improved materials for hydrogen fuel storage and  electrochemical cells.  The anomalous relaxation in many  metal-hydrides at high temperatures may arise from rapid gas-solid  exchange of hydrogen molecules.  Argon overpressures can reduce the  gas-phase relaxation and thereby test this mechanism, specifically  in the face centered cubic dihydrides.  Nanocomposites are a new  class of high strength, though materials made by compaction of  extremely small (e.g. 20 nm) grains, sometimes in a more ductile  matrix.  To understand their unusual properties, NMR will probe the  crucial interfaces.  Specifically, NMR will determine the  interfacial area on an atomic scale and the nature of core-cladding  bonding.  Techniques will be developed for detection, measurement,  and manipulation of unusually broad resonances.  Applications will  include double-resonance distance determinations in biological  systems between Nitrogen fourteen and Carbon thirteen.    % % % %    Metal hydrides are attractive candidates for clean energy  technologies, for hydrogen fuel storage and electrical batteries.   The location of Hydrogen (or Deuterium) atoms in the structures  will be determined by applying magic-angle spinning nuclear  magnetic magnetic resonance to deuterided metallic alloys and  compounds.  The results will direct the development of improved  hydrogen storage materials.  At high temperatures, many metals-  hydrides exhibit an unexplained mechanism of spin-relaxation.  One  suggestion is that rapid exchange between the gas and solid occurs;  more exotic explanations have also been proposed.  The role of  hydrogen in the unexplained relaxation will be tested.   Nanocomposites are a new class of high stre ngth, tough materials  made by compaction of extremely small (20 nm) grains, often in more  ductile matrix.  The interfaces grain are crucial to the mechanical  properties.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be used to  measure the interfacial area on an atomic scale and to determine  the nature of the core-cladding bond. Techniques will be developed  for the detection, measurement and manipulation of very broad NMR  lines, which otherwise unusable.  Applications to biological  structures and the detection of Nitrogen (e.g. in explosives) will  be pursued.  ***",
