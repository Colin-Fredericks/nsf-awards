In this extension, the PIs have  built upon their experience to focus on fostering critical  thinking skills in student participants.  The inclusion of both  spring introductory activities, and a final fall \"independent  contribution\" assignment further integrate the program. Students  will truly experience the development of their understanding of,  and contribution to, a scientific project.  In addition, we have  expanded the students' involvement in extracurricular activities  so that their time here is even more fully integrated around  their research experience.  The REU program is run by the site  Director, Dr. Joelle Presson, who is intimately involved with the  students.  She runs the summer journal club, and is a mentor for  REU students in her own lab.  The 17 participating REU faculty  are all active, productive researchers in the Center for  Neuroscience at University of Maryland, College Park. These  faculty come from diverse departments on campus, and form an  interactive Neuroscience community here.  We are all supportive  of the goals for our new program, and look forward to giving  students these valuable opportunities.  ***",
