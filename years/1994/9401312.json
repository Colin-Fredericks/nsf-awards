 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas Doren is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the study of   reactions on silicon surfaces.  First principles solutions of the   electronic Schrodinger equation are used to determine interatomic   interactions in models for reactions on silicon surfaces.  From   calculated interactions in many atomic configurations, a global   description of the potential energy is developed which is then   subsequently used in classical and quantum calculations of reaction rates   and dynamics.  Applications to be studied include desorption and   diffusion of hydrogen atoms, abstraction of chemisorbed hydrogen, and   adsorption and decomposition of silane.    The immediate objective of Doren's research is to develop reliable   methods for calculating mechanisms and rates of reactions on silicon   surfaces, and to apply them to several examples which are important in   semiconductor device fabrication.  A mechanistic understanding of silicon   surface chemistry will be essential for developing new semiconductor   technologies that  require unprecedented control over the properties of   these materials.",
