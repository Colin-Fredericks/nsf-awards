A year-long  course on product design and manufacturing will be developed using  a simulated factory floor facility.  An elective senior year design  course will be offered to give students experience in design for  manufacturing under the supervision of faculty and industrial  experts.  In addition, manufacturing principles will be introduced  into management and liberal arts courses offered to all NJIT  students.  Resources available to NJIT include the National Science  Foundation-sponsored Gateway Coalition and a feeder network of 19  community colleges.  Industry involvement in this effort will  include hosting student interns during the summer and a seminar  series by industrial experts.***",
