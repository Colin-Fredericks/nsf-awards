It has become increasingly apparent in the past 15 years  that small bodies such as comets and steroids played,  through accretionary processes, a fundamental role in the  formation and evolution of the Earth and planets.  After the  planets formed, asteroidal and cometary impacts profoundly  influenced the evolution of Earth's climate by i) providing  volatiles and organic materials and ii) causing long-term  climatic catastrophes. Understanding the dynamical evolution  of these bodies is required in order to fully understand  their effects on the Earth and other planets.    Until very recently, direct numerical simulations of the  dynamics of solar system objects over the timescales  necessary to study the formation process and long-term  evolution have been beyond normal computational reach.  However, due to recent advancements in computer hardware and  software, it is now possible to attack problems in solar  system dynamics which were intractable only two or three  years ago.    The SSONIC computing system will allow the PIs make  significant inroads in understanding the origin and  evolution of bodies in the Solar System like the Earth and  other planets.  ***",
