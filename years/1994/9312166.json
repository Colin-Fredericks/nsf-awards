Michigan, in the form of new cabinets (174) and drawers (5200) to replace substandard ones and to accommodate growth.   The collection, with 4 million specimens and 1012 holotypes, is the third largest university insect collection in North America and is particularly strong in Odonata, Orthoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and Acari.  This improvement will occur in concert with the university's renovation of the collection areas: specifically, the institution will construct a new wet lab and counters, and prepare the space for air conditioning,  with an estimated expenditure of $520,000 for the divisions of Insects and Amphibians & Reptiles in the Museum of Zoology.  The collection is indispensable for biodiversity research and education regionally, nationally and internationally.  This improvement will allow better access to the material for researchers and students and will help preserve these holdings for future generations of biologists.  %%%  The Museum of Zoology, U. Michigan houses one of the most important arthropod collections in the country: with 4 million specimens, it is the third largest university insect collection in North America.  This support will allow rehousing of the material threatened by substandard and deteriorated drawers and cabinets.  At the same time, the institution is providing $520,000 worth of capital improvements to the collection facilities, including climate-control and new laboratories.  This support will provide much easier and safer access to the specimens fo r researchers and students in biodiversity, and will protect the collection for future biologists.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Y   `                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           R   W   Y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          $         $         $              D                                   Y                         `         Y     (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial       $   $         $           \"             h     {  e{  e                        7        Leonard Krishtalka Leonard Krishtalka",
