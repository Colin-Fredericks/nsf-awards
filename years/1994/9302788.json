The project aims to isolate and mutate genes of  Azobacter diazotrophicus necessary for nitrogenase enzyme  activity.    Nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been isolated from sugar cane  varieties in Brazil in which up to 70 percent of total plant  nitrogen comes from atmospheric nitrogen (dinitrogen).  The  major organism isolated, A. diazotrophicus, is an endophyte  thought to be responsible for the fixation of dinitrogen and  transfer of products to the plant system.  The researchers  will use mutants unable to fix nitrogen to prove or disprove  a role for this species in providing fixed nitrogen in sugar  cane.  They will also characterize genes involved in  bacterial responses to environmental factors such as ammonia  and oxygen that control nitrogenase biosynthesis.  Strategies to increase amounts of fixed nitrogen provided to  plants will be applied to construct strains that produce  nitrogenase in the presence of ammonia or have increased  tolerance to oxygen.  The U.S. side has expertise in the  genetics of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The Brazilian  laboratory is where A. diazotrophicus was identified and its  colonization of plants is being studied.  Both sides will  benefit from establishing the significance of a novel and  potentially important nitrogen-fixing bacterial species.  ***",
