 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407341  Smith    This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural   anthropology student from the University of California-Davis.  The   student will do a case study of one Native American community museum,   study a conference of museum professionals, study the dominant national   institution (the Smithsonian Institution), and conduct a survey of   Native American museums, in order to study how Native Americans defend   their own definition of \"ethnicity\" and culture against national   influences.  The questions to be asked have to do with whether   Native American museums can play dynamic roles in relation to living   culture of Native American communities, or whether they treat their   culture as historic relics not relevant to contemporary life.        This research is important because the tension between local   minority cultures and the national majority culture is a fact of life   relevant to all nation states.  Increased understanding of how local   cultures defend their own interests and maintain their cultural   distinctiveness while at the same time interacting with national   political institutions will help planners design programs which can   productively satisfy both local and national cultural and political   concerns.",
