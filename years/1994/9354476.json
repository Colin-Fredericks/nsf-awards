The Geographer's Craft is a two-semester  course and model for introductory training in geographical  methods, and is based upon a problem-solving, integrated  approach to the teaching of cartography, GIS, spatial  statistics, and remote sensing. It also addresses real-world  issues with a range of textually \"appropriate\" technical and  conceptual tools and stresses independent thought and reasoning  skills. Prototype modules are being created to test software  designs and once a full suite of materials is complete, the  Geographer's Craft will become the core introductory course  required of all majors and minors. The project is also expected  to introduce all geography students to the latest research  techniques, provide a means for non-majors to gain background  in valuable skills that complement their studies in other  disciplines, and prepare students for upper-division studies  and advanced courses in geographical techniques.",
