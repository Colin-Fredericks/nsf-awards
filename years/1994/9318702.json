Erik Trinkaus  SBR-9318702    Recently, it has become clear that in the Near East, in the Middle Paleolithic, there were two rather distinctive, morphologically defined hominids - the Neanderthals (or late archaic humans with affinities to the Eurpoean Neandertahls) and robust early modern humans.  The late archaic group not only resembles the European Neanderthals in cranial features, but also in a suite of features from the rest of the skeleton, most of which appear to be related to overall robusticity, shared with some other later archaic humans.  By contrast, the Near Eastern early modern human sample more closely approaches Recent human skeletal morphology than does the late archaic sample.      The issue to be addressed by this research is to what, if any, significant behavioral differences might these two lineages possess?  There are a number of clues to the different possible habitual behaviors, but Trinkaus will focus on one relevant aspect, leg bone size and shape, as related to differences in locomotor activity (the implication is that the more Neanderthal - like individuals possessed thicker, more robust leg bones, and were engaged in more strenuous patterns of habitual activity).      Whatever the outcomes of the proposed research, it will provide further insight into the dynamics fo the origins of modern humans in the Near East, one of the earliest regions to witness populations we call early modern humans.    The work will therefore contribute to understanding more global issues of the origins of modern humans, for which the Near East provides only one regional example.    ***  P\\a nthro\\jfried\\9318702.abs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      V   X   =   ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !         !         !         !         !
