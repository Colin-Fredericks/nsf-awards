During group projects utilizing the  automated system to chromatographically purify a series of ricin A  proteins (differing structurally in 1 or a few amino acids), the  relationship between the physical/chemical nature of the molecules  and their chromatographic behavior is elucidated. The students are  also introduced to basic chromatographic principles as they are  applied to protein purification.  Students who complete  Quantitative Biology during their junior year are qualified to  participate in the undergraduate research restricted elective  during summer and/or senior year.",
