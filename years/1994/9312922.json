 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312922  Mayne       The research addresses the problem of obtaining nonlinear  controllers for the control of linear and nonlinear systems  subject to control and state constraints.  There will be two  prongs to this research, both employing optimization.  The first  will be concerned with online optimization and will build on our  existing results on receding horizon (model predictive) control  in which we have overcome many of the obstacles impeding its use  for the control of nonlinear systems; our research will endeavor  to remove the remaining restrictions,. to improve the observer-  based controller, and to develop an adaptive version of the  receding horizon controller.  The second prong will be directed  to the development of novel, nonlinear controllers, designed  using, extensive off-line optimization, for controlling  constrained dynamic systems, both linear and nonlinear.  This  research constitutes a new approach to an important, but  difficult area, and it motivated by the results we have obtained  in receding horizon control.  A beneficial side effect of success  in this area would be the provision of initial feasible controls  (i.e., controls which satisfy the control and state constraints)  for receding horizon control, thus mitigating one of the most  difficult problems arising when this type of control is employed  to control constrained nonlinear systems.  ****",
