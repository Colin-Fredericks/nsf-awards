These two activities will be developed jointly.  The  Workshop is targeted for minority undergraduate majors in science  and engineering.  Its purpose is to prepare students to enter  graduate degree programs, and to gain employment by companies  engaged in the rapidly evolving field of micro-machine engineering,  science, and technology.  It is particularly intended to prepare  students to make leading, lifelong contributions to this field.  Networking with guest lectures and visitor drawn from industry and  academe will be an important component of the Workshop and course.  The major benefit of the summer Workshop is to increase the number  of minority students entering science and engineering.  The  Workshop will further serve as the foundation for a new  undergraduate major course in Engineering Science at Dartmouth  College, entitled \"Science and Technology of Micro-Machines.\"   Benefits will be to promote evolution and growth in the field of  micro-machines by:  preparing skilled undergraduates to make  contributions at the graduate level, and with industrial firms  engaged in this field; providing an important bridge between  undergraduates, and leaders in the field; and disseminating results  of this effort to the academic community, to lead in and assist the  replication of similar undergraduate programs at other  institutions.  ***y",
