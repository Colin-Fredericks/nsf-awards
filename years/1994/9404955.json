 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9404955  Kinetoplastid protozoa contain a novel form of mitochondrial DNA  (kinetoplast DNA or kDNA) consisting of thousands of minicircles and  20-30 maxicircles catenated into a single sheet or network. These kDNA  networks are condensed in vivo, forming a highly organized disk-like  structure about 1 um in diameter and 0.4 um thick. Previous studies  have focused almost entirely on the novel DNA components of the  kinetoplast and their organization into a catenated network. The  research proposed here addresses the role of small histone-like  proteins in the structural organization of the kinetoplast. Prior work  in our laboratory has identified five small lysine-rich proteins  associated with kDNA in vivo. Genes encoding three of these have  already been cloned. The proposed research will lead to the cloning of  the remaining genes and their use in determining the possible roles of  these proteins in the structural organization of the kinetoplast. Each  of these histone-like proteins will be produced in large amounts by  expression in bacteria and used for producing antibodies and for  biochemical studies of the interactions of each protein with DNA. These  studies will determine the DNA-binding specificity of each protein and  its ability to bend DNA, to induce supercoiling and to condense kDNA  networks. Antibodies against these proteins will provide essential  reagents for localizing each of the proteins within the cell using both  immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy. Through  the use of this range of experimental approaches we expect to gain an  understanding of the possible roles of histone-like proteins in  organizing the kinetoplast structure.  %%%  Genetic information is encoded in living cells in extremely long  strands of DNA that must be organized or \"packaged\" in some highly  condensed and regular manner. This research program is aimed at  identifying and analyzing some of the factors involved in condensing  DNA within living cells. One of the m ost highly condensed forms of  cellular DNA in nature is the DNA found in tropical parasitic organisms  called trypanosomes. These organisms are widespread parasites of both  plants and animals. One of their characteristic features is the  presence of a large body of DNA called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) which is  located outside of the cell nucleus where chromosomes are found. Like  the DNA of chromosomes, kDNA condensation appears to involve  association with a group of small positively charged proteins. Methods  have been developed for isolating and characterizing these proteins.  Through the study of the interactions of these proteins with DNA, it  may be possible to determine how these proteins bind to DNA and how  this binding contributes to the folding and organizing of the DNA into  a compact structure. These studies are made possible by the many  developments in biotechnology including DNA cloning and sequence  analysis. An important aspect of this research is the training of  future scientists in these areas of biotechnology and assisting them to  acquire the necessary skills to contribute to the growth of an  important area of technology in this country.  ***",
