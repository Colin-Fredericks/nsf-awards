 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the work described in this proposal is  to understand how plant cells communicate with one another.  To study this, this investigator analyzes the interactions  that must take place between the male and female  reproductive systems in order for fertilization to take  place successfully.  These encompass many different  interactions which are required to control such diverse  processes as the transfer of water from the stigma to the  pollen grain, the acquisition of polarity by the pollen  grain and the guidance of the growing pollen tube to an  individual ovule.  This investigator has undertaken a  genetic approach to this problem, identifying mutations  which result in sterility but are not due to the altered  morphology of the reproductive system.  He has identified  one major class of male sterile mutants which fail to be  recognized by the stigma and appear to be deficient in the  production of long chain lipid species.  He has also  identified numerous mutations which alter the development of  the ovules and has used these to determine that the haploid  embryo sac contained within the ovule is essential for the  proper guidance of the pollen tubes within the ovary.  Experiments are proposed to extend the characterization of  these mutations as well as to identify new mutations,  including those which are active in the haploid phase of the  plant life cycle.  Specific objectives for this granting  period are:  (1) to identify as many genes as possible which  are specifically involved in the control of the growth and  development; and (2) to characterize the functions of the  genes already identified genetically in the reproductive  process by an analysis of their phenotypes.",
