 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320120  Town  Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the principal naturally-occurring  member of a class of plant growth hormones known as auxins.  IAA is  involved in a wide range of plant processes including cell growth  and differentiation, fruit development and senescence.  In plants,  most of the IAA occurs not as the free acid, but conjugated either  to various sugars via ester linkages or to amino acids or peptides  via amide bonds, the latter form of conjugate being more prevalent  in most dicots.  Several roles have been postulated for auxin  conjugates, including storage for use during germination, IAA  homeostasis, and even tissue targeting.  Various lines of evidence  suggest that auxin conjugates are active only after hydrolysis to  free auxin.  Despite the obvious importance of auxin in the plant,  and the potential significance of the much larger reservoir of  conjugated auxin, very little is known about the biochemistry and  even less about the molecular biology or genetics of the synthesis  or degradation of IAA conjugates.  In this proposal, several  approaches will be used to isolate genes involved in IAA conjugate  metabolism.  This laboratory has recently isolated a cDNA encoding  a conjugate hydrolyzing activity by a yeast complementation  strategy.  The principal focus of this proposal is to characterize  many facets of the structure, expression and biological function of  this activity in Arabidopsis.  As time permits, other studies on  conjugate function and metabolism which were ongoing prior to the  cDNA isolation will also be continued.  ***",
