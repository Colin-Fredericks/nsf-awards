Over a 3-5 year period, an estimated  50,000 copies of the supplement will be shrinkwrapped with the text  and offered free of charge to all students and faculty. Formative  testing of the supplement and student evaluations of the topics  covered will be conducted in large introductory physics courses at  Temple University. Each topic will describe the way society reacts  to scientific and technological developments through the legal  system. The depiction of these issues in the visual mass media will  also be analyzed. The environmental issues to be discussed are:  nuclear power plants and-nuclear waste; indoor air pollution;  stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect; and  electromagnetic waves: effects on humans. The staff consists of one  physicist who has co-authored several textbooks/instructor's  manuals, one environmental lawyer with a biology background, two  environmental engineers, a media specialist, and a research  librarian. The authors of Physics: A World View and Saunders staff  will help produce the supplement. The staff will write articles  describing the supplement and student reactions to the topics.",
