The student will            study the nature of the transformation of traditional Chinese            families in a rural area of northeast China.  Using ethnographic            methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews, the            student will trace the impact on the life and work of families in            one hamlet of land reform, marriage laws, the cultural revolution            and other national government policies.  The end result will be            an ethnography that describes how these rural families have coped            with and responded to the national government's efforts to change            them.             This research is important because it will add to our base of            studies of rural Chinese communities.  This case study of the            successes and failures of the national state in changing the            lives of rural families will help us understand similar processes            in other areas where governments are engaged in drastic            modernization policies. We will be better able to respond to            problems and opportunities the more we understand about the            reality in these remote rural areas.            ***",
