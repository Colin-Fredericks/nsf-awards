 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361544  Markham  Advanced Fuel Research Inc. (AFR) has pioneered a technique to  determine temperatures along a \"line-of-sight\" into transparent  materials.  It involves measuring infrared radiance spectra, for  materials with well-characterized, temperature-dependent optical  constants.  The objective this proposal is to demonstrate that  Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) radiance spectra can be used  to extract the average temperature at the slurry-sample interface  during micromachining processes.  Feasibility will be  demonstrated by performing FT-IR radiance measurements through  samples to the slurry interface, for two systems:  colloidal  silica lapping of sapphire, and diamond lapping of silicon.  The  latter case represents the dicing of silicon wafers.  At present  there is no way to measure the slurry-sample interface  temperature during micromachining.  The successful completion of  Phases 1 and 11 would lead to an on-line process monitor for the  micromachining of single-crystal ceramics, as well as to  increased understanding of the processes involved.  ***",
