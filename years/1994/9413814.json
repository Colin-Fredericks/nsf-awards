 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413814  Good       State-of-the-art equipment to support research in the Web  Handling Research Center (WHRC) will be developed.  The WHRC is a  National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center in its ninth year of operation with twenty  corporate sponsors. The term \"web\" describes materials that  are manufactured and processed in a continuous-strip form, e.g.,  thin plastics, paper, textiles, metals, and composites.  Web  handling refers to the physical mechanics related to the transport  and control of continuous-strip materials through processes and  machines.  The equipment to be acquired will support several  research projects, including:  (1) winding webs at high speed and  accelerations, (2) longitudinal dynamics and tension control in  multi-span web transport systems, and (3) the wrinkling of webs.       The sucessful research performed with the web line should have  an impact upon productivity within web handling industries.  The  amount of web handling which is done within industry is immense as  many automated manufacturing processes demand the continuous strip  form.  The investigator's will be able to validate and improve  some of the most critical mathematical models that have been  developed.  The result will be an improved knowledge base  which engineers can use to design web process lines  that produce the required product without  defects and losses  resulting in improved productivity.",
