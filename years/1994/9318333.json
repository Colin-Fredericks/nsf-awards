The research project will investigate the unusual metal-  insulator transition thansition that we have recently discovered  in the BaCo1-xNixS2-y system.  This first-order phase transition  is from a semiconducting to a metallic phase with decreasing  temperature.  The low temperature phase is a highly correlated  metal, while the high temperature phase appears to be a two-  dimensional antiferromagnet.  The transition temperature and  hysteresis depend on the chemical composition.  The thermal  bistability and positive temperature coefficient of resistivity  associated with the transition suggest that these materials could  be useful for many practical applications in materials research  and engineering.  The large resistance change at the transition,  the ability to control the properties by varying the composition,  and the stability of the materials are all favorable for  applications.  %%%  The experimental program will also involve exploratory synthesis  and characterization of related ternary sulfide and selenide  alloys that might exhibit similar phenomena or possibly  superconductivity.  The equipment requested will be used to  measure the DC magnetization, AC magnetic susceptibility,  resistivity, and Hall coefficient of all phases found.  The  existence of this unusual phase transition in certain layered  ternary sulfides is a significant discovery of previously unknown  phenomena.  Study of these materials can contribute to our  understanding of highly correlated electronic systems, metal-  insulator transitions, and perhaps high temperature  superconductivity.  ***",
