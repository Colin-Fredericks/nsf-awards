Geosynthetic reinforced slopes are earth slopes  (such as road cuttings) which are reinforced against slope  failure (landslides) using geosynthetic materials.    The project involves: (1) the identification of geosynthetic  reinforced slopes which were subjected to substantial shaking by  the Northridge earthquake, (2) the estimation of the ground  shaking to which these slopes were subjected and any pre-  earthquake movements of the slopes, (3) photographing the slopes  from the ground and from the air and the measurement of landslide  size, head and side scarps, and reinforcement patterns on the  ground, and the collection of soil samples, and (4) the  estimation of slide volumes,  distances moved, and slope angles,  and an attempt to correlate soil type, slope angle, type of  reinforcement, reinforcement pattern, slope orientation and  magnitude of displacement, where applicable.  ***",
