 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318160  Gross       The vast majority of ecological models applied to problems  in ecosystem analysis and management have relied on aggregative  properties of populations and communities.  This award will take  advantage of high performance computing systems to analyze new  models based upon interactions between  many individual organisms  which comprise these populations and communities.  These  individual-based models may be used to predict the dynamics of  populations and communities explicitly on a landscape, and thus  provide a method to analyze the effect of alternative spatially  explicit management schemes on ecosystems.  Massively parallel  machines offer the potential to deal with these analysis and  management problems, as well as taking account of the vast array  of information about individual organism difference that is  ignored in more aggregated modeling approaches.  This award  involved the development and comparison of alternative methods to  implement individual-based modes on several high performance  computing systems and the application of results obtained to  several specific problems of ecosystem analysis and management,  in particular community-level interactions between several  species and explicit models of populations and communities.  This  award is being jointly supported by programs in Ecology,  Ecosystems, Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics and  Computational Biology.  ***",
