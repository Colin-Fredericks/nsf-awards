 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321429  RALEIGH    This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment    for the research vessel MOANA WAVE a Navy-owned ship operated by  the University of Hawaii and dedicated to use in support of ocean  science research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data  retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Barry C. Raleigh is fully qualified to direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.      This project will allow the institution to acquire an HF receiver,  a cellular phone an attitudinal GPS and to complete the  installation of a capstan.  ***",
