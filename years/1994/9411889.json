This  research project examines the creation of the rule of law in  Hungary, which has moved farthest along the path toward creating  a state where a written constitution meaningfully constrains and  guides day-to-day politics.  At the center of this transition in  Hungary is the powerful Constitutional Court which has already  acted aggressively to uphold a strong vision of human rights,  separation of powers, and constitutional regularity.  Acting on  the basis of petitions from ordinary citizens, the Constitutional  Court has struck down many statutes since 1990 on constitutional  grounds; the Parliament has re-worked most of these to comply  with the Court's interpretation of the Constitution.  Analysis of  the development and legitimation of this Court will make a major  contribution to our knowledge of the role of constitutionalism in  the democratization process.    The PI will be examining petitions to the Court from January 1990  to see what it is that ordinary citizens in this new democracy  believe a Constitution should do.  The analysis will include what  the Court does with these petitions, how they are turned into  constitutional questions, and the effects of the Court's rulings  on everyday politics in Hungary.   ***",
