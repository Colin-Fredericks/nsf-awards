 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316179  Leibacher      This award will support the participation of ten U.S. senior and  junior scientists to participate in a workshop on helioseismology  and the internal structure of the Sun to be held in Sydney,  Australia in mid-January 1994.  The American coordinator is   Dr. John Leibacher from the National Optical Astronomy  Observatories / National Solar Observatory.  The Australian  coordinator is Prof. Peter Wilson of the University of Sydney.  This workshop is being conducted under the U.S. - Australia  Cooperative Science Program and support in Australia is provided  through the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional  Development (DITARD).    Helioseismology, the study of acoustic oscillations trapped in  resonant cavities within the Sun, is a new and exciting field  that promises to provide a means of measuring the characteristics  of the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun. The NSF -  sponsored Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project will  deploy a network of six oscillation observing stations around the  world beginning in 1994.  These stations will keep the Sun under  surveillance 24 hours each day over a three year period. One of  these stations will be located at the Learmonth Solar Observatory  in Western Australia.    The object of this workshop is to increase the participation of  Australian scientists in helioseismology and to initiate  cooperative research programs.  The workshop will be divided  between tutorial presentations by recognized experts and  traditional research presentations.  The principal topics will be  the physics of solar oscillations, solar internal models,  convection, dynamos, and helioseismic inversions.  ***",
