 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406889  Ruckenstein    With the discovery of conductive polymers, the possibility to combine the versatility of polymers with the electrical properties of metals became possible.  However, the initial conductive polymers were insoluble and infusible and thus not processable, and had poor mechanical properties, being brittle.  In this proposal an extremely simple procedure is suggested to prepare conductive composite materials.  The procedure is so simple, that it may acquire industrial significance.  For a composite polymer formed of a conductive polymer, which is responsible for the conductivity, and a host polymer, which is responsible for the mechanical properties, to have good electrical and mechanical characteristics, the two components must be mixed very uniformly.  The present ensures the uniform oxidation of pyrrol, and hence a uniform distribution of polypyrrol in the host polymer.    Electrified conductivity, mechanical properties and morphology will be determined for the resulting materials.   We expect to develop a procedure for the preparation of a composite polymer which will have a good electrical conductivity > 1S/cm and good mechanical properties.  The selection of the host polymer and of the surfactant which will be employed to obtain the oxidative solution are extremely important.  ***",
