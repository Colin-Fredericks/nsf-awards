 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416164  Wong  Reconnaissance of damage to telecommunications assets caused by  the Northridge earthquake confirmed that: (a) Countermeasures  (primarily lateral bracing)implemented since 1971 to protect  equipment against direct ground shaking effects were effective,  and (b) As a result, system integrity now depended on indirect  effects.  The major indirect effects identified were, for inside  plants, collateral building damage and dependency on support  lifelines; for outside plants, they were collateral damage to  other lifelines by virtue of collocation.    In this study, telecommunications performance data from the 1994  Northridge and the 1971 San Fernando earthquakes will be  evaluated and used to: (1) Assess the effectiveness of mitigation  procedures (e.g., equipment bracing) introduced between 1971-  1994; (2) Identify vulnerabilities in telecommunications systems  that remain unchanged since 1971; (3) Quantify sources of such  vulnerabilities, with emphasis on indirect effects such as  collateral hazards, damage to outside plants and support  lifelines; and (4) Prioritize data/research needs based on the  impact of indirect-effects related disruptions on the  economics/recovery needs of telecommunications.    The study makes use of a recently developed computer simulation  tool that combines geographic information system technology with  state-of-the-art  seismic risk models, and is designed expressly  to quantify the effects of lifeline interaction on seismic  security of telecommunications system.    This research will contribute to improved security of  telecommunications systems which benefits the carriers, the  public, governments, private enterprises, emergency response, and  disaster recovery.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
