They will test to failure a full size unreinforced masonry  building under a set of carefully controlled vertical and lateral  loads.  The Italian research plan also includes a compressive  program of material and substructure tests, use of non-  destructive tests prior to and after structural loading,  extensive analytical studies to predict performance, and repair  and retest of the damaged structure.    The planned experiment in Pavia, Italy, with the associated  supporting research provides a unique opportunity for U.S.  investigators to participate in a major research program and to  obtain research results applicable to the U.S. building  infrastructure.  The U.S. has never tested a full-sized, masonry  building such as will be tested in Italy under this research  program.  Current U.S. understanding of the behavior of such  building has been extrapolated from individual component tests or  has been estimated from observed building response after a major  loading from a catastrophic event.  The Pavia experiment provides  an opportunity to test such a building under controlled loading  conditions, with known materials, and with known construction  methods.  It should provide extensive building response and  strength data of a type not now available.  * * *",
