The rhyolitic system to be studied  is that which erupted at 1.51 Ma to form the Otowi (or  Lower) Member of the Bandelier Tuff, Jemez Mountains, New  Mexico.  The procedure to be followed relies on analyzing  very small amounts of Sr (down to 1 ng) in small samples of  feldspar, matrix glass, and glass inclusions.  The results  of this work will enable the contribution of various  processes involved in compositional zonation (closed-system  differentiation, phenocrysts accumulation, wall-rock  contamination, magmatic recharge) of the Otowi Member magma  to be quantified.  More significantly, the timing, rates,  and mechanism of any contribution from closed-system  differentiation can be constrained more closely than is  possible in a conventional geochemical  study.",
