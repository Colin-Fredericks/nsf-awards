 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320275  Saldin  Although electron diffraction techniques have been successful at  revealing many of the complex and unusual atomic structures which  exist at solid surfaces, they are hampered by their most common  methodology to date, which is to compare simulated diffraction  patterns for a large number of model structures with experiment.   Unfortunately, this limits their ability to determine complex  unknown structures because of the very large number of structural  parameters which need to be varied.  The computer time scaling of  such trial and error techniques is known to scale exponentially  with the number of optimized parameters (an NP-complete problem).    Recently, holographic techniques, as developed for optics, have  been shown to hold promise in overcoming some of these difficulties  for determining surface structure by electron diffraction.  This  research will use the only method that explicitly addresses the  nonlinear object wave terms whose non-negligible nature is the main  barrier to accurate structure determination by purely holographic  algorithms.  This method employs the unique idea of using a linear  programming based algorithm to iteratively optimize the solution to  the nonlinear problem.  The theoretical work will be applied to  experimental data of low energy electron diffraction, Auger and  photoelectron diffraction from both clean and adsorbate-covered  surfaces.  %%%  This analytical and computational research will focus on a new way  of interpreting experiments that determine the atomic structures of  surfaces.  The method is analogous to that of holography as used in  optics.  In this case the experimental probes are electrons instead  of light.  Successful completion of this project will yield a rapid  and accurate method to determine surface structures.  This  determination is important for basic research, but is particularly  important in applications ranging from catalysis to corrosion.  ***",
