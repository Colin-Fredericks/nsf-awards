A selective liberal  arts college for women, Scripps is one of the five undergraduate  colleges in Claremont. Because of an open cross-registration policy  among the Claremont Colleges, Scripps students have always had  access to mathematics courses taught at the other colleges. Over  the past decade the College has grown in the areas of the social  and physical sciences. This change in emphasis has created an  increased need for mathematics courses specifically for Scripps  students. In response to this need, the College created a new  mathematics department. The College is committed to the notion that  the knowledge of mathematics is increasingly important in our  society, and is dedicated to encouraging women to pursue studies in  mathematics.  Matching funds are provided by a grant from the Ralph  M. Parsons Foundation.",
