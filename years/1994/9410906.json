 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410906  Schwarcz    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Henry Schwarcz will  continue research on electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of  prehistoric archaeological and hominid sites. ESR dating can  provide dates over the range from a few thousand to more than two  million years. It is based on the principle that some materials  found at archaeological sites store a physical record of the  amount of radiation to which they have been exposed.   Tooth enamel, which is found at virtually every archaeological  site, displays a characteristic ESR signal which increases in  intensity with exposure to radiation, and which has zero  intensity in modern teeth. One can experimentally determine the  dose rate at the site where the enamel was recovered, and the  equivalent dose that was absorbed by the enamel to produce the  observed ESR signal. The ratio of these quantities provides the  age of the tooth, and thus the time of occupation of the site.  The precision of the dates is +- 5 to 10 %. The McMaster    Laboratory is the only one in North America carrying out ESR  research and has successfully applied the method to many sites in  Europe, Asia and Africa. With NSF support research will continue  to refine the ESR technique itself. Dr. Schwarcz and his  colleagues will also analyze and provide dates for a range of  significant anthropological specimens.",
