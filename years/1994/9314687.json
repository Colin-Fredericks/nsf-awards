 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314687  EMERSON      This study is t determine rates of net biological productivity and  respiration  in the oligotrophic ocean and the mechanisms that  control this process.  It is hypothesized that oxygen and carbon is  cycled at this location in which about two thirds of the net oxygen   production in the euphotic zone is accompanied by dissolved organic  carbon (DOC) production and one third by particulate carbon  formation.  Most of the DOC is respired immediately below the  euphotic zone (100-175m) and most of the particulate carbon escapes  the upper ocean.  Since DOM has a high C/N ratio, much less nitrite  is required to fuel the biological pump than suggested by the  \"Redfield\" ratio.  Dissolved nitrate appears to be taken up in the  region of oxygen  respiration below the euphotic zone.    This proposal is designed to test this hypothesis and study the  importance of short term transients of net biological O2  production. Continuous measurements of net biological  oxygen  production will be determined by deploying a device for in situ  measurements of total gas pressure and oxygen.  The hypothesis will  be tested by detailed simultaneous measurements of biological O2  production and dissolved organic matter at both Hawaii and Bermuda  U.S. JGOFS time series stations, and by determining the rates of  respiration and 15N-NO3 uptake below the euphotic zone.",
