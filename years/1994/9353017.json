During the six-week  period the students will work in teams of twenty-five and sub-  groups of five solving real-world environmental problems. They will  be assisted by environmental scientists and university professors.   Activities include seminars, field investigations, individual  career counseling, research project, and dialogue and visits with  various scientists. Follow-up activities during the academic year  will involve students using their summer experiences to develop  individual projects. The selected students will enter the project  as a special program within the Bronx High school of Science.  ***",
