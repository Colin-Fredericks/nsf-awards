Russell, Department of  Chemistry, Iowa State University, to pursue with Dr. Woonphil Baik, Department  of Chemistry, Myong Ji University, Korea, for 30 months, a program of  cooperative research on free radical reactions of nitro compounds.  This  research will involve (1) exploring the reason(s) underlying the lack of  reactivity between allylic nitronate anions and 2-halo-2-nitro-propanes when  photostimulated and (2) extensions of the basic SRN1 mechanisms to new types  of free radical chain processes involving electron transfer reactions of  aliphatic nitro compounds.  The possibility of achieving cyclization reactions  of hindered phenoxide radicals with a tethered nitronate anion also will be  investigated.    The proposed research will attempt to extend general understanding of the  mechanism of certain free radical chain substitution reactions with  appropriate anions (nucleophiles).  The collaborators are highly respected  researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
