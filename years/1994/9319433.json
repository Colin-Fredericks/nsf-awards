 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319433  Susman    Acid-base balance, or pH homeostasis, is crucial for the proper  function of many organs within the body, including the brain.   However, despite the general agreement that pH homeostasis is  crucial for brain function, little is known about the impact of  changes in pH on nerve cell (neuron) functioning.  It was only  recently that scientists recognized that changes in brain pH play  a role in neuron signalling.  Neurotransmitters, released from  neurons in response to an electrical signal, influence brain pH.   Further, brain pH influences the response of neurons to  neurotransmitters.  These findings indicate that changes in pH  modulate neuron electrical functioning.  It is well-known in other  systems that pH changes affect many cellular processes, including  energy and protein metabolism.  Despite indications that pH affects  neuronal function, little is known about the role of pH changes in  metabolism of neurons or of how pH is regulated in neurons.   Current research explores the relationships among pH, energy  metabolism and protein metabolism in slices from the region of the  brain implicated in learning and memory, the hippocampus.  We  assess the impact of brief changes in pH on neuronal metabolic  responses to neurotransmitter stimulation and to energy challenges.   Results from this study will provide important information about  the role of changes in brain pH in several important aspects of  neuronal function, particularly protein and energy metabolism, and  will provide new information about pH regulation in the mammalian  brain.  ***",
