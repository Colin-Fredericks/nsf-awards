 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parsons    Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Ms. Starr Farr will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological excavation at Bloody Point, an indigenous Native  American village site on the island of St. Kitts. The site  appears to have both prehistoric and early historic period  components. She will analyze the ceramics and other materials  collected from both trash midden and household contexts and  attempt to reconstruct both ethnic affiliation and social  organization based on these remains.    In recent years there has been great interest in the collision of  European and indigenous American peoples and cultures. Recent  scholarship on the Island Carib of the Lesser Antilles has  questioned traditional models of native society and the ways in  which they adapted to change in the face of contact. Ms. Farr  believes that in response to changed conditions, indigenous  political and social realignments occurred and that new ethnic  identities were rapidly forged. The research is important because  it will increase our understanding of how human societies adapt  to intense, rapid and unexpected change. It will also assist in  the training of a promising young scientist.",
