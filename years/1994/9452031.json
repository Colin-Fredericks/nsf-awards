 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452031  Baker  This project is designed to introduce science and non-science  majors to environmental compliance methodology with experiments of  four different types: (1) Measurements of specific properties of  substances like pKas or kf values, in complex solutions like those  that might be found in waste streams or measurement of distribution  coefficients of hazardous waste solutes between aqueous solutions  and oil or dirt or microbial sludge. (2) Degradation of organics by  treatment with inorganic oxidizers like ammonium persulfate or  hydrogen peroxide/light or oxidizing enzymes or microbial cultures.  (3) Experiments in which students manufacture a product by a method  that generates hazardous waste streams document concentrate and  clean up those streams. (4) Waste minimization experiments in which  the products of one lab experiment become the starting materials  for another (not necessarily in the same lab course). All of these  experiments are being managed by a high-quality UV-VIS  spectrophotometer capable of multicomponent analysis. This proposal  seeks funds for a Hewlett-Packard HP 8452A UV-VIS, a Vectra 486.25  computer with an HP50Q Desk Jet printer and software capable of  general scanning, multicomponent analysis and kinetic studies. This  project is giving students insight into how chemists have to think  in environmental compliance work, and into the experimental  ramifications of hazardous waste legislation on chemical  manufacturing processes.",
