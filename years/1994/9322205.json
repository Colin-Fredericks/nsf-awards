Each summer, 10 undergraduate students will be selected from a pool of 600-700  applicants to spend ten weeks completing an independent research project under the direction  of one of the 24 faculty mentors affiliated with the program.  At least half of the participants  will be students of color and at least half will be from institutions other than the University of  Minnesota.  Mentors in this program are basic scientists who have a common interest in  research related to water quality and the analyses of physical, chemical and biological  processes that occur in lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands.  The students' research experience  will be supplemented by weekly student seminars and faculty discussions of current research  topics.  The faculty discussions will provide students with the most current information on  specific topics as well as background terminology and concepts.  All students will prepare a  summary of their research project in the form of a display for a poster session at the  conclusion of the program.  ***",
