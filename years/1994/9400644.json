 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400644  Liggett        Professors Liggett, Mountford and Schonmann will work on  several projects related to two areas of Probability Theory:  Interacting Particle Systems and Brownian Motion. The first of  these is the study of probabilistic models for the evolution of  large physical systems which undergo phase transitions, while the  second is a more classical model which has played a central role  in Probability for much of this century. Among the problems to be  considered in the first area are: obtaining good bounds on the  critical values which separate the single phase from the  multiphase parameter region, and determining rates of convergence  to equilibrium in several models, including the stochastic Ising  model and nearest particle systems. In the second area, detailed  properties of the level sets of the Brownian sheet will be  investigated.       A relatively new and very active area of Probability Theory  is known as Interacting Particle Systems. It is devoted to the  analysis of probabilistic models for the evolution of physical  systems which can be in two or more phases - pieces of metal  (magnetized or not) or water (ice, water, steam) for example.  Some results of investigations in this area also have  applications in other areas, such as the study of queues and  transmission of disease. Professors Liggett, Mountford and  Schonmann will continue their work on some of the basic problems  in this field. One of them is the determination of the regions of  physical parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) in which  various phases occur, and the behavior of the systems near points  at which the phase description changes. Another is a study of the  speed with which systems approach equilibrium.",
