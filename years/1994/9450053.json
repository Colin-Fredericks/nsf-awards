It uses a system-wide approach, targeting not only  girls interested in science, but also their teachers, counselors,  and parents.  The project serves sixteen rural schools throughout  the state of Washington. In each school, with the support of the  principal, four girls entering the 10th grade, three  science teachers, and one counselor will be involved in an  intensive summer experience and a year of follow-up activities.   The girls will attend a two-week residential camp; the  teachers, a one-week institute; and counselors, a three day  workshop.  As part of the follow-up there will be school-generated  activities for other students and parents.  Each participating  school will receive a set of the curricular materials developed  during the summer programs and a grant for special science  projects.  In the last year of the project, a state-wide conference  will bring together participating students, teachers, and  counselors to share curricular materials and begin a public  education effort.  The selection of schools in clusters will  magnify and maintain the effects of this intervention beyond the  project funded period.  Materials generated by the project will  enable non-participating schools to duplicate many parts of the  project.  ***",
