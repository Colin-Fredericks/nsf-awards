 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360087  Ahmed    Technologies based on the injection of lime directly into flue gas  ducts in order to control sulfur dioxide show promise as being   simpler and less costly than acid-rain control approaches.  Up to  now, typical sulfur dioxide removals with lime alone have been low  (40 to 60 percent), and sorbent utilizations have been not  satisfactory.    Sorbent Technologies Corporation researchers have proposed a  concept to significant improve sulfur dioxide remove efficiency and  sorbent utilization.  By coating the lime onto an inexpensive  support phase, expanded vermiculite or perlite, and moistening the  combination slightly before introducing it into the duct, extremely  high sulfur dioxide removals were possible.  By recycling the  sorbents, high utilizations could be achieved.  The concept was  examined at U.S. SPA's North Carolina laboratories with good  results.  This Phase I project will continue the proof-of-concept  testing at Sorbtech's laboratories, specifically aimed at  developing a performance model and testing the model by  characterizing how changes in process and sorbent variables affect  sorbent performance.    The new technology represents a low-cost solution to the current  acid rain problem.  If fully developed, it should be attractive to  utilities and industrial firms that burn coal or fuel oil.  ***",
