 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the approximation capabilities of  afeedforward neural network for approximating functions in  different function classes in terms of the activation function  used, the number of layers, and the number of neurons.   Particular emphasis is placed on dimension-independent bounds and  localized approximation by networks.  In particular, the research  establishes strong connections between the theory of wavelets and  neural networks.  Applications to the construction of universal  time series predictors and pattern classifiers also are studied.  The project connects the theory of wavelets with that of neural  networks.  Both of these theories have numerous applications in  such areas as data compression, prediction of time series, target  classification, pattern recognition, and signal processing.  Both  topics of study have therefore flourished during the recent past,  for the most part, independently of each other.  There do exist  certain similarities between the two theories stemming from the  fact that they both deal with mathematically similar processes of  approximation.  The investigator explores these similarities  further.  In particular, he studies the inherent capabilities and  limitations of universal mapping networks and develops efficient  training paradigms.  A remarkable feature of the networks to be  studied is the ease with which the same network can be trained  and retrained to perform a variety of tasks using a theoretically  guaranteed minimal number of neurons.",
