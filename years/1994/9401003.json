 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401003  Le Floch      This proposal is motivated by the numerical difficulties  arising in Computational Fluid Dynamics, and more generally in  continuum mechanics, when computing solutions to nonlinear  hyperbolic systems of PDE's. The solutions to such a system are  discontinuous, and, being not uniquely determined by their  initial data, are selected via the so-called entropy criterion.  While the entropy criterion is treated in the literature as an  extra condition that is checked afterwards, the P.I. developed  approaches where the entropy criterion plays the very central  role in analyzing the properties of a scheme, or in the  derivation of the scheme itself. The emphasis here will be on  establishing the entropy criterion and the nonlinear stability of  high order accurate schemes for multidimensional systems of  conservation laws.  This work is aimed at clarifying the role of  the so-called entropy criterion for the numerical approximation  of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The P.I. developed  new methods of analysis and numerical analysis, and established  that several numerical schemes are consistent with the entropy  criterion. Such a result guarantees that a method is nonlinearly  stable, and produces the physically meaningful discontinuous  solutions. The techniques also provide new insight on the schemes  used for shock wave calculations, and suggest possible  improvements. The focus here will be on developing flux-splitting  methods, second-order Godunov-type schemes, and truly  multidimensional schemes for systems of conservation laws. The  analysis will include concept such as: entropy dissipation  estimates, tracking of monotonicity regions, the compensated  compactness method, the measure-valued solutions, etc. Further  insight about the nonlinear stability will be obtained by  considering the issue of uniqueness and continuous dependence  with respect to the initial condition.",
