 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313650  Bates  Research activities focus upon metal-semiconductor composites for  the detection of optical radiation in the 3-5um wavelength portion  of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Two important detectors used for  thermal imaging in this atmospheric window include Hg1-x Cdx Te  (x=0.4 to 0.3) and Ptx Si Schottky barrier devices.  (The Ptx Si  alloy composition varies with the sintering temperature.)  The  former material has attractive fundamental properties such as a low  intrinsic carrier concentration with no~1014 cm-3, a high electron  mobility of ue~ 105 cm 2/volt-sec. and long minority carrier  lifetimes on the order of 10-6 seconds associated with intrinsic  recombination processes.  These combine to give systems using this  material large quantum efficiencies of 60%.  Quantum efficiencies  are given on the basis of absorbed photons.  Disadvantages include  nonuniform properties in two-dimensional arrays and poor mechanical  integrity.  The latter material, though very uniform in its  properties, suffers from low quantum efficiencies of about 1% for  thermal imaging and are normally operated at 80 K to suppress the  dark current.  These factors have contributed to the lack of their  more widespread use in the 3-5um wavelength range.  The concept involved in these studies is the use of buried Schottky  barriers, as produced by dispersing small metal particles typically  5-50nm in size, in semiconducting matrices for the detection of  infrared radiation.  These structures avoid the trade-off between  absorption and quantum efficiency in the choice of metal thickness  in the planar structures which contributes to their low quantum  efficiencies.  The system to be investigated is PtxSi particles in  a p-type silicon matrix and this choice is based on the following:   (a) like the planar structures of the same materials this system  can be made sensitive to radiation in the 3-5um wavelength range;  (b) these structures may be produced by well established solid-  state growth techniques; ( c) they may be, like the planar  strucutures, readily incorporated as an integral part of a larger  system using silicon-based technology and; (d) properties such as  quantum efficiency responsivity and uniformity may be readily  compared to the planar structure as a test of the theory involoved  and the feasibility of reducing it to practice.",
