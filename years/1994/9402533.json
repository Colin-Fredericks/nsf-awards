The activities include 1.)  integrated product and process development with customer's supplier  chain, 2.) flexible manufacturing distributed over networks of  cooperating facilities, 3.) teamwork among geographically and  organizationally distributed organizational units, which may be  highly diverse in size, capabilities, and culture, and 4.) use of  high-technology support for collaboration, including high-speed  information networks and integration methodology.       The central focus of the proposed research is the  investigation of fundamental engineering principles that are  critical to the success of collaborative manufacturing or test the  limits of the concept in case of the most demanding requirements.   The ultimate goal is to create the enabling tools and help  manufacturing companies and students learn how to make effective  use of the new opportunities.          There are three major thrusts for the new proposal: 1.)  Coherent Product Realization which deals with the issues related to  bringing new products into production, supported by the previously-  developed technologies in distributed concurrent engineering,  performance evaluation design, and product and process simulation;  2.) Coherent Process Integration which relates to analysis and  synthesis tools required for integrating all of the activities  associated with production; and 3.) Coherent Production System  Tools which targets the issues at a system level such as modelling  of collaborative production system, decision support structures,  and distributed implementation.       This award provides support for the ERC for 5 years.  In  addition, a supplementary award with funds provided by the Army  Redstone Missile Command to fund a research project to adapt,  extend, and apply research in rapid product manufacturing  techniques demonstrated by the Purdue Engineering Research Center  (ERC's) Qui ck Turnaround Cell (QTC) system and to support a testbed  installation at the Army Redstone Missile Command Production  Engineering Division for the purpose of validation and technology  transfer.         The major thrust for this project is to implement the  developed research tools for designing and planning of cylindrical  parts.  The newly developed design tools will be installed and  tested at Army Redstone Missile Command.  This system contains new  features developed to represent cylindrical and hybrid parts for  turning and milling operations.  In addition, the interface module  will be installed and implemented to validate the simulation  results.  ***",
