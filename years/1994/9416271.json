Data   will  be  derived  from telephone interviews with 500 individuals  who  are  members  of  families  participating in an  ongoing  longitudinal  study  of  intergenerational family relations and mental  health.  The  focus of the interviews will be experiences during and after  the  earthquake,  including  family involvement  in  preparedness  efforts and the psychological impact of the earthquake.  Analyses  will address: the extent to which preparation is diffused through  family  networks, and what family-level mechanisms  encourage  or  impede preparation; the effects of family ties in moderating  the  impact  of the recent earthquake, and conversely, the effects  of  the   earthquake   on   family  ties;  and  age   difference   in  vulnerability.  ***",
