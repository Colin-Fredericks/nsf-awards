The objective of their  research is to explain theoretically the transport properties and  plasmon excitation spectrum of electronic microstructures in  spatially confined electronic systems.     The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration theoretical  expertise and will compute properties of arrays of quantum  antidots and dots.  These systems exhibit novel magnetic field  dependent phenomena and could play a crucial role in the next  generation of computers.  Quantum dots have a range of electronic  and optical applications. And dots have possibilities as the  basis for more efficient and precisely tuned semiconductors. The  theoretical effort is complemented by the experimental expertise  of the British research group. Dr. Pepper and his colleagues will  fabricate, grow and characterize the semiconductor samples and  perform transport and infrared absorption experiments.  The  theoretical results obtained at Hunter College will be compared  with the experiments.  The proposed research will advance our  understanding of these electronic systems and their transport  properties.",
