 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311749  Marshall         The objective of this research is to see if the charge on  precipitation is primarily responsible for the electricity in  thunderstorms.  Toward this end, the investigators propose to  analyze data of the charge, size, and two-dimensional shape of  precipitation particles collected inside ten Florida thunderstorms  during the 1991 Convection and Precipitation/Electrification  Experiment (CaPE).  These data are especially important because of  the measurements in the temperature range from -5o to -20oC; this  region has not been well studied despite suggestions that much of  the charge in storms is generated there.  From the shape  measurements the proposers can determine the type of precipitation  particle:  raindrop, snowflake, hailstone, or graupel.  They can  then determine the polarity and amount of charge carried on  different types of particles.  The PIs will collaborate with  colleagues at the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to  look for influences on particle charges by temperature, cloud  liquid water content, cloud particle types and numbers, updrafts  and downdrafts, position in the cloud, etc.  They will compare the  electric fields measured by the sailplane to the electric field  expected from the measured particle charges; comparable fields will  suggest the precipitation carries most of the charge in that part  of the storm.  The PIs will collaborate with NCAR colleagues and  other CaPE researchers using radar data to place the precipitation  measurements in their correct storm context by superimposing  sailplane tracks on reflectivity data and on wind fields from  multiple Doppler radar analyses.  ***",
