 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroimmunology is a rapidly emerging and expanding field of  research, propelled by recent findings that have provided evidence  that a number of molecules affect the growth and differentiation of  cells in both the immune system and the nervous system.  It is now  recognized that molecules once thought to have actions restricted  to the immune system directly affect the proliferation, growth, and  differentiation of nerve cells.  Similarly, molecules originally  identified because they function in the development of the nervous  system reciprocate by having effects in the immune system.  A major  goal of this conference, held under the auspices of the Federation  of American Societies for Experimental Biology,  is to bring  together scientists from diverse fields (such as immunology,  neuroscience, pharmacology, and psychology) to explore new ideas,  exchange information, and foster collaboration in the study of the  interactions between the nervous system and the immune system.",
