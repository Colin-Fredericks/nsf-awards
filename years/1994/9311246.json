 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311246  Landry         The Arabian Sea is an intensely dynamic region of the world's  oceans driven by strong seasonal reversals in monsoon winds.  The  region is interesting in the context of the Joint Global spatial  scales \"extremes\" in ocean production systems -- coastal upwelling  to open ocean oligotrophic -- under relatively constant tropical  illumination.  It is thus a natural laboratory to test conceptual  linkages among physical forcing, food-wed structure, biogeochemical  cycling and fluxes, and carbon burial in the sediments.  The  general goals of this project are to asses the roles of  microzooplankton as consumers of bacterial and phytoplankton  production and to contribute to understanding the relationships  among plankton community structure, new production, and  biogeochemical fluxes and their responses to physical forcing the  Arabian Sea.  The project is to be conducted during the spring  (April) intermonsoon and summer (August) SW monsoon seasons, when  the most dramatic differences should be evident.  Abundance,  biomass, and specific growth rates of bacteria and phytoplankton  will be determined by flow cytometric, microscopic, and pigment  analyses to determine their variations with season, depth and  location.  The dominant microzooplankton grazers on pico- and  nanoplankton will be identified and quantified, and the impact of  their grazing will be measured with a suite of complementary  methods including dilution, fluorescently-labelled prey, size-  fractionation, and specific metabolic inhibitors.  Results of this  project will contribute to understanding how global climate  changes, which may affect prevailing forcing winds, will alter  phytoplankton community structure and in turn how these changes in  structure of the food web affect carbon storage and export from the  upper water column.",
