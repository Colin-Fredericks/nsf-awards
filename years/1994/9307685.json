 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307685  Gowda  An affine complementarity system is defined by a finite number of  linear equalities, linear inequalities, and complementarity  conditions.  This project will investigate the theory and  computation of affine complementarity systems based on their  equivalent formulation as a system of nonsmooth equations and on  degree theory.  On the theoretical side, the goal is to develop a  comprehensive theory covering uniqueness, existence, and  sensitivity/stability aspects of these systems.  The aim is to  present a unified theory for linear, mixed linear, vertical, and  horizontal complementarity problems, and affine variational  inequalities.  On the computational side, the goal is to discover  and analyze feasible/infeasible interior point algorithms for  solving affine complementarity systems.  The research will build  on work in recent years which has demonstrated the fruitfulness  of nonsmooth-equations and degree theory approach to variational  inequalities, complementarity problems, and nonlinear programs.  ***",
