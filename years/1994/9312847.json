The U.S. principal investigator, John  Zhang of New York University, will work with NYU graduate  students on a two year collaboration with the Atomic and  Molecular Physics Group at Shandong Teacher's College.     Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control intra-and  intermolecular energy transfer and energy partitioning among the  products of unimolecular reactions is of practical importance in  chemical dynamics.  As studies of unimolecular reaction move ever  closer toward state to state level thanks to advances in laser  and molecular beam technologies, it is increasingly important and  necessary to use dynamical theories to simulate unimolecular  processes in order to understand the detailed dynamics and  features of the potential energy surfaces that characterize  unimolecular reactions.  In this proposal, the researchers will  focus on rigorous quantum mechanical study for vibrational  predissociation of HF dimer and other hydrogen bonded complexes  and the direct photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide.",
