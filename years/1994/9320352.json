 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320352  Kash    This three-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative research in  technological innovation between Don Kash of George Mason  University and William Kingston of Trinity College in Dublin,  Ireland.  The objective of the study is to trace the evolution of  technological innovation through research on the \"interference  files\" of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  The award  supports dissertation research and travel to Ireland for the  principal investigator and an advanced graduate student to analyze  the data with Dr. Kingston, a world renown scholar and expert on  patents.    Historically U.S. patents have been granted, not to the first to  file an application, but the first to invent. When two applications  have been filed nearly simultaneously, the patent examiner declares  an \"interference\" and both parties must provide evidence as to  their respective dates of invention.  This evidence usually reveals  the details of every aspect of the generation of the invention and  is a rich source on the process of innovation. Dr. Kash brings to  this collaboration expertise on innovation.  This is complemented  by Dr. Kingston's research on patent systems and intellectual  property rights. The proposed research will advance our  understanding of the innovation process and patent behavior and  their public policy implications.  ***",
