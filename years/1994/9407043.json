By  characterizing the surfaces of silicon and  silicon substrates before and after metal  deposition, the team will analyze the surface  flaws, metal contamination, and oxidation  induced defects in silicon wafers.    Today, the electronic industry is demanding  clean silicon wafer surfaces to produce ultra  large scale integrated circuits.  Metal  impurities can degrade various characteristics  of the silicon integrated circuit components,  and as the device geometries are reduced, they  become more sensitive to contaminants and  defects.  Prior to the vapor deposition of  metal, the team will utilize Dr. Shimizu's  expertise in non-destructive diagnostics of  metal contaminants using a scanning photon  microscope (SPM) as well as other instruments  at Hitachi to characterize the surface of  silicon wafers.  The team will then utilize Ms.  Shull's technique of measuring interfacial  stress with a laser scanning curvature  measurement device to study the effect the  contaminants and defects have on the vapor  deposition of copper and silver multilayers.   Similarly, the team will also study the effect  of a silicon oxide layer in preventing  crystallization of amorphous thin films of  metals and silicon.  Shull will provide samples  of thin film amorphous silica, both with and  without an oxide capping layer, which have been  subjected to various high vacuum thermal  anneals.  The team will utilize the SPM to  analyze the silicon/metal interfaces and the  silicon/silicon oxide thin film/metal thin film  layered structure.  The efforts of Shimizu and  Shull will further the fundamental  understanding of the behavior of metal  impurities in ultra thin films enhancing the  research and development of thin film,  multilaye r and surface coating technologies.  ***",
