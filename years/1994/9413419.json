 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matching funds support is requested from the National  Science Foundation to defray approximately 45% of the cost  to acquire instrumentation that is vital for the development  of a state-of-the-art scientific imaging facility at Ohio  University. The facility is to be located in space that has  been newly renovated for this purpose. It will upgrade and  replace aging and obsolete light, transmission-, and  scanning electron microscopy equipment, and utilize the  newly emerging generation of digital and video technology to  resolve, capture, store, process, transmit and print high  quality scientific data. The facility will be used  extensively by the authors of this proposal, and by numerous  additional senior personnel and their graduate research  groups to expand the parameters of present research programs  and to initiate new projects that are possible only with the  support of this multiplicity of newly emerging technologies.  The proposed facility will be available to researchers  throughout Ohio University and to their collaborators. We  currently have no facility with the resources and  flexibility to satisfy the specialized requirements of such  a diverse array of research programs, and the combined  capabilities of the proposed facility are presently not  available at Ohio University or elsewhere in the  southeastern Ohio region. By bringing together in a single  centrally-located laboratory all of the imaging requirements  for a broad spectrum of productive research programs, we  will be able to establish a center for the support of  ongoing research, for the development of innovative new  research initiatives, and for the comprehensive training of  future generations of scientific researchers.",
