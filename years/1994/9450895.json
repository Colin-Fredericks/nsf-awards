Other  institutions will be able to replicate this environment. The  project demonstrates that closed laboratories can be used  effectively as the primary means of instruction in the first two  courses in the major and  provides an alternative teaching paradigm  that is more student-centered than the traditional lecture/listen  method. This paradigm focusses on the student as performer, rather  than the professor as performer. The professors role is  facilitator, guide, and manager. There is much current interest in  incorporating closed laboratories into the computer science  curriculum, but the investigators know of no other institution that  is committed to replacing most lecture/listen sessions with a  totally redesigned active learning environment based on the use of  closed laboratories.  Formal studies have shown that students learn  best in small groups. The closed laboratory materials and the  physical arrangement of the equipment is designed to promote  teamwork, and a major goal of the project is to help students learn  to work effectively in teams. Lifelong learning skills will be  developed as the focus of activity centers on the student and  encourages her/him to share responsibility for the learning  process. The project can have a positive effect on attracting and  retaining women and minorities because of the emphasis on human  interaction and the de-emphasis on rote learning and memorization.",
