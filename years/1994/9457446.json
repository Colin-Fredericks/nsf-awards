 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457446  Steidel      Over the course of the next several years, a number of  inter-related projects will be pursued which address the broad  question of the history of \"normal\", Milky-Way-like galaxies from  the epoch of their formation to the present time. The studies are  based on a combination of the technique of quasar absorption line  spectroscopy and more conventional optical and near-infrared  imaging and spectroscopy of very faint, distant galaxies.  The  objects for study are selected on the basis of their having  produced hydrogen and metallic absorption lines in the spectra of  even more distant, background quasars.  High resolution  spectroscopy of the quasars yields extremely detailed physical  information on the galaxies producing the absorption, even for  galaxies whose mere detection (using conventional methods)  strains our technological capabilities at the present time.  Samples of galaxies, selected in essence by their gas  cross-section, are constructed without any biases related to the  nature of stellar radiation being emitted by the galaxies as a  function of time.  The samples represent a very large range of  cosmic epochs, from times when the Universe was only 10% of its  current age, to the present.  One then combines this information  with data that is obtained from direct identification of the  galaxies producing the absorption line systems using imaging and  low-dispersion galaxy spectroscopy in the optical and the  near-infrared.  These latter data provide information on the  stellar populations, luminosities, and geometrical orientations  with respect to the line of sight to the quasars.  In total, then,  one obtains information on the chemical composition, gas-phase  structure, kinematics, luminosity distribution, ionization state,  space density, and clustering properties of galaxies as a function  of time.  The marriage of these methods, all of which can be  pursued using currently existing instrumentation on large  ground-based telescopes, allows the construct ion of a detailed  history of normal galaxies since the time of their formation.   Galaxy formation and evolution theories are at present largely  unconstrained by observations, and it is the intent of this  research effort to place the subject on a firm empirical footing.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  The award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
