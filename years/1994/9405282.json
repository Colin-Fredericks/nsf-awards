These proteins share remarkable structural  similarity by x-ray crystallography despite as little as 20%  sequence identity.  The experiments proposed here will determine  if proteins that share the same structure also share the same  folding mechanism, even when there are low levels of homology in  their sequence.  A multifaceted approach will be used to address  this problem on all levels of structural organization.  Stopped-  flow circular dichroism will be used to examine global changes in  secondary structure during folding and unfolding.  In addition,  for proteins in this family that have proton NMR assignments,  backbone amide-hydrogen exchange labeling will be used to  determine when the specific hydrogen bonds that form the  secondary structure and stabilized during the folding process.   Formation of tertiary structure during folding will be examined  by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence and by site-specific  labeling of the protein with fluorine and fluorine NMR.  This  unique method allows the changes in tertiary contacts at specific  sites during folding to be monitored, both at equilibrium and  kinetically by stopped-flow NMR.  Fluorine NMR has already  identified an unusual intermediate that has little if any  secondary structure for one member of the family, intestinal  fatty-acid binding protein.  This intermediate is highly  populated at equilibrium at levels of denaturant sufficient to  completely unfold the protein by other spectroscopic methods.   These studies will be extended to other members of the lipocalin  family to determine if the same types of intermediates are  present on their folding pathways as well.  %%%  The mechanism of protein folding continues to be a elusive  problem in biochemistry.  It is not currently known how the amino  acid sequence of a protein determines the final structure of the  protein  and the structures of the intermediates that might be  present during the formation of that structure.  This proposal  uses a variety of physical methods to determine the mechanism of  folding for the intracellular lipocalin family of proteins.  The  study of this family of proteins will improve our understanding  of protein folding in general, and of  -sheet proteins in  particular, which will have benefits for the production of  improved protein products by the biotechnology industry.  ***",
