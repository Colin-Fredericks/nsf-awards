 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412789  Takahashi  The series of Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU)  conferences sponsored  by the National Science Foundation  and wide assortment of partners has stimulated considerable  interest, cooperation and agreement on balanced utilization  and management of our coastal region in harmony with the  environment.  The success of these gatherings can be  attributed to the quality of the conferees and the  philosophical format.    There is generally a dominant core of active decision makers  presenting papers, participating in the panel discussions  and interjecting comments throughout the conference.    To further expand this network it is proposed that a  symposium on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization be held to  focus on marine economic development in harmony with the  environment.  The convening of this symposium will  accomplish several objectives:       continue to call attention to the need for wise    utilization of our coastal regions;       share knowledge of environmentally acceptable mechanisms    for enhancing coastal utilization while improving or    maintaining standards in these areas;       identify future engineering and related environmental    research needs;       discuss how ocean applications can serve as the    transition for defense contractors and shipyards into a    peacetime economy; and       widely disseminate the results of the presentations and    discussions via the publication of proceedings containing    the papers presented.    Japan has offered to Co-host the meeting and provide funding  for the necessary logistics and on-site activities.  Support  has also been provided by NOAA.",
