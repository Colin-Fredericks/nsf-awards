 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320971  Willey         This research will investigate the chemical composition of  rainwater in coastal North Carolina.  This location is ideal for  rainwater research because it receives precipitation of both  continental and maritime origins.  Previous work has shown that  these two general source types are compositionally very different  with respect to inorganic ions as well as formic and acetic  acids.  The specific objective of this study is to define  patterns of variation in the rainwater concentrations of the  strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).  At this time the factors  controlling the concentration of H2O2 in maritime and continental  storms are poorly defined and unpredictable.  The question  addressed in this research project is whether H2O2 concentrations  are greater in rain of marine or continental origin.  It could be  argued that H2O2 levels would be lower in continental rain because  it can oxidize sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitrogen  oxides to nitric acid, thereby resulting in a net loss of H2O2.   Hydrogen peroxide is, however, photochemically produced along  with other pollutant atmospheric oxidants, which would increase  its concentration in rain of continental origin.         The relative concentrations of H2O2 in continental versus  maritime rain must be defined to allow global modeling of many  important atmospheric oxidants.  Hydrogen peroxide is involved in  cycles of other stronger atmospheric oxidants including the  formation of hydroperoxyl radical and the destruction of hydroxyl  radical.  Model calculations suggest that concentrations of  strong atmospheric oxidants may increase dramatically during the  next decade because of stratospheric ozone losses at temperate  latitudes.  Hence, this is a particularly timely project.         Rainwater and atmospheric condensate are appropriate media  for the study of H2O2 due to its large water solubility.  For  example, hydrogen peroxide is often present in rainwater at  micromolar concentrations.  It is st able in rain for time periods  of hours, which makes this laboratory well suited for the project  because of the proximity of the collection sites and the  analytical laboratory.  There is approximately a decade of  rainwater composition data for one of the North Carolina sites.  This relatively long term data record will be useful in  interpretation of new measurement data and will also facilitate  comparisons with other sampling locations.  ***",
