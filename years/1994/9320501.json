 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rates and mechanisms of prototype isomerization and fragmentation   reactions of small hydrocarbons will be examined. The molecules selected   for study are sufficiently small to allow high-level molecular orbital   calculation for comparison to experiment. The studies will include: (1)   the rate of cis, trans ethylene-1,2-d2 isomerization, (2) the relative   energy barriers for structural vs geometric isomerizations of   cyclopropane-1, 2-d2 and cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3, (3) energy barriers for   fragmentation of cyclobutane-1,3-d2, (4) the stereochemistry of   conversion of bicyclo 1.1.0 butane-2,2-d2 to butadiene, (5) rate and   mechanism of the 3,4-elimination of molecular hydrogen from cyclopentene,   and (6) the stereochemistry of reactions of vinylcyclobutane-2,3-d2 to   cyclohexene and to ethylene plus butadiene.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work   of Professor David K. Lewis at Colgate University. These results of this   research will provide fundamental information about processes where   carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken and formed. A   long-standing question about these processes is whether the bonds are   broken in a stepwise manner or in one step. These mechanistic aspects   will be probed by the thermal decomposition of deuterium labeled   compounds and compounds with unique three-dimensional structure.   Theoretical predictions, based on sophisticated calculations, will be   compared to experimental results which will be a test of the theory.",
