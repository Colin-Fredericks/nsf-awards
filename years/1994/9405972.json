Polarized growth in  response to different signals during the yeast cell cycle  can result in the generation of several different  morphological structures, such as buds, mating projections  and pseudohyphae.  Three protein components of the cell  polarity apparatus in yeast were previously characterized;  the Ras -related GTPase Cdc42p, Cdc24p, which activates  Cdc42p function by nucleotide exchange, and Cdc43p, the beta  subunit of the geranylgeranyltransferase that regulates  Cdc42p subcellular localization.  These components have  conserved counterparts in other eukaryots, suggesting that  common mechanisms may exist.  This project will use genetic  and biochemical techniques to identify new or pre-existing  proteins that interact with Cdc42p to control either its  function as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p  or its localization and interactions with the actin  cytoskeleton.  %%%  The long term objective of this project is to understand the  mechanism that control cellular morphogenesis during the  eukaryotic cell cycle.  Cellular morphogenesis, the process  by which the complex, three dimensional organization of the  cell is developed and maintained, is crucial for the control  of many cellular and developmental processes such as the  generation of cell polarity and cell shape, the  intracellular movements of organelles, and the polarized  secretion and deposition of new cell surface constituents.  Microtubules and actin based cytoskeletal networks play a  critical role in cellular morphogenesis.  In the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, microtubules are required for  proper chromosome segregation and nuclear migration while  actin microfilaments are necessary for polarized growth  patterns.  Polarized growth in yeast occurs in response to  both internal and external signals, resulting in different  m orphological structures.  One of the goals of the proposal  is to understand the molecular machinery that controls these  changes in polarized growth patterns.  In addition, it will  also be determined how the growth of cell polarity is  integrated with other cellular processes, such as cell cycle  control.  ***",
