The  investigation seeks to determine why the University of Minnesota's  Institute os Technology has been particularly successful in the  recruitment, retention, and placement of its students with  disabilities in these disciplines and careers.  Efforts will be  made to distinguish between the factors that originate within the  community and those that derive from the structure and culture of  the Institute or University.  The method of inquiry is based on  ethnographic techniques.  The study will draw on the cumulative  experience, reflections, and recommendations of students and former  students with disabilities  who have enrolled in the Institute.   Fifty juniors and seniors enrolled as full-time students in  science, mathematics, engineering, or computer science will be  invited to participate in focus group discussions.  An additional  20 recent graduates of the institute who have disabilities now  successfully employed in their careers, will be interviewed.   Verbatim transcripts will be entered into a computer program  designed to assist in identifying recurrent themes which  subsequently will be used in building a system of domains and  hypotheses.  The researcher will then develop a set of prioritized  recommendations concerning actions that can be taken by 4-year  institutions, pre-college educational systems, employers, and other  community-based entities to encourage people with disabilities to  enter these disciplines and careers.  ***",
