The objective of   the conference is to bring together researchers from the United   States and Japan to focus on the current state of research and new   directions in simulation as applied to manufacturing and   communications.  The conference is sponsored by the Special   Interest Group on Systems Simulation, The Operations Research   Society of Japan, and the National Institute of Standards and   Technology.       The conference provides an opportunity for US researchers to   meet and discuss critical research issues with their counterparts   in Japan and other Far Eastern countries.  The limited focus on   manufacturing and communication provides an opportunity for an in-   depth analysis to assess the current state of application of   simulation technology in manufacturing and identify any major   obstacles present that must be overcome to move the technology   forward.  Simulation as a tool has been widely used in modeling and   analyzing many engineering problems, especially complex   manufacturing systems.",
