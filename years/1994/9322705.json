 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322705  Swift  Research conducted by this award is a component of the 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section (AOS).  The AOS is a collaborative effort with Canada that involves approximately 60 scientists participating on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during a 55-day field program in the summer of 1994.  The AOS is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and research is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences, the Office of Polar Programs and Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Data collected should be relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans and regions.    This project encompasses a service and research program.  The Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will conduct a detailed hydrographic survey consisting of about 100 precision temperature, conductivity, oxygen, and nutrient profiles at approximately 30 km intervals along the cruise track.  Resulting data will be shared with all participants.  Swift will use the hydrography data to focus on a study of the origin and circulation of the intermediate and deep waters of the Arctic Ocean and nearby seas.  Parameters to be determined are the surface-to-bottom distributions and sources of the physical and chemical characteristics, and the location, origin, and the structure of sub-surface boundary currents.  Information thus obtained will augment other studies during the AOS and will contribute to studies of the response of the regimes to environmental forcing.  ***",
