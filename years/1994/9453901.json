The project has three goals. The first goal  is to bring the concerns of minority women into the mainstream of  research on women in science and to leverage their concerns as  significant in their own right--not merely as an adjunct to women's  or minority issues.  The second goal i to sharpen and extend the  conceptual debate on equity in science by developing a framework  that accounts for race and gender in process and outcomes in the  science labor force.  The third goal is to identify and develop  more accurate indicators of access to opportunity and power that  describe the nature and form of specific processes that  differentiate minority women in their career attainments in  science.",
