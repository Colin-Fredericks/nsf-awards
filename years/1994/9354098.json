 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354098  St. John    Mark St. John, President of Inverness Research Associates, has  organized a four-day conference in October, 1993 devoted to  systemic reform of science instruction in urban school districts.  Eight urban districts that are at least three years into  NSF-funded reform efforts will send teams to share their  experiences, develop new skills, and contribute to a proceedings  volume that will document the lessons learned in these projects.  Project leaders from Teacher Enhancement projects in Cleveland,  Buffalo, Baltimore,  San Francisco, Pasadena, and Las Vegas will  be primary participants. Teams from cities with more recently  initiated reform projects (New York, Los Angeles, Brooklyn, and  Cincinnati) will also attend.     The monograph resulting from the conference will identify  barriers to systemic change encountered by the participating  teams, and the solutions they have crafted. Four of the  participating districts will be the subjects of in-depth case  studies presented in the monograph. These lessons may prove  essential to the many urban districts embarking on systemic  change, including those districts eligible for NSF support  through the Urban Systemic Initiative.    Cost sharing on this project represents approximately 10% of the  NSF contribution.  ***",
