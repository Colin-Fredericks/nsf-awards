 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321938  Kelley       The principal investigator will design and analyze  algorithms for the large systems of linear and nonlinear  equations and optimization problems that arise when infinite  dimensional problems are discretized.  Objectives include further  development of a new multilevel method for compact fixed point  problems, work on globally convergent methods for nonsmooth  compact fixed point problems, particularly those that arise from  parabolic control problems, and analysis of the sup-norm  convergence of certain methods based on inner products,  particularly GMRES, CG, and primal-dual interior point methods.   The principal investigator will also continue work on special  purpose methods for optimization and solution of nonlinear  equations. These methods are directed at problems such as  optimization of noisy functions, aomputer aided design of  microwave devices, and optimal control.       Large systems of equations arise in scientific computation  in many ways.  This project is to design and analyze efficient  solution methods for classes of very large problems that arise in  many applications.  The particular objectives of and algorithms  studied in this project are driven by applications and the  principal investigator works closely with scientists and  engineers in other disciplines.  As an example, in computer aided  design and manufacture of microwave semiconductor devices, such  as the amplifiers used in radar and cellular communication, the  principal investigator's work has been incorporated into software  for analysis and optimization of process yield, design of more  efficient devices, and bench testing of chips. In the course of  the development of this software, a new algorithm was discovered  for the optimization of noisy functions, that is, functions whose  values are corrupted by noise or error. Process yield models  often have that feature.  One goal of the present project is to  continue the work on noisy optimization.",
