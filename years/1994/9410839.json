The  West Antarctic Rift system is a major continental rift adjacent to the East  Antarctic craton and the Transantarctic Mountains are thought to represent an  uplifted rift shoulder on the south side of the rift system.  The rift system is of  particular interest because of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet that  occupies the region.  The late Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the  rift and mountains have been the subject of several recent investigations  sponsored by several national Antarctic programs.  These investigations have  demonstrated that these features are clearly linked and that their evolution has  been complex.  The proposed workshop will allow investigators to discuss  approaches to future research to understand the dynamics of this rift system  and the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains and to begin discussions about  collaborative research to focus on this region.  ***",
