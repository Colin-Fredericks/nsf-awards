 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421831  Branton  We propose a new method for rapidly sequencing polymers such as DNA  or RNA.  The method involves measurements of ionic current  modulation as the nucleotides of a linear nucleic acid molecule  pass through a channel in an artificial membrane.  Our immediate  goal is to prove that we can draw single stranded DNA or RNA  through a continuously open channel in a lipid bilayer and to  demonstrate that, during polymer passage through the channel, ionic  currents are reduced in a manner that reflects the properties of  the polymer (length, nucleotide composition, etc.).  Our long term  goals are to demonstrate the feasibility of using a patch-clamp-  like approach for direct electro-sensing of monomer sequences in a  linear polymer of DNA; and develop this as a routine procedure for  sequencing.  Because the approach proposed eliminates several of  the currently required preparatory chemical steps in DNA sequencing  and because it depends on inherently rapid, molecular events,  successful sequencing with this method will be an extraordinarily  important advance that should reduce the time and cost of nucleic  acid sequencing by several orders of magnitude.  %%%  A new method for the rapid sequencing of nucleic acid polymers  like DNA and RNA will be developed.  The method to be used involves  measurements of changes in ionic currents as the individual  building blocks of a nucleic acid pass through a channel in an  artificial lipid membrane.  The immediate goal of this research  project is to show that single stranded DNA or RNA can be drawn  through a continuously  open channel in the membrane (lipid  bilayer) and to demonstrate that during passage of the polymer  changes in ionic currents are reduced in a manner that reflects the  properties of the nucleic acid (i.e., length, composition of the  individual nucleotides which make up the nucleic acid).  The long  term goals are to demonstrate the feasibility of using this patch-  clamp-like approach for direct electro-sensing of ind ividual  nucleotides (the building blocks of nucleic acids) in the linear  sequence of DNA; and to develop this as a routine procedure for DNA  sequencing.
