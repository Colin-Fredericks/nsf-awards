 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362022  Murphy  The objective of this project is to evaluate a concept for  reducing the pollutants emitted by internal combustion engines  during the period before the engine reaches its optimal operating  temperature.  In this approach, a method is proposed for rapidly  heating the catalytic converter by bleeding hydrogen into the  exhaust system upstream from the catalytic converter.  The  hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using energy from  the vehicle's battery and alternator.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  The results may potentially be applied to design  of internal combustion exhaust systems to reduce pollutants  emitted during start-up to levels produced when the engine and  exhaust system are at their normal operating temperature.",
