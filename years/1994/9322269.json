 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322269  Collea    The Chautauqua Short Courses are an annual series of forums in  which scholars from various sciences meet for several days with  undergraduate faculty to communicate new knowledge, concepts and  techniques which are immediately beneficial to teaching and  research.  This program, which was initiated in 1970, continues  to receive National Science Foundation funding.  This award,  under the direction of Dr. Francis P. Collea, Director of  Research and Sponsored Programs for the California State  University System, and Prof. Nicholas Eror, Executive Director of  the U.S. Chautauqua Program and Chair of the Materials Sciences  Department at the University of Pittsburgh, will examine the  transferability of this mechanism from an American to an  Australian setting.  Prof. Terry Hore, Director of the Higher  Education Advisory and Research Unit at Monash University in  Clayton, Victoria, serves as the primary Australian counterpart.  Australia was selected for this internationalization of the  Chautauqua Program based on the belief by the U.S. organizing  group that Australia offered the greatest opportunity for the  widest dissemination of the courses, the Australian counterparts  would aggressively promote attendance, and that nine Australian  universities have agreed to participate in the program.    Over the past three years ten Chautauqua Short Courses received  outstanding reviews in that every participant gave it an  outstanding rating.  In consultation with the Australian  organizers, three of these courses have been selected for use in  Australia.  These courses are: Research on Learning Physics and  Implications for Instruction; Molecular Approaches to the Study  of Genetics, Evolution, Ecology, Systematics, Behavior, and  Conservation Biology; and, Creating Interactive HyperMedia Using  HyperCard.  Each of the three courses will be offered three  times, thus the nine participating Australian universities will  each serve as a course site.  This award primarily covers the   travel and per diem expenses of the American scholars providing  the course instruction.  Some additional support costs including  supplies, publications and evaluation costs are also included.  It is anticipated that through the support of the American-  Australian Studies Foundation a reciprocal program will be  mounted during the 1995-1996 academic year in which Australian  scholars will present short courses in the U.S.",
