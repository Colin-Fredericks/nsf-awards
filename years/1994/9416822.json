 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416822  Brown    Scientific visualization is a descriptive term for the use of  computer graphics and interactive techniques to gain insights  from scientific data, and the hardware and software of virtual  environments allow the scientists to interact with the data in  more natural ways than the typical screen, keyboard, and mouse  allow.  An invited workshop is planned for Hangzhou, P.R. China,  September 5-9, 1994, with selection for invitation to be based on  position papers.  The goals of the workshop are to bring together  researchers from the United States and China, as well as other  Asian countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, to spend  three days of intensive brain-storming and accomplish the  following:  *Survey what is currently happening in the United States and  Asia.    *Identify future research and development issues and trends in  scientific visualization and virtual environments, looking at  both the technology and at possible new scientific applications.    *Identify research  collaborations between the United States and  the Chinese and other Asian researchers.    A workshop report will be produced, published in respected  journals such as Computers and Graphics and ACM SIGGRAPH's  Computers Graphics, and made widely available.  This award will  cover the travel expenses of five researchers from the United  States.",
