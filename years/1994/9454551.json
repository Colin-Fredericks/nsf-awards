 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-year project in curriculum and network development undertaken  by two two-year colleges -- Minnesota Riverland Technical College  (MRTC) and Austin Community College (ACC) -- will involve  universities and high schools -- initially Mankato State University  (MSU) and Austin High School (AHS).  This project focuses on  educating builders of information highways and local byways.  In  other words, the focus is on \"conets\" -- cooperative networks that  link communities and companies regionally as well as within  evolving national and global information infrastructures.The last  two years of high school and last two years of university  baccalaureate degrees (in engineering, information science, etc.)  will provide a \"2+2+2\" context for developing a two-year associate  degree in interactive mass media and networking communications.   Students will study core general and technical courses and then  select options -- tentatively called digicom (electronics),  multiware (computers) and intervision (mass media).  Practicums  will entail student work on development of a \"conet\" to serve local  communities and involve high schools as public access sites,  equipped with terminals and kiosks.This two-year project is  intended to help set the stage for development of both: 1) a CoNet  Center of Excellence, supporting curricula not just within two-year  colleges but within \"?+2+2+2+?\" education extensions; and 2) a  Southeastern Minnesota CoNet regional community network, as a  potential model, especially for rural regions in the U.S. and  globally.",
