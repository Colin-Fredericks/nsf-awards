One of the most effective methods centers on outdoor  field activities, both local and off-school, in which students  learn science as observation and interpretation rather than as a  collection of facts.  We propose a Field Science Institute for  Teachers, in which K-12 teachers increase their basic knowledge and  appreciation of science topics that are appropriate for field  study, using classroom work and field work at suitable localities.    The grant allows 40 teachers to participate in the Field Science  Institute during each of the 1994 and 1995 summer semesters at  Wesleyan University, within the Graduate Liberal Studies Program.   The Institute will be conducted as four concurrent academic courses  and seminars during four-week sessions in July of 1994 and July of  1995.  Courses will be in subject areas of Field Botany, Field  Geology, Field Zoology (Ecology), and Field Archaeology, plus a  seminar in curriculum design for all participants.  Graduate  credits can be applied toward a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies  or a Certificate of Advanced Study, and school districts may also  award CEU's.",
