 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manthiram  This proposal addresses the use of borohydrides as reducing agents  in aqueous solutions to obtain reduced transition metal oxides and  ceramic-metal and metal-metal nanocomposites at ambient  temperatures. It is proposed to synthesize several novel reduced  oxides of tungsten and molybdenum and vanadium by a careful control  of experimental conditions such as pH, concentration and nature of  the reactants, and aerobic vs anaerobic environment. The  borohydride reducing agents will also be used to synthesize at  ambient temperatures ceramic-metal and metal-metal nanocomposites  that exhibit interesting magnetic characteristics. The products  will be characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis,  chemical analysis, spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy,  electrical transport, and magnetic measurements. The observed  properties will be correlated with crystal chemistry, chemical  composition and microstructure. A thorough characterization of the  products formed will provide an understanding of the chemistry  involved in the borohydride reduction-reaction process. Such an  understanding might provide important insights in exploiting  borohydrides for the synthesis of new inorganic materials. In  general, the proposed studies are of interest because of their  technological applications such as in magnetic recording. The  proposed exploratory research may lead to a kinetic accessibility  of new phases that may otherwise be unstable at higher  temperatures.   %%%  Inorganic solids are generally synthesized by reaction between the  components at high temperatures to overcome the diffusional  limitations. Such harsh reaction conditions not only result in  products with larger particle size and inhomogeneity, but also lead  to an inaccessibility of metastable phases and unusual valence  states. This proposal addresses the use of borohydrides as reducing  agents in aqueous solutions to obtain several novel reduced  transition metal oxides and ceramic-metal and metal-metal  nano composites at ambient temperatures.  In general, the proposed  studies are of interest because of their technological applications  such as in magnetic recording.
