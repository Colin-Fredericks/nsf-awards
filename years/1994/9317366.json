Crystals of calcium oxalate  form in higher plants in species-specific anatomical and  developmental patterns, indicating that their formation is  biologically controlled.  Crystals generally form within the  vacuole in association with an organic matrix, which  accumulates prior to crystal formation and provides cellular  control over the crystallization process.  The long term  goals of the proposed research are to understand what  induces particular cells to form crystals, and how the  organic matrix controls the crystal development.  Because  expression of the organic matrix is a key event in crystal  initiation and differentiation, the proposed studios focus  on the organic matrix associated with crystal formation in  Vitis labrusca leaves.  In particular, research is aimed in  characterizing proteins in membrane enclosures which  surround developing crystals.  These membrane enclosures  form prior to crystal initiation, and are in direct contact  with the crystal s during development.  In the proposed  research polyclonal antibodies will be used that were  developed against membrane envelope proteins in rabbits.  The specific objectives of the research are: 1) to identify  and characterize immunoreactive proteins in the membrane  enclosures, and 2) to determine the specificity of  antibodies for these proteins and for the membrane  envelopes.  Antibodies produced against the membrane  proteins are used to isolate the individual protein  components.  The isolated proteins will be subjected to  amino-terminal sequencing and their sequence compared with  other protein sequences already present in data banks. The  specificity of the proteins will be examined by  immunoblotting crude protein extracts and solubilized  membrane envelope proteins, as well as by  immunoelectonmicroscopy.  %%%  Biomineralization is an important process both in plants and  animals.  Presently little is known of ho w crystals are  initiated in plants, and about their growth.  The proposed  research deals primarily with fundamental problems of cell  differentiation and calcium regulation in plant growth and  development.  It has also broad relevance outside this area  as wll, and will provide information about the mechanisms of  biomineralization in plants and other organisms.  ***",
