 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403924  Wang/Lin       Two major areas within nonlinear control theory will be  pursued in this investigation. The first is related to stability  and stabilizability of control systems, and the second to  observability and reachability. Within the area of stability, the  research program will rely upon the integration of three closely  related topics with the ultimate goal of developing an  understanding of the effect of disturbances on control design.  The first topic focuses on the analysis of the stability of  general dynamical systems through an analysis of the structure of  reachable sets and their prolongations, so that a converse  Lyapunov function for general dynamical systems can be developed.  The second topic concerns so-called input-to-state stability, and  the third topic concerns the development of universal formulae  for designing explicit stabilizing feedback laws. The main goal  in the second major area of this investigation is to analyze the  relationship between different representations of systems.  Attention will be focused on clarifying the connections between  different notions and results related to observability which have  been developed within the frameworks of differential algebra and  differential geometry. Also to be investigated are conditions  under which a state space system admits integral input/output  equations.       Roughly speaking, control theory concerns itself with  changing the behavior of dynamical systems so as to meet desired  performance objectives. The analysis and design of control  systems play fundamental roles in manufacturing automation and  many other applications. The main issues addressed in this  research deal with the problem of stability of control systems  subject to disturbances, that is, with the question of how to  assure that the quantities of interest ultimately behave in an  appropriate manner regardless of the specific nature of the  disturbances acting on the system, and with identification of  systems, that is, with the questi on of how to obtain models of  the system, or \"plant\", on the basis of data obtained from  observations of its operation.  ***",
