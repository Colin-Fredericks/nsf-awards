 "awd_abstract_narration": "Normalization, matching, and unification are three   computational steps found in virtually all symbolic   computation  systems.  Applications of these operations include term  rewriting,   functional, equational  and logic programming  languages, abstract data type   specification and  verification,  automated deduction, code generation, type   inferencing, and  computer algebra.  This project addresses these problems in   computing and the means to design and  analyze efficient   algorithms for them.  Practical algorithms are designed on both sequential and   parallel machines.  Algorithms  which learn efficiently from their history are   designed for  normalization with respect to several important and useful    classes of rewrite  systems.  Several facets of matching and  unification   problems are studied  from a novel perspective.  Algorithms that correlate   information from previous  match/unify  operations are designed for tree pattern   matching and its  interpreted versions, and subterm unification and  its    interpreted versions.  The practical performance of these  algorithms is   investigated.  This  research is useful in enhancing the efficiency of symbolic   systems as well as provide understanding of the inherent    complexities of these  operations.",
