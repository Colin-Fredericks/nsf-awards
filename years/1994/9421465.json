The CSTB organizes a  multi-stage  convening activity for academia, business, and industry to consider  the deployment of technologies and services expected for the near-  term national information infrastructure (NII), their relationships  to key applications which are representative of those under the NII  umbrella, and their anticipated degree of interoperability.   Activities under this project include an initial workshop to  structure the kinds of information on which common understanding is  desired, a solicitation of white papers to explore industry,  technology, and applications perspectives based on the outcome of  the initial workshop, convening of a larger forum to air and  discuss perspectives presented in the white papers, and a synthesis  of the insights from all these activities and from related reports  generated by others into a succinct summary to inform the  development of the initial phase of the NII  roadmap  development.",
