The project (1) identifies indicators within and  beyond the framework of the concern-based adoption model (CBAM)  that measure the extent of institutionalization of exemplary  elementary science programs and apply the identified indicators to  a study of a SCIS-based program maintained within the Frederick  County (MD) Public Schools for twenty years (2) implements teacher  enhancement activities within these schools based upon findings  from this study, and (3) uses these indicators to evaluate the  impact of the enhancement activities and to allow the school system  to continuously monitor and respond to its teacher enhancement  needs.    Eighteen weeks of training are provided to seven science  specialists and nine weeks to thirty school-based lead teachers.   Project staff and these trained specialists and lead teachers  provide training to the remaining 710 teachers in the county based  upon their identified needs.  Insights are obtained on activities  that effectively maintain elementary science programs in schools.  ***",
