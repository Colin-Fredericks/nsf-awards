Normal Form and Symmetry, and C). KP Hierarchy and Related Topics  in Physics and Mathematics. In project A, the main purpose is to  analyze and control soliton solutions in nearly integrable  systems, and the goal is to design and determine a most feasible  model for a long-distance and high-bit-rate communication system  using soliton. In project B, the goal is to reformulate the  normal form theory of Poincare-Dulac-Birkhoff for nearly  integrable system in terms of symmetries of the leading order  integrable system. In project C, the emphasis is to apply  solution methods developed in the KP and dispersionless KP  theories to the field of conformal field theory. These projects  contain several new directions of the theory of integrable  systems.  Recent progress on the theory of integrable systems  seems to be demonstrated by finding its applications in several  different fields of research, such as high energy physics,  classical and quantum field theories, nonlinear optics, and  representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebra. This  expanding area of applications provides a wide variety of studies  in applied mathematics, and promotes a progress on  interdisciplinary fields which are the most inportant aspects of  modern science. The proposed research directly relates with these  area of reseach, and I believe that the projects will make  several contributions to education in the field of applied  mathematics and to development of human resources in science and  engineering.",
