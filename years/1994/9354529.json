 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354529  Derry  Literacy and informed decision making in an uncertain world require the  ability to reason statistically. However, research indicates that  although conceptions of statistics and probability have steadily  advanced within scientific and mathematical communities, adults in  mainstream American society cannot think probabilistically or  statistically about important societal issues. This project therefore  presents a novel undergraduate course targeting students who are  considering a career in teaching. The course is designed to help  students employ statistical concepts as tools for social reasoning  within simulations of real-world problem situations. Reusable  instructional materials are being designed and will be disseminated to  assist faculty at other universities who wish to offer the course.  The course will also interact with the community, focus on cultural  diversity, and is expected to achieve a high degree of authenticity  through simulations of realistic social problem solving.",
