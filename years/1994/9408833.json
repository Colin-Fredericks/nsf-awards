 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 94-08833  Spee    This collaborative research grant supplements Grant No. ECS-  93-01168  (\"Intelligent Control of Complex Nonlinear Systems with  Electric Power Application\"), which is studying Flexible AC  Transmission Systems (FACTS) in an effort also supported by  the Electric Power Research Institute and the Bonneville  Power Administration.  The current grant provides partial  support for a U.S. researcher, Dr. Rene Spee, of the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oregon  State University, to spend six months at University of  Stellenbosch, South Africa, to investigate a \"next  generation\" FACTS device which utilizes force commutated  power converter technology.  Activities proposed include  design, modeling and evaluation of this \"Unified Power  Controller\" with an emphasis on device performance in power  systems representative of the western United States and  Southern Africa.  The South African partner is Dr. Johan H.  R. Enslin, of the Department of Electrical and Electronic  Engineering.  The work at University of Stellenbosch is  supported by the South African national utility, ESKOM.  The  collaboration includes a six-month stay at Oregon State U.  by the South African partner, with partial support from the  South African Foundation for Research Development.    This collaboration promises benefits to both institutions,  which have ongoing research projects on system and device  level control of FACTS, and to the power needs of both  countries.  Devices and control strategies not previously  investigated in depth for the western North American power  system will be evaluated in a system setting very similar to  the US, thus speeding possible application and reducing  development cost.  The South African utility is interested  in the potential of FACTS for a number of reasons,  including: use in ESKOM's rural electrification program, as  a technology for improving quality of supply, and as a  solution for present stability problems.  ***",
