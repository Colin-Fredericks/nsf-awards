 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adams  9404992  The study of enzymes isolated from organisms inhabiting  unconventional ecosystems has led to the realization that  biocatalysis need not be constrained to mild conditions and can be  considered at pH's, temperatures, pressures, ionic and solvent  environments long though to be destructive to biological systems.   However, the intrinsic basis for biological function under such  extreme conditions is only starting to be addressed, as are  applications for what can be called extremozymes.  In addition to  expanding the search for novel and interesting enzymes from extreme  environments, it is important to bring to bear the current  sophistication in the study of protein structure and function.   Also, those familiar with potential uses of biocatalysis must  become more aware of the opportunities and challenges associated  with the identification study of extremozymes.  Ultimately, given  the information acquired from the study of extremozymes,  modification to less stable enzymes to improve their ranges of  stability and activity remains a possibility.  %%%  This workshop will bring together representatives from academia,  government and industry to provide a perspective on extremozymes  and their place in modern biocatalysis.  Contributions will cover  both fundamental and applied aspects in an effort to describe  exciting developments in progress as well as to identify potential  opportunities for the use of biological catalysts under extreme  conditions.  ***",
