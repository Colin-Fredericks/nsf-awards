 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321572  Hanken         This proposal outlines a series of descriptive and  experimental studies that examine the hormonal mediation of  embryonic development in direct-developing anurans. Precocious  activity of the thyroid axis is frequently cited as the mechanism  underlying direct development, but this has never been fully  examined. To test this hypothesis, initial appearance and  subsequent development of the thyroid axis in a direct-developing  frog will be compared to the patterns observed in metamorphosing  frogs. The role of thyroid hormones (TH) in mediating direct  development will also be evaluated experimentally by manipulating  endogenous hormone levels.       Methods include histology (to document thyroid gland and  median eminence formation), radioimmunoassay (to determine TH  levels through embryonic development), immunocytochemistry (to  examine the ontogeny of thyrotropic cells and TH receptor  expression), and hormone manipulation (to experimentally examine  the roles of TH in direct development). Analyses will focus on  embryos of the direct developing frog Eleutherodactylus coqui  (Leptodactylidae) derived from an established breeding colony.  For comparative purposes, analyses will also include several  metamorphosing species, including Leptodactylus albilabris  (Leptodactylidae), Bombina orientalis (Discoglossidae), and  Xenopus laevis (Pipidae).       Results will contribute to our understanding of the  endocrine mediation of direct development in amphibians. They  also will provide new information on the mechanistic basis  underlying life-history evolution. In addition, this study will  examine maternal provisioning of hormones in early embryogenesis  and development, a process relevant to understanding early  development in all classes of vertebrates.  ***",
