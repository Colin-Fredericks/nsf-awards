 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314725  Christensen  This is an award to support research to find effective  methods for determining the sources of diffuse aquatic  pollutants.  The investigator plans on developing a chemical  mass balance model and factor analysis models for analyzing  sedimentary records of pollutants including consideration of  errors in both the measured historical record of a substance  and its known source functions. The models will be evaluated  using existing data sets for sediment-associated deposits of  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in existing dated sediment  cores and polychlorinated biphenyls in sediments from  freshwater Lake Michigan estuaries.  In addition, an  experimental program will be conducted focusing on  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated dibenzo-  p-dioxines in Lake Michigan, Green Bay and the lower Fox  River of Wisconsin.    The goal of this project is to develop source-attribution  methods for potential use in management of aquatic water  quality.  These methods, previously extensively used in  characterizing sources of air pollutants, may prove  especially effective in dealing with non-point sources of  pollution.  While point-sources of water pollution are  generally readily identifiable, non-point sources such as  those attributable to deposition from the atmosphere are  not.  Results of this research are expected to lead to  improved models that can be utilized in engineering design  of pollution control facilities and remediation of polluted  aquatic resources.    ***",
