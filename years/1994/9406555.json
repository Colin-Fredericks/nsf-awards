 "awd_abstract_narration": "Switching from vegetative (indeterminate) to reproductive  (determinate) growth is a major transition in the  development of the shoot in higher plants.  This transition  occurs at the shoot apical meristem, the region that  initiates primordia that differentiate as leaves separated  by stem tissue during vegetative development or as floral  organs during reproductive development.  The timing of this  transition has profound effects on the architecture of the  shoot, as well as influencing yield in crop plants.  The  mechanism regulating the transition to flowering is  beginning to be understood in plants in which the transition  occurs in response to environmental cues.  However, many  other plants flower in a variety of environments.  In these  plants it is believed that the primary determinant of the  timing of the transition from vegetative growth to flowering  is a developmental program, of which little is known.  The  objective of the experiments proposed here is to examine  various aspects of the developmental program underlying the  switch to flowering in a plant of the latter group, maize.  The meristem receives information from elsewhere in the  plant and responds by either continuing leaf initiation  (indeterminate) or becoming determined for determinate  growth and forming an inflorescence, the tassel.  This  investigator will examine potential sources for that  information by organ culture techniques.  These experiments  will lay the groundwork for the eventual identification of  the signals that inform meristems of their progress through  ontogeny, which results in the precise regulation of the  morphology of maize shoots.  The maize vegetative shoot  apical meristem has been deduced to be organized in tiers,  in which typically the lowermost cells (at the periphery) of  the meristem will give rise to the first-formed nodes of the  plant, midmeristem cells to the later nodes, and upper cells  to the top of the plant.   Cells most likely to participate  in the formation of reproduct ive structures are located in  the apex of the meristem.  Resetting of the meristem by  excision and culture results in more nodes being formed by  the meristem than would normally occur.  An inevitable  result of this is a change in the contribution of at least  some cells in the meristem to the shoot.  This investigator  will use clonal analysis to determine the origin within the  meristem of the extra nodes of reset plants.  This  information will be useful for understanding the flexibility  of cells within a meristem with respect to the portions of  the plant to which they will contribute and the nature of  the reorganization that takes place as a meristem is reset  by excision and culture.  This may also have practical  implications for transformation of maize via the shoot  meristem.  Experiments are also planned to examine the  molecular nature of the resetting of the shoot's  developmental program by culturing plants carrying a  photosynthetic mutation that can become suppressed through  the course of normal development of a shoot.  These  experiments are expected to provide insight into normal  changes at the level of gene expression in differentiation  of successive nodes as part of the developmental program of  the plant.",
