 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Technical abstract:   This project will address two scientific  issues: anomalous heat flow in  very dilute superfluid helium  mixtures, and convection in superfluid helium mixtures.  The  objective of the anomalous heat flow study is to understand  experimental observations of a finite thermal conductivity of  superfluid mixtures as the helium 3 concentration goes to zero.  These observations conflict with theory that predicts that the  thermal conductivity approaches infinity as the helium three  concentration goes  to zero.  The work will use alternating current  techniques in order to separate fluid and other heat flow paths,  providing information on the boundary resistance. The objective of  the convection study  is to characterize convective flows in  superfluid mixtures. The experimental techniques will yield pattern  and heat flow data which pertain to a broad range of Prandtl  numbers. The issues to be investigated concern  Rayleigh-Benard  convection patterns and spatio-temporal chaos, instabilities of  pattern forming systems, and chaotic states.    Non-technical abstract:  Convection and heat flow will be  investigated in mixtures of helium 3 in superfluid helium 4.  Superfluid helium 4 is interesting from a technical viewpoint,  because its effectively infinite heat conductivity makes it an  outstanding fluid for extracting heat from cooled electronic  devices.  It is aimed to potentially reduce limits to heat flow in  this system caused by the naturally present helium 3.  It is also  planned to characterize nonlinear dynamics and chaos in convecting  helium.  Convection occurs in the environment (atmosphere, ocean,  technical processes), and it is an outstanding system for studying  the broader topic on nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation.  Superfluid mixtures have similar properties to liquid metals and  semiconductors, and a better understanding of the convection in  helium is potentially relevant to purifying these materials.",
