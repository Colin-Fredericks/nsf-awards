The workshop  will help to implement a sustainable development  initiative for the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin (SDI).   The SDI project involves five U.S. and Mexican basin  institutions seeking to encourage improved management  of the region's water resources and development  options by establishing a network of regional groups  responsible for water management and economic  development.  The objective of the workshop is to  develop a detailed plan of action for implementing the  findings and recommendations resulting from previous  work of the participants.  The planned document should  serve as the foundation for the future establishment  of a coordinated research and policy development  program for the basin.       A key problem in the region is the frequency of  drought and other stressful water-related events.   With the worsening depletion of ground water,  pollution from mining activity, transfers of water  rights from irrigation to municipalities and  accelerating industrial development, water problems  are likely to become more severe.  A basin wide  community-based approach to these challenges is vital  for the creation of sustainable responses to growth  and change.  The SDI project aims to provide a long-  lasting agenda for this approach.      ***",
