 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355625  Cassady    The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is developing a new permanent  12,000 square-foot gallery, \"The Wet, Wild, Wonderful World of  Science: A Science Gallery That Connects Kids to Their World.\"  Water is the catalyst for the exploration and discovery of science  concepts throughout the gallery.  Within the gallery are three hub  context areas (Pipes and Pumps, Streams and Ponds,Tubes and Flasks)  that are closely linked, both conceptually and physically.  The  message is that the concepts introduced in one hub also apply to  the others, thus erasing artificial distinctions between natural  and physical sciences.         The goals of the project are:         To create a gallery that will make science accessible to the       museum's current and underserved visitors.         To create hands-on opportunities for young people to practice       scientific thinking so they may better understand the physical       and natural world.         To create a science education experience that promotes       linkages for visitors between the learning of science in the       gallery and formal and informal learning outside of the       museum.         To research the application of constructivist theory in the       design of hands-on exhibits.  ***",
