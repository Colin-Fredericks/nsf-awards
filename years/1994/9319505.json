Collins, Chemistry Department, Carnegie  Mellon University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  research into the development and chemistry of stable high valent mid- and late- transition metal complexes. Through ligand modification, alkane soluble oxidants will be prepared. A series of water soluble or polymer attached high valent cobalt, copper, and nickel oxidants will be developed as potential replacements for commercially used, but toxic, Cr(VI) reagents. As there is evidence that Cr(V) will induce DNA damage, the role of this species as a carcinogen and mutagen will be evaluated. Finally, a  series of Cu(IV) and Ni(IV) complexes will be developed as two electron reductant and the feasibility of producing Cu(V) and Ni(V) species will be explored.  A wide variety of oxidants, compounds which transfer one or more electrons to another species in a chemical reaction, are used routinely in all areas of chemistry. In this project new oxidants will be developed which will be more efficient, easier to use, and environmentally more friendly than the ones which are currently employed. As chromium is commonly used in oxidations, the interactions of DNA with one important form of this element will be evaluated. Overall this project will contribute to design of new reagents which are easier to use, not as toxic, and less polluting than those which are now being used.",
