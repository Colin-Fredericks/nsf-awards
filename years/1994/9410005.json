A dramatic reduction in   environmental impact can be made by product reuse in which, in   contrast to material recycling, the geometrical form of the product   is retained and its associated economical and environmental value   is preserved.  However, attempts to generate formal and systematic   design approaches which include environmental considerations such   as reusability as well as economical, mechanical and other design   considerations break down when confronted with the need to quantify   environmental properties and requirements.  In this research the  objective is to identify efficient and  effective metrics for  quantifying and enhancing reusability in  design.  In order to  achieve this objective, reusability metrics are postulated based on  life cycle factors affecting reusability of engineering systems.   A validation strategy is developed to determine the correctness and  validity of these metrics.  Among others, the postulated metrics  are verified using historical design and service data from  cooperating industrial partners. Uncertainty and variability are  key aspects which are taken into account as well.       Design of environmentally benign products is an area of  critical national importance.  Successful research results could be  used by the industrial design community to improve the product  development activities.  The project has strong industrial support.",
