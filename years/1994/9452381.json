Applications of mathematics, visualization of data and functions,  and exploration of models and simulations area being investigated  in the facility. The University is providing a dedicated and  remodelled classroom for this laboratory.  This facility is vital  to the Department's planned calculus and undergraduate mathematics  reform and to the design of computer-aided courses and instruction.  The institution is currently planning for a complete restructure of  the present Calculus courses as well as significant changes in  Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Applied Mathematical  Modelling, Numerical Analysis, Probability, and Statistics  instruction. All of the Calculus classes are being held in the  laboratory on a daily to weekly basis, enabling students to  experiment with mathematical ideas, concepts, and realistic  applications as they evolve from the lectures. Traditional lectures  are being supplemented and often replaced as students now use the  computer and powerful symbolic, numeric, and graphic software  packages to illustrate key ideas. The interactive nature between  written lecture and computer-aided instruction is a crucial aspect  of this approach.",
