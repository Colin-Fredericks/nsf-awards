The  Northridge  earthquake in Los Angeles affected housing units in thousands  of  buildings.  The majority of these units were in apartments.  This  research  will  assess the number and type  of  units  lost,  the  ability  of owners to repair or replace affected units,  and  the  ability  of  the displaced tenants to find short  and  long  term  housing  alternatives.  To assess housing losses the  researchers  will  analyze data on damaged buildings assembled by the City  of  Los  Angeles.  To understand the impact on building  owners,  the  researchers will assess the number of units repaired or  replaced  one  year  after  the  event.  And to understand  the  impact  on  tenants,  the  researchers will analyze the short and  long  term  housing availability for displaced tenants.  ***",
