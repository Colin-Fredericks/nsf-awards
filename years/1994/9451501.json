 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451501  Pavia  This proposal introduces molecular modeling and computational  chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum beginning with first  year chemistry and progressing with increasing degrees of  sophistication in higher level courses. In the first year students  will be concerned principally with model building and the testing  of common bonding theory (VSEPR and VB). For organic chemistry,  conformational analysis, reaction modeling, and reaction dynamics  would be introduced judiciously via force-field and molecular  orbital and MOPAC calculations. In the third year for the  integrated inorganic/physical laboratory, students would model  zeolites and learn applications of MO theory to inorganic and  organometallic compounds. Biochemistry students would also be  introduced to the use of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank files.  They would also be taught to model docking operations at an active  site and to evaluate potential substate antagonists by least  squares fitting routines.  It is our belief that molecular modeling  will have far reaching pedagogic consequences because of its  predictive abilities and superb graphics and belongs in the  undergraduate curriculum. This proposal, if funded, will provide  for six molecular modeling workstations to be used in the  environment of an open computer lab.",
