 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315027  Lessard  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short,  but intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  The focus of this proposal is the role of  microzooplankton in controlling the production and fate of carbon  during the two types of blooms.  Objectives are: 1) to determine  biomass, abundance, size and selected species composition of  primary producer assemblages, 2) to determine similar features of  nano- and microplanktonic heterotrophic assemblages, 3) to  measure total community grazing on heterotrophic bacteria and  phytoplankton, 4) to examine which grazers are the major  herbivores and bacterivores, and 5) to measure the contribution  of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton egesta, sinking of algal  cells and colonies, and sinking of protozoan assemblages  associated with detritus to the total carbon flux from the  euphotic zone through 250 m depth.  Water samples for abundance  and biomass determinations will be taken and samples will be  examined with epifluorescence microscopy.  Grazing rates will be  measured using the dilution grazing technique and the dual-  isotope radiolabeling single cell method.  Carbon fluxes will be  determined on sinking material collected with particle  interceptor traps at the base of the euphotic zone and two deeper  depths, using microscopical analys is.  An understanding of these  processes and other fundamental processes studied by  collaborating investigators will contribute to the understanding  of the role of the Southern Ocean in present, past and predicted  future sequestration of carbon, as well as in other global  elemental cycles.",
