 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317901  Harwood  This award supports a study of fossiliferous glacial erratics  from the McMurdo Sound region.  This work will help to establish  the record of Eocene, and possibly Cretaceous, marine and  terrestrial biota on the margin of the Victoria Land basin.  The  Eocene is poorly known from Antarctica, represented only by  outcrops in the Antarctic Peninsula and by glacial sediments  recovered near Prydz Bay.  Fossils known to be present in the  erratics include leaves, wood, organic mats, and marine  invertebrates.  The goal is to study the included fossils to  determine paleontological ages of the sedimentary rocks and to  find clues to the paleoenvironmental conditions.  Specifically,  documentation of the fauna and flora in these erratics will allow  better understanding of marine and terrestrial biological and  ecological systems during the early Cenozoic and will provide a  basis for comparison of the Ross Ice Shelf region with lower  latitude sites in the Southern Ocean.  This work will also help  form a framework for interpretation of early Cenozoic  paleoenvironments in drill core from the Cape Roberts region that  is anticipated in the near future.  ***",
