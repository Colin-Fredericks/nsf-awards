 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years it has become increasingly recognized that  brominated compounds (BrC's) in the atmosphere may play a  significant role in stratospheric ozone depletion, especially in  the Antarctic and Arctic regions.  Most of the attention, to date,  concerning stratospheric ozone depletion has centered on the role  of chlorinated compounds (ClC's), due in part to their relatively  high concentrations in the troposphere, now totaling well over a  part per billion (mole ratio).  One of the greatest challenges  associated with atmospheric studies of the BrC's is related to  their relatively low concentrations in the troposphere, typically  in the low or sub parts per trillion range.  The BrC's are  therefore relatively difficult to detect and quantitatively analyze  in atmospheric samples that invariably contain a large excess of  other organic compounds, including the ClC's.  In this research, a  new instrument, will be applied to the analysis of BrC's in  atmospheric samples.  This instrument is called the SiF4-doped  Photodetachment-Modulated Electron Capture Detector (SiF4-PDMECD)  and has been shown to provide sensitive responses to BrC's, but  does not respond to ClC's or other organic compounds.  In this  project, the SiF4-PDMECD will be evaluated specifically for the  analysis of BrC's in the atmosphere and will thereby provide the  field of atmospheric chemistry with an additional and very possibly  a superior analysis capability for future investigations of the  atmospheric chemistry of brominated compounds.",
