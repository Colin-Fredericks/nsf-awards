In terms  of basic science, research is likely to shed light on two specific  areas.  First, this research will provide the first insights into  the response of natural plant populations to increasing UV-B  radiation.  The research will determine if genes for UV-B tolerance  are fixed within natural populations or if there is variation for  this trait that would allow for the evolution of more tolerant  genotypes.  Second, basic questions concerning the population  biology of Arabidopsis will be addressed.  The investigators will  determine the number and frequencies of the genotypes within this  population and identify the phenotypic traits that distinguish  these genotypes in the field.  The research will provide insight  into how these genotypes arise and how are they maintained.         The significance of this research to applied biology is clear.   Two of the proposed experiments will contribute to knowledge of  plant UV-B protective mechanisms.  It is important to identify the  traits that protect plants from UV-B radiation and to understand  the mode of inheritance of these traits.  Once this is known, this  information can be incorporated into conventional breeding  practices and minimize the potential impacts of UV-B damage.",
