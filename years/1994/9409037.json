 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409037  Gardner       This project is funded jointly by the Applied Mathematics  Program and the Geometric Analysis Program. Its goal is to  construct and apply new invariants, structure theorems and normal  forms of control systems under time-independent, time-dependent,  and dynamic feedback. The tools involve the method of equivalence  as refined by the principal investigator, exterior differential  systems, and the theory of infinite pseudogroups. An important  principle is the enlargement of the notion of feedback  equivalence to the fully nonlinear category. This program has  resulted in major improvements in exact linearization algorithms.  Similar ideas will be used to investigate algorithms for other  applicable normal forms such as standard bilinear systems. A new  concept of control structure, a more global viewpoint of  nonsingular control systems, will also be investigated.       The theory of feedback control systems, originally motivated  by problems in engineering, occupies a central place in applied  mathematics and is fundamental to control engineering  applications. This project will develop the geometric foundations  that underlie the dynamics of high-performance automatic control  systems. It focuses primarily on systems that have highly  nonlinear dynamics and which may have many interconnected  components influencing each other. The engineering demands for  ever higher performance, or even optimality, often require  completely new control designs since classical linearization  techniques for control design is often inadequate in such  situations. By employing techniques from various areas of pure  mathematics, such as differential geometry, major improvements in  exact linearization algorithms, with applications to nonlinear  autopilot design, for example, are expected.",
