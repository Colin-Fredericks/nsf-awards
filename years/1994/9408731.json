 "awd_abstract_narration": "Populations of stem cells exist in many organisms.  Their  most significant attribute is that they replenish themselves  as well as give rise to many terminally differentiated cell  types.  In plants, the meristems or growing tips of roots or  shoots are groups of stem cells.  Shoot apical meristems in  angiosperm plants are formed during embryogenesis and are  comprised of a small number of undifferentiated, dividing  cells.  These cells will give rise to all of the above-  ground portions of the plant.  Thus, understanding the  developmental biology of shoot apical meristems is  absolutely fundamental to understanding plant growth and  development.  How is the shoot apical meristem initiated  during embryogenesis?  How are additional meristems  initiated postembryonically in the axils of leaves?  How is  a group of undifferentiated, dividing cells maintained in  the meristem?  How are the positions of organs generated by  the meristem determined?  The long term goal of this study  is to answer these questions in molecular detail.  The small  cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been chosen as an  experimental organism -- its short generation time and small  genome size make it especially well suited for molecular  genetic analysis.  The focus of this project is the shoot  meristemless (STM) locus.  Seedlings homozygous for a loss-  of-function mutation in this gene lack a shoot apical  meristem but are otherwise normal.  Careful morphological  examination of homozygous stm-1 mutants has shown that the  defect lies in their inability to initiate a shoot apical  meristem during embryogenesis.  Evidence that the STM gene  corresponds to an Arabidopsis homolog of the maize Knotted  gene is presented.  This gene encodes a homeodomain  containing protein and therefore probably acts as a  transcriptional regulator.  Although homeodomain proteins  have been identified in plants previously, this is the first  case in which a loss-of-function mutation has been  identified in such a gene and hence  its wild-type function  deduced.  To understand how STM promotes shoot apical  meristem formation, experiments are proposed that are  designed to shed light on how the STM gene is regulated and,  in the long term, to identify genes that STM in turn  regulates.",
