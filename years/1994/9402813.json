Using the aphid Schizaphis graminum ( greenbud) we have found that its endosymbiont (Buchnera aphidicola) has all of the genes of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway and the trpEG (genes for anthranilate synthase, the first enzyme of the pathway) is amplified on a plasmid. These results are consistent with past observations indicating that the endosymbiont synthesizes tryptophan which is utilized by the aphid host.  Preliminary results have indicated that, in the distantly related endosymbiont of the aphid Schlectendalia chinensis, tryEG has a chromosomal location.  We intend to continue this research by examining the  gene organization of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in the endosymbiont of this aphid species and making a survey to determine the distribution of gene amplification of chromosomal location of trpEG in the endosymbionts of other aphid species.  The first reaction which initiates the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) as well as folic acid is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase.  We intend to determine if this gene is located on a plasmid, on the chromosome or if there are isofunctional DAHP synthases.  This will be accomplished by restriction enzyme and Southern blot analysis as well as the cloning and sequencing of the gene(s) for the enzyme(s).  Comparisons will be made with the gene organization in E. coli and other organisms.  In most prokaryotes the genes for ribosomal RNA are arranged as a single transcription unit in the order 16S, and 5S rRNAs.  We have shown that B.  aphidicola has only one copy of the 16S 23s rRNA gene and is unusual in that it is unlinked to the other rRNA genes.  We will continue this study by examining the organization of the 23S and 5S rRNA genes in B. aphidicola.  The genes will be cloned, sequenced, and the up stream and downstream regions compared to the putative promoter and terminator of the B.aphidicola 16S rRNA transcription unit. In their most active stage of growth aphids reproduce by parthenogenesis giving birth to live yound.  Nothing is known concerning the number of endosymbionts during the growth cycle of the aphid.  Using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction we will determine the number of copies of 16S and 23S rRNA genes in the B. aphidicola-aphid DNA preparations during the aphid growth cycle.  The results will be an indication of the number of endosymbionts.   Using immunological methods we will determine the amount of several essential endosymbiont consitutents.  This includes ribosomes (ribosomal protein S1), RNA polymerase (beta-subunit), sigma factor and GroEL.   %%%  The results obtained from these studies may be of use for the eventual control of aphid populations by manipulation of the endosymbionts which are essential for their survival.  ***",
