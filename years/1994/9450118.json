 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular arrangement in a liquid crystal (LC) film differs in  the bulk compared to surfaces and interfaces.  An LC film deposited  onto a grooved substrate experiences a competition between the  aligning forces at the LC-air interface, which force the molecules  to align normal to the surface, and aligning forces at the LC-  substrate interface, which forces the molecules to align parallel  to the plane of the substrate.  In previous studies on smectic A  liquid crystal films, a critical thickness was measured beyond  which the long-range aligning forces from the groove interface  dominate over the short-range aligning forces imposed by the air-LC  interface.  There is a range in thicknesses, which spans  approximately 10um, where the competition between short-range and  long-range aligning forces is most pronounced. The aligning forces  are responsible for many pretransitional phenomena as well as  surface memory effects inside the films.  In this project, the  unstable region just above the critical thickness in smA droplets  will be studied as a function of temperature to ascertain the  interplay between short and long range aligning forces.  Attention  will be paid to the region immediately above the LC-solid substrate  interface.    Interactive activities consist of the following:  (1) teaching a  graduate course in liquid crystal physical properties, taught as  part of the Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary program at Kent  State University; and (2) organizing outreach activities for high  school students and first and second year college students.  This  second activity will include visits to area schools as well as the  development of demonstration kits.  A major goal is to convey the  interdisciplinary nature of liquid crystal research and of science  in general.",
