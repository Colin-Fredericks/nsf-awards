The central question addressed by this proposal is whether language  differences in speech perception are linked to language differences  in coarticulatory structure. The specific hypothesis to be tested  is that language-specific patterns of coarticulation give rise to  listener expectations concerning the acoustic consequences of  coarticulation; such expectations in turn lead to language-specific  patterns of perceptual accommodation to coarticulated speech. The  cross-language acoustic and perceptual data to be collected here  are relevant to theoretical issues in speech perception and  language acquisition. Current models of speech perception differ in  whether the primatives of perception are auditory events or vocal-  tract gestures. A finding that compensatory context effects are  language-specific (and in turn linked to language-specific  coarticulatory patterns) would constrain possible models. It would  be argued against a purely auditory source for these effects, but  also against articulatory-gesture approaches which propose that the  acoustic signal provides sufficient information for the listener to  disentangle coarticulatory influences. Developmental models of  speech perception are more centrally concerned with the language-  specific reorganization of initial perceptual capabilities. Even if  the specific hypotheses concerning a coarticulation-perception link  are not upheld, the data will broaden knowledge of which perceptual  capabilities can be modified through linguistic experience and the  nature of the relevant experience.  ***",
