 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416160  Feng  The Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 caused severe  damage to many bridges including the disastrous collapse of  seven bridges.  Preliminary investigations have shown that  some collapses are due to inadequate seat widths at  superstructure hinges, although most of them had been  retrofitted using cable restrainers.    This project investigates the seismic performance of bridges  to determine whether energy dissipation systems can be  effectively used at bridge hinges and other possible bridge  locations for seismic damage reduction.    The objectives of this project are to:  1) extensively  investigate the performance of cable restrainers at bridge  hinge locations during the Northridge earthquake; 2) examine  the effectiveness of dampers as hinge restrainers through  analysis of bridge response to the ground motion (including  the vertical component); 3)examine the effectiveness of  dampers installed at bridge abutments and bent caps as  restraining devices; and 4) compare different damper devices  including viscous, viscoeleastic, friction, and steel  yielding dampers and recommend appropriate damper devices  and installment configurations suitable for bridge  applications.  A bridge model of Gavin Canyon Undercrossing  which collapsed during the Northridge earthquake will be  used for the analysis with the aid of the nonlinear analysis  computer code NEABS.    Engineers of California Department of Transportation  (Caltrans) offered their strong support to ensure the  results of this research will be utilized for retrofitting  and in the new design of their bridges.  Caltrans will  provide technical assistance and will make a highway bridge  located in seismic-prone San Bernando, California, available  for the PI to perform field testing of energy dissipation  systems to be recommended as a result of this research.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
