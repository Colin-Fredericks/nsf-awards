 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421593  Jirsa  This project will continue technical coordination for NSF  projects funded under the NSF Initiative on Repair and  Rehabilitation which was begun in 1990 when the first group of  proposals were funded. During the first four years of the  project, the coordinator has organized meetings of the Principal  Investigators and produced annual progress reports which have  been disseminated to all interested parties. In addition, several  technical sessions at national meetings and a number of  presentations have been made to publicize the research work.  These coordination activities will continue until the conclusion  of the five year program. A major remaining activity will be to  edit and produce a comprehensive technical summary document  containing contributions from all PI's. The summary document will  provide a single source reference for use by designers and others  interested in implementing the results of the program. The intent  is to develop a document which contains design requirements and  sufficient details for use in engineering practice.  ***",
