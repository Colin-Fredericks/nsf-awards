 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312825  Dick  This is an award to provide support for research, the objective  of which is to determine the source and fate of fine particles  emerging from wastewater and associated treatment processes as an  initial step toward improved process design and operation to  exercise control over these discharges.  The investigator plans  to develop procedures for tagging particles that enter the  process and tracing their path through the various unit  operations that comprise a wastewater treatment system.  Techniques for tracking the particles that will be investigated  include neutron activation, fluorescent marking, radiolabeling,  elemental and chemical analyses, particle size measurement and  microscopic examination.    Results of this project are expected to provide a better  understanding than now exists for the fate of fine particles that  are present in wastewater and those produced during the treatment  processes.  This improved understanding in turn is expected to  provide the basis for improvement of engineering design and  operation of processes and systems for wastewater treatment and  for managing the residual sludges derived from these treatment  processes.",
