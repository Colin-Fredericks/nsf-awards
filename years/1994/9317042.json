Specific objectives are  (1) to investigate the length dependence of the hydrodynamic  radius of DNA; (2) to determine the dynamic bending rigidity of  DNA and its dependence upon salt concentration, intercalator  binding, and other factors; (3) to complete construction of the  transient grating instrument; (4) to examine the effect of  bending strain upon the torsion constant and circular dichroism  spectrum by studying small DNAs before and after circularization,  and to study structural transitions induced by temperature in  those DNAs; (5) to examine the effects of Mg2+ ions upon the  structure of plasmids as a function of superhelix density; (6) to  study circular DNAs as a function of superhelix density to  observe and characterize the first transition to writhe; (7) to  apply a new Monte Carlo algorithm to generate canonically  distributed sets of tertiary configurations for circular DNAs  with fixed linking number, from which average static structure  factors and transnational diffusion coefficients are calculated,  and to calculate the differences in free energy between  topoisomers; (8) to determine the effect of anisotropy of the  bending potential upon the structure, distribution of torsional  strain, and free energy difference between topoisomers; and (9)  to examine the effect of the ordinary-extraordinary transition  upon the rotational dynamics of 150 bp DNAs.  %%%  In their natural setting, most DNAs are highly bent and/or  twisted, and there are many instances where this deformation is  achieved at considerable energy cost to the cell.  The reasons  why cells maintain their DNAs in such deformed states are stil l  unclear, although several hypotheses have been advanced.  One  speculation is that sufficient bending deformation may alter the  internal structure of the DNA (in a way that goes beyond simple  elastic strain), so that a new internal structure or combination  of structures results.  In this way, the properties of the DNA  could be altered, and thereby regulated, by the degree of  deformational strain.  The present work endeavors to investigate  this possibility in several ways.  In one experiment, both linear  and circular forms of the same short DNA are examined to  ascertain whether the internal structure is substantially altered  by the bending inherent in the circular molecule.  In another  experiment, the different responses of the DNA to very rapidly  and also very slowly varying bending forces are compared.  When  the bending forces fluctuate more rapidly than the changes in  internal structure can take place, the DNA appears stiffer than  it does in response to slowly varying (or permanent) bending  forces that allow sufficient time for changes in internal  structure to occur.  These experiments rely on sophisticated  optical measurements that are capable of determining the twisting  and bending rigidities of these molecules in very short times as  they move and spontaneously deform in solution.  In another  experiment, the responses of differently deformed DNAs to Mg2+  ions are investigated to better understand the roles of both Mg2+  and DNA deformation in controlling the internal structure and  overall conformation.  In this case extensive computer  simulations are required to interpret some of the optical data  pertaining to DNA conformations.  The results of this work  provide a foundation for understanding the manner in which DNA  deformation controls the internal structure and overall  conformation, and thereby regulates its interactions with various  proteins involved in the read-out of its genetic information.  ***",
