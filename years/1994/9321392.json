 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321392  Lund    This is a study of the zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst for the  chlorination of toluene.  Of the three possible monochlorination  products, p-chlorotoluene is the most valuable; in other reactions  involving alkylaromatics, ZSM-5 is selective for formation of the  para isomer.  In this work, a form of ZSM-5 in which iron cations  are present in ion-exchange positions of the zeolite is used.  The  first (chronologically) objective of the study is to determine  whether the catalyst deactivates under reaction conditions, and if  so, to measure the severity of the deactivation and determine its  origin.  The second objective is to probe the active site using  sorption capacity and selectivity, Mossbauer spectroscopy, infrared  spectroscopy of adsorbed species, transmission electron microscopy,  acidity measurements, chemical analysis, ion exchange, and other  techniques.  Catalysts are prepared with various degrees of  dehydration, location of iron, and silicon/aluminum ratios.   Reactor studies are performed to measure catalytic activity and  selectivity.  The third objective is to develop a mechanistic  microkinetic model of the reaction kinetics from steady-state and  transient kinetics measurements and temperature-programmed  desorption data.  The performance of ZSM-5 is compared  quantitatively to that of conventional Lewis-acid catalysts.    Chlorinations and related aromatic substitution reactions are  widely used in chemical manufacturing.  They are presently done  using relatively large amounts of inexpensive (and not very active)  catalysts that create large amounts of solid waste that is now  recognized to be an environmental problem.  This work aims to  replace such processes with ones that employ small amounts of more  active catalysts that are relatively benign environmentally.  ***",
