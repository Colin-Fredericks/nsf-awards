 "awd_abstract_narration": "McBrearty    With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Sally  McBrearty will continue archaeological research in the Baringo  Basin region of Kenya. In particular she will focus on the  Kapthurin Formation in the Tugen Hills. Previous archaeological  research in the area has yielded a stratified sequence of  archaeological sites as well as a small amount of hominid (human)  skeletal material. Building on previous work she will conduct  archaeological, geological and paleontological prospecting and  mapping. Limited excavation will also be carried out. Sediment  samples will be collected to determine age by means of argon  dating. Geochemical fingerprinting will serve to check on field  stratigraphic correlations and x-ray fluorescence analysis will  provide a technique to provenience surface fossils whose  stratigraphic position is unclear. Dr. McBrearty will use stone  artifacts and archaeological fauna in an attempt to reconstruct  human behavior. A number of techniques will be employed to  understand the fluxuating environment to which these hominids  adapted.    While a number of lines of evidence - archaeological,  paleontological and genetic - suggest that anatomically modern  humans first appeared in sub Saharan Africa just when and where  this occurred is unknown. What interests paleoanthropologists  most however is the process which lead to this emergence and here  also little evidence is available. Dr. McBrearty's research will  address this issue. Information to date suggests that the  transition took place during the Middle Pleistocene and the  Kapthurin Formation encompasses this time period. Prior work  indicates that it contains archaeological materials and fauna as  well as human remains. Dr. McBrearty's work will increase this  data base and bring a wide range of modern scientific techniques  to bear in order to make interpretations.    This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of Africa's past. It will provide data of  inter est to a large number of paleoanthropologists and shed new  light on the emergence of modern humans.",
