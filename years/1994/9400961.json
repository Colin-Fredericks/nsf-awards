 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400961  Sengupta       The project involves an investigation of several  mathematical problems arising from gauge theory (or Yang Mills  theory) on compact surfaces. The first project is to construct a  certain measure on an infinite dimensional non-linear space (of  certain geometric objects which represent the physical concept of  gauge fields); the next objective is to solve a number of  concrete problems related to this measure. Some of these  questions involve the \"moduli space of flat connections\", a space  whose structure has been of interest in mathematics from other  points of view and has involved deep questions.       Gauge theories are used to describe the interactions of the  fundamental constituents of matter. While these theories arise in  physics, they involve many elegant and deep geometric ideas in  mathematics. When combined with quantum field theory to obtain a  more realistic description of nature, gauge theories give rise to  more complex mathematical questions. Such questions are of  intrinsic mathematical value even in situations where there is no  immediate physical significance of the question. The present  proposal addresses mathematical problems of this nature. The  problems involve ideas from a variety of mathematical  disciplines, including topology, geometry and probability theory.  ***",
