Wear is expected to become the major cause of  artificial joint failure, requiring costly revision surgery  and inducing irreparable bone damage.  In order to  synthesize new  materials, or modify existing materials to  resist wear, the fundamental wear mechanisms must be  understood.  Polyethylene wear is integrally linked to the  condition of the articulating metal component, yet research  of metal component wear has been practically neglected.  Failure analysis of in vivo CoCr wear is an essential  element of this research.  Surface roughness measurements  will provide quantification of wear.  Scanning electron  microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, an x-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to investigate the  wear surface.  In vitro wear testing to investigate the  mechanisms of wear, and the effect of wear surfaces on the  integrity of artificial joints will be based on the failure  analyses.  ***",
