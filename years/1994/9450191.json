 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at analyzing and developing iterative  methods for solving the nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in  many areas of scientific computing.  Current iterative methods for  solving such problems ar sometimes effective but lack a firm  theoretical foundation and may not be robust.  Krylov space  methods, such as GMRES, will be analyzed and the idea of choosing  approximations from different spaces will also be considered.  The  biconjugate gradient and QMR algorithms will be related and an  attempt made to explain their success.  Potential for parallelism  in various algorithms will be studied and parallel implementations  will be developed for specific machine architectures.   Collaborations are planned with Nick Trefethen and others in the  Computer Science Department at Cornell.    Two main activities for interacting with students are:  teaching a  graduate seminar (\"CS 722\") on iterative methods and matrix  analysis, to familiarize students and other interested scientists  and the state of the art in this field; and introducing a sophomore  level practicum where, in conjunction with the numerical analysis  course CS 222, students will implement parallel numerical  algorithms on the machines available at the Cornell Theory Center.   Various undergraduate seminars will be organized related to this  activity.",
