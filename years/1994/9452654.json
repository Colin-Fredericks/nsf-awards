 "awd_abstract_narration": "National and global environmental effects of manufacturing  operations require the development of alternative, environmentally  benign technologies.  Although this is true in essentially all  industrial sectors, one of the greatest needs is in chemical  manufacturing.  This industrial sector is prominent in the American  economy, having consistently maintained a positive trade balance.   In order to preserve the dominance and global competitiveness of  this industry, however, it is recognized that the development and  implementation of waste-free environmentally benign processes are  needed.  Such environmentally conscious processing alternatives can  only result from the development of innovative technologies and  through the education and training of scientists and engineers who  can integrate technological advances and environmental  considerations with the goal of economic development.    Five doctoral traineeships in Environmentally Conscious Chemical  Manufacturing (ECCM) are requested in this proposal.  The training  program will be based on coursework and research leasing to the  conception of innovative technologies capable of reducing the  harmful environmental impact of chemical process operations.  This  training program emphasized pollution prevention, not waste  treatment or environmental restoration.  A diverse group of  students will be recruited for the proposed traineeships through  programs which can be effective in bringing women and minorities to  this critical area.",
