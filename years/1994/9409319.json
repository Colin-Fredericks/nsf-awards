 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop modular and  parallelizable algorithms for problems in adaptive filtering,  robust estimation, control, and structured matrix computations.  A  major motivation for this work is the need to properly identify,  model, and exploit convenient structures that might exist in a  particular problem in order to develop a computationally effective  solution.  An intrinsic and relevant part of the proposed work is  to first identify common ingredients, as well as to explicitly  clarify, the interrelations and interplays that exist among several  problems in the disciplines of control, signal processing, and  mathematics.    In this regard, the proposed research develops a unifying point of  view that simultaneously addresses a variety of seemingly unrelated  problems in estimation, control, adaptive filtering, and matrix  computations.  It shows that the solutions to many applications in  these areas turn out to share a key and surprisingly simple  ingredient, namely, that of computing the triangular factors of  matrices that exhibit structure.  The significance of this  particular fact and, more generally, of the proposed research as a  whole, is that it enables several well-understood concepts from  matrix theory and linear algebra to be applied in order to simplify  the derivation of a variety of algorithms, to propose new  computationally efficient variants, and to exploit new forms of  structure.    The proposed research consists of theoretical investigations and  algorithm implementations.  The techniques developed in this work  have applications in several areas including, among others, new  windowing schemes for adaptive RLS filtering, analysis of gradient-  based algorithms, and modular and square-root algorithms for  instrumental variable methods, robust estimation, and control.   Equally important is the development of a systematic and unifying  methodology.",
