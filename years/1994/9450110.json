 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a model of candidate evaluation.  The  important considerations, individual difference and contextual  variables, and cognitive processes of the model are specified.  The  basic components of the model are \"institution free\"; i.e., the  model is a general one that transcends any particular electoral  context.  A strategy will be developed for applying the model to  the presidential primary context using data from the American  National Election Studies of 1980, 1984, and 1988, and Thomas  Patterson's panel study of the 1976 election.  These data are  available through the ICPSR.  The new application of the model will  cover multi-candidate contexts, and thus will considerably advance  our understanding of vote choice processes across different  electoral arenas.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate course on  political applications of social and cognitive psychology; serving  as guest director of an interdisciplinary colloquium on political  psychology; engaging in collaborative research with several members  of the department; and presenting these results in a regular  departmental lecture series.",
