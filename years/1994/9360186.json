 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360186  Flusberg    Recently declassified military research has validated the applicability of artificial guide stars to  atmospheric compensation for astronomical observations.  Of the two alternative guide-star  techniques that have been demonstrated, the more promising is the laser-induced generation of  an artificial star in the sodium layer located at an altitude of 95 km.  The required laser power  depends strongly on the observation wavelength of the telescope.  It ranges from about 2 watts  in the infrared (2000 nm) to 300 watts in the visible (500 nm).  For a large, visible-light  telescope, a pulsed laser beam with approximately one joule of energy, repetitively pulsed at  several hundred hertz and tuned to the 589-nm sodium-D line is needed to generate a suitable  guide star.  To make this source acceptable to the astronomical community, such a laser should  be inexpensive, compact and reliable.  A flashlamp-pumped dye-laser system will be developed  for this application.  Recent advances in flashlamp-pumped dye-laser design have greatly  increased the achievable efficiency and beam quality, while recently developed all-solid-state  magnetic-compression-pulser technology that has demonstrated a lifetime of 7 x 1010 shots in  similar applications can be used to make pulsed dye laser much more compact and reliable.   These advances and recently developed dye-laser modeling codes will be used to design a guide-  star laser source.  ***",
