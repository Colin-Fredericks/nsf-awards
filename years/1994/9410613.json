 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410613  Chang       This research is focused on the development and use of a fuzzy  controller to address the problem of process design and control in  a short run production environment.  The controller will provide  recommendations on the choice of machine operating parameter in a  given production instance in order to produce a part of acceptable  quality.  Computer simulation will be used to test the controller  in the initial phase of the research.  Subsequently, data generated  from other currently existing models for process control purposes  will be used to test and fine-tune the performance of the  controller.  Upon the successful development of the controller,  sample parts will be designed and processed on computer numerical  control (CNC) machine to simulate a short run production  environment to further test the controller.  A second objective is  to develop a process monitoring approach that uses neural network  control chart (NNCC) to integrate observations from quality  characteristic and process related information to determine process  status.       The outcome of the research has some potential for industrial  application to improve process quality and process parameter  selection for short-run production situation.  The integration of  process control and process design provides opportunity for on-line  process monitoring for process data collection with the objective  of improving product quality through reduction in process  operational variation.",
