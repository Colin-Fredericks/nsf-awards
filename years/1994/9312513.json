 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312513  Poling    The successful description of phase equilibria in aqueous-weak  electrolyte systems requires an accurate description of the  liquid phase composition.  In models that are now used,  concentrations of all the ionic species in such a liquid phase  are calculated, but these calculated compositions are not based  on experimental determinations of true ionic compositions.  To  reliably evaluate existing models, and develop improved models,  experimental determinations of the liquid phase compositions  will be essential.    The goal of the proposed research is to determine the  concentrations of the ionic species in a typical aqueous-weak  electrolyte system.  Specifically, it is proposed to use carbon-  13 NMR to determine the concentrations of the carbonate,  bicarbonate, and carbamate ions in equilibrium in the liquid  phase for the CO2 -NH3-H20 systems.  The behavior of the  carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium is well established.  But in  spite of the industrial and biological importance of the C02-  NH3-H20 system, the equilibrium behavior of reactions involving  the carbamate has not been established experimentally.  It is  proposed to establish this behavior over a range of  concentrations and temperatures.  ***",
