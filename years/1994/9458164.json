The current  concentration of these studies is on a class of bacterial toxins that  exist in two distinct states: water-soluble monomers and membrane-bound  oligomers. Members of this class of molecules include  -hemolysin from  Staphylococcus aureus, aerolysin from Aermonas hydrophila and cytotoxin  from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mechanisms for assembly of this specific  class of transmembrane pores will be developed and from this, models will  be developed for the assembly of oligomeric membrane proteins in general.  To accomplish these aims strategies have been developed for; 1 )  crystallization of membrane proteins which involve sparse matrix and  systematic approaches; 2) proven the ability of n-alkyl dimethylphosphine  oxide detergents for use in membrane protein crystallizations; and '3)  have identified novel amphiphiles which promote the growth of large  single crystals. More than 15 different crystal forms of the  detergent-solubilized  -hemolysin oligomer have been formed (three of  which diffract beyond 3.0 angstroms) and have 3 distinct forms of the  water-soluble monomeric species. Determination of the oligomer ace form  is underway. During the time of this award plans are to crystallize and  determine the structures of assembly intermediates of  -hemolysin using  different mutants that are \"frozen\" at different stages and to pursue  crystallographic studies on related toxins and on important oligomeric  membrane proteins.  %%%  The transduction of energy, the active and passive transport of ions  and molecules, the transmission of biochemical signals into and out of  cells and organelles, and the action of potent bacterial toxins are  some of the critical biological processes mediated by membrane  proteins. Models of the three-dimensional structure and the function of   membrane proteins are much less developed when compared to models that  describe the properties of water-soluble proteins. The work in this  project involves using x-ray crystallography to elucidate the three-  dimensional structure of membrane proteins.  -Hemolysin, one of the  important virulence factors from Staphylococcus aureus, kills blood cells  by forming a hole in the cell membrane. This project is focused on  understanding how the toxin assembles itself on the surface of the  cells - that is, how it actually creates the fatal pore in the cell  membrane. In addition, studies are planned on crystallography of  related toxins, ion channels and receptors. These fundamental studies  will lay the foundation for genetic engineering of membrane proteins  for use as novel biomaterials and as chemotherapeutic agents.  ***",
