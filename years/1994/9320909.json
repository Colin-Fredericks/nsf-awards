 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Terry A. Miller of the Ohio State University will conduct   fundamental investigations of chemical reaction intermediates and   clusters involving them.  The primary method for detection and   characterization of the species is high resolution spectroscopy.  The   species are produced in the cold, unreactive environment of a supersonic   jet expansion where they can be interrogated by bot moderate and very   high resolution laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy.  Using the   same jet techniques, the zero kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy of the   chemically very important ions of a number of reactive, neutral free   radicals will be characterized.   Specific chemical intermediates to be   studied as neutrals and/or cations include alkoxy radicals and their   fluoro- and thio-derivatives, carbenes, amiodogen and related radicals,   and substituted methyl radicals (carbonium ions).  Concurrent theoretical   developments in fundamental spectroscopic theory, applied spectroscopic   analysis, and ab initio calculations on the chemical intermediates will   be undertaken.     Complex chemical reactions that occur in atmospheric, combustion, and   organic synthesis processes typically involve transient chemical   intermediates, such as free radicals and molecular ions, that determine   the overall result of the process.  Spectroscopic identification of the   intermediates is critical for the practical investigation and monitoring   of such reactions.  Spectroscopic characterization of the intermediates   provides a foundation for the basic understanding of the nature of   chemical reactivity.  This research involves a multifaceted approach to   the spectroscopic detection and characterization of these intermediates   and species involving them.",
