Subsequent CUPM documents  call for a 4-semester sequence of study that contains the core of  mathematics normally found in three semesters of calculus and  semesters of discrete mathematics, linear algebra, differential  equations, and probability and statistics. This call for a broader  view of mathematics dovetails well with the vision for secondary  school mathematics outlined in the NCTM's Curriculum and Evaluation  Standards.  A workshop during summer, 1994, brings together leaders  from secondary, community college, liberal arts and research  university mathematics to discuss such 7-into-4 programs and to  review their implications for the variety of individuals and client  disciplines they serve. The United States Military Academy at West  Point has a fully implemented model of a 7-into-4 curriculum. The  activities of the workshop focus on discussing the content that  should be central to each of the seven curricular areas, examining  the Academy's program, and considering how content can be better  integrated to better prepare the students served. The products of  the conference consist of proceedings with commissioned papers and  reactions, details on the West Point program, and actions and  recommendations of the workshop. Panel discussions based on the  workshop will be proposed for future MAA meetings.  ***",
