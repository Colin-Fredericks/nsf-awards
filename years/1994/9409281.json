 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409281  Bar-Yosef    With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ofer Bar-  Yosef and a large multinational group of collaborators will  continue National Science Foundation supported archaeological  research at the site of Hayonim Cave located in Israel. Hayonim  contains deposits rich in lithics and faunal remains - as well as  fragmentary human skeletal material - which span the time range  of ca 160,000 - 120,000 years ago. Excavation and analysis will  proceed over a three year period with a series of related goals.  Materials will be collected for thermoluminescence and electron  spin resonance dating of the deposits. If successful this will  provide absolute age estimates. Extensive horizontal exposures  will be obtained to permit recording and examination of hearths  and spatial distributions of artifacts and bones. Each of these  classes will be analyzed. Reseachers will reconstruct the lithic  operational sequences employed for tool manufacture and microwear  analysis will be conducted to determine tool function.    Data from a number of sources suggest that anatomically and  behavioral modern humans first appeared in Africa perhaps 200,000  years ago and spread sequentially to other parts of the world.  The Near East, as the gateway from Africa may provide essential  data on this expansion. Work to date indicates that for a long  span of time both modern humans and earlier \"Neanderthal\" forms  either coexisted or alternated presence in the area. Just when  the first modern humans arrived however is unknown and Dr. Bar  Yosef's research directly examines the suspected period. Hayonim  cave is worthy of concerted research because its deposits not  only cover this time range but also contain well preserved faunal  and lithic remains.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to a large number of anthropologists. It will  shed light on the emergence of modern humans and increase our  knowledge of a little understood period of time.",
