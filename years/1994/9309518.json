Recent work suggests that important new  insights can be gained from this approach.  The contracting  approach shows that problems of private information and the trade-  off between inflation bias reduction and optimal stabilization may  be solved by simple contracts that act to affect the incentives  faced by the central bank.  Perhaps most interestingly, these  contracts look like targeting rules in which the central bank is  penalized (or rewarded) on the basis of deviations around a target  inflation rate or money growth rate.  Since the targets depend on  central bank announcements about its private information, these  contracts are targeting rules with reporting requirements.  As  such, they bear a resemblance to the institutional structure of  monetary policy in some countries.    The research will extend the contracting approach to more closely  study its implications for choosing among various performance  measures for monetary policy defined over policy instruments (e.g.,  the monetary base), intermediate targets (e.g., the growth rate of  a monetary aggregate) or final targets (e.g., the rate of  inflation).  The role of imperfect information on the central bank  type will be examined to see how performance contracts might help  to reveal information.  In addition to addressing many other  theoretical issues suggested by the contracting approach, the  project will examine the empirical evidence on central bank design  to determine the extent to which the empirical implications of the  contracting approach might be reflected in the actual institutional  structure of central banks.    Recent work in monetary economics has suggested the importance of  designing institutional structures that grant a large degree of  independence to the central bank.  This work has had an impact on  the proposed design of a European Central  Bank.  No existing  central banks have been granted complete independence.  If greater  independence leads to low inflation but undesired fluctuations in  real economic activity, it is important to examine other approaches  that might lead to new insights that could be applied to the  problem of designing monetary policy institutions.    ***",
