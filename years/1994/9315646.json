 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315646  Lester         This grant will provide a two-year program to develop and  apply a new method for measuring kinematics of galactic nuclei.   This information will lead to robust mass estimates, and allow  critical investigation of the star forming history of heavily  obscured nuclear regions.  It will also provide insight into the  dynamics of collisions and mergers and their role in starbursts.   Newly available instrumentation at the Infrared Telescope Facility  in Hawaii allows a large number of interesting galactic nuclei to  be observed.  Since the Kinematics of stars, instead of gas, is  measured, the derived gravitational potential is insensitive to  dissipative forces and large scale flows.  The long wavelength  minimizes extinction in heavily obscured regions, yet is short  enough that the continuum is relatively undiluted by thermal  emission. A new instrument, now under development at the McDonald  Observatory of the University of Texas, will provide complimentary  measurements of the most massive, compact nuclei with large  velocity dispersions.",
