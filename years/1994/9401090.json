 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past several years investigation of geometric and  language-theoretic aspects of finitely presented groups has  engendered a remarkable interplay between group theory, geometry,  and the theory of automata and formal languages.  The  introduction of automatic groups and the classification of groups  with context free word problem are significant developments in  this area.  The contribution of formal languages to this  interplay is that they afford new ways of looking at the geometry  of Cayley diagrams of groups.  The goal of this proposal is to  develop this approach further by characterizing other classes of  groups in terms of the language-theoretic properties.            This project is in the general area of group theory and the  computer-aided computational aspects of this field.  There is a  growing interest in using computers to answer theoretical  questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for  the development of algorithms.  This research will not only aid  in the development of computer programs in group theory but will  influence the development of computer programs in other areas.",
