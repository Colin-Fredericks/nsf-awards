The long-term  objective is to investigate mechanisms in the immune system  of establishing tolerance to self antigens.  During the  planning period of this award, experiments will be carried  out to address one possible mechanism for inducing tolerance  to the MBP121-140 epitope (amino acids 121-140 of mouse  myelin basic protein, a predominant protein in the myelin  sheath which has been used extensively as a model system for  antibody production to self antigen).  The proposed  experiments involve the molecular characterization of the T  cell receptors (TCRs) expressed on MBP121-140-specific T  cells from both \"shiverer\" mutant mice, which are unable to  express endogenous MBP (where the cells are not tolerized)  as well as wild-type mice (where tolerance results in a  minor response to these residues).  Comparing the  repertoires of these two different types of mice will permit  the testing of the hypothesis that affinity of the T-cell  receptor for its ligand is critical in inducing tolerance to  this epitope.  In this hypothesis, high affinity TCRs which  mature in the presence of antigen become tolerized.   The  minor response observed in wild-type mice could then arise  from a small number of cells that were not tolerized simply  because they escaped the stochastic process of interaction  with antigen, reflecting \"leakiness\" of tolerance  mechanisms.  The model predicts that a repertoire of TCRs  would be found in shiverer mice that are not found in non  shivering litter mates.  All possible MBP121-140-specific  TCRs would be present in shiverers because of the lack of  ligand to tolerize high affinity receptors.  However, only  receptors representing low-affinity clones would be found in  non-shivering mice that express MBP if the high affinity  clones are deleted or unresponsive.  These studies will lay  the basis for an investigation of the in vivo mechanisms for  establishing tolerance to MBP.  %%%  In its response to foreign p athogens, the immune system must  be able to discriminate between foreign and self molecules.  The recognition of \"foreign\" antigens is accomplished by  lymphocytes.  These cells undergo a developmental program in  which a large variety of clones of lymphocytes express  antigen receptors on their surfaces with different  specificities.  During lymphocyte maturation in the thymus,  a selection process occurs in which those cells bearing  receptors which recognize and bind to self-antigens are  either destroyed (negative selection) or somehow induced to  be non-reactive toward their antigens (anergy).  This  process is called tolerance.  Without tolerance, the immune  system would result in self-destruction of the organism. The  goal of this project is to understand the molecular  mechanism whereby this self-non self discrimination is  achieved, using a well established mouse system.  ***",
