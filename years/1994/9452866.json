The proposal is for a 6-month grant for SRI  to engage in research and support activities of an extremely time-  sensitive nature.  The proposed project capitalizes on a unique  situation and a time-limited opportunity to both document and  support nascent efforts to install an educational version of the  information superhighway that is unparalleled in the country.    During this 6-month period we will (1) observe and document the  rapidly changing events that are affecting the Castro Valley  Unified School District as they attempt to take advantage of  unusually rich technology opportunities while maintaining their  focus on their own educational and school restructuring goals, (2)  provide support and technical assistance to school district  personnel, and (3) engage a third party evaluator (external to SRI)  to review our methods and findings on an ongoing basis.  ***",
