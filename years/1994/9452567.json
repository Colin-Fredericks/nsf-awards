As computing installations  of all types (large and small) move away from single-vendor  proprietary architectures to more and more open architectures, U.S.  colleges and universities are increasingly faced with the  responsibility of introducing open systems concepts into the  undergraduate curriculum. Most colleges and universities today lag  behind in introducing these concepts in a coordinated and conscious  manner. Academic laboratories today are still largely configured  using single-vendor homogeneous computing systems. The increasing  popularity of computing networks which support multivendor  configurations (e.g. Novell Netware) is a first step in the right  direction and is also evidence of the inevitable eminence of open  systems computing.  This development of an open systems computing  laboratory is based on the three most popular computing platforms  today in the PC to Workstation range; namely IBM/PC, Macintosh, and  Sun/UNIX. Supporting equipment include a postscript printer, a  Novell network, a tape mass storage, and appropriate software and  interfaces. The number of platforms is kept to three to reduce  complexity, make the problem tractable, and still illustrate  important open systems concepts. The laboratory serves as the  vehicle for developing and offering a three credit-hour elective  course titled Open Systems Computing. The course will fully utilize  the laboratory and will provide hands-on training in the three  important open systems concepts of multiple-platform  interconnectivity, interoperability, and extensibility. In addition  to the development of the new course, several undergraduate  computing courses including Computer Architecture, Operating  Systems, Computer Networks, Systems Programming, Systems  Integration, and Computer Interfacing are directly enhanced by the  laboratory.",
