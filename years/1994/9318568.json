 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318568  Miller    Many studies have detected enzymes in fungi (fungi that are  symbiotically associated with the roots of trees) that may  decompose organic matter in laboratory studies. Other  studies imply that these symbiotic fungi are not capable of  such decomposition in the field even though they may outgrow  true saprotrophic fungi in the soil. Several possibilities  exist for this apparent contradiction. The symbiotic  association may alter the behavior of mycorrhizal fungi so  that enzyme production is not possible. Another possibility  is that ectomycorrhizal fungi may only be able to decompose  organic matter during times when sugars produced by their  host are not being produced in sufficient quantities. At  such times, the saprotrophic machinery of mycorrhizal fungi  may be able to obtain energy along with required mineral  elements from organic substrates. A third possibility is  that at least some reports of enzymatic activity in the  laboratory are subject to criticism because the research has  been accomplished under conditions that are very different  from what would most likely be encountered by these fungi.  We propose to examine the mechanisms of ectomycorrhizal  fungi that may allow them to better compete with  saprotrophic fungi. We will accomplish this by conducting  experiments in the laboratory using specially designed root  chambers that allow growth and manipulation of a portion of  the fungus separate from the roots and rooting substrate  while still in symbiosis with the tree. This approach will  allow us to investigate the saprotrophic reposes by  ectomycorrhizal fungi at a level that heretofore has not  been achieved.  ***",
