 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant requested in this proposal will support the  development of a technology for the fabrication of  microelectrode arrays (\"probes\"). The probes will be  capable of being inserted with minimal tissue trauma  into the brain, where they will record neuronal  signals. The arrays will be fabricated using silicon  micromachining methods, and will be tested in  anesthetized animals. CMOS integrated circuits will  also be designed, to amplify the signals recorded from  each of the several recording sites on a single probe,  and multiplex them onto a single output line.  Interconnect and encapsulation methods will be  developed to combine the probes and electronics into a  package suitable for use in animals. The probes will be  designed so that the CMOS electronics can ultimately be  integrated on a common substrate with the probes.    The probes will be used to obtain simultaneous  recordings from multiple sites in the mammalian brain.  Such recordings are used to obtain information that is  not available through other means, in order to learn  about how the brain works on the single-neuron and  network levels. The instruments to be developed under  this grant will greatly extend our ability to conduct  this basic neuroscience research.",
