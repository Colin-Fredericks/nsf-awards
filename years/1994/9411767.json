 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411767  Snow       Due to their severity, tornadoes have been the subject of much  study.  One data source, however, that is still relatively  unexplored is that of the location of debris lofted by the tornado  and parent storm.  The phenomena of lofting, deposition, transport  and fallout of debris are not well understood with most data being  anecdotal in nature.         The Principal Investigator will carry out his research under  the umbrella of the Verification of Origins of Rotation in  Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX) that will be conducted in 1994 by a  consortium of university and National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration researchers.  The Principal Investigator will  conduct field surveys, and telephone and mail campaigns of regions  where deposition and fallout are deemed likely.  He will use these  data in combination with supporting meteorological data collected  in VORTEX to fine tune a debris trajectory model and to develop  data sets for later use in evaluating the ability of  cloud/mesoscale models to replicate the observed patterns of  fallout.  He will use the observed deposition and fallout patterns  together with observations of the tornadoes to infer the likely  mechanism that control lofting.       Results of this research will extend understanding of  tornadoes and their damage producing mechanisms, elucidate  connections between tornadoes and their parent thunderstorms and  further reveal the interaction between a thunderstorm and the  environmental winds.       Because of the potential hazard posed by lofting and  subsequent deposition and fallout of contaminated or toxic  materials, the results will be of interest to emergency management  personnel as well as to the meteorological community.  ***",
