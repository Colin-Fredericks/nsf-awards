Specific efforts to be undertaken include  finite element modeling of machine components, control system  optimization of textile processing machinery, kinematic synthesis  of textile mechanisms, and application of smart material  technology.  Design improvements to the loom would also be  considered, involving the use of braiding principles in order to  achieve improvements in the production rate.       The design improvements have the potential to achieve an order  of magnitude improvement in production rate in the intensively  competitive of textile manufacturing.  The interaction between the  Principal Investigator and the textile manufacturer would also be  mutually beneficial to both parties involved.  The former would  benefit from its impact on his teaching and research activities,  whereas the latter would benefit from exposure to advanced  technology.",
