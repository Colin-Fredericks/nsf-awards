Two specific directions are being  proposed.  The first is to enrich the instruction in courses in all  of these areas by preparing application modules in science and  engineering for use in mathematics courses, and mathematical  modules for use in science and engineering courses.  The goal in  both these cases is to forge closer links between instruction in  mathematics on the one hand and in engineering and science on the  other.  In this way students will see mathematics developed more  closely in the context of applications that are of interest to  them.  The second major direction of proposed work is to expand as  rapidly as possible the use of a mode of instruction known locally  as studio courses.  In this type of course all class meetings take  place in the same room, and the distinction among lectures,  recitations, and laboratories is essentially eliminated.",
