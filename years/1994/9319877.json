West Antarctica is characterized by two kinds of the  Earth s most dynamic systems, a continental rift (the West  Antarctic Rift System) and a marine based ice sheet (the WAIS).   Active continental rift systems, caused by divergent plate  motions, result in thinned continental crust.  Associated with  the thin crust are fault-bounded sedimentary basins, active  volcanism, and elevated heat flow.   Marine  ice sheets are  characterized by rapidly moving streams of ice, penetrating and  draining a slowly moving ice reservoir.  Evidence left by past  marine ice sheets indicates that they may have a strongly non-  linear response to long-term climate change which results in  massive and rapid discharges of ice.  Understanding the evolution  of the ice stream system and its interaction with the interior  ice is the key to understanding this non-linear response.    Subglacial geology and ice dynamics are generally studied in  isolation, but evidence is mounting that the behavior of the West  Antarctic ice streams may be closely linked to the nature of the  underlying West Antarctic rift system.  The fast moving ice  streams appear to glide on a lubricating layer of water-saturated  till.  This till requires easily eroded sediment and a source of  water, both of which may be controlled by the geology of the rift  system; the sediments from the fault-bounded basins and the water  from the elevated heat flux associated with active lithospheric  extension.    This project represents an interdisciplinary aerogeophysical  study to characterize the lithosphere of the West Antarctic rift  system beneath critical regions of the WAIS.  The objective is to  determine the effects of the rift architect ure, as manifested by  the distribution of sedimentary basins and volcanic constructs,  on the ice stream system.  The research tool is a unique  geophysical aircraft with laser altimetry, ice penetrating radar,  aerogravity, and aeromagnetic systems integrated with a high  precision kinematic GPS navigation system.  It is capable of  imaging both the surface and bed of the ice sheet while  simultaneously measuring the gravity and magnetic signature of  the subglacial lithosphere.  Work to be done under this award  will build on work already completed in the southern sector of  central West Antarctica and it will focus on the region of the  Byrd Subglacial Basin and Ice Stream D.  The ice sheet in these  regions is completely covered by satellite imagery and so this  project will be integrated with remote sensing studies of the ice  stream.  The changing dynamics of Ice Stream D, as with other  West Antarctic ice streams, seem to be correlated with changes in  the morphological provinces of the underlying rift system.  The  experimental  targets proceed from the divide of the interior  ice, downstream through the onset of streaming to the trunk of  Ice Stream D.    This study will be coordinated with surface glaciological  investigations of Ice Stream D and will be used to guide  cooperative over-snow seismic investigations of the central West  Antarctic rift system.  The data will also be used to select a  site for future deep ice coring along the crest of the WAIS.   These data represent baseline data for long term global change  monitoring work and represent crucial boundary conditions for ice  sheet modeling efforts.",
