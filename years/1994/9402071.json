 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kuniholm    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Kuniholm will  continue to develop a dendrochronological sequence for Southern  Europe and the Near East. To date he has collected sections of  sequences which extend back to ca. 7,500 BC and which cover major  portions of Turkey, Greece, Italy and adjacent areas in  Southeastern Europe. With partial NSF support he will continue  this work. Over the course of two field seasons, together with  his colleagues, he will visit numerous sites in the region to  collect old wood. Analysis at Kuniholm's Cornell laboratory will  then permit their incorporation into a master chronology. The  goals of this work are to fill in the gaps which remain in the  chronology and to fill in its extended range.    This research is important for several reasons. Most importantly,  from an archaeological perspective, a tree ring chronology will  provide an absolute dating technique which will allow dates to be  assigned to wood and charcoal recovered from archaeological  sites. Precise dating is critical in such research. The  information will also be useful to paleoecologists,  climatologists and others who use data derived from the past. The  tree ring chronology will not only provide a basis to increase  our understanding of past human behavior, but will also help to  illumine such issues as the effect of human actions on climate.",
