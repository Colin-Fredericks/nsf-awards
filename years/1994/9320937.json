The grant will enable the investigator to work  with a leading scholar at the University of Arizona to learn the  techniques of experimental economics.  In addition she will begin  to apply these techniques in public goods situations.  The goal  of this research is too design and compare alternative cost  sharing mechanisms for public goods.  The tool of experimental  economics will be used to compare alternative mechanisms in terms  of social costs and equity for environments with varying group  size, cost conditions, and initial endowments.  This project will  provide a case in which experimentation is used not only for  behavior hypothesis testing but also as method of endogenous  institutional choice.  The object is to design rules and  institutions for cooperative solutions to local public problems.  ***",
