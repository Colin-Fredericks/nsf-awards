The International Social Survey Project (ISSP) will be  carried out in the United States and twenty other countries:   Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic,  Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,  the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland,  Russia, Slovenia, and Sweden.  In each nation, questionnaire  interviews will be administered to scientifically drawn samples  of the population, employing items selected by an international  committee of experts.  The module on women, work and the family  will chart changing gender roles, challenges facing the family,  the correlates of declining birth rates, and changes in women's  labor force participation.  The environment module measures  attitudes and behaviors related to preservation of the ecology.  %%%  The data collected in the United States by these two survey  modules will be enhanced by the fact that they will be connected  to the General Social Survey (GSS), a major data base project  supported by the National Science Foundation.  In the past, more  than two thousand five hundred scientific reports have been based  on the GSS, and many researchers in several fields will use the  ISSP data.  Not only will the United States benefit from the  scientific findings of the ISSP concerning significant policy  issues, but the ISSP will enhance scientific cooperation with  twenty other nations.    ***",
