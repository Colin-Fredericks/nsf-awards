The strategy through which this mission will be  accomplished centers around the establishment of science clubs for middle school girls.   Each club will be coordinated by a team of two University of California, San Francisco  women scientists, and one woman middle school teacher who will all serve as mentors  for the students.  The girls will gain hands-on experience in science investigation and use  of tools, as well as opportunities to apply their skills and knowledge to group projects.   The scientists will develop teaching and communication behaviors that foster gender  equity in their own interactions with students and colleagues over the course of their  careers.  Workshops on gender equity will also be provided for other science teachers,  male and female, at all grade levels, improving the overall climate for gender equity in  the District.  ***",
