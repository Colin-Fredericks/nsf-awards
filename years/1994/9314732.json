 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the  theoretical work of Dr. Thomas R. Cundari of the Chemistry Department, Memphis State  University, on CH activation.  Cundari will carry out five computational projects on the factors  affecting the first step in catalytic methane conversion.  Three of the projects involve methane  activation by multiply-bonded Ti, Zr, and Hf complexes.  The effect of pi-bond energy and  polarity on the CH activation barrier will be explored, as well the effect of changing from amide  to imide ligands.  Other projects will examine metal-methyl complexes of lanthanides, Sc, and  Zr.  Oxidative addition and sigma-bond metathesis mechanisms for some Ir, Re, and W  compounds will be modeled.  The fifth project involves analysis of methane activation by  electrophilic Pt(II) and Hg(II) complexes.  In all cases, the computational results will be  compared to experimental findings.  The main goals of the study are to develop reliable methods  for describing d- and f-block chemistry and to assess how CH activation is affected by the  complex interaction of the metal, activating ligands, and ancillary ligands.    A number of catalysts are available for the conversion of methane, which is abundant, to other  organic products such as methanol, which is a transportable liquid fuel.  For any conversion  reaction, a carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in methane has to be broken, or activated, and then  other steps in the reaction can take place.  Experimental data on a number of catalysts for  reactions involving methane are known, but a common framework for understanding the role of  the catalyst, which consists of a metal and accompanying groups, has not been developed.  By  carrying out computational studies on the electronic structure of the catalysts during these  reactions, Cundari will identify important factors in the reaction and develop a broader view of  the reaction mechanism.  The research will aid in the development of more activ e and selective  methane or alkane catalysts.",
