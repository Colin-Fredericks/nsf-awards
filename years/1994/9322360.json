 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322360  Hill         The investigators propose to carry out theoretical  investigations of the plasma interactions associated with the  impending encounter of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy-9 fragments with  Jupiter and its magnetosphere.  They will concentrate on  potentially observable consequences of the interaction of comet  material with the magnetosphere, both before and after the impact  episode.  Because the comet is already fragmented and carries  significant dust (and perhaps gas) components, its interaction with  Jupiter's magnetosphere may well have observable effects upon its  first encounter with the bow shock or magnetopause, about a month  before planetary impact.  These effects include electrostatic  disruption of grains, copious ionization, and the intriguing  possibility of remote optical imaging of the magnetospheric  boundary.  During and after the impact episode, magnetospheric  convection may be influenced by the mass-loading effect of comet  ejecta, with observable consequences in the optical Io torus, the  Jovian aurora, and Jovian radio emissions.  The theoretical  investigation of these phenomena will combine analytical and tested  numerical techniques, and will be carried out in close conjunction  with relevant observational programs to maximize the scientific  return from this rare celestial event.  ***",
