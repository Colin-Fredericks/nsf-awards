Lewis-Beck and a research  group at the Center for Studies on French Politics at the French  National Center for Scientific Research.  The French principal   investigators are Daniel Boy, Jean Chiche, Gerard Grunberg, and  Nonna Mayer.  The objective of this project is the collection of  survey data that will allow the the principal investigators to  develop and test comprehensive models of voting behavior in  France and the United States.  The survey is timely, taking  advantage of the 1992 U.S. presidential election and national  survey, and the French national election in 1995.  Among the  items to be tested are:  party identification and economic  issues, such as personal finances.  This award supports Dr.  Lewis-Beck's travel to France and the costs of administering pre-  test items for the French national election survey.    The project takes advantage of combined expertise in social  sciences and will provide access to national election data in  both the U.S. and France, which might not otherwise be made  available to scholars.  Comparative studies of national elections  in the western democracies and cross cultural analysis will  advance our understanding of voting behavior in the U.S. and  France.  ***",
