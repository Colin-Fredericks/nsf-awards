The proposed research will  be carried out within the framework of finite-dimensional center  manifold normal forms of bifurcation problems. The symmetries of  these bifurcation problems will be exploited in their analysis  and in the interpretation of the results. Special attention will  also be given to developing geometric methods that exploit  integrable Hamiltonian limits of the bifurcation problems.      Symmetries play a central role in the evolution of  pattern-forming instabilities in hydrodynamic systems. The  primary goal of the proposed research is to develop mathematical  methods that exploit their presence. The research on pattern  formation will aid the interpretation of large-scale numerical  studies of three-dimensional magnetoconvection, and laboratory  studies of electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals. The  research on globally coupled oscillators will contribute to our  understanding of the dynamics of series arrays of Josephson  junctions.",
