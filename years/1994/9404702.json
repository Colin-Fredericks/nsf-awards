Experiments addressing  this question will utilize reconstituted proteolipid systems in  which the lipid and protein compositions can be readily varied.   The lipid bilayer properties to be investigated are:  i. fatty acid  composition, which determines the fluidity of the membrane  interior; ii. head group identity, which modulates electrical  charge, hydration, curvature free energy, lateral mobility and  other surface physicochemical properties; iii. presence of specific  components such as cardiolipin and glycolipids.  The protein  systems to be studied include the integral membrane proteins  cytochrome c oxidase (bovine heart) and cytochrome f (spinach), and  their physiological electron transfer partners, the peripheral  membrane proteins cytochrome c (bovine heart) and plastocyanin  (spinach). Our approach is multifaceted, utilizing a unique  combination of kinetic, thermodynamic and structural techniques.  Protein-protein complex formation and electron transfer will be  characterized by measurements of transient kinetics using laser  flash photolysis and by electrochemistry at lipid bilayer-modified  electrodes; structural features of the proteolipid systems (packing  density and film thickness) and protein-protein and protein-lipid  interactions will be investigated using surface plasmon resonance  spectroscopy.  %%%   ***  In this research program, we wish to determine how the lipid  components of biological membranes modulate the properties of the  proteins which participate in the principal energy conversion  processes occurring in biology, i.e. photosynthesis in green plants  (which converts sunlight into f ood energy in the form of  carbohydrate) and respiration in animals (which converts stored  carbohydrate into biologically available energy).  We will change  the following properties of the lipid component and determine how  these changes affect protein-protein interactions and electron  transfer reactions: fatty acid composition (which modulates  membrane fluidity), lipid head group structure (which modulates  surface electrical charge), and the presence or absence of specific  types of lipids (galactolipids and cardiolipin) which are unique  components of the biological membranes associated with  photosynthesis and respiration.  The following properties of the  protein-lipid systems will be studied: the rates of protein-protein  electron transfer reactions, the intrinsic ability of proteins to  accept and donate electrons, and the structural changes induced in  the lipid-protein systems by varying the lipid properties noted  above.  These studies will not only be of fundamental interest for  increasing our understanding of these crucially important  biological processes, but will also have important implication for  the development of future technologies such as molecular electronic  devices, biosensors for medical diagnosis, and energy conversion  devices based upon biological models.  ***",
