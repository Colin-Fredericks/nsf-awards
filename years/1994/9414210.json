The courseware will include a set of modules: Computer Basics; Electronic Mail; Operating Systems; Library Information Systems; Internet, Bulletin Boards, and Networking; Word Processing; Data Visualization and Spreadsheets. With this courseware, students can learn from instructions, get help from on-line tutors, discuss learning experiences with fellow students, raise questions.  Students will be able to practice on both simulated as well as real computer systems and receive feedback on their performance. The course content and instructional strategies will be adaptive to individual students.       With ID Expert/CS, instructors will be able to customize the existing courseware to meet the needs of their students, to integrate new material into existing courseware, and to develop new courseware for computer technologies.      Successfully completion of this project will provide a means to significantly improve the quality of education and training for high school and college students as well as adults in the area of computers.  ***",
