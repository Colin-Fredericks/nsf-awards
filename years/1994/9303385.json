 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303385  Klusman       It is proposed to measure methane and non-methane hydrocarbon  (NMHC) fluxes from the earth in sedimentary basins with a focus on  arid and semiarid environments.  The microseepage phenomenon is  widespread, though not generally recognized as a significant  contribution to the atmospheric loading by hydrocarbons.  Saturated  hydrocarbons, particularly methane, make a significant contribution  to the absorption of infrared radiation from the earth.  The 14C  activity of the atmosphere sets an upper limit to the contribution  of methane from all fossil fuel sources in the range of 20-30%.   Presumably nearly all of the C2-C5 saturated hydrocarbons in the  atmosphere are from fossil fuel sources.  Research to date  attributes the fossil fuel contribution entirely to man-induced  leakage and pollution, but has not measured the natural  microseepage rates in the environments where it is likely to occur.       The proposal is to measure the natural fluxes of CH4 and NMHC  in several sedimentary basins in the western United States using  gas chromatography the basins selected are known to have a wide  range of concentrations of hydrocarbons in soil gas.  The fluxes  are expected to be proportional to the soil gas concentrations.   The research in the first year will concentrate on preliminary  estimates of fluxes using flux chamber techniques.  Second year  research will focus on more accurate measurement of fluxes from  additional basins and application of carbon isotopy to support the  nature of the source of methane and NMHCs.  The proposed research  will be of significance in global change research if it is found  that natural microseepage is a major contribution to the methane  and C2-C5 emission inventories.",
