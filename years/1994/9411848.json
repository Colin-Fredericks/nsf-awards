 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411848  Ranker       Graduate student Chrissen Gemmill, under the supervision of  faculty adviser Thomas Ranker at the University of Colorado, is  studying the taxonomy, phylogeny, and population genetics of  Hawaiian species of the palm genus Pritchardia.  There are an  estimated 25 species in the genus, 19 in Hawaii and the rest in the  South Pacific.  Eight or so species occur in isolated, small  populations and may prove to be genetically depauperate and  endangered.  Morphological and molecular studies are being  conducted, the latter including electrophoresis of proteins to  assess levels of genetic variability and sequencing of nuclear DNA  regions (ITS regions) to measure mutational differences among  species.  Combined morphological and molecular evidence will  improve taxonomic discrimination of the Hawaiian species and  provide characters for reliable identification and for inferring a  hypothesis of evolutionary history.       Because conservation and management decisions must be based on  reliable taxonomic treatments, an improved classification of  Pritchardia palms, based on combined morphological and molecular  data, will answer the needs for accurate identification and  measurement of genetic variability in wild populations.",
