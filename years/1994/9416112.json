 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416112  Roeder  Cracking has been noted on approximately 50 steel frame  buildings as a result of the Northridge Earthquake.  Considerable concerns have been expressed about the welding  practice and procedures used on these structures.  These  welding concerns are clearly well placed, but it is unlikely  that these are the sole source of the steel frame cracking.  The progression of cracking into the steel column and panel  zone suggest that factors in addition to the welds affect  the process.  At the same time, there have been changes in  the professional practice and seismic design codes for steel  moment frames during the past 10 years.    This research project will determine if the recent changes  in seismic design practice have combined with welds and  contributed to the cracking problem.  The research will  examine the cause of cracking and possible solutions.  A  subcontract to the consulting firm of Brandow and Johnston  will be involved in this study to provide design drawings,  detailed advice, practical insight and information on the  damaged buildings.  Three buildings will be selected for  investigation.  A series of global elastic and inelastic  analysis of the structures will be performed using the best  available information for the shaking experienced by the  buildings.  Detailed elastic and nonlinear analysis of  critical areas will be used to examine the weak links, the  sequence of yield and cracking and the estimated resistance  of the critical components.  The effect of alternate design  provisions to the UBC provisions would be predicted and  examined.   A limited series of experiments examining weld  effects will be performed, and the experiments will be  correlated to the analytical results.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
