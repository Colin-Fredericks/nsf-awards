 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313778  Eisenthal  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the  Chemistry Division, Prof. K.B. Eisenthal of Columbia University  will investigate the properties of and processes on liquid  interfaces using non-linear optical methods based on second  harmonic and sum frequency generation techniques.  The aim of  this work is to obtain a molecular level description of  equilibrium and time dependent processes at vapor/liquid,  liquid/liquid, and liquid/solid interfaces.  The equilibrium  processes include chemical equilibria such as a new method for  measuring acid-base equilibrium constants at interfaces,  isomeric equilibria at interfaces of molecules that are known  to be sensitive to polarity, and the investigation of charged  molecules at liquid interfaces. Ultrafast photochemical and  photophysical events such as photoisomerization at air/ liquid,  liquid/liquid, and liquid/solid interfaces as well as the  dynamics of solvation initiated by a large change in the  molecular dipole moment following photoexcitation of interface  molecules and other phenomena will be investigated.  %%%  Interfaces are the sharply delineated geometric boundaries that  separate different media from one another.  The chemical and  physical processes that occur at interfaces differ from those  that take place within either of the media.  A common example  is the bending of a light beam as it traverses the boundary  between air and water.  While moving along a straight line path  in both media, air and water, the beam is bent at the boundary  face.  Other examples are the evaporation of a liquid, whereby  individual molecules move across the boundary surface from the  liquid to the vapor, and chemical processes on surfaces which  differ from those that take place in the bulk medium.  While  these and other common interfacial processes are reasonably  well understood on the basis of macroscopic, phenomenological  theories, it is important to know on a molecular level of  description how these come about.   It is the purpose of this  research project to investigate interfacial processes in such a  way that they can be understood on the basis of interactions  between molecules, and between molecules and electromagnetic  radiation. Though this research will concern itself with  fundamental, basic questions of the chemistry and physics of  interfacial phenomena, it has relevance to major environmental  issues of air/water, oil/ water, and soil (silicates)/water  interfaces.  ***",
