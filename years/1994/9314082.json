The principal lecturer will be Professor  David Kinderlehrer of Carnegie Mellon University.  In addition, talks will be  given by a number of other scholars studying mathematical systems which, it is  believed, will be useful in the study of nonlinear materials.        One of the foci of considerable research in both the sciences and  mathematics is how local or micro behavior affects global or macro behavior.   In general, it is often very difficult to predict the properties of a large  structure when only the properties of its constituent parts are known.  This  general problem presents itself in fields as diverse as economics and solid  state physics.        Professor Kinderlehrer will be lecturing on mathematics that addresses  the response of materials to changes in its environment.  In general, one  knows the properties of the individual atoms that make up a material and one  knows the ways in which they can fit together.  This knowledge can be used to  predict, for instance, the structure of crystals and the magnetic properties  of iron.  However, when a material is subjected to changes in its environment,  for example changes in temperature. pressure, or electromagnetic fields, the  atoms begin to realign themselves in sometimes surprising ways.  The  phenomenon has already lent itself to the development of many useful  applications such as shape-memory alloys and liquid crystals.  However the  mathematical questions that are posed by an attempt to obtain a detailed  understanding of this phenomenon are deep and require the development of new  mathematical machinery.        Recent, progress has been made with some averaging methods which enable  one to cope with the rapidly spatially varying systems involved.  Professor  Kinderlehrer's lectures will be on the application of these averaging met hods  which promise a more unified theory and treatment of the subject.  The other  invited speakers for the conference have been selected because of their  knowledge of and contributions to this and related material in order to  achieve a rich and productive interaction between researchers currently active  in this area.  ***",
