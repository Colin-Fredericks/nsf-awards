The College of William and Mary  Title: Flux and Fate of Sediment and Water from Small, Mountainous  Rivers to the Continental Margin: The Gulf of Alaska Example    Small rivers charging directly from mountains into the ocean carry  greater sediment loads than commonly envisioned, a relatively great  percentage of which may escape to deeper waters during high stands  of sea level.  This award supports a study of the flux of Holocene  fluvial sediment into the Gulf of Alaska, whose generally small  tributary rivers are collectively the largest supplier of sediment  from North America.  Alaskan rivers are relatively uninfluenced by  human activities, although glacial activity has resulted in higher  sediment yields than noted for other rivers with similar drainage  areas.    High-resolution seismic profiling, in conjunction with seismic data  previously collected, will allow the identification of sediment  accumulation and discharge patterns on the shelf and slope, as well  as trace individual sediment layers derived from episodic (flood)  events.  Sedimentological data will help define the escape  routes/processes, and a variety of radiometric datings will show  frequency of occurrence and rates of accumulation.  Facies will be  defined by compositional and textural analyses, as will be sources  (and fates) of terrigneous grains and organic matter in shelf  sediments.  Measurements of total organic carbon and total  nitrogen, d13C, d15N, and lignin oxidation productions in sediment  organic matter will be used to determine the amount and source of  organic matter accumulating in the sediments.    Contemporaneous oceanographic processes controlling strata  formation will also be evaluated.  This information should help in  the interpretation of the older strata observed by seismic  profiling and coring.",
