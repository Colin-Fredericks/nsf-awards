 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402501  De Lumen    This award supports the travel expenses for Dr.  Benito De Lumen of the Department of  Nutritional Sciences at the University of  California at Berkeley to spend eleven months  in Japan conducting collaborative research with  Dr. Fumio Takaiwa, Department of Cell Biology  at the National Institute of Agrobiological  Resources in Tsukuba. The research will focus  on the regulation of gene expression at the  transcription level that results in tissue and  stage-specific expression in rice seed  endosperm.    Dr. Takaiwa and his team have made significant  progress in cloning and characterizing a number  of rice glutelin genes. Working with Dr.  Takaiwa, Dr. De Lumen will attempt to  clone and sequence a cDNA encoding a nuclear  protein that binds to the 5' upstream region of  a rice glutelin gene, then to establish the  stage-specific expression of this cDNA, and  finally to compare its homology with cloned  transcription factors.  This project depends  heavily on the groundwork established by Dr.  Takaiwa in identifying upstream DNA control  sequences in a rice glutelin gene that interact  with nuclear proteins. This work should  facilitate the cloning of similar transcription  factors using methionine-rich protein genes  from soybeans when Dr. De Lumen returns to his  laboratory in Berkeley.    This award is funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
