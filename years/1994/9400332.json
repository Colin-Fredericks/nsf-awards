 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400332  Tatum  This award supports Professor C. B. Tatum of the Center for  Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) of Stanford University  to collaborate with Professor H. R. Schalcher and others of  the Center for Integrated Planning in Construction (CIPCON)  of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.   Professor Tatum is a recognized leader in the evaluation,  understanding and modeling of innovation and the  introduction of new technology in construction engineering.   The Swiss group recently began a major research project to  improve construction project performance through  integrated planning and communication in the building  process.  They are testing this on a major commercial  complex planned for construction in Switzerland. The  collaboration provides Dr. Tatum a unique opportunity to  extend and refine technologies and organization structures  for implementing new technology developed at CIFE by  applying them to the CIPCON project.     A major barrier to improved performance in construction  projects is fragmentation of activities by functional  specialists over the various stages of the project.  Advanced  information technology can assist in meeting this major  challenge, but the process of implementing such technology  is poorly understood and the effort is frequently  unsuccessful.  This project will increase understanding of  approaches for effective use of new technology to improve  project performance in the vital construction industry.  The  U.S. has given substantial attention to Japanese research  and relatively little to European work.  In this area where  European groups are world leaders, Dr. Tatum's participation  will provide valuable insight into the European methods for  innovation and the introduction of new technologies in their  construction industry.  ***",
