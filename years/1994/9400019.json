 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400019  Narum       This award to the Independent Colleges Office  makes possible a series of seminars and workshops  on undergraduate science facilities.  The goals  are to: 1) equip institutional teams from  predominantly undergraduate institutions to  prepare competitive proposals to the NSF, and to  other funding agencies, public and private, for  their science facilities modernization projects;  and 2) support the process of facilities  modernization, so that the science, mathematics  and engineering programs for undergraduate  students on those campuses are strengthened.  With  full participation from the United Negro College  Fund, this series of workshops and seminars also  seeks to incorporate the needs of Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, thus paying  attention to scientific workforce diversity  issues.  This project is important since it seeks  to include small colleges into the mainstream of  rebuilding their research and research training  infrastructure.  This is of great significance to  this country since these are the institutions from  which a high percentage of Americans emerge and go  on to become our scientists and engineers.",
