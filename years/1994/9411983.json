The workshops will present practical information, advice, and basic information needed to succeed in academic careers.  The attendees will be provided with opportunities to interact with more senior women in academia, to develop mentoring relationships, and to start a professional network with their fellow attendees.  The workshops will be held in conjunction with the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing to be held in Virginia in June 1994, with Supercomputing '94 to be held in Washington DC in November 1994, and with the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) to be held most probably in Philadelphia in 1996.  A successful pilot workshop has already been held in conjunction with the first FCRC held in San Diego in May of 1993.  The workshop drew a 150 participants although funding was provided for only 32 people.  The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research.  The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research community and to support and promote its interests.  Dr. Weingarten is the Executive Director of CRA.  Dr. CUNY, the academic leader of this project, is a Professor of Computer Science and The University of Oregon.",
