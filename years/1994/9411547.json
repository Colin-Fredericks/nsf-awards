The research will be undertaken by the staff  veterinarian for Cornell University's Center for Research Animal  Resources, towards completion of the PhD degree in Science and  Technology Studies.  When pressures mounted from the animal rights  community during the 1980s, the U.S. Congress increased its  regulation of animal-based research dramatically, thus empowering  the laboratory animal veterinarians who oversee the welfare of  research animals.  These veterinarians, employed by research  institutions, now have enormous responsibility.  The central aims  of this research are to develop a historical understanding of the  evolving definition of laboratory animal veterinarian and to  examine professional and moral difficulties inherent in reconciling  competing models of what the veterinarian should be.  The  researcher will follow review of government documents and  scientific and philosophical literature with interviews with the  scientists, animal protectionists and veterinarians who have tried  to shape the legal role of research veterinarians.  The analysis  will provide insight into the complex interactions between  scientists' values and society's values, against the changing  backdrop of our understanding of the nature of non-human animals.  ***",
