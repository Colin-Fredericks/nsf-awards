 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) program is proposed for the  priority of Geosciences are of \"Coastal Ocean Processes\".  In the  Oceanography Program of the Graduate College of Marine Studies  (CMS), we have a PhD degree program that we propose to modify to  provide an additional new specialization in \"Coastal Ocean  Processes\" (COP).  This COP program is built on an existing  emphasis in nearshore oceanographic areas, an advanced course in  coastal and estuarine oceanography, an advanced physical  oceanography course, and a course in marine policy for  oceanographers.  There are 15 faculty members from the CMS who have  agreed to participate in this initial program.  An additional equal  number who teach and do research in the general area of nearshore  oceanography will add to the resource base for this traineeship  program; although not contacted for this program initially, some  may join later as potential advisors for the students.    Over the past decade, 17 students have received PhD degrees in  Oceanography from the CMS in which there was an emphasis in each  one's dissertation research in nearshore oceanography. The six  faculty who advised these students are participants in the new  program that is proposed here.  Although these previous students  did not have the same specific requirements as are proposed for the  new program, many did take one or more advanced estuarine and  coastal oceanography courses and several of the non-physicists did  take advanced physical oceanography courses and used dynamical  physical oceanographic modelling in dissertations and refereed  publications.  Most took a course in marine policy.    We feel that we have demonstrated the ability to give training in  a coastal ocean processes orientation for an oceanography degree  and that we have the capacity to recruit and advise the additional  number of students that this GRT grant would support.",
