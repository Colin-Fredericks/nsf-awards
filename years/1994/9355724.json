With the support of education service  centers, and participation from nine participating school  districts, in the Central and South Florida region, project staff  will train teams of key middle school teachers and supervisors in  summer institute settings.  Instruction will include science  content, a wide range of regional STS issues, strategies for  investigating and evaluating STS issues, issue resolution skills,  and two well-researched strategies for teaching this content to  middle school students.  Subsequent to each institute,  participants will apply these skills, and report their results.  Over each school year, participants will implement and evaluate  much of this content, including one issue instruction strategy,  in their classrooms.  As a part of the projects evaluation, the  teachers will report the results of their efforts to project  staff and participants in a regular spring meeting.  In Year 3  district teams will participate in a summer seminar designed to  prepare them to offer inservice sessions to their colleagues.  Once trained cadres of teachers and articulated instructional  programs are in place, extensive data will be collected to assess  impact and program effectiveness.    The cost sharing will be 42 percent of the NSF funds.  ***",
