The preliminary investigation includes the sites of  Hovsgol Nuur in Mongolia, a large lake southwest of Lake Baikal,  and lakes and rivers in the Oka and Tunka Valleys in Buryat.  The  purpose of this visit is to collect data on invertebrates (e.g.,  zooplankton and amphipods) and fishes throughout the Selenga  river basin and Hovsgol Nuur to examine the ecological  relationship between Hovsgol Nuur and Baikal Lake.  The data  available from these areas are very limited.  This trip can  provide important preliminary information for research in this  area, which has been accessible for outsiders to only a limited  degree since Hovsgol Nuur is situated in a remote part of   Mongolia and there is no road to reach the lake, and since only  Mongolians and Russians were allowed to enter this area prior to  1990.   Dr. Goulden is a distinguished scientist with an  excellent record in carrying out difficult field projects.  This  visit can provide important baseline information for carrying out  field research in part of Asia.",
