 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354510  Billington  This proposal seeks to provide a textbook and teaching materials  for an introductory-level engineering course of an  interdisciplinary nature that seeks to attract students into  engineering, and to educate non-engineering students in  engineering. This new course is aimed at freshmen engineering  students, at students interested in pre-college teaching careers,  goals and open to all students in college. The course describes the  200-year transformation of American society through the innovations  of large-scale structures, powerful machines, continental networks  of communication and power, and industrial processes all  culminating in the complex world of the late twentieth century. The  course also introduces students to techniques for more effective  communication by written, oral, and visual means.  This proposal is  to develop a set of teaching units, to test them at several  institutions, and to complete a textbook. The materials will  introduce students to the scientific bases for engineering, the  social context within which modern engineering arises, and the  intimate relationship between engineering and modern culture.  Efforts will also be made to make engineering more accessible to  women and underrepresented minorities.",
