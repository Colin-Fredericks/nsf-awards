 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353405  Pica    A five year program is proposed which will promote effective  inquiry based science teaching and learning in the elementary  grades of the school district of Philadelphia.  It has three  principle objectives:         1.   to improve the teaching of science through the            establishment of a cadre of Leader teachers to serve as            mentors and change agents;         2.   to deepen and extend students' knowledge and            understanding of science by integrating science learning            with instruction in the language arts, and         3.   motivate students from historically underrepresented            groups to pursue further study and career selection in            science and technology.    The Collaborative brings together teachers, university faculty and  professional scientists who share a commitment to the enhancement  of science teaching and learning.    The Collaborative will focus its efforts in the District's  southwest region, whose 25 schools have a predominantly minority  population.  Teams of 4 elementary teachers (grades 1-3) from these  schools will participate in the first two years to build up a  critical mass of Leader Teachers.  They will attend an intensive  three week summer institute, a graduate level continuing education  seminar during the academic year and a three week institute during  the following summer.    Teachers will work with materials which they will use in their  classroom-the Franklin Institute hands-on science kits-as the  sprongboard to exploring basic science concepts and discovering  strategies for engaging students in their own explorations.  Pre-  service teachers will be invited to attend the summer institutes.   An annual spring conference will bring together current and former  participants share information and experiences.  By the end of the  five years the school district will have in place approximately 250  leader teachers.    The funds requested amount to $1,780,796 for 5 years with cost  share estimated  at $784,039.",
