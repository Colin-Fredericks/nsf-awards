 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308081  Norpoth    This doctoral dissertation research project examines the two stages  of voting decisions in presidential elections.  Electoral  participation is of critical importance in both democratic theory  and policy reform proposals, and has been extensively studied.   While much of the past electoral research has acknowledged the two  steps of participation in the United States, registration and then  actually going to the polls, few have modeled these two stages  explicitly.  Considering nonvoters as a unitary group in a single  model may have serious implications for model specification and the  conclusions which have been drawn, because as Merriam and Gosnell  demonstrated, \"entirely different reasons (for not voting) were  emphasized by those who were registered than by those who were  registered but did not vote.\"      This research first examines the three distinct groups of the  electorate (non-registrants, registered nonvoters, and registered  voters), for comparisons across a number of demographic and  attitudinal variables.  The next phase of research translates the  two stage conceptualization into an appropriate selection bias  model of turnout.  Finally, the conclusions of past research about  the effects of easing registration requirements will be re-examined  in the properly constructed two stage model.  This research agenda  presents a different analytic approach to the accepted  conceptualization of turnout which will aid in understanding  electoral frameworks, policy impact analysis and the interpretation  of recent history.  ***",
