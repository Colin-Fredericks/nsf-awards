 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops generalized fast Fourier transforms  (FFT's).  Of principal importance is the further development of  techniques for constructing FFT's for finite groups, as well as  the extension of algorithmic tools for the efficient and  numerically stable computation of Fourier transforms for  band-limited functions on nonabelian compact groups and their  quotients.  This interdisciplinary research draws from the areas  of computational group theory, representation theory, and  complexity theory, as well as those areas of science in which  applications are explored.       Historically, by speeding certain fundamental scientific  computations, the ``classical'' FFT has had a tremendous impact on  society.  It is one of the most important algorithmic tools in  digital signal processing and as such plays a key role in such  areas as medical imaging, defense, telecommunications, and high  performance computing.  The utility of the classical FFT is an  indicator that perhaps similar success may be obtained from  applying these newly developed generalized FFT's.  Applications  towards more efficient use of high performance computing networks  (the information superhighway) are under investigation.  The  investigator and his colleagues continue to apply generalized  FFT's in statistics and data analysis.  Specific applications in  climate modelling and structural chemistry have also been  identified and are being pursued.",
