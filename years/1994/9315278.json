The co-  organizers are Professor David Cane, Department  of Chemistry, Brown University, and Professor  Katsumi Kakinuma, Department of Chemistry,  Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan.  In  addition to senior scientist, the seminar will  bring together promising junior investigators  and graduate students from both countries.    This is the fourth is a series of seminars on  this topic.  Previous seminars have had a  profound impact of the development of research  on biosynthesis in the two countries.  The  broadening interdisciplinary scope of the field  of natural product biosynthesis has made these  seminars increasingly important as a means of  bringing together scientists from different  disciplines, particularly bioorganic chemists,  enzymologists, and molecular biologists.   Participants have been selected from a wide  range of academic laboratories and research  institutes, national laboratories, and  pharmaceutical and biotechnology research  laboratories in both countries.  The  interactions between senior investigators and  the next generation of scientists will ensure  the continued vitality of this field.  This  seminar is also being supported by the National  Science Foundation's Division of Molecular and  Cellular Biosciences and the Division of  Chemistry.  ***",
