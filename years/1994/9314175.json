The researchers will investigate the performance of an X-80 steel  in sour environments, particularly at temperatures above 100  degrees C.  They aim to obtain a full characterization of the  microstructure and strength of received and heat-treated steels,  and expose fracture-mechanics specimens to sour environments by  means of direct current electrical potential drop methods for  continuous monitoring of crack growth.    Steel microstructure characterization will be done at UNAM while  the U.S. side will focus on the continuous monitoring of crack  propagation rates under sour gas environments.  Expected outcomes  of this work include the determination of the influence of  temperature on steel resistance to sour environments, correlation  of steel properties and microstructural features with conditions  for crack growth and severity of damage, and further insights on  the role of alloying additions and steel strength on its  susceptibility to cracking under various testing environments.  ***",
