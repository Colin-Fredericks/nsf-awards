 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curtiss  Computer assisted analysis has evolved to a point that  access to several advanced technologies is, or soon will be,  indispensable for the conduct of modern biological research.  Advances in the sensitivity ranges of isotopic detection and  the ability to digitize, record and analyze data has reached  the level where computer assisted acquisition, analysis and  storage of data is no longer a luxury but a necessity  required by those wishing to remain current and competitive.  The Computer-Based Electrophoresis Analyzer and Phosphor  Imager will serve as shared equipment to provide the primary  functions of data acquisition, analysis, and storage for  members of the Department of Biology.  Increased sensitivity  of isotopic detection and digitization of a wide range of  sample media have resulted in the chance to explore  questions previously considered unanswerable due to  limitations of detection methods.  These technological  advances in turn provide a formidable amount of data which  can often overwhelm manual analysis and even traditional  software programs.  The goal of these proposed acquisitions  is the efficient use by the maximum number of participating  scientists of instruments which cannot be afforded in  individual laboratories.  Funds are requested to purchase  (i) an Optical Electrophoresis Analyzer, consisting of CCD  Camera, workstation, and accompanying software, and (ii) a  phosphor imaging system consisting of scanning module,  workstation, and accompanying software. The Department will  provide other essential equipment, including phosphor  storage screens, auxiliary software, and installation of the  Ethernet networking system to allow maximum usage of all  equipment by those in the Department.  The equipment will be  supervised by Drs. Roy Curtiss III and Robert Landick.  Use  by graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and faculty  will be scheduled so as to make maximum use of the equipment  to advance research progress by all participants.",
