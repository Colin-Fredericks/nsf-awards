This  department is one of the leading research institutions for chemical engineering  in the United States, ranking consistently in the top 15 departments nationwide  on the basis of Ph. D. degrees awarded.  This renovation project will modernize  a substantial fraction of their wet lab space that  was built in the 1920s and is  now obsolete.  The NSF support will also permit renovations that are badly  needed in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The  renovation will support research activities in Process Design and Control,  Polymer Engineering, Applied Theoretical Chemistry, and Catalysis and  Reaction Engineering.  The improved facilities capabilities will strengthen both  programs focused on experimental studies of materials and surfaces as well as  programs emphasizing computational modeling research.  Finally, the renovated  laboratories will also impact graduate training in the scientific areas involved.",
