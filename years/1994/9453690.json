The 1992 ASEE Annual Conference in Toledo, Ohio marked  the seventh year that the Division for Experimentation and  Laboratory-Oriented Studies (DELOS) of ASEE and the National  Science Foundation cooperated in holding sessions at which grantees  from the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program have  presented their results, and the first time that this work was  supported by NSF.  The current NSF Grant covers the expenses for  this operation through the 1994 ASEE Annual Conference.  These  sessions have proven to be immensely successful as measured in both  quality and, especially recently, quantity of presentations.  At  the last three years' meetings, the number of papers have selected  for greater exposition in a separate session.  All of the papers in  both the poster and paper sessions are eligible for inclusion in  the reviewed proceedings of the conference.  Our DELOS group, working with NSF, sends out a \"call for papers\"  through the U.S. Mail to grantees from the ILI Program from recent  years.  We ask them to submit an abstract, through E-mail if  possible, to be reviewed for inclusion in the poster session. After  reviewing these abstracts and notifying the authors, we ask for a  complete paper to be reviewed for inclusion in the proceedings.   These complete papers are the basis for selection in the technical  paper session.  Again, authors are notified about the review.  As  much of this procedure as can be handled through E-mail is, but  there are always many things which need to be handled through  Express Mail, regular mail (if time permits, which it rarely does  on this tight schedule), FAX, and telephone. With so many excellent  presenters to be heard from, the costs for putting on these  sessions is excessive.  NSF has provided financial assistance under  the following arrangements.  Dr. Lawrence J. Gen alo (DELOS Chair - 1992 and current PI for grant  number DUE 9255358), of Iowa State University, will continue to  serve as the principal investigator on this project.  The three  year award should begin May 1, 1995 in order to help defray and  costs for the 1995 conference sessions.  Dr. Ed Roche, Jr. and Dr.  C. Stewart Slater will serve as consultants on the grant.  This  will allow them to receive travel allowances and reimbursement for   expenses directly from Iowa State without having to compound the  indirect costs at their own schools.  Our schools will, in effect,  be contributing out time in this endeavor.  Additional funding  necessary for travel, and not covered by proposed budget, will be  provided by Iowa State University.  DELOS will assume any  additional costs with mailing, phone, etc. which are not covered by  the proposed budget.",
