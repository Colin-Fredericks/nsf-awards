 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313951  Darensbourg    The primary purpose of this U.S.-Hungary research project between  Dr. Donald J. Darensbourg of Texas A&M University and Dr. Ferenc  Joo of Kossuth University, Debrecen, Hungary, is to explore the  special effects which should be considered when water is used as  a solvent in organometallic catalytic processes.  To do this, the  researchers will study the use of aqueous solutions as media for  reactions catalyzed by organometallic complexes with sulphonated  tertiary phosphine or phosphaadamantane ligands.  Four areas will  be examined in detail: 1) hydrogen transfer reactions; 2)  reactions of water-soluble phosphines with aldehydes and olefins;  3) reactions of carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions; and 4) new  reagents for organometallic chemistry in aqueous solutions.   Results are expected to improve our understanding of the  properties of catalyst recovery and recycle-ability afforded by  catalytic chemical processes carried out in aqueous solutions.    This project in organic chemistry fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and  pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  ***",
