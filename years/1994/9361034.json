 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361034  Buchholtz  Improving the wear-endurance-lifetimes of sputtered MoS2 on  Titanium (Ti) alloys represents an enabling technology for these  alloys.  Colorado Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) proposes  to pretreat Ti-6A1-4V surfaces by elevated-temperature-ion-  implantation and reactive-ion-beam-sputter-deposition to produce  ceramic surface layers, which will significantly (i.e., 2 orders  of magnitude) improve the wear-endurance-lifetimes of sputtered  MoS2.  Ceramic layers that exhibit a range of electronic (band  gap) properties will be formed on Ti-6A1-4V substrate surfaces.  Pretreated substrate surfaces will be characterized by X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy to establish the binding  energies/chemical states of elements important in the bonding  process.  Scratch adhesion tests on the MoS2/pretreated  substrates will be performed to establish the three best  pretreatments.  Wear-endurance-lifetimes tests will then be  performed, in an argon atmosphere, on specimens exhibiting the  greatest adhesion.  Correlations of ceramic electronic properties  with MoS2 tribological performance will be made.  Preparation of  pretreated substrates and mechanism gears for commercial coating  vendors to apply their specific tribo-coatings is a viable  product.  Increased use of Ti gearing in mechanisms and  transmissions will result in reduced weight of space and  terrestrial vehicles and increased fuel efficiency.  ***",
