 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415829  STERN   The maturation of the U.S. Global Change Research Program   (US/GCRP) has placed greater emphasis on research on the human   dimensions of global change, including the policy sciences.  The   US/GCRP also is looking to develop more effective methods for   conducting integrated assessments that examine the nature and   timing of physical, biological, and human systems as well as   interactions among those sets of systems and policy options for   adapting to or mitigating global change.  Agencies like NSF that   collectively manage the US/GCRP traditionally have looked to the   National Academy of Sciences and the component parts of the   National Research Council to provide guidance and feedback   regarding planning and conduct of the program.  As human   dimensions research reaches critical new stages, the NRC   Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change will conduct a   two-day workshop to examine two closely related issues:    (1) research needs across the breadth of the human dimensions of   global change and in specific areas, such as the policy sciences   and methods for integrated assessments; and (2) strengths and   weaknesses of various modes of research support (ranging from   support for individual investigators to support for centers),   including consideration of the relative balance among different   modes.  This two-day workshop will take place in June 1994 in   Washington, with roughly two dozen leading social scientists   gathering to share their experiences and opinions with respect to   these issues.  A written summary of comments will be made   available within a few months of the conclusion of the workshop   in order to allow others to benefit from the ideas presented at   the workshop.   Through this workshop, leaders of human dimensions and other   global change programs in NSF and other US/GCRP agencies will   have to opportunity to hear directly from leading research   scientists.  The discussions at the workshop also will provide   NSF officials  with valuable information as it develops plans for   possible new modes of research support to facilitate research on   the human dimensions of global change.",
