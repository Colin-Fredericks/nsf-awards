 "awd_abstract_narration": "94114404 Altman  The mechanism of metal etching reactions will be  studied using high speed variable temperature STM along with  macroscopic surface analysis techniques.  The project will focus on  halogen etching of copper because of interest in using copper as an  interconnect material in integrated circuits.  The study will  concentrate on the two major reaction steps in halogen etching of  copper:  1)copper halide formation and  2)halide removal by  sublimation and/or reaction.  The factors that limit etching rates  will be directly determined through STM \"movies\" monitoring the  surface under etching conditions.  A mechanistic kinetic model  based on the elementary reaction steps observed with STM will be  developed.  The results will guide development of new etching  processes and new etching schemes to directly pattern fine metal  lines. %%% This research is anticipated to provide an atomic-level  understanding of etching reactions that are an important step in  integrated circuit fabrication.  This understanding will aid  development of new etching processes to allow new materials to be  used in integrated circuits.  The use of new materials will be  required to continue the trend of increased device speed and  decreased device size into the next century.  The results of this  research will have an impact on the fabrication and general  perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in  computing, information processing, and tele communica tions.  ***",
