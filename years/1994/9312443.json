 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steven Schwartz is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical research in the   application of evolution operators to condensed phase systems consisting   of a few quantum degrees of freedom in contact with a solvent bath.  This   model is useful for theoretical treatments of chemical reactions in the   presence of solvent.  Schwartz has developed a propagator expansion   resummation technique which shows significant promise in terms of   improved accuracy and range of applicability for treating many   dimensional chemical reactions.  He plans to apply this theory to the   elucidation of the mechanism of rate processes in multiple pulse ligand   photolysis experiments on hemoglobin.    A great deal of progress has been made in the theoretical treatment of   gas phase chemical reactions of systems consisting of relatively few   atoms.  Using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, it is now possible to   explain a great deal of the experimental detail for such systems.    However, the large majority of reactions which are of interest to   chemists occur in condensed phase systems in the presence of solvent.    The theoretical models for treating such complex systems are in a much   earlier stage of development.  Schwartz is developing new theoretical   approaches for dealing with solvated chemical systems undergoing chemical   reactions where quantum effects may be important.",
