Replacement instrumentation is for campus wide research and student training on the St. Paul Campus of the University of Minnesota. The XRMA replacement sought is a workstation based analyzer capable of simultaneous energy dispersive X ray microanalysis from two light element detectors installed on existing instruments located in separate rooms. The replacement instrumentation would also provide for electronic image capture and storage, image analysis capabilities, and have a networking interface with Ethernet. The requested replacement instrument is an integral part of current and future campus wide biological and life science research needs.    On going student training and research capabilities would be greatly enhanced by \"state of the art\" replacement instrumentation. Current research efforts, with state and national priorities, benefiting immediately from the proposal for a replacement instrument are: a) Wood decomposition and bioprocessing of lignin removal for paper products; b) Disease and pest resistance in plants; c) Elemental distribution research in plants aimed at reducing fertilizer needs; d) Forest water quality and applied ecology of lakes, streams and rivers; and, e) Atmospheric acid deposition and pesticide residue research in soil chemistry and physics.    Replacement instrumentation is to be located in the  Cooperative Electron Optics Facility (CEOF) in the Christensen Laboratory building on the St. Paul Campus. This multiple user facility has been in operation since 1969, is supported by the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station, and serves campus wide needs in analytical electron microscopy and XRMA. The CEOF is centrally located on the St. Paul Campus, has 11 rooms, 2 ultramicrotomes, vacuum evaporators, darkrooms and preparation laboratories. No renovation or remodeling is necessary to accept the proposed instrument replacement.     u    ~ s  t  # # # # # # # # # #   # # #  e# # # #!#\"###$#%#&#'#(#)#*#+#,#-#.#/#0#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9#:#;#<#=#>#?#@#A#B#C#D#E#F#G#H#I#J#K#L#M#N#O#P#Q#R#S#T#U#V#W#  Y#Z# #\\# #^#_#`#a#b#c#d#  f#g#h#o#   #  m#n#  p#q#r#s#t#        y#                 # # # # # #                                 # #           #                                                                  9313813  Zeyen  Replacement of a 15 year old energy dispersive X ray Micronanalysis Unit (XRMA) on an existing scanning electron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            6   8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  !          !         !         !         !
