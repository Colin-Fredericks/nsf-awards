 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320136  Hay    The proposal will develop a  technique that provides a quantitative  link between climate model data and geological observations.  Until  now the only means of assessing the validity of paleoclimate model  data as a description of past conditions has been in terms of  subjective, often global scale generalities (eg.  Does the model  reproduce the meridional temperature gradient?;  Would the winds  cause upwelling and deposition of organic carbon?).  There has been  no way to compare the model results with the occurrence of  geological deposits except in general terms.  We believe that the  technique proposed will allow quantitative comparison of model  results with geologic data, showing  whether or not the model  accurately predicts conditions of formation of a specific deposit.   This quantitative comparison will enable modelers to determine what  input parameters need to be changed to come closer to simulating  the ancient climate.  The proposal was submitted as an SGER because  the technique, if developed, could be used by a number of modelers  to evaluate paleoclimate studies to be run in the near future.   Until the technique has been worked out the paleoclimate model  runs, representing a large amount of valuable supercomputer time  will not result in data that can be used for quantitative  validation.  SGER is appropriate because of the urgent need to  define the technique before planned  and proposed GENESIS  paleoclimate model runs are initiated.  ***",
