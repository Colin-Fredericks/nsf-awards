 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308485  Pugh    Bis(rotaxane) monomers and polyrotaxane networks based on  oxyethylene repeat units will be synthesized. This is a new  topology for both monomers and polymer networks.  Comparison of  statistical and directed threading under standard conditions, as  well as under conditions which induce hydrophobic and solvophobic  interactions will provide a through study of the extent of  threading the bis(macrocrown ether)s to form monomers and polymer  networks.  The extent of threaded vs. dangling macrocrown ethers  will be determined from model systems containing hydrolyzable  crosslinks.  Absolute molecular weight of the linear polyrotaxane  precursors and hydrolyzed products will be determined.  Previously  undetermined solution properties of linear polyrotaxanes, including  size, shape and second virial coefficients, will be determined by  micro-batch light scattering measurements.    The non-covalent nature of the bicyclic crosslinks should provide  the networks with maximum microscopic mobility, and at the same  time, maintain the macroscopic shape.  This structural design  should therefore result in an amorphous network of low glass  transition temperatures.  The polyrotaxane networks will be  composed almost exclusively of oxyethylene repeat units, which is  the optimum chemical structure for ion mobility in polymer  electrolytes.  The minimal topological constraints could  potentially result in polymer electrolytes with unusually high room  temperature ionic conductivities.  Solid polymer electrolytes are  of interest for chemical sensors and devices, and for thin film  battery applications, including expensive uses such as laptop  computers, pace makers and electric automobiles.  ***",
