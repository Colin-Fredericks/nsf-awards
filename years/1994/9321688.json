The project will study  the role that South Africa's Civic Association movement has played in hastening political reform and  nurturing norms of civic participation among previously disenfranchised black South Africans.  The research will focus case studies on three communities (Lawaaikamp, Port Elizabeth, and Grahamstown)  in the Eastern Cape, an area with the longest history of politicization, which, however, has been relatively neglected in research.  The principal methods used will be interviews, participant observation, and archival research.  The candidate's research will be linked to ongoing projects on Civic Associations that are being conducted at two universities in other regions of the country.  She will participate in workshops organized by Dr. Tom Lodge at the University of Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg,  and will also be associated with Dr. Thomazile Botha's Local Government and Planning Policy Research Project at the University of the Western Cape, in Capetown.    This study by a promising young researcher will be a valuable contribution to comparative studies as well as to scholarship on South Africa.  It would illuminate the role that organizations of civil society play in the emergence of democratic states in developing countries.  The collaboration with South African scholars will build professional relationships that can be expect ed to endure throughout the individuals' careers.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           r   t   !   &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !         !         !           !
