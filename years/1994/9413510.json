 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at SUNY-Stony Brook acquire a 500 MHz NMR, and an upgrade of an AMX 600  MHz NMR to a DMX600 MHz NMR which will be used in research.  The research activity to  be supported includes the structural investigations of five major users who work in organic  chemistry and in biological chemistry; the research includes studies of steroidal diamines as  DNA-targeted antibiotics, of electronic effects in face selection in addition and elimination  processes, of applications of the  -lactam synthon method and of  4+4  photocycloaddition  processes in approaches to taxol analogs, and of the configurations of synthetic oxidosqualene  cyclase and squalene epoxidase inhibitors.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, charcterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in  biology.",
