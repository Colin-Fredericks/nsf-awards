 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the acquisition of a SQUID  magnetometer to conduct a variety of research projects in  superlattices, multilayers, granular solids, metastable  alloys, low dimensional quantum magnets, and other systems  with low-dimensional magnetic and superconducting entities,  funded by the NSF. These samples will be fabricated by  multisource advanced sputter deposition, molecular beam  epitaxy and single crystal growth. These systems are  designed to reveal finite-size effects and dimensional  crossover in magnetic and superconducting systems with  various correlation lengths. The realization and the origin  of magnetic surface anisotropy and perpendicular  magnetization will be investigated. Surface and interfacial  magnetism of a variety of heterostructures and superlattices  grown by MBE will be studied. In superconductor/magnetic  multilayers, experiments are proposed to investigate the  relationship between the effects on superconductivity and  the magnetic ordering and conductivity of the magnetic  layers. A number of metastable solid systems will be studied  in order to reveal new properties in structures unattainable  by conventional methods. Low dimensional antiferromagnets  provide unique opportunities to explore quantum many-body  effects. Various issues of the giant magneto-transport  properties in granular magnetic systems will be explored.  These are problems of fundamental interest, many of them  having important technological implications. In all these  studies, a high sensitivity SQUID magnetometer with low-  field and variable frequency capabilities is imperative.    Funds are requested for the acquisition of a superconducting  quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer, the most  sensitive type of magnetometers, to conduct a variety of  research projects in superlattices, multilayers, granular  solids, metastable alloys, low dimensional quantum magnets,  and other systems with low-dimensional magnetic and  superconducting entities, funded by the NSF. These a re  problems of fundamental interest, many of them having  important technological applications, such as magnetic  recording media, field-sensing elements in magnetic  recording heads, and superconducting devices.",
