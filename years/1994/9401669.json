Trieste, Italy in September  1994.  The meeting will focus on experimental and  theoretical aspects of biomolecules: structure,  dynamics and solvent effects.  The U.S. organizer for  this meeting is Dr. Horacio Farach of the University  of South Carolina, Columbia.    The International Center was established to promote  research by scientists from developing countries as an  effort to contribute to the growth and development of  Third World technology.  It supports research  activities in high energy and solid state physics,   provides a range of advanced courses and conferences,  and offers a full program of visits in all branches of  physics, biophysics, biotechnology and applied  mathematics.  The proposed meeting will give  researchers from developing countries an opportunity  to be in direct contact with leaders in the field and  obtain a systematic, up-to-date knowledge of the  present status of their own and related research  fields.  Lecturers, in turn, will obtain a first-hand  view of development problems in third world countries,  particularly with regard to academic research, and  will gain an international view of the field of  biophysics and a broadened perspective of its  applications.    ***",
