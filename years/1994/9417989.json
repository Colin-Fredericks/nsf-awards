This work was published and will be used to guide the analysis of secondary data acquired from the Center for Research on Women at Memphis State University, and from the Family Data Archives    The implications for the results of the data analyses are present for furthering theories about the development of African American and European American middle class managerial and professional women, adaptive strategies, and techniques for success that have only been discussed briefly in the literature.  The Principal Investigator's work in progress currently examines the gender role development among women in Latin America to determine the relationship between societal expectations and orientation and the impact on stress as it occurs within the work and family nexus.",
