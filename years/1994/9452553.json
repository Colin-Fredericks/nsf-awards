 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452553  Boda  The major thrust of this work is to integrate a unique, newly  implemented two-year Associate Degree Program in Electron  Microscopy and its laboratory facility with other instructional  areas within our college. Target areas for integration include: (1)  a two-year program in Biotechnology, (2) a two-year program in  Welding in particular Metallurgy courses, (3) Chemistry courses,  (4) the Biological Sciences, (5) Geology, (6) two-year programs in  the Health Professions, and (7) Image Processing. The mechanism of  integration will involve: (1) the initiation and expanded use of  elective research credits creating joint projects between electron  microscopy students and students from other areas, (2) faculty and  students from other disciplines using our microscopy laboratory  facility, and (3) the microscopy facility being used for  demonstrations and instructional presentation by faculty from other  instructional areas. In addition, we hope to implement a course for  electron microscopy students involving projects supervised by  industry and/or other educational institutions.  This goal, if  realized, will allow non-microscopy students the rare opportunity  to discover and understand how electron microscopy impacts their  areas of major study. The exchange will afford microscopy students  a valuable opportunity to experience the broad range of microscope  utilization by the many disciplines and academic areas routinely  using electron microscopy.    The electron microscopy laboratory facility is adequate to meet  this increased student and faculty use except for x-ray  microanalysis and image processing capability. Currently only one  scanning electron microscope is equipped with both capabilities.  Our plan is to obtain an x-ray analyzer capable of image processing  and interfacing it with two x-ray detectors (one is already on  hand) installed to two scanning electrons microscopes (also on  hand). Thus, two microscopes can have this capability for little  more cost than a sin gle microscope installation.  ***",
