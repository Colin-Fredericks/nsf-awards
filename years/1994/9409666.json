The main objective of the research  is to synthesize cost-effective system architectures for  designing such multimedia servers by developing:  (1)  efficient disk scheduling algorithms which minimize the  average access time to media blocks from disk, (2) novel  admission control algorithms that a multimedia server can  employ to maximize the number of clients being serviced  simultaneously while assuring the quality of service  requirements of none of the clients are violated, and (3)  algorithms for efficient placement (including replication  and distribution as desirable) of multiresolution multimedia  objects of disk arrays.  Algorithms and protocols that are  found to be promising will be implemented and evaluated in a  prototype distributed multimedia storage server. ***",
