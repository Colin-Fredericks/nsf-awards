The  consortium will design fresh, comprehensive, and coordinated  approaches to reform science teacher preparation involving  intra-institutional and inter-institutional collaboration.  Faculties in the departments of biology, chemistry, physics,  mathematics, and science education from Florida A&M  University, University of Florida, University of South  Florida, Bethune Cookman University, and Florida Memorial  University, along with lead science teachers from Leon, Dade,  and Volusia School Districts, will convene for two weekends.   They will develop an articulated program model for a four-  year comprehensive curriculum for teacher preparation in  science education in the areas of biology, chemistry, and  physics at the five major institutions.  The program will be  characterized by interdisciplinary experiences, use of new  pedagogies, and clinical experiences.  The curriculum model  will be disseminated throughout the U.S. through newsletters  and professional journals.  ***y",
