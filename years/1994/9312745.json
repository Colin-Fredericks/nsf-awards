Emphasis is given  to location of finite-dimensional sensors and actuators.  These  problems, being the inverse problems for partial differential  equations of traditional interest, have received considerable  attention in the literature, mostly in the linear time-invariant  setting.  On the basis of harmonic and nonharmonic analysis it was  shown that in this case observability and controllability of the  system in question depend crucially upon the associated eigenvalues  (in particular, upon their growth and multiplicity) and,  consequently, stationary finite-dimensional sensors and actuators  often fail when the space dimension is higher than 1.  The research  proposed here is aimed to overcome this difficulty on the basis of  the introduction of spatially scanning observations and control.   In the above context, the proposed methodology mostly deals with  the eigenfunctions, while employing in the case of the heat  equation, for example, only the sign of the eigenvalues.    It is planned to study the interrelation between continuous-time  and discrete-time observations and controls for the above systems,  interpreting the discrete-time setting as a skeleton for the  continuous-time one.  The objective of research here is to develop  a methodology (introduced in our previous studies) that allows us  to replace continuous-time sensors and actuators, the spatially-  averaged ones, associated with the set-valued mappings will also be  studied.  The latter is a natural generalization of the notion of  pointwise observations/control for the case of discontinuous  generalized solutions, allowing us to ensure the well-posedness of  the finite-dimensional observation and control.  ***",
