 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457260  Roberts  This is an award to support research through a National Science  Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the  Principal Investigator who was nominated and selected through  procedures contained in NSF 93-148, Young Investigator Awards FY  1994 Program.  This investigator's research plan involves work on  the interactions of trace metal ions with inorganic ligands.  These have important ramifications with respect to the manner by  which metals exert their toxic effects such as influencing the  mechanisms that are involved in formation of toxic methylated  metal species by sulfate-reducing bacteria.  This work involves  development of techniques for investigating the mechanisms of  electron transfer in reductive dehalogenation reactions of  polyhalogenated alkanes.    The treatment of contaminated soils and aquifers by stimulating  abiotic or microbial reduction can result in byproducts that are  relatively persistent and toxic as well as others that are  readily biodegraded.  Results of this research may be applied in  engineering design of systems for remediation of contaminated  soil and aquifers to avoid the formation of byproducts that are  relatively persistent and toxic.",
