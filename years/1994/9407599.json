Upon release of the neurotransmitter at the cleft,  neurotransmitter transporters contribute to the removal of  transmitter into the presynaptic terminal.  This limits the  duration of the neurotransmitter action, and is thought to  play a major role in maintaining neurotransmitter  availability at a variety of synapses.    The precise molecular mechanisms which regulate the activity  of the neurotransmitter transporters are only beginning to  be elucidated.  Moreover, such work has not yet addressed  the developmental and functional significance of perturbing  these mechanisms in vivo.  This application proposes to  build upon our recent cloning of Drosphila neurotransmitter  transporter cDNAs to examine the regulation of these  important proteins.  The choice of Drosophila enables us to  bring to bear some of the unique advantages of this model  system (such as the facility in generating both transgenic  animals as well as mutations specific to genetic loci) on  these important questions.    These studies will take advantage of recombinant DNA  methodology to (1) identify the specific neurotransmitter  substrate for each of the transporters isolated thus far,  and (2) to initiate a molecular genetic analysis of the  transporter loci.  These initial studies will lay the  groundwork for future experiments that will assess the  developmental and  functional consequences in vivo of  perturbing reuptake regulatory mechanisms by introducing  altered transporter genes into the genome of  Drosphila.  These studies will increase our comprehension of the role  that neurotransmitter transporters play in synaptic  transmission.",
