Study subjects will  include female and male disputants and legal professionals  participating in domestic violence cases at the Regional  Tribunal.  Anthropological methods, including structured and  unstructured interviews, court observations, and participant  observation will elicit information on a number of subjects  pertaining to law and domestic violence.  The chief objective of  this study is to determine to what extent the law provides a  means for challenging domestic violence, and, alternatively, in  what measure it maintains the conditions enabling domestic  violence to persist.  To pursue this objective, three sets of  questions will be investigated:  (1) what beliefs do female and  male disputants hold regarding the law, gender, and violence, and  how do these beliefs shape the demands disputants make on the  legal system?; (2) how do legal professionals interpret the law,  and how does this affect their handling of cases and case  outcomes?; and (3) do case outcomes offer remedies for women  facing domestic violence?  Information obtained from this  research will be of potential use to legal professionals and  scholars in the United States, Senegal, and the rest of the  Islamic world.",
