 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316969  Hardie       In the last 10 or so years that TEM studies have unveiled the  true nature of the internal architecture of natural calcian  dolomites, revealing diversity of heterogeneous microstructures  occurring on a scale of one to a few thousand Angstroms.  It is  clear from electron microscopy on sedimentary dolomites that one of  the root causes of the \"dolomite problem\" lies in the existence of  energy barriers to cation ordering and phase separation inherent in  the dolomite crystal structure at low formation temperatures.  This  inability to reach thermodynamic equilibrium leads to a host of  compromise edifices built of compositionally and/or structurally  different domains with dimensions of only a few hundred Angstroms.   Thus, calcian dolomites display a range of structural modifications  and are characterized with the electron microscope by heterogeneous  microstructures, such as chemical or structural modulations.         Case studies integrating field, petrographic geochemical, SEM,  and TEM observations are essential if we are to make progress in  bringing together the atomic-scale features of the mineral dolomite  with the microscopic and macroscopic features of stratigraphic  bodies of the rock dolomite.  We propose to carry out such an  integrated study that compares three dolomite bodies different from  each other in age, scale, and style of dolomitization.  The three  dolomite bodies wee have chosen for study are the Triassic Latemar  Limestone of northern Italy, the Holocene tidal flat carbonates of  the Bahamas and Florida, and the Cambro-Ordovician platform  carbonates of the central Appalachians.  We have chosen these  particular dolomite-bearing carbonates because (1) we have  extensive experience with all of them, (2) they present a spectrum  of dolomitization features yet they have in common a most important  characteristic, namely, they all preserve dolomite-CaCO3 phase  boundaries at both the outcrop and the microscope scales, (3)they  record a variety of do lomitization environments that range from  low-temperature supratidal conditions (Holocene and Triassic  dolomites) through shallow to deep burial conditions (Cambro-  Ordovician dolomites) to 200C hydrothermal conditions (Triassic  dolomites).       By making the study a comparative one carried out on dolomite  bodies with significantly different microscopic and macroscopic  properties related to their different environments of  dolomitization, we hope to uncover diagnostic differences in the  reaction mechanisms and in the microstructures of the dolomites at  the atomic scale and in the intracrystalline geochemistry as  determined by TEM and AEM analyses.  In particular, we will attempt  to:  1) relate dolomite microstructures and fine-scale chemical  variations to the environment of dolomitization; (2) relate  dolomite microstructures to reaction mechanisms such as crystal  growth into passive voids, fabric-retentive and fabric-destructive  replacement, and annealling recrystallization; (3) combine 1 and 2  to link reaction mechanism to dolomitization environment.       The origin of dolomite remains one of the major unresolved  problems in geochemistry.  Resolution of this \"dolomite problem\"  has considerable economic significance because many sedimentary  dolomite bodies are hosts to gas, oil, and hydrothermal ore  deposits.",
