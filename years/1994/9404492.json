 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404492  Drugan                  Previous attempts to obtain analytical solutions for the  stress and deformation fields near a dynamically propagating  crack in elastic-plastic material have employed the strong  assumption that the fields admit variable-separable near-tip  solutions in the polar coordinates r, theta centered at the tip.  Comparisons of these results with an exact crack-line solution  for Mode III, and with detailed numerical finite element  solutions, show that their radius of validity is so small as to  render them physically inapplicable. A new analytical approach is  proposed that avoids the overly restrictive separability  assumption. The approach combines asymptotic analysis of the  governing equations in distance r from the crack tip with a  singular perturbation analysis in the crack Mach number (crack  growth speed/elastic shear wave speed) that utilizes coordinate  straining. Since the approach thus builds on quasi-static crack  growth solutions, it will make use of the recently-derived   analytical family of plane strain near-tip solutions, and also  their analytical extension to very large regions of validity,  obtained by the proposer. While the research proposed involves  analyzing one of the simplest physically realistic  elastic-plastic material models for initial study, it is  anticipated that the work will provide a new mathematical tool  for deriving analytical solutions for dynamic elastic-plastic  crack growth in more sophisticated materials models also         The proposed research seeks to develop analytical solutions,  valid over a physically significant size scale, for the stress  and deformation fields near the tip of a rapidly propagating  crack in elastic-plastic materials such as ductile metals. More  generally, we seek to develop mathematical methods for finding   such solutions for rapid crack growth in general material types.  These solutions will provide a fundamental understanding of how  the material near a rapidly propagating crack tip behaves , and  since this near-tip material region controls whether and how the  crack will grow, the solutions sought will serve as the basis for  analytical crack growth and stability criteria. We seek to   predict, among other things, how the material's resistance to  crack growth is affected by crack propagation speed. Dynamic  fracture can occur when a cracked structural component is loaded  beyond the stability level, or when it is subjected to impact  loading, or when it experiences a thermal shock.  Predictions of  the ensuing rapid crack growth, facilitated by the results  anticipated from this research, are crucial for accurate design  and safety assessments.",
