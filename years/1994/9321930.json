 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321930  TOBIN  Major disasters focus attention on the need for a better  understanding of the ways that individuals and communities assess  threats beforehand and react to events after catastrophic events.  Geographers and other social scientists have been concerned with  a variety of factors that affect underlying attitudes, reactions,  and behaviors associated with living in a hazardous area and/or  experiencing a catastophic event. This Small Grant for  Exploratory Research will provide support for a team of  experienced scientists to explore the psychological impact of the  massive flooding in the Midwest during the summer of 1993 on  residents of two different communities, one urban (Des Moines,  Iowa) and the other rural (Hartsburg, Missouri). The researchers  will be able to modify a survey form that has already proven  successful in a similar investigation of elderly residents near  the Trinity River in Texas, thus providing an excellent point of  comparison. The questionnaire also includes key questions that  were asked of Des Moines residents before the flooding. The study  will focus on three levels of factors influencing stress: the  primary level, including individual characteristics; the  secondary level, focussing on the degree of homogeneity within  the neighborhood; and the tertiary level, mainly the distinction  between urban and rural communities.       This project will provide new insights into the general  principles governing human attitudes and behaviors in hazardous  environments. It should prove especially useful to policy efforts  that attempt to institute pre-event mitigation as well as those  efforts designed to help victims cope after disastrous events.  The research will clarify the special roles which might be played  by the different types of communities in shaping the attitudes of  residents towards the hazard potential and in responding to  specific disasters.  ***",
