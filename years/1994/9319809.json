 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319809 Komarneni  Research will be carried out to develop a  fundamental understanding of  new nanocomposite materials having  novel dielectric properties.  We will employ a compositional  nanocomposite strategy using two or more sols of the barium,  strontium, lead titanates, as well as lithium and lead niobates to  radically change the sintering behavior and properties compared to  materials made from single phase gels derived from alkoxides, and  traditional oxide mixes.  In addition to these processing  innovations, we propose to make new materials with potentially  different properties focusing on three classes of applications:   relaxor ferroelectrics with high permittivity and electrostrictive  coefficients; nanocomposites with conducting grains and insulating  boundaries; and product-property nanocomposites.  Encapsulation of  nanoparticles in a second solution before hydrolysis will be used  to make composites, and sol-gel spin coating will be used to make  superlattice structures with different ferroelectric materials.    %%% Electroceramic materials will be prepared using a new  processing approach which involves very fine particles that react  to form the desired material faster and at considerably lower  temperature than with other processing methods.  New materials with  novel properties will be  made by designing mixtures on a very  small scale.  This strategy of making ferroelectric materials is  expected to result in enhanced densification at lower sintering  temperatures which can lead to considerable energy savings for the  capacitor industry.  New materials with novel properties that are  expected to result from this research may lead to new applications.   An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing research.   ***",
