This is a unique gathering at  India's premier institution where some of the  world's most eminent physicists will be  discussing topical areas in modern theoretical  physics.  Cumrun Vafa, Lyman Laboratory,  Harvard University, and Sumit Das, Tata  Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay are  the principal organizers.  Subjects to be  covered at the meeting include String Theory,  Quantum Gravity, Lattice Field Theories,  Stochastic Processes, Field Theoretic Aspects  of Condensed Matter Physics and Mathematics and  Quantun Field Theory.  In each of these areas,  a growing number of Indian physicists are  making important contributions in a sustained   manner.   Scope: There is a high level of interaction  between Indian physicists and their U.S.  colleagues, many of which have resulted in  fruitful exchanges of ideas and collaborations,  and are likely to continue to foster  significant developments in the future.       The colloquium will serve the dual purpose of  getting together leading experts in a given  area and fostering interaction across areas.   The meeting will benefit students and  researchers from India and neighboring  countries and is likely to foster significant  collaborations between U.S. and Indian  scientists.     ***",
