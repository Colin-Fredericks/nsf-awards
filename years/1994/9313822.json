U.S. investigators, Nobumichi  Shimizu and Peter Kelemen of Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution, J. Quick of the U.S. Geological Survey and G.  Wasserburg of the California Institute of Technology, will  collaborate on studies of the Oman ophiolite with French  investigators, Aldophe Nicolas and Delphine Bosch of the  University of Montpellier, II.  Ophiolites are exposed sections  of the ocean's crust formed by volcanic and igneous rock  accretions at mid ocean spreading centers.  The objective is to  conduct integrated field and laboratory studies of mantle  periodites and melt migration in mantle rocks as preserved in the  Oman ophiolite. This ophiolite is especially suitable due to its  exposure and thickness of its residual mantle. The results of the  study will advance understanding of the physical processes  involved in mid-ocean ridges and formation of oceanic crust.    The U.S. and French groups will carry out extensive sampling in  northern Oman followed by data analysis and meetings in the U.S.  The investigators cover many disciplines including structural  geology, petrology, trace element geochemistry, and isotope  geochemistry.  The project takes advantage of significant French  expertise on the Oman ophiolite and provides access to detailed  structural mapping developed by the French group.  ***",
