Project  Earthlink educational efforts focus on the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change assessments; the effects of human  actions on the environment; and the use of information  technologies for informed decision making.  These  educational efforts promote general awareness about global  change issues as well as enhanced accessibility to related  information and technologies, benefiting students at all  levels and the public at large.  These focus areas are  consistent with the goals of the Committee on Environment  and Natural Resources and the newly released \"Science in the  National Interest\" report from President Clinton.  Activities sponsored by Project Earthlink include a resource  guide for use by teachers and informal educators, a video  conference for teachers (May 1994), a Global Change  Education Conference (August 1994), and an Informal  Educators Workshop (November 1994).         Member agencies of the CENR/SGCR have reviewed the  merits of this program and have decided to support these  educational activities in Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995.  This  interagency agreement transfers $159,000 which originally  were transferred to NSF from the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration as its share of the CENR/SGCR  distributed-agency funding pool to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture for this purpose.",
