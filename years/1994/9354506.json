The goal  is to assist the development of statistical and probabilistic  intuition and understanding through the use of interactive  computing and graphics.  This project is the next step in the  Statistics Department's efforts to improve lower division  instruction, which began in 1986 by integrating computing into  the undergraduate curriculum. This year, about 2000 lower  division students have ongoing computer assignments.  Funded by an  NSF Grant, 50 X-Windows terminals and a more powerful SUN server  were installed in 1993. The X-Window terminals allows reaching  students on a graphical/intuitive level. In the interactive  windowing environment, different views of data can be linked  together and probabilistic concepts illustrated dynamically so that  the ideas come alive.  Twenty computer projects will be  constructed, corresponding to key concepts discussed in lower  division courses. Each project is a small story, consisting of a  number of related parts that carry the student into rings of  related material. Each project requires responses and initiative on  the part of the students. All parts of the project have as their  core the effort to create a setting to give students better  understanding of the particular concept being discussed in their  classes.  This is a first of its kind in undergraduate statistical  instruction.  The leadership position of the Department in the  field of statistics, in the use of computing, and in undergraduate  instruction will be an important factor in the programs, course  materials, and approach being adopted by other universities and  colleges.  ***",
