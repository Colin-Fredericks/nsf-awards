The \"correct\" view since the 19th century  is that spontaneous generation does not occur.  Yet, unless there  was some point in the history of the universe in which spontaneous  generation of life occurred, then evolutionists are confronted with  two options:  divine intervention or the existence of \"vital\"  matter.  While neither of these options are inconsistent with  evolution, they implicitly undermine evolutionary theory and, at  least in the first option, play into the hands of creationists.  If  a god had to intervene at least once to create life, what prevents  that god from intervening again to direct the development of  species?  So how is it that biologists have worked so energetically  to disprove spontaneous generation?  This is the issue that James  Strick, under the direction of Dr. Gerald Geison, is examining in  his doctoral dissertation.    Mr. Strick has found that the spontaneous generation controversies  in Britain offer a unique window into many areas of biological  theory developing in the 19th century.  These areas include  biological explanations of inheritance, development, evolution,  generation and cell theory.  The debates over spontaneous  generation reveal how thoroughly entwined into a single problem  complex all these areas were, to a greater extent than has been  appreciated previously.  In addition, ideas in biology and physics  about the nature of molecules and their role as simplest elements  of life underwent rapid change during this period, exemplified by  the debate over the significance of Brownian motion and Brown's  \"active molecules.\"  This was an integral strand of the problem  complex which has been almost totally ignored.  Any attempt to  explain why spontaneous generation lost favor so decisively after  1880 must explore all of these clusters of ideas which were pillars  of support for sponta neous generation theories.  Shifts in  institutional power between the medical community and programs in  experimental biology also played a major part in the demise of  spontaneous generation theories.  The maneuvering for control of  prestige and power in British science by the Darwinian \"X-club\"  during this period involved rhetorical strategies to make  evolutionary theory more respectable by actively disengaging it  from the traditionally linked doctrine of spontaneous generation.   In order to undertake this study, Mr. Strick is examining archives  in the United States, Great Britain and France--the centers of  scientific work on this issue.  ***",
