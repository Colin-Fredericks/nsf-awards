 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318523  Miller       Studies on the ways in which natural selection leads to the  evolution of species have demonstrated that many traits of  interest, such as leaf shape or growth rate, are controlled by  numerous loci (many genes), but that one can qualitatively predict  how traits will evolve when undergoing natural selection.  For  example, previous research has investigated how herbivory by  insects would lead to evolutionary changes in herbivore resistance  of a plant species.  Clearly, however, organisms are affected  simultaneously by multiple environmental agents.  The dune annual  Sabatia stellaris, for example, appears to be simultaneously  affected by resource competition, water availability, and  herbivory.  The proposed research asks how selection for one agent  (e.g. competition) is affected by the simultaneous action of a  second agent (e.g. herbivory).   Theoretical predictions suggest  that the selection by any one agent will be increased, in some  cases dramatically, by the presence of any second agent%%%       The proposed research will quantify selection for traits   related to competition, herbivory, and water stress in Sabatia  plants grown under a variety of different experimental conditions  in the field:  competition only, herbivory only, water stress only,  and several combinations of these three environmental agents.  In  each environment, a number of plant traits known to be important  for dealing with competition, herbivory, and/or water stress will  be quantified.  By counting the seeds produced by plants with these  traits under various conditions, selection for these traits will be  quantified in each environment and predictions can be tested.  The  results of this study may be important for understanding basic  questions about rates of evolutionary change of species in  different natural environments and the maintenance of genetic  diversity.  They may also be important for developing or  understanding breeding programs in agricultural systems where  factors su ch as completion and herbivory are commonplace.",
