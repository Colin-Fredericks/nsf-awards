 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450249  Finkral    There is an increasing need for instructional materials which integrate mathematics, science and technology education.  This project produces several instructional packages for secondary school students which are consistent with the standards from each of the disciplines.  The units are published as supplements in journals, such as TIES Magazine, The Technology Teacher, The Mathematics Teacher and The Science Teacher, to reduce the lead time from development to use. They are developed in a collaborative effort among teachers, subject specialists, and practitioners from science and industry.  Local and national support is available to help teachers and groups of teachers use the materials.  The research and evaluation component measures the impact of the units and provides models for increased use. The products include the units, teacher guides for use of the materials and support via electronic means.  Themes to be engaged include science and technology of sports, biotechnology, music, fire prevention, control systems, etc.    ***",
