 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457458  Ghez      The study of star formation is often motivated by the  desire to explain the formation and evolution of the solar system.  Thus, the current paradigm for star formation is centered on  the production of a single star that, at a young age, is surrounded  by a disk of gas and dust, roughly a few hundred astronomical units  (AUs) in size, from which planets may form.  However, recent  surveys, carried out by Dr. Ghez and others, of the star forming  regions of Taurus and Ophiuchus in our Galaxy have led to the  conclusion that most, if not all, young low mass stars have  companion stars.  Furthermore, the majority of these binary stars  are separated by distances that are smaller than the size typically  assumed for a circumstellar disk.    At the distance to Taurus and Ophiuchus, the nearest sites of  star formation in our Galaxy (Distance = 150 parsec), the angular  extent of a circumstellar disk is expected to be roughly 1-2  seconds of arc.  Unfortunately, due to turbulence in the  atmosphere, the angular resolution of traditional imaging  techniques is limited to 1 second of arc, a factor of 10-30 times  worse than the theoretical resolution of a 4-m telescope.  Thus, to  study these perplexing and yet prevalent close binary stars,  the  high resolution imaging technique of speckle imaging will be used.    The current research effort is focussed on studying the effect of  these close binary stars on the formation and evolution of  circumstellar disks.  The presence of a circumstellar disk and its  properties are primarily inferred from the measured spectral energy  distribution (SED) of T Tauri stars.  In particular, it is the  excesses of radiation at ultra-violet and infrared wavelengths that  have been attributed to disk processes.  More recently, increased  efforts in modeling the effects have resulted in the interpretation  of dips in the SED as evidence for planetary formation.  However,  the SED's for close binary stars have so far been the result of  observing the co mbined light from both components.      In one approach to answering questions regarding the consequence of  close companion stars for circumstellar disks, Dr. Ghez is  measuring the SED, from optical to infrared wavelengths, of each  individual component within these close binary star systems using  high spatial resolution imaging techniques.  This will allow a  determination of (1), how much of the previously observed excess  can be attributed to the presence of a secondary source as opposed  to a circumstellar disk (2), if the excess remains, whether both  components or only one shows evidence for a circumstellar disk and  (3), whether or not the dips in the SED are created by the presence  of two stars with different apparent temperatures.    In a second approach, Dr. Ghez will also compare the binary star  frequency of the classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), which are thought  to have an inner accretion disk, with that of the weak-lined T  Tauri stars (WTTS), which are thought to lack an inner accretion  disk.  In their initial work, Dr. Ghez and her collaborators  observed a distinction at the 3 sigma level; at separations less  than 35 AU binary stars are more frequent among the WTTS than the  CTTS.  These observations suggest that close companions  significantly interfere with the disk accretion process associated  with many T Tauri stars.  This result is an exciting possibility  but requires follow up observations of more T Tauri stars to gain  statistical significance.  This will be accomplished by (1),  expanding the sample of observed T Tauri stars to additional star  forming regions and to fainter systems with the use of a more  sensitive camera and (2), eventually using larger telescopes  (Diameter > 5-m, such as the Keck telescope) to probe this  relationship further.  If Dr. Ghez' hypothesis is correct, then the  difference between the CTTS and WTTS binary star populations should  increase at smaller separations.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  s cience and engineering.  The award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
