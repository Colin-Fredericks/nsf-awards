 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451959  Monroe  The goal of this project is to improve the learning of physics at  Southwest Texas Junior College and to improve the retention of  students and the attraction to major studies in physics,  particularly among women and the Hispanic population. This  project proposes to develop and implement new laboratory  activities in three physics course sequences during the next two  years.  The lab curricula will be adaptions of the curriculum  developed by Ron Thornton and Priscilla Laws, using  microcomputers to collect data and perform analysis and graphing  as controlled by the students.  The lab activities will be  developed in the area of mechanics, heat, sound, electricity and  magnetism, light and nuclear physics.  The project requests support for six networked lab stations  equipped with Mac Quadra 650 microcomputers, Universal Lab  Interfaces and appropriate sensors and probes.  In addition, lab  equipment to be used with the MBL tools as well as a laser  printer and scanner are requested.  The project expects to more actively involve the students in lab  activities and thereby improve the learning of physics through  the new technologies of the microcomputers and with proven lab  curricula.  As a result more students will support physics  because of their positive experiences and may elect to continue  their studies in physics.  Students will be better prepared for  the technologies of the twenty-first century and science literacy  in southwest Texas will increase.",
