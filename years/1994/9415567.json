 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this program is to explore the chemical  and traditional synthesis, processing and microwave  dielectric properties of novel ceramics in the system  tantalum oxide-zirconium dioxide.  The investigation will be  conducted to gain deeper insights into the fundamental  relationships between the atomic level defects,  heterogeneous interfaces and dielectric properties.  The  measurement results of quality factor, dielectric constant  and temperature coefficients of these properties will be  correlated to the observed microstructure and the far  infrared reflectance spectra.  The program will establish  the collaboration with engineers and scientists from  industries and National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST).    The proposed work will explore the fundamental understanding  and relationship between the atomic level defects,  heterogeneous interfaces and microwave dielectric properties  and its temperature dependence.  The program will establish  the collaboration with industries and government  laboratories (NIST).",
