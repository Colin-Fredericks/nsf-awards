The focus of the project is on the Development of  Professional Standards for Professional Services set forth in Annex  1210.5 of Chapter 12 of the Agreement, involving professional  conduct and ethics.  Its goal is to develop recommendations on  muturally acceptable standards and criteria on professional conduct  and ethics for consideration by the NAFTA Forum on Engineering  Practice and other appropriate groups within the three nations.   The recommendations will include fundamental understandings of the  responsibilities of engineers to clients, governments and public.   This effort involves a team of six, two from each nation, advised  by four consultants with expertise in global ethics.  The project  involves several meetings and interim research between May and  August 1994, in order to identify major issues on ethics and  professional conduct, draft ideas on how they should be addressed,   develop a preliminary report to the NAFTA Forum on Engineering  Practice meeting in June, and a final list and preliminary outline  of recommendations for the next NAFTA meeting which is likely to  occur in the Fall in Canada.  After this, a final report will be  prepared and distributed appropriately.  Addressing these issues of  professional conduct and ethics is critical to the implementation  of a viable Agreement that will be beneficial to all three nations  in our future involvements in professional engineering practice.  ***",
