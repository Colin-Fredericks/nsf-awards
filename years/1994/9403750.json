 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403750  Kovacic    This proposal describes intended research concerning irregular  dynamical behavior in two classes of physical systems. The first class  will be mechanical systems described by ordinary differential  equations. The proposed work will show the existence of special  trajectories, called homoclinic orbits, that connect equilibrium  positions to each other in an infinite amount of time. These  trajectories will consist of a sequence of slow and fast stretches  following one another, and may be responsible for irregular behavior  of nearby trajectories, and thus of the mechanical systems under  investigation. One such system describes irregular beats in the  amplitudes of two coupled mathematical pendula. The second class of  physical systems under investigation is laser optics. The proposed  research will investigate the occurrence of irregular dynamics of  soliton-like optical pulses in the Maxwell-Bloch partial differential  equations describing ring lasers. These dynamics will result in  intermittent blinking, on a very short time scale, of the laser  output. Both analytical and computational methods will be used in the  course of this research.    This proposal describes intended research in two problem areas  concerning near-integrable dynamical systems. The first proposed area  concerns multi-bump orbits homoclinic to resonance bands. The work  proposed here will utilize  the Melnikov method, geometric singular  perturbation theory, and the exchange lemma to describe new classes of  such orbits as well as new techniques that can be used to find these  orbits in concrete physical problems. Multi-bump orbits homoclinic to  resonance bands consist of a succession of fast bumps interspersed  with segments on which trajectories move very slowly in time. Besides  these theoretical studies, a computational verification and  investigations of physically interesting examples that may exhibit the  phenomenon of orbits homoclinic to resonance bands are also proposed.  The second propos ed are concerns chaotic dynamics in the  near-integrable regime of the  Maxwell-Bloch partial differential  equations describing samples of lasing material in a ring cavity.  These dynamics may be present due to the existence of space-dependent  homoclinic orbits in the corresponding infinite-dimensional phase  space. The existence of these homoclinic orbits and chaotic dynamics  will be ascertained with the use of a combination of numerical and  analytical techniques. The numerical techniques will include  simulations using split-step and pseudo-spectral methods, as well as  calculations of various diagnostics such as power spectra, Lyapunov  exponents, and Lyapunov attractor dimension. The analytical techniques  will include the subharmonic Melnikov method,  perturbation theory,  Floquet theory, invariant manifold theory, inverse spectral theory,  and the homoclinic Melnikov method for near-integrable partial  differential equations.",
