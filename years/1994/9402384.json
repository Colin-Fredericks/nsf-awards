The Center will use and expand its well-established  industrial collaboration programs to facilitate the rapid transfer  of developed system methodologies.          This will be achieved through  three cross-disciplinary thrust  areas:  1) intelligent control systems which involves the design of  robust control systems with many sensors and many feedback loops  using algorithm and tools for optimization-based design, 2)  intelligent signal processing and communication system which  involves the modelling, design, and control of wireless and high-  speed communication networks, 3) system integration methodology  which involves model complexity, architectures for control, and  communication systems.         In addition, there are three  demonstration projects:    (1) electromechanical motion control prototyping project  which  will develop basic research and engineering innovation needed to  build high-performance, low-cost, motion control system, (2) wire-  less multimedia shop communication project which will develop the  research and technology for designing multimedia communication  subsystems for manufacturing, (3) virtual factories for electro-  mechanical devices manufacturing project which will develop an  integrated tool kit for design, planning, and manufacturing of  electromechanical devices.        This award provides support for the ERC for three years.  ***",
