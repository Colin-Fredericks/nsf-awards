The potential for   simultaneously considering these diverse factors has been   increased dramatically in recent years through the development of   sophisticated geographic information systems (GISs), but   procedures for analyzing data in ways that identify optimal   routes have not yet been developed.  This Small Business   Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will begin work on the   development and application of an algorithm to identify least-  cost and environmentally acceptable route locations between   points.  Special attention will be given to three major facets of   the optimal route location problem.  With respect to   identification of the shortest path, this project will focus on   adaptation of an algorithm that minimizes metrication errors that   result from characteristics of the spatial units for which data   are associated.  The project will address directional factors,   especially the role of slopes in terrain that can have a major   impact on the operation of transport and utility systems, by   introducing elements of a third dimension into calculations.  The   project also will consider the practical need to consider how   routes cross boundaries between parcels, because past experience   has shown that route location problems are reduced when fewer   parcels are affected.  This phase of the project will consist of   four parts:  (1) the testing and improvement of an existing   algorithm to determine the computational complexity of   adaptations, (2) evaluation of commercially available geographic   databases to provide terrain and boundary information for test   calculations, (3) creation of a graphical interface for users to   simplify information entry for additional data, and   (4) application of a revised algorithm in a small-scale   demonstration project focusing on highway location  in western New   York state.  The test demonstration will be undertaken in   cooperation with officials of the New York State Department of   Transportation.   Through development and testing of this algorithm, the   investigators will advance the capabilities for GISs to address a   critical set of problems in a more powerful and efficient way.    The use of this type of algorithm is expected to reduce   construction costs of transportation routes and utility corridors   by four to seven percent, thereby saving both public- and   private-sector organizations millions of dollars annually.  This   type of algorithm also will help the U.S. maintain its   competitive advantage in geographic information systems, a   rapidly growing segment of the information technology industry.  ***",
