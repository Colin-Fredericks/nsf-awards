The  target instructional audience are undergraduate and graduate  students and industrial personnel.  Eleven separate topics that  affect cellular manufacturing will be covered in the instructional  materials.  Instructional materials to be prepared will consist of  lecture notes, handouts, laboratory exercises, and software.  A  step by step description of methodologies (mostly heuristics and  optimizing algorithms) used in the design and operation of  cellular manufacturing and group technology based systems will be  written manuscript will be bound in a workbook form and distributed  to students as a source of reference.  Results will be shared with  other universities that offer courses in manufacturing.                 To ensure a wide dissemination of the outcome of this  research, in addition to the instructional materials mentioned  above, results of the research will be shared with other academic  institutions and industry through presentations at the National  Conference of the American Society of Engineering Education.   Letters outlining the deployment activity will be sent to  universities that have accredited programs in industrial and/or  manufacturing engineering.  Following this, a detailed course  outline, developed tools, handbook, and lab exercises will be sent  out to universities interested in the deployment activity.",
