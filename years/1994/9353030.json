The  guide is expected to be about 150 pages in length and will be  divided into two parts.  Part I will provide information on the  common wetland types with integrated learning activities.  Part II  will include information on identifying potential sites for  implementing the project and will include the information necessary  to achieve these objectives.  The guide will also include  information on ecological functions, hydrologic regimes and plant  communities of wetlands.  It will provide an alternative for hands-  on projects that will result in a school yard habitat well suited  for student monitoring, research and instructional activities.  An  urban wetland restoration project will be selected to field test  the project.",
