The objective is to obtain a comprehensive assessment of  the prospects for high Tc Supercccconducting Field-Effect  Transistors (SuFET).  Based on the existing data, two material  problems have been identified as the limiting factors for the  current device performance:  the quality of the SrTiO3 (STO)  dielectric layer and the quality of YBCO ultrathin films.  In  support of the project objective, work will be done in these two  directions to improve the device properties.  In addition to the  study and optimization of the device characteristics experiments on  unique SuFET applications, such as in SQUID circuits and microwave  resonators will be continued and also extended to new device  concepts.  At the same time, the basic study of the physics of  field effects in high Tc superconductors will continue.    Non-technical abstract:  The aim of the program is to investigate  the effect of electric fields on the properties of the high  temperature superconductors.  It has been shown that by use of  electric fields the transition temperature and the maximum current  carrying  ability of superconductors can be modified.  Thus, one  may be able to design novel devices where the device properties are  modified by the use of electric fields.  In order to understand the  science as well as the full device potential of this phenomenon it  is essential to fabricate high quality thin film based structures.   One of the goals of this program is to understand and optimize the  materials growth process.  It is expected that a better  understanding for the potential of three terminal superconducting  devices will emerge from this program.  ***",
