Wayne and Delores Zage of Ball State  University will conduct a study \"Using Design Metrics Feedback  During Software Development.\"  The researchers are an integral part  of Purdue University/University of Florida's  Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Software Engineering.  This study  is to be conducted at and cost shared by the Northrop Corp.    The research will evaluate the performance of the design metrics  developed at Ball State University as it is applied to ongoing  software development in a controlled industry experiment.    The researchers are nationally recognized experts in their field  and well qualified to perform this project.    The Program Manager recommends Ball State University be awarded  $15,000 for one year for this project.",
