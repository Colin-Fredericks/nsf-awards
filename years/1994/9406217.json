Complex vocal repertoires are found in  humans (e.g. speech), some other primates, cetaceans, many  songbirds, and parrots.  Comparative work over the last  decades has shown that complex repertoires are used in  recognition of individuals and associations, sharing of  environmental information, declaring of intentions, and  competition for mates (sexual selection).  Sexual selection,  alone or in combination with individual recognition, seems  to account for many of the complex repertoires in songbirds.  Nonhuman primates declare subtle variations in intention and  have some simple environmental meanings.  Cetaceans remain  difficult to study, but there is now evidence of both  sexually selected repertoires and social association  signatures.  Although both captive and wild parrots are  known to develop complex vocal repertoires and continue to  learn new signals as adults, nearly nothing is known about  how their complex repertoires are used in the wild.    Dr. Jack Bradbury and his students have located a study site  in Costa Rica that hosts four species of parrots, has an  open forest making direct observations feasible, provides an  extensive road system for following the birds, and has  sufficient control of poaching that the birds can be  approached closely without perturbation.  Birds will be  outfitted with newly designed radio transmitters and  followed intensively.  All vocalizations will be recorded  and correlated with social composition of groups,  environmental contexts, and behaviors.  Functions can be  verified by playback of natural and modified calls to wild  birds.  Parrots are extremely responsive to such playbacks.    Dr. Bradbury thus hopes to clarify the role of complex vocal  communication in a group of animals that, although critical  to the general understanding of vocal commu nication  processes, has largely remained a mystery.  The results will  provide a basis for subsequent lab studies on brain-behavior  relationships and allow contrasts with other avian and  mammalian groups.  Furthermore, the extensive ecological  data to be collected in this study will be useful to Costa  Rican conservation biologists.",
