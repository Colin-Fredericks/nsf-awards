Pollen is rejected if its single S-allele matches either S-allele in the pistil.  Information is communicated about the allelic constitution of the S-locus in the sporophyte and in the gametophyte.  The products of the S-locus are the carriers of this information.  The S-locus products expressed in the pistil comprise a series of allelic ribonucleases, the S-RNases.  It has been shown that each S-allele encodes a different S-RNase.  However, it is not known how these differences lead to S-allele specific recognition.  No S-allele specific product has yet been identified in the male gametophyte (i.e., pollen-S).  This proposal seeks to develop an understanding of the molecular basis for S-allele specific recognition and rejection.  The first step will be to develop a system in which S-allele specific recognition and rejection can be manipulated.  Cloned S-RNases from Nicotiana alata will be used to introduce new allelic specificity into transgenic plants.  Using the expression system, it will be possible to manipulate cloned S-RNase sequences in vitro and assess the effects on pollination behavior in vivo.  The choice of plant materials for use as transgene recipient is very important.  The transformation efficiency of N. alata is too low to generate the necessary number of transformants.  Therefore, transgenes will be introduced into a plant such as Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and crossed into N. alata or into a transformable F1 hybrid ca pable of S-allele specific pollen rejection.  In either case, the inherent specificity of the SI reaction provides excellent controls.  Dr. McClure will look for the introduction of, or modification of, a new specificity in the transgenic plants.  Identification of the pollen-S product is a major goal of this proposal.  A combined genetic and molecular biological approach is proposed.  A large F2 population segregating for two S-alleles has been generated.  Plants homozygous for a given S-allele will be pooled.  Using these pooled materials, subtractive hybridization and differential mRNA display will be used to identify a putative pollen-S cDNA.  GSI has the potential to help understand plant cell-cell communication.  To realize its potential, GSI research must move into an analytical phase.  This proposal aims to accomplish this by developing a system for direct analysis of the allelic specificity function of S-RNases, and identifying the product responsible for allele specific recognition in pollen.  ***  409Schiefelbeintio                $       W   `   e   g                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   g                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         !                        F                         The morphogenesis of plant cells is primarily achieved by the precise control of cell division and cell enlargement.  The long-term objective of the proposed work is to analyze the contribution of single genetic loci to the complex process of plant cell development.  The model system being studies is the formation of root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The complete process of Arabidopsis root hair development can be subdivided into several phases: (1) root epidermal cell fate specification, (2) the initial formation of a bulge at the base of the epidermal cell, (3) the expansion of the hair by tip growth, and (4) the maturation of the hair and cessation of tip growth.  In this proposal, genes will be studied that appear to influence two of these stages of root hair cell development (cell expansion and cell fate specification).  In one part of the proposed research, genes affecting root hair cell expansion will be cloned and characterized by virtue of their association with the T-DNA of Agrobacterium.  Several root hair mutants have already been identified from T-DNA populations of Arabidopsis.  One of these possesses a mutation in a previously-characterized locus, RHD3, and it has been used to isolate putative genomic and cDNA clones of the RHD3 gene.  In the other major part of the proposed research, genes that affect cell fate specification in the root epidermis will be characterized and identified.  The Arabidopsis TTG gene, which affects trichome formation and anthocyanin production, has been shown to influence the fate of root epidermal cells.  Normally, only epidermal cells in particular positions will form hairs.  However, it ttg mutant plants, all root epidermal cells appear to form hairs, and in Arabidopsis plants that ectopically express a putative TTG homolog (the maize R gene), no hairs form on the root epidermal cells.  These studies will servt to define genes that affect two of the basic processes that occur d uring the formation of root hair cells, and they will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that control cell development in plants.homologueserve      W             W                                 R   W      !     !     !     !     !     !      g         g     (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial                                                                                  &   z       P   R   U   W     e                                               $               W       -       `                                     \"             h      c   d   d        k             +        Dana Brigham Dana Brigham",
