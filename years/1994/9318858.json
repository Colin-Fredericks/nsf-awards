We will develop a  comprehensive, computerized intron database. We will test five key  predictions of both theories by determining in diverse eukaryotes  the intron structure of the gene triphophate isomerase (TPI), the  gene which has most often been utilized in this controversy. We  will also use the database to evaluate the temporal dynamics of  intron gain and loss among the major groups of erkaryotes and,  finally, we will examine recent cases of the apparent insertion or  sliding of introns in order to gain insight into possible  mechanisms.  %%%  Introns - noncoding sequences that interrupt genes and which are  removed at the RNA level via RNA splicing - are the hallmarks of  many eukaryotic protein genes.  Nowhere is this more true than in  humans and other vertebrates, where they occupy 80-90% of a gene's  length and number nearly a million.  Ever since their discovery 16  years ago (for which a Nobel Prize was awarded this year), a  fundamental controversy has raged concerning the evolutionary  origin and importance of introns.  In order to directly address,  and attempt to resolve, this long-standing controversy, we will  develop a comprehensive, computerized intron database and use it to  assess whether the distribution of introns across eukaryotes best  fits the tenets of the competing \"introns-early\" or \"introns-late\"  theories.  In addition, we will test five key predictions of these  two theories by determining, in various diverse eukaryotes, the  intron structure of the gene TPI that has figured most prominently  in this controversy.  We will also move beyond this debate by using  the intron database to evaluate the temporal dynamics of intron  gain and loss among the major groups of eukaryotic, especially  animals, plants and fungi.  Preliminary analyses suggest a highly  episodi c pattern, which raises striking mechanistic and selective  questions.  Finally, we will examine especially recent cases of the  apparent insertion or sliding of introns in order to understand how  these events occur.  ***",
