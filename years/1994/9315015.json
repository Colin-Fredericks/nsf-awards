The  hypoxic (low-oxygen) stress response of seedling roots involves the  rapid inhibition of initiation, followed by selective initiation  and elongation of mRNA translation.  The hypoxic stress response  provides a model for studying modulation of protein synthesis under  low energy conditions.  This project focuses on modifications of  acidic ribosomal proteins (ARPs) in response to hypoxia.  Three  acidic-phosphorylated proteins, known as P0, P1 and P2, are present  as a multimeric structure in the active site of the ribosome where  interactions between mRNA, tRNA and translation factors occur  during the late-initiation, elongation and termination phases of  translation.  The biochemical objectives are to identify P0, P1 and  P2 of maize, analyze the stoichiometry of the three-types of ARPs  in monoribosomes and polyribosomes of aerobic and hypoxic roots,  characterize the in vivo phosphorylation of ARPs under control and  hypoxic conditions, and analyze other modifications of ARPs in  response to hypoxia.  The molecular objectives are to identify and  sequence the genes encoding the ARPs of maize, and to initiate  site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites of the ARPs  genes.  The long-term goal is to test the role of ARP modification  in an in vitro translation system from maize root tips.  These  experiments will provide the foundation for the elucidation of  ribosome structure-function relationships in mechanisms of protein  synthesis in higher plants.  This project involves a collaboration  with Dr. Estela Sanchez de Jimenez at National Autonomous  University of Mexico, Mexico City.  ***",
