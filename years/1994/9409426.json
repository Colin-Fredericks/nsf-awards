 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract        Within the last twenty years the percentage of children born out  of wedlock and raised in single parent households has increased  dramatically.  While the existing literature has documented the  adverse effects of such living arrangements on child development,  the causes of these phenomena are not yet well understood.  The  purpose of this project is to develop and test empirically a  theoretical construct to disentangle the causes of illegitamcy.   In particular, the roles of changing male and female employment  opportunities, AFDC benefits, improvements in contraception, and  legalization of abortion will be analyzed.    There is substantial evidence that an important cause of  increasing illegitimacy is a break down of the custom governing  the social norm that men should marry women who bear children as  an unintended consequence of premarital sexual activity.  These  observations motivate the theoretical work, which focuses on the  incidence of, and the response to, unplanned pregnancy.   Illegitimacy will be explicitly modeled as the consequences of a  sequence of decisions--about premarital sexual activity, the use  of contraception, abortion in the event of pregnancy, and  marriage, and the use of AFDC in the event of birth.  In each of  these decisions, welfare and the availability of jobs for men and  women play a role, but so too do the costs and availability of  contraception.  The prediction of the theoretical model will be  tested using data from a variety of national surveys including  the National Survey on Family Growth, the CPS Fertility  Supplements, and the NSLY.  This model can used to reassess the  roles of AFDC and male joblessness in promoting illegitimacy.",
