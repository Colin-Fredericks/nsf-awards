The proposed research is a combined molecular  biological and biophysical approach to this problem.  Because the  complexity the folding problem increases with chain length, the  research is focused ont he shortest sequences known to fold into  unique, stable structures without disulfide bonds.  The goal is to  identify the determinants of folding for two small  -  proteins  which have similar secondary structural elements but different  folding topologies.  Both in vivo and in vitro selection methods  will be used to identify 1) large sets of divergent sequences which  adopt each folding topology 2) amino acid sequence changes which  convert one topology into another. The 3-D structures adopted by  particularly interesting sequences will be studied in detail using  NMR and X-ray crystallography.  Analysis of the resulting sequence-  structure database and comparison with the sequences and structures  of natural  -  proteins will seek to identify the sequence patterns  which specify each of the two topologies.  A detailed understanding  of how amino acid sequence specifies tertiary structure for these  particularly simple proteins should contribute to the understanding  of the folding of more complex proteins.  %%%  Due to advances in technology and the initation of large scale DNA  sequencing projects, DNA sequence information is being generated at  an ever increasing rate.  However, understanding the role of the  newly sequenced genes is difficult from the DNA sequences alone;  what one needs to know are the structures and functions of the  proteins that the genes encode.  The research project is directed  at understanding the rules which connect amino acid sequences with  protein structures for two particularly simple proteins.  To the  extent that the rules generalize, this knowledge should contribute  to the understanding of the folding of larger and more complex  proteins, and thus to th e interpretation of data generated in  genome sequencing projects.  ***",
