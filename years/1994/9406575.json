 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406575  BYRNE       Research on global change has focused on understanding  contemporary natural and human processes, but an important  ancillary line of inquiry consists of reconstruction of  historical records of change, thereby enhancing knowledge of the  outcomes of natural processes upon which patterns of human-  induced change now are superimposed.  Paleoenvironmental records  from around the world indicate that dramatic changes took place  during the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene periods  roughly 10,000 years ago.  The primary driving forces behind  these changes are thought to have been fluctuations in global  atmospheric and oceanic patterns.  More accurate timing of  paleoenvironmental records is necessary in order to understand  these processes, however.  This doctoral dissertation research  project will focus its attention on advancing the synchronous  record of change in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California over  the period from 14,000 years to 9,000 years before the present.  Sediment cores have been drawn from a number of lakes in the  region, and pollen and macrofossil evidence in the cores have  been identifies.  Preliminary analyses using traditional  radiocarbon dating techniques indicate strong synchroneities  among the sites.  More detailed analyses will be conducted by  making higher-resolution AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) 14-C  measurements on conifer needle fragments and pollen grains.       This project will improve the chronological precision of  records that document the nature and rates of environmental  change in the Sierra Nevada during the Pleistocene/Holocene  transition.  Of particular value will be improved understanding  of how abruptly climates may change.  As a doctoral dissertation  improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable  a promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.",
