 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the purchase of a single crystal X-  ray diffractometer to conduct four interdisciplinary  research programs at a predominantly undergraduate  institution. Currently, no capability for refining single  crystal structures exists at the institution or in the  research laboratories of local universities. The proposed  equipment provides capabilities to conduct collaboration  research with industry and outside research institutions.  Specifically, the equipment is to be used in: 1)  quantitative analysis of titanium aluminum alloys; 2)  determination of bond lengths and valences in alumina and  magnetoplumbite-type compounds; 3) examination of  organometallic polymers and rigid rod polymers; 4)  investigation of ployfluroarylene bridged polymers; 5)  exploration of vinyl polymers having highly fluorinated side  chains; 6) study of chiral phosphonate transition state  analogues as inhibitors of HIV-1 protease; and 7) the  determination of the correspondence between changes in the  crystal structure of pumpellyite with changes in its  composition. These studies have applications in the  development of high-performance, high-temperature alloys,  better understanding of structure/property relations of the  crystal chemistry at the spinel blocks, development of  industrially important polymers, and establishing a rational  design in the synthesis of analogues of HIV-1 protease.   %%%  Funds are provided for the purchase of a single crystal X-  ray diffractometer to conduct four interdisciplinary  research programs at a predominantly undergraduate  institution. Currently, no capability for refining single  crystal structures exists at the institution or in the  research laboratories of local universities. Researchers  from Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Geology, and  Material Engineering conduct a diverse range of studies that  have applications in: 1) the development of high-  performance, high-temperature alloys, 2) better  understanding of structure/property relations of mate rials,  3) development of industrially important polymers, and 4)  establishing a rational design in the synthesis of analogues  of HIV-1 protease.
