 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454757  Williamson    WhaleNet is an interdisciplinary, hands-on, collaborative  monitoring project to foster science education and interest in  schools across the nation utilizing telecommunications.  WhaleNet  will ultimately incorporate continued contact among educators,  students, scientists, and research programs to enhance K-12 science  education.    Through interaction with cooperating scientists and research  institutions, students will be able to participate in research  projects on and utilize data from the marine ecosystem, including  marine mammal identification and migration patterns.    WhaleNet Program Goals              to utilize telecommunications and other advanced            technologies to allow cooperation and communication among            students, teachers, scientists, and marine research            institutions;            to involve students in real-time interdisciplinary            scientific research and education, by using data            collected on classroom whale watches, data from existing            research programs and data from new research projects by            participating organizations using high technology            devices;            to establish collaboration (through a nation-wide            network) among business, education and research            institutions, with the goal of enhancing student            involvement and interest in the marine environment;            to establish a nation-wide network of schools, students,            educators and scientists who are interested in            integrating WhaleNet into the K-12 curriculum as an            interdisciplinary theme;            to connect students to research data, students to            scientists/naturalists, students to students via            telecommunications to stimulate interest in            interdisciplinary learning;            to make related curriculum materials available to            educators electronically.    Interdisciplinary K-12 curriculum units and interactive  CD-ROM  materials will be available to participating educators and students  so that they can be used with the WhaleNet program.  Throughout the  academic year students and educators will have access to volunteer  WhaleNet scientists via the Internet for their inquiries.  Students  and educators will also have access to past and current data so  that they can experience a more comprehensive academic program on  a year-round basis.    WhaleNet will enable students to use research data in real-time to  generate involvement and interest in scientific investigations  while fostering an interdisciplinary approach to learning,  research, critical thinking, and problem solving.",
