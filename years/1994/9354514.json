The modules  address a pressing need for modernization in introductory astronomy  laboratories: Though astronomy is a very popular course for  undergraduates, and for many their first and only college  experience in science, laboratories in introductory astronomy have  difficulty doing experiments because of the faintness of  astronomical objects, the long time scale of many phenomena and the  fickleness of weather. Most astronomy exercises currently available  to astronomy instructors rely on analysis of photographs or canned  data and exemplify techniques that are increasingly out-of-date.  Students rightly regard many of these activities as make-work.  The  current project, Contemporary Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy  (CLEA), is developing 8 Windows-based exercises, running on  IBM-compatible computers, that provide realistic observing  experiences for introductory labs based around simulations, digital  images, and, observations with CCD cameras on small telescopes.  Each module consists of software, student guides, teachers'  manuals, and technical documentation. The Windows modules, along  with 5 Mac-based exercises and two digital imaging exercises  introduced before NSF support, have been introduced into classes at  Gettysburg College and distributed widely by ftp and by mail. CLEA  software is currently in wide use.  This project continues the work  for another two years, developing an additional 8 modules and  rewriting software and manuals so that the exercises can be used on  Macintosh computers with color displays. This includes  documentation, distribution, and dissemination of the modules. The  new exercises improve students understanding of astronomy and  provide the means and the impetus for revitalizing introductory  astronomy laboratories around the country",
