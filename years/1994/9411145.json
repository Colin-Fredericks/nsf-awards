Normal form  techniques have been successfully applied to simplify the state  space expression of nonlinear ordinary differential equations.   Here we propose to study the stabilization of nonlinear control  systems using normal form techniques.  Thus, we are interested in  systems whose linearizations possess at least one uncontrollable  critical mode.  From some preliminary analysis, it can be  inferred that there is a great advantage to using the normal form  as a method to reduce the dimension of the system whose stability  is to be analyzed.  We propose to study this dimensional  advantage in detail as it may be applied to various problems.       One question of interest is to understand and characterize  the decoupling of the critical and stable modes of a nonlinear  control system in normal form.  Another line of proposed study is  to examine how the normal form characterizes the Lyapunov  function associated with the nonlinear system.  We would also  estimate the region of attraction of stability for nonlinear  systems using the normal form.  We will study the relationship  between the normal form and the center manifold techniques which  have been previously used in stabilization analyses.  Full and  Partial feedback linearization, and approximate feedback  linearization will also be studied, to see if these objectives  can be achieved more simply using the normal form.       Time scale techniques have been applied to control systems  in order to simplify analysis and obtain stability results.  A  further direction of the research herein proposed will be to  derive a deeper understanding of the relationship between  stability and time scale, and the relevance of time scale  techniques to existing center manifold and normal form techniques  in  stabilization of nonlinear control systems.  ***",
