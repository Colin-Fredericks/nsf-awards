Rao of the Regional Research Laboratory in  Bhopal, India.  The research aims at  understanding the behavior of entrained  particles.  Entrainment is one of the important  mechanisms in processing of coal by froth  flotation where particles are transported from  the pulp phase to the froth phase.  In that  process particles enter the base of a flotation  froth and are transferred up and out of the  flotation cell suspended in water between the  bubbles.  The process is subject to the  influence of many factors, such as the particle  size, shape and surface chemistry, whose  effects are not fully understood.  In this  research, experiments will be carried out to  conduct studies in batch and continuous  flotation cells.  Experiments will be conducted  using both well-characterized coals and  synthetic mixtures of purified components, to  compensate for the difficulty of determining  particle characteristics in the heterogeneous  mixture of minerals in coal.    Scope :  This project involves collaboration by  two scientists with complementary experiences  in testing and in mathematical modeling in  dealing with a fundamental science problem.   The solution of this problem, leading to better  understanding of the factors involved in the  process of particle entrainment, could have  applications in the future in various  industries.    ***",
