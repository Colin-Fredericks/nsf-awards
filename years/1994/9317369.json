As a starting point, the determination of  the three-dimensional structures and examination of the internal  dynamics of small (32 base-pair) models of Holliday junctions is  proposed using time-resolved fluorescence and nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectroscopies.  The selected sequences are  designed to inhibit migration of the crossover junction to  facilitate analysis by biophysical methods, and the results are  then analyzed with the assistance of computational and molecular  graphics approaches.  Our objectives are formulated on the basis  of critical observations indicating that the resolution of HJs in  the cell and in vitro appears to be dependent on the sequence at  the site of strand crossover, and that the spatial arrangement of  the branches of Holliday junction is dependent on sequence.   Thus, our objective extends beyond the determination of the  structure of a single HJ at atomic resolution, to analysis of a  series of related HJs having identical branches but different  permutations of the bases at the  junction.  Selection of  specific HJs for in-depth structural analysis is based on  screening using gel mobility, thermal denaturation, and  fluorescence assays.  %%%  Genetic recombination is a fundamental process of biology leading  the variation and diversity that is essential to life.  Most  mechanisms proposed for recombination involve a four-arm branched  DNA intermediate termed the Holliday junction (HJ), which is  cleaved by enzymes to generate either parental or recombinant  products.  A significant body of evidence has accumulated  indicating that the structure of the HJ has a central role in  determining the outcome of the recombination event.  Thus, we  seek an understandi ng of the molecular basis of genetic  recombination from detailed knowledge of the structure of the HJ,  and ultimately, of the nature of the interactions with enzymes  critical to HJ recognition and processing.  ***",
