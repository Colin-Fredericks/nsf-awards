Though students have extensive  experience in solving textbook problems that have been set out for  them, they often report difficulty in solving engineering problems  in real-world situation they confront. This project provides  students multiple opportunities to integrate different areas of  electrical engineering while working in teams to solve technical  problems in their community.  This project affects students at each  level of the curriculum: students in the first semester of the  capstone design project will take on the role of project managers;  students in at least three other classes--electronics or  electromechanics, circuits and digital logic take on the role of  designers. The project managers craft separate assignments for each  of the three other classes. This corresponds to a project manager  dividing a large project among several different departments, each  with its own area of expertise. These assignments are used as  laboratory projects for the classes involved, and the students who  successfully complete their projects can work on integrating the  entire system into a single solution to the real-world problem. The  project has support from 100% of the electrical engineering  faculty.  The requested equipment will be dedicated to projects  that span the curriculum both in subject area and in level of  sophistication. Four work-stations equipped with computers and  instrumentation will be provided to students working  collaboratively on real-world projects from various sectors of the  community: local education, industry, individuals requiring  assistive technology, and the university itself. Special-purpose  equipment to be shared by the teams is also included.",
