 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic interactions in metals can produce a rich variety of  interesting phenomena including superconductivity, magnetic  order, heavy fermion behavior, non-Fermi liquid behavior, Kondo  effect, and valence fluctuations, many of which are not well  understood. Valuable information needed for developing an  understanding of the microscopic interactions that produce these  phenomena can be obtained from measurements of the properties of  materials that exhibit these phenomena at low temperatures. This  award provides support for a dilution refrigerator (DR) which  will be used for measurements of low temperature properties of  strongly correlated electron systems. The DR system will provide  a base temperature of less than 10 milliKelvins with a cooling  power of 250 microwatts at 100 milliKelvins, and a large amount  of experimental access. Several accessories will be added to the  basic system, including resistance thermometry for measuring the  temperature of the sample mounted below the mixing chamber, and a  9 tesla superconducting magnet system for measurement in high  magnetic fields.    Studies in the milliKelvin range are especially important for  some materials with very low energy scales including heavy  fermion superconductors, low ordering temperature magnets, heavy  fermion and Kondo compounds, and those exhibiting time-dependent  phenomena associated with quantum tunneling. Very often,  investigations to ever lower temperatures yield unexpected  behavior, revealing new lower energy scales associated with the  many-body ground state. These studies are of fundamental  scientific interest and are also of importance in the  development of useful materials for industrial applications.",
