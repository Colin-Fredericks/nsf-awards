 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in asynchronous systems has had a resurgence in the past  five years.  Several breakthroughs distinguish this recent work  from earlier efforts, and have made asynchronous operation a viable  option for modern system design.  CAD systems have been developed  for asynchronous circuit design, asynchronous processors have been  built and evaluated, and controllers and systems have been  designed.  Problems in hazard-free operation, formal specification  and verification of designs are being actively pursued.  The  purpose of the symposium is to provide a forum where researchers  may assess the current state of research in the field, and exchange  ideas about present work in depth.  The symposium is planned for  November 3-5, 1994.",
