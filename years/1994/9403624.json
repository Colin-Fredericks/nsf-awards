 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403624  Golubitsky       In this project we study both the theory and application of  symmetric dynamical systems.  In many applications, symmetry is  introduced either by the supposition of a regular geometry or by  the interchangability of parts in a complex system.  It has been  well established that the existence of regular patterns in  experiments and in computer simulations are often due to  symmetry.  Only recently has it been shown that the existence of  intermittency in the dynamics and patterns in the time-average of  solutions or experiments can also be forced by symmetry.  It is  the purpose of this proposal to investigate these and related  phenomena. In particular we will study how symmetry and chaotic  dynamics intertwine in dynamical systems and how symmetry affects  the types of solutions found in systems of coupled cells.          In this project we will study iteration of symmetric maps  (symmetric chaos),  the investigation of coupled systems of ODEs  where each subsystem or cell has its own internal symmetry, the  stability of heteroclinic cycles (which occur naturally in  symmetric systems of differential equations), and the effect of  forced symmetry breaking (where perturbations of a symmetric  equation to one with less symmetry are considered).  Applications  to patterns on average in systems of PDEs and experiments  (particularly in the Taylor-Couette system and the Faraday  surface wave experiment) will be considered as will the existence  of intermittency (heteroclinic cycles) in an experiment modeling  convection in a porous media.  In addition, the dynamics of a  number of differential equations with symmetry will be studied by  direct computer simulation and the results compared with current  theory.",
