 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312091  Anson  This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry  and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  During the tenure of this  five-year continuing grant, Professor Anson and his students will  design, synthesize, and evaluate new surface confined electrocatalysts  for the direct, four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water and for  the electrooxidation of organic substrates such as methanol, ethanol,  formaldehyde, and formic acid.  The general applicability of  electrocatalysis by adsorbed electroactive ligands and their metal  complexes will also be explored.  Because many electrocatalytic species  are surface confined using polymeric matrices, the impact of solution  composition-controlled thermodynamic driving forces on the kinetics of  electron transfer across polymer-electrolyte interfaces will also be  investigated.  Finally, the electrochemical behavior of metastable  transition metal-dioxygen complexes, long believed to be key  intermediates in the electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen, will be  probed to afford insights into the mechanisms of these transition  metal-promoted processes.  %%%  The rational design of efficient, economical fuel cells and batteries  is predicated on a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical  processes involved.  This research is aimed at enhancing knowledge of  how electrochemical transformations of inexpensive substrate molecules  can be facilitated through electrocatalysis for use in these  technologically and societally important devices.  ***",
