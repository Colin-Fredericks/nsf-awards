 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cronmiller  93-16826  The broad goal of the proposed work is to understand the molecular  basis of the initiation phase of the sexual pathway choice in  Drosophila. Toward this goal, the following questions will be  asked: 1) Where and how do mutational changes in the da gene  disrupt wild-type function?  Six new ethyl-methane-sulfonate  induced alleles which have been characterized genetically will be  sequenced to find functional domains within the da gene product.  2) What regions of Da are required to activate sex-specific Sxl  expression in vivo? This approach will use in vitro mutagenesis,  combined with a transient in vivo functional assay, to complement  the domain mapping by mutational analysis. 3) Two newly identified  putative regulators of sex determination, E(2)AX and E(2)P239 will  be genetically characterized in regard to the null phenotypes,   temporal and spacial expression, function, genetic roles during sex  determination and the molecular mechanisms of function.  %%%  A central problem in the study of eukaryotic development is how the  growth and differentiation of an organism is genetically  programmed.  Sex determination in Drosophila has proven to be a  successful model system for elucidating basic biochemical  mechanisms that mediate the initiation and subsequent maintenance  of commitments to a variety of cellular differentiation pathways.   For example, the genetic and molecular analysis of the Initiation  of the sex determination pathway has uncovered connections between  this system and such diverse processes as dosage compensation,  neurogenesis, oogenesis, mammalian immunoglobulin gene expression  and oncogenic transformation.  These connections have emerged, in  part, as a result of the characterization of the daughterless gene.   The daughterless (da) gene has multiple roles in development, one  being the control of the cellular choice between male and female  developmental pathways.  In this capacity, the gene functions  together with the molecular constituents o f the pathway  initiating  signal, the X/A ratio.  Maternally supplied daughterless product is  required as a positive activator of the gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl),  which acts as a binary switch gene for the sex determination  pathway.  The product of the daughterless gene is a DNA-binding  protein, a member of the basic-helix-loop-helix family:  The da  protein (Da) appears to be a transcription factor.  The ultimate  goal of the work outlined in this proposal is to understand the  molecular basis of the Initiation stage of sexual pathway choice in  Drosophila.  One approach toward this goal will include a  functional \"dissection\" of the daughterless protein, one of the key  molecules in this genetic regulation.  An in vivo bioassay will be  developed to identify functional domains within the structure of  Da, and the molecular lesions responsible for a collection of  genetically defined hypomorphic and null alleles of the gene will  be identified.  A second approach will consist of the  characterization of other loci that may function in the early  regulation of sex determination. Two recently identified genes will  be analyzed to determine their genetic and molecular contributions  to sex determination.  ***",
