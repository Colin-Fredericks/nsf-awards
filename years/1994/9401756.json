Three particular problems will be  addressed in this project.  The first concerns the boundary  behavior of the Bergman kernel function and its derivatives on  smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domains.  The second involves  estimates of the Holder norm of solutions to the  Cauchy-Riemann equations on smoothly bounded convex domains  and the third relates to the mapping properties of the Szego  projection operator on various Banach spaces.  The methods  employed will center on the relationship between regularity for  solutions to certain systems of partial differential equations  and the geometry of the boundary of the domain in question.  Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear early on that the theory  differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics  of differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of  the fundamental structures were defined in the last three  decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these  basic mathematical forms.  ***",
