 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362164  DIERBERG    Remote sensing is used in a large number of environmental  investigations, including water quality assessments.  Most of the  data acquired for water quality are from satellite platforms, which  contain sensors that provide images using wide bandwidths. The use  of narrow, correctly positioned, spectral bands in current airborne  sensing devices as well as in a new generation of sensors planned  for satellites will simplify formulation of water quality  algorithms.  If simple, accurate, reproducible and sensitive  algorithms applicable to a wide range of coastal and inland waters  can be developed, then using remote sensing will become not only  easier and more reliable, but also more affordable and rapid due to  the reduction of data volume, increased integration times, and  facilitated image analysis.  The \"operationalization\" of remote  sensing for monitoring water quality conditions will become closer  to reality.     In the present investigation, algorithms representing spectral  energy from single bandwidths, ratios of bandwidths, and line  heights found to be highly correlated with chlorophyll a,  turbidity, and suspended solids for inland waters will be tested in  tow coastal ecosystems, the Indian River Lagoon and Tampa Bay. It   looks promising that even in the absence of precise optical  characteristics for an environment, it may be possible to simulate  that environment from previous ground truthing and derive fixed-  wing transportable coefficients.",
