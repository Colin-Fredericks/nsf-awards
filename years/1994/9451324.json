The course will be activity-  and inquiry driven, and will provide mechanical engineering  students with an opportunity early in their college career to  investigate and practice some general principles of materials  science and some general concepts in manufacturing to solve a  real-world problem in a design project involving  press-forming/press-shaping.  The laboratory course will carry one  (l) credit hour with half (0.5) credit hour of design, and will  meet once a week for three hours. It will consist of  lecture/demonstration during the first 20 to 30 minutes of the  class period, hands-on investigation by students during the next  hour-and-a-half to two hours, and will conclude with a class  discussion devoted to interpreting the results of the investigation  and how they relate to the design project. Students will work in  teams of two or three.  The four basic elements of materials  science and engineering -- synthesis and processing, structure,  properties, and performance -- will be investigated by students in  laboratory experiments and applied in the design project.  Statistics and probability as they relate to product descriptions,  tolerance, and properties will be applied by students in the design  project. They will also practice the process of design for  manufacturability, tool selection, and tooth path optimization.   The laboratory course will be team-taught. The project will be  assessed by tracking the progress of students who are enrolled in  the proposed course as they move forward in the engineering  curriculum. Results of the project will be disseminated by paper  presentations in regional and national conference, and published in  journals.",
