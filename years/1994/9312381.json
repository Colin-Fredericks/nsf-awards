 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312381  Sievers  Persistent spectral hole burning will be investigated in  chalcogenide glasses, polymers, and poled ferroelectrics.  A  ternary chalcogenide glass will be used to distinguish processes  which are controlled by the glass topology from those which are  dominated by the chemistry of the chalcogen (primarily Se)  chemistry.  The influence of network topology on short time energy  transfer and the homogeneous dephasing time will be measured by  infrared picosecond pump-probe and photon echo experiments,  respectively.  The focus in these studies is to determine the  effect of the average coordination number on the short time  dynamics.  Polymers will be investigated at very low temperatures  to inhibit thermally activated recovery to the vibrational ground  state.  Poled ferroelectrics will be studied by reorienting the  polar molecules by persistent hole burning in the opposite  direction to the crystal polarization.  In a related study, the  nature of localized vibrational modes will investigated in various  types of crystals containing defects.  In these materials localized  modes may be trapped at a defect site leading to persistent changes  in the defect absorption spectrum at low temperatures.  %%%  The absorption of light in a glass can be altered when a laser beam  is incident on the same region of the glass.  The glass retains a  memory of the laser light.  This memory effect is termed \"spectral  hole burning\" because the optical absorption is reduced precisely  for the same light energy corresponding to the laser energy.  Study  of the \"spectral hole\" as a function of temperature, time and light  energy provides important information about microscopic structural  properties of the glass.  The proposed study will extend the  investigation of this effect to ultrashort time scales and to  imperfect crystalline solids.  The aim of such studies is to modify  a solid in order to observe these hole burning effects at room  temperature with the potential application as optical mem ory  devices.  ***",
