Such a product would allow  PCB manufacturers to convert a critical step from an uncontrolled  manual procedure into a deterministic, measurable process.  Proven  techniques such as Statistical Process Control and continuous  improvement could then be applied to the custom tooling portion of  the PCB manufacturing process.  Printed Circuit Boards are an  essential component of almost every electrical and electronic  product sold today.  PCB Manufacturing is a complex process  involving many chemical, thermal, and mechanical steps.  Like other  manufacturing industries, PCB manufacturers seek to optimize each  of these steps to achieve the highest quality and the best yield.    Many of the key PCB manufacturing steps require tooling which is  unique for each PCB design produced.  The quality of this custom  tooling has a large effect on the yield and quality of the final  product.  The complex fine line patterns which the tooling must  accurately portray are contained in a design database.  Creation of  custom tooling from the design database is currently a manual  process performed by a human expert.  An automatic tooling  generator would bring a crucial portion of the PCB manufacturing  process under process control.  Manufacturers who adopted such a  product may increase competitiveness and lower costs through  optimized yield, higher quality, and shorter turnaround times.  ****",
