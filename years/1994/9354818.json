This project integrates recent  developments in computer based techniques with the current best  educational practices to create an innovative computer curriculum  for Scientist, Engineers, Mathematicians, and Educators.  The  curriculum is based on an emphasis of solution correctness, team  orientation, and the use of advanced languages, tools, and  application packages.  This foundation is combined with the  fundamentals of the Software Engineering, Object Oriented, and  Cleanroom paradigms to provide the skills necessary for each  undergraduate to take advantage of potential computers can provide  them in their educational and professional careers.    This project produced the foundation for three sequences of  introductory level computing service courses.  The courses were  categorized as application based consumer computing, software  development of small projects by a single individual, and large  scale, team based, system development.  The initial motivation for  these sequences of courses was based on the innovative curricula at  Florida Tech.  The foundation for the course sequences developed by  this project included an analysis of the expected needs of the  academic majors, a set of evaluation criteria, and a set of  preferred educational paradigms for course development.  Initial  course outlines were prepared, sample multimedia presentation were  developed, and a sequence of reports were produced.  This effort  also produced several general conclusions and a proposal for the  continuation of this project.  ***y",
