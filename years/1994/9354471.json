In addition, the  project leaders are engaging in dissemination activities to  determine the effects of implementation of these materials. The  curriculum materials are designed to provide students with greater  mathematical literacy and a stronger foundation to bridge the gap  to calculus. The project is investigating the adaptability of  current calculus reform dissemination models for use in an algebra  reform curriculum.  They are also designing a model for evaluation  of student attitudes and performance in comparison with students  taking introductory and/or intermediate algebra in a traditional  setting, as well as an instrument to document pedagogical changes  in teachers trying to implement a non-traditional curriculum.  A  proposed outcome of the project is a model for implementing a  reform algebra curriculum and the establishment of a network of  two-year and four-year college developmental mathematics  implementers for a particular curriculum reform project.  ***y",
