 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317540  Guy  The various physical components of the natural environment are  rarely optimal with respect to growth and development over the life  cycle of any given organism.  Because terrestrial environments are  dynamic, most plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with  marginally unfavorable conditions that may otherwise be  deleterious.  While physically different environmental conditions  may injure plants in quite unique ways, certain cellular  consequences of injury may be common to what would be viewed as  rather divergent environmental stresses.  The work outlined in this  proposal continues to focus attention on the fundamental role of a  class of molecular chaperones, the stress 70 family, in the basic  functioning of the plant cell and in the organism as a whole during  normal growth and development, as well as when subjected to  suboptimal and deleterious environmental condition.  It has been  demonstrated that one of the responses of spinach to low  nonfreezing temperture exposure involves an increased level of  expression for one or more members of the heat shock 70 family.   The objectives of the research are to: 1, determine the expression  responses for all members of this family to both short and long  term exposure to low temperature; 2, define the expression patterns  for all the members of the family in response to the complement of  environmental parameters of significance to plants; 3, examine the  phenotypic consequences resulting from over-and under-expression in  transgenic plants; and 4, continue the biochemical analyses of the  purified proteins with respect to peptide binding and its role in  protein assembly.  Together the aggregate of this work will be to  not only examine the molecular chaperone function of HSP/C70s, but  to test the hypothesis that this family of proteins plays an  important role in protein assembly and disassembly in plants at low  temperatures. ***",
