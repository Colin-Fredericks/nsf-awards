However, the development of visual, object  oriented languages and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) used in  conjunction with video and audio displays has vastly increased the  range of programming techniques and information types to be used  and mastered by computer science students. This project seeks to  improve the present undergraduate laboratory experience in computer  science through the establishment and use of the Multimedia,  Ergonomics, Design and Interface Activities (MEDIA) Lab for  exercises associated with eight existing undergraduate courses at  Southwest Texas State University. These new laboratory exercises  require equipment that is not available to the Department of  Computer Science, although the department has made substantial  investments in microcomputers to augment the existing campus-wide  mainframe network. The MEDIA Lab provides hands-on, open and closed  laboratory experiences in the use, design, development and  production of multimedia GUIs. The MEDIA Lab also provides students  a solid foundation of experience with the ergonomics (or human  factors) associated with the use of various GUI techniques and  devices. The MEDIA Lab functions in conjunction with the Computers  in Society Laboratory, CS1308 Lab, to train computer science majors  and minors as well as students enrolled in the departmental service  course. The MEDIA Lab allows students to experiment with multimedia  information and interfaces and to actually produce multimedia  products for dissemination. The MEDIA Lab should serve as a model  for the development of multimedia GUI training facilities,  materials and techniques in other computer science departments that  seek to prepare students to design applications that accommodate  the wide range of abilities and disabilities present in American  society.",
