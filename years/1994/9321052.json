 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321052  Meltzer  The optical dephasing time of dopant ions will be used as a tool to  investigate two-level systems (TLS) in disordered crystalline  materials such as mixed solid solutions and polycrystalline films,  where the disorder is generally experimentally variable.  These  types of experiments will be extended to ordered arrangements of  atoms in a restricted geometry, such as MBE grown undoped as well  as rare earth ion doped superlattices.  In a second set of  experiments phonon dynamics will be studied with a number of  innovative approaches.  These include use of a very short duration  (100 ps) pulses to study phonon-phonon interactions in RE doped  fluoride crystals, and use of two FIR pulse sources to study the  interaction between two narrow band phonon populations.  A third  study will apply coherent and transient holeburning techniques to  study the dynamics of the photoionization process of transition  metal ion sites in ferrolectric materials.  %%%  Unique optical techniques will be applied to study the nature of  disorder in doped crystals, mixed solid solutions, and ultrathin  semiconductor layers.  The unique techniques include two ultrashort  pulsed lasers which emit radiation at very long infrared  wavelengths used for directly generating sound waves in solids, and  a special laser which emits visible light which is extremely close  to a single frequency.  The latter light source will allow to study  changes in absorption induced by a laser very accurately as a  function of light wavelength.  A key aspect of this work is that  the degreee of disorder can be experimentally varied when preparing  a particular sample material.  This study is expected to provide  new sensitive tools for characterizing disorder with applications  to more controlled growth of a variety of optoelectronic materials.  ***",
