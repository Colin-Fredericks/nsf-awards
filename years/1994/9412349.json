 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412349  Langari       The award is for the purchase of components of an experimental  setup which will be capable of micromotions and which will be used  to support research in engineering.  The equipment includes linear  actuators, a laser doppler velocimeter, force transducer, acoustic  emission sensor, and digital signal processor based data  acquisition and control equipment, along with an optical bread  board and custom built accessories.       The equipment will be used for research involving development  of accurate models of friction-induced dynamics at low velocities  and development of effective control strategies to deal with  friction-induced dynamics at low velocities and in micro-  positioning situations.  The better understanding of friction and  its control would be of help in many manufacturing applications  involving precise motion control.",
