This equipment will be used to measure the body composition and energy content  of arctic animals, as part of several related research projects on the hysiological ecology of high latitude endotherms (songbirds, microtines, geese, seabirds, ground squirrels, and ruminants).  All projects seek to understand the regulatory role of nutrient and energy reserves for either migration, reproduction, or  survival.    The TOBEC body composition analyzer is a new instrument for noninvasive  measurement of body composition in live subjects and provides an opportunity to examine temporal variation in an individual's fat and protein reserves. The Soxhlet apparatus would be used to calibrate the TOBEC technique and extract stored lipids for further analyses.  Separation and quantitation of lipid classes would be accomplished with the TLC/FID system, and the energy content of storage compounds will be measured with the isoperibol oxygen bomb  calorimeter.     Determination of body composition is a fundamental method for evaluating physical condition and nutritional status of animals. Lipid and lean mass are measures of energy and protein reserves and, presumably, of fitness during periods of food shortage, dormancy, or negative energy ba lance.  Scientists at the Institute of Arctic Biology are engaged in several research projects that test the adaptive significance of fat reserves for endotherms living in high latitude environments.  Procurement of the above pieces of equipment will greatly enhance existing research projects at the Institute that are described in this proposal, and will provide many opportunities for new projects.  In addition, the new instrumentation will significantly improve instruction and research of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.                 9         9     (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial                                 \"             h            E                        =    abstract    Deseree King, BIR Deseree King, BIR               X1       ~CRD3E17TMP            X1       ~CAL1E3FTMP           l:L       ~CRD1809TMP           p:L       9317916  Roby   This Equipment Proposal requests funds to purchase (1) total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) body compositi    9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       d                           9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    !         !
