 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450849  Gale                                 \\A powerful microcomputer-based computer algebra system such as  Maple V is a resource for calculus teaching that can enhance  students' understanding of fundamental concepts, enable students  and instructors to do realistic applications, and ameliorate the  ongoing decline in the number of students pursuing technical  degrees. To maximize these benefits the CAS must be incorporated  smoothly into each class session in such a way that students can  see how the program is used, and can use it themselves whenever  need or opportunity arises. To this end, the Department of  Mathematics of the University of North Carolina at Asheville is  teaching calculus in a combination classroom/computer laboratory.   A classroom is outfitted with 19 Macintosh Centris 650 computers,  an In Focus System 6000 LCD projection panel, and some networking  hardware and software.  The calculus computer classroom (not a  laboratory) enables smooth transitions between lecture/discussion  and computer explorations. This classroom enables the mathematics  faculty to teach calculus courses in an innovative way and creates  a model for math departments initiating changes in their own  curricula.",
