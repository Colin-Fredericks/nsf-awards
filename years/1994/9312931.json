Bayesian techniques have found  applications in virtually every branch of statistics, and have proved to be  useful in the analysis and interpretation of a wide range of data.  Bayesian  analysis which utilizes prior information in addition to the information from  the collected data, is particularly well-suited in finite population sampling.   In most surveys, there is some prior information available about the units of  the population to be sampled.  For example, for  estimating the yield of a  certain crop based on samples from a large number of agricultural units,  information is usually available regarding the area devoted to that particular  crop in all these units.  Bayesian methods enable one to incorporate this  prior information formally in the form of a prior distribution, and produce  estimates in a fairly straight forward manner.        In addition, there is a growing need to produce reliable small-area  estimates, that is estimates for counties, municipalities, and other local  areas.  Classical sample survey methods are usually designed to provide  effective estimates at a much higher level of aggregation, for example at the  state level.  But standard estimation based only upon data for a given local  area typically results in unacceptably large standard errors due to small  sample size within a local area.  Bayesian methods enable borrowing strength,  or use information from similar areas or sources to improve accuracy of  individual local area estimates.  This is used for a wide range of survey data  being collected by both the public and the private sectors.        The Conference will provide a mechanism for synthesizing the substantial  and diverse literature in the general area of Bayesian finite population  sampling, and will illustrate the methods with a number of real life  applications.  ***",
