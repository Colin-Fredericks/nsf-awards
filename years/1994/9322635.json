An initial  selection of candidates is made by the Council  for International Exchange of Scholars before  final review and selection by NSF.  Awardees  come from a wide range of scientific fields in  the social and physical sciences, and will work  with counterparts in India.  NSF supports the  travel, a portion of living expenses, and some  costs related to the research project for  approximately eight awardees per academic year.   Part of the award funds the Subcommission for  administrative costs.  Past participants have  engaged primarily in the social and behavioral  sciences, with some in the physical  and  geological sciences.      Scope:  This project directly supports  collaborative research between US and Indian  scholars.  The office that represents the  Subcommission in India provides critical  services for the U.S. side such as obtaining  necessary clearances for US scientists to be  affiliated with various Indian academic and  research institutions.  They manage the  logistics of travel for each scientist and  his/her family as necessary; arrange for the  shipping of research material into and out of  India; provide for language training and assist  with research arrangements.  This project fits  the objectives of the India program very well.   ***",
