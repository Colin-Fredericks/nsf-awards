 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSRTACT    A combined program of field measurements and modeling  of  the Artic snow cover is proposed as an addition to the Land/  Atmosphere/ Ice/ Interactions (LAII) component of the Artic  System Science Program.  The objective of the proposed  program is to understand the role of the Artic snow cover in  governing the winter heat and mass exchange between  the  ground and atmosphere.    The justification for studying the Artic snow cover is that  it is one of the dominant features of the Artic system and  needs to be accurately incorporated in an Artic system  model.  Studies have shown that long-term changes in the  depth and thermal properties of the snow that could  accompany a change in climate would affect plants under the  snow and the temperature.  Furthermore, thawing of carbon-  rich permafrost may release CO2 to the atmosphere, providing  a strong feedback mechanism for local and global  warming.  Predicting  how the Artic will respond to changing climate  will require understanding the role of the winter snow  cover.    The core of the proposed program is a series of over-snow  traverses during which extensive measurements of the  physical and thermal properties of the snow will be made.  Traverse measurements, along with knowledge of the physical  process that affect the Artic snow cover, will be used to  develop an Artic snow distribution model.  The validated  snow distribution model can be incorporated in both climate  and surface process models being developed under other LAII  projects.",
