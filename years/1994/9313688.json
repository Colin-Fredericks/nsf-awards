 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313688  Furbish  This project is aimed at providing a general description of the  complex flow fields that can occur in steep mountain streams, whose  morphologies consist of irregular arrangements of stable boulders  and logs, and small gravel bars.  The treatment makes use of both  linear and nonlinear formulations involving depth-integrated  equations of momentum and mass continuity to describe how  streamwise and transverse flow velocities, and water-surface  topography, respond to an irregular bed whose topography is  significantly more complex than that of alluvial self-formed  channels.  The work is an extension of a linear model which  predicts that the wavelength of nascent bend forms can be longer  than that of the dominant bendforms.  Theoretical aspects of the  work will be tested with data collected rom North Boulder Creek,  Colorado.  Data will come from a single reach of nearly 80 channel  widths in length, and from two short reaches selected for detailed  measurements of bed topography and flow.  Results will provide a  mechanical basis for testing the idea that these bouldery channels  can undergo a self-stabilizing period that involves an interaction  among extant flow conditions, variable erodibility of bed and bank  materials, local armoring of the bed, and piecemeal transport of  sediment.",
