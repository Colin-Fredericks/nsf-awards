Two systems  will be investigated, one with a storage system  to even out the diurnal and seasonal  insolation, and the other without such storage.   The theoretical study will determine the  optimum variables of each of the two systems  under various conditions.  In the experimental  investigations, to be carried out in Pakistan,  a PV Hydrogen Production demonstration system  will be designed, built, operated, and  evaluated.  The results will be used to refine  the theory.    Scope:  This project addresses one of the major  problems facing many developing countries.   Pakistan is one such country with no oil  reserves, but which may be able, by virtue of  being in the sunbelt, to utilize solar  radiation for energy and for industrial  applications.  The collaboration by the CERI  with the NIST in Pakistan provides a strong  combination of complementary capabilities.  The  NIST is backed by the Pakistan Ministry of  Science and Technology which has already  allocated the necessary resources for the major  part of the project, the experimental part.   The project can lead to major benefits to the  U.S. in supplying much of the materials and  technology needed, and can benefit Pakistan and  other developing countries utilize an endless  source of energy for various applications and  industries.  ***",
