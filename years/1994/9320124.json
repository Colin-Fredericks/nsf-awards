This  system has been chosen since it is ideally suited for the study of  multiparameter bifurcations in anisotropic pattern-forming systems.  An experiment in convection of pressurized gases, opposed to, for  example, electroconvection of liquid crystals (EC), has the major  advantage that the fundamental equations describing the fluid flow  are well understood.  Pressurized gases allow experiments  (similarly to EC) in large systems, where boundary effects are weak  and much of the spatial degrees of freedom are retained.  In  addition, by changing the temperature and pressure a wide range in  parameters can be achieved.  The weakly nonlinear region will be  investigated and quantitatively compared with recent theoretical  investigations.    Non-technical abstract:  The aim of this research is th  experimental investigation of nonlinear, non-equilibrium pattern-  forming phenomena.  As a paradigm buoyancy-driven convective flow  in a fluid layer which is inclined with respect to the horizontal  will be studied.  This system is of great interest from a physics  point of view as well as of major importance in heating and cooling  technology.  By using pressurized gases at ambient temperatures as  working fluids convection cells with unprecedented large system  sizes under well controlled boundary conditions can be realized.   It is expected that boundary effects will be weak and much of the  spatial degrees of freedom will be retained.  The research will  allow a detailed quantitative comparison with recent theoretical  investigations.  ***",
