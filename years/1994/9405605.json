 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405605  The naturally synchronous plasmodium of physarium will be utilized  to isolate genes whose transcript levels peak during the last hour  of the mitotic cycle.  The cDNAs will be prioritized for further  analysis.  For practical simplicity, initial priority will go to  genes present in single copy.  Among these, top priority will go to  novel genes, as estimated by partial DNA sequencing.  The complete  coding sequence will be obtained for one single-copy plasmodium-  specific gene and for one single-copy gene expressed in both amoeba  and plasmodial stages.  A genomic clone will be obtained for each  fully-sequenced gene, and used to disrupt the gene in order to  determine whether its function is essential for viability.  %%%  The major periodic events of the mitotic cycle are DNA replication  and mitosis. They must be regulated so that they occur alternately  and only once per cycle. Many gene products involved in this  regulation have been identified, notably protein kinases,  phosphatases and cyclins. Regulation is achieved by periodic  changes in the activities of these molecules, which can be achieved  at the level of transcription, mRNA stability, protein stability,  association with other proteins, and covalent modifications. This  proposal focusses on periodic transcription, which for some genes  is crucial for proper regulation of the mitotic cycle Many of the  genes involved in mitotic cycle regulation may not be identifiable  by classical genetic methods. This proposal uses an alternative  method to identify novel genes that may be involved in mitotic  cycle regulation. cDNAs for genes whose transcript levels peak  during late G2 phase will be isolated, using the plasmodium of the  protist Physarum polyacephalum as a source of transcripts to  template the cDNAs. The plasmodium has a naturally synchronous  mitotic cycle, so that changes in transcript levels are readily  detectable. Moreover, the plasmodium can be grown to extra-  ordinarily large mass, providing a sou rce of transcripts at  precisely-defined mitotic cycle stages that will be used to  template cDNA synthesis. mRNA from alternative mitotic cycle stages  will be used for hybrid subtractions to enrich the cDNA library for  clones representing periodic transcripts. Once periodic cDNAs are  identified, their copy number will be determined, and further  analysis restricted to single-copy genes. Next, gene expression  will be studied both in the Physarum plasmodium and in the Physarum  amoeba a haploid uninucleate cell similar to an animal cell. The  cDNAs will be partially sequenced to determine which are likely to  represent novel genes. Then, one novel, gene that is expressed only  in the plasmodium and another novel gene that is expressed in both  amoebal and plasmodial stages will be fully sequenced to  investigate their coding potential.  The requirement of each of  these two genes will be tested by gene disruption.  Success in this  endeavor would create a foundation for identifying other periodic  genes that may be involved in mitotic cycle control. For such  genes, the special characteristics of the Physarum cell types would  provide a powerful system for analyzing their role in the mitotic  cycle and the timing and mechanism of their action.  ***",
