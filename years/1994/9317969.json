 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317969  Marden    Physiological processes in animal tissues are strongly  affected by temperature, with resultant effects on whole-  organism performance and fitness. The precise manner in  which tissue and organismal performance are affected by  temperature is called \"thermal sensitivity\". Studies of  lower vertebrates have led to an understanding of some of  the molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine thermal  sensitivity, and to an appreciation of how variation in  thermal sensitivity among species affects their geographic  distribution and ecology. However, current evolutionary  models lack consensus regarding fitness of variation in  thermal sensitivity, with competing models concentrating on  how thermal sensitivity affects niche breadth, aerobic  performance capacity, high-temperature tolerance during peak  activity, and compromises between high- and low- temperature  performance capacity. Ability to distinguish among these  competing hypotheses is hampered by the scarcity of species  in which there is both i) variation in thermal sensitivity  among individuals, and ii) ability to observe and measure  fitness variation among animals possessing different thermal  sensitivities. This project takes advantage of the presence  of large-scale variation in thermal sensitivity among  different-aged individuals in a dragonfly, and the ability  to manipulate and observe these abundant and highly active  animals in a field setting. Results of these experiments  will allow critical tests of the competing models for the  evolution of thermal sensitivity.       This project will also make a detailed examination of       the  cellular and molecular mechanisms that affect variation in  thermal sensitivity of muscle performance. Preliminary data  indicate that a switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism  accompanies the age-related change in thermal sensitivity,  and that variation in expression of a calcium regulatory  protein, troponin-t, may be particularly important in  determining  how mu scle functions in changing thermal and pH  conditions. An opportunity to enhance our understanding of  the basic physiology of troponin-t is particularly  significant, since presence of this molecule in the blood  stream has recently become the most sensitive clinical  indicator of severe myocardial infraction in humans(i.e.  heart attack).       In summary, this project will examine physiology and  ecology of a model organism in order to provide new data and  perspectives that will influence our understanding of both  basic evolutionary processes and muscle physiology.  ***",
