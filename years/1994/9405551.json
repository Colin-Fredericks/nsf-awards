 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405551  Wilkinson       The nature and genesis of shallow marine cyclic carbonate  units has been a subject of alluring interest for over several  decades, with origins variably attributed to the central importance  of high-frequency sealevel change, to periodic but intrabasinal  variation in subtidal carbonate production, and even to stochastic  episodes of random carbonate deposition.  Numerical simulations  incorporating a wide variety of allocyclic, autocyclic, and  aperiodic scenarios can all be tuned to yield reasonable scenarios  of repeated upward-shoaling peritidal carbonate accumulation.   Moreover, no single paradigm of intrabasinal versus extrabasinal or  haphazard versus periodic accumulation has proven to be a superior  predictor of the composition and distribution of cyclic limestone  deposits in epicratonic settings.       Recent analysis of stratigraphic data on cyclic peritidal  carbonates over a wide geographic and geologic range indicates that  measured thickness frequencies are strongly skewed and that the  actual distribution of cycle thickness is perhaps exponential.  We  wish to explore the nature of thickness structures among peritidal  lithofacies and lithofacies associations in order to evaluate this  postulate, and believe that important progress in developing an  understanding of cycle generation will be gained from careful  investigation of facies arrangements and thicknesses.  Funds are  therefore requested to:  1) determine differences between minimum  carbonate production rates and maximum carbonate accumulation rates  in several subtidal coquinoid parasequences; 2) carry out detailed  examination of several shallow-water carbonate sequences to  quantitatively determine if statistically-important asymmetrically-  stacked lithofacies associations are present, and 3) analyze  measured and synthetic facies associations in order to determine if  frequency distributions of cycle thicknesses delineate patterns  anticipated from periodic or random deposition.       In  the first instance, comparison of data on carbonate  generation versus accumulation will not only allow for assessment  of early Phanerozoic stratigraphic completeness at a kiloyear scale  of resolution, but will also provide the first tangible basis for  evaluating the usefulness of Holocene rate data in ancient platform  settings.  In the second case, presence or absence of numerically  significant facies associations will provide a quantitative  assessment of the importance of upward-shoaling motifs in several  classic examples of carbonate cyclicity.  This will be one of the  first extensive attempts to quantitatively discern and document the  presence (or absence) of repetitive upward-shoaling facies  associations among shallow marine carbonates, and plainly is (and  should be) a requisite step in investigations of any supposedly  cyclic sequence.  In the third case, the nature of cycle thickness  distributions bears directly on questions of depositional  periodicity.  Should data on natural cycles result in  differentiation of some modal thickness class, such a distribution  would largely be in agreement with presumed repetitive and periodic  carbonate accumulation.  Presence of exponential thickness  distributions, on the other hand, is not as yet easily rationalized  when assuming periodic accumulation, but is in agreement with  anticipated trends if cycle formation reflects a random probability  of deposition during uniform subsidence.",
