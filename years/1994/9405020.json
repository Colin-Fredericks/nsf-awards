 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405020  Cook  O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS)   is a PLP-dependent enzyme  that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of L-cysteine, the  conversion of O-acetyl-L-serine and sulfide to L-cysteine and  acetate.  he OASS is one of only a few  -substitution and  -  elimination reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes that has  been studied in detail.  It is unique as a  -substitution reaction  in having a ping pong mechanism, allowing study of the two halves  of the reaction separately.  Over the past grant period studies  have focused on the kinetic and acid-base chemical mechanisms of  the A and B isozymes of OASS, as well as the spectral  identification of intermediates, crystallization, and site-directed  metagenesis.  As a result, the kinetic and acid-base chemical  mechanisms are well known, as is the spectral properties of many of  the intermediates along the reaction pathway.  In addition, OASS-A  has been crystallized, apoenzyme prepared, and several site-  directed mutants have been studied.  Continuation of the studies of  OASS will be carried out using four main aims.  1) Although a  mechanism has been proposed for OASS, it is not known what  intermediates build up along the reaction pathway, or the nature of  the rate-determining transition state structures.  Primary  substrate deuterium solvent deuterium, secondary deuterium, and  multiple isotope effects will be measured for both isozymes using  natural and slow alternative substrates.  2) The isotope effect  studies will be complemented by rapid scanning stopped-flow studies  of both half reactions. Aims 1 and 2 should allow a reconstitution  of the reaction pathway and provide transition state structural  information.  3) A number of site-directed mutants have ben made  probing the function of enzymes residues that are implicated in  aspects of mechanism including K42 (Schiff base lysine), C43 (the  only cysteine and known to be in the active site), and W51/W162  (one of the only two Trps is implicated fluorescence e nergy  transfer) and these are being characterized.  Additional site-  directed mutants will be prepared as dictated by the enzyme crystal  structure, which will be solved in addition to the studies outlines  above, but is not part of the present proposal.  the completion of  these studies will be placed   OASS among the best studies of the  PLP enzymes.  In addition, the structure of OASS-A will be  available to compare to the tryptophan synthase  2 which catalyzes  a very similar reaction.   %%%  O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase is an eznyme that depends on a form of  vitamin B6 for its activity.  The purpose of the proposed studies  is to determined how the enzyme  and  its B6 cofactor catalyze the  substitution of one group for another in amino acids, the building  block of proteins.  The enzyme studies is representative of a class  of enzymes, and thus anything learned could be applied to other  enzymes in the class.  The reaction will be studied using kinetic  techniques which view the enzyme in the act of catalysis, and site  directed mutagenesis which allows a change in specific amino acid  residues of the enzyme thought to be important in the reaction.  ***",
