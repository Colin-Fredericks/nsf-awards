Our main tools are expression of cloned copies rRNA operons from natural  rRNA promoters or from inducible promoters, at high or moderate levels, and assay of structure and  function using allele-specific chemical probing as well as by more conventional methods. Among the  functional problems we plan to address are the role of rRNA in tRNA selection, subunit association,  translocation and peptidyl transferase activity. Bases that have been identified as potential components of  these respective ribosomal functional sites will be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting  phenotypes will be studied, and we will attempt to analyze the mechanistic basis of the genetic defects,  to obtain direct genetic evidence for the functional roles of specific sites in rRNA in translation. We will  use suppressor and synthetic lethal mutations to discover new sites and interactions that have not yet been  identified by biochemical approaches. We also plan to continue to analyze the higherorder structure of  rRNA, using site-directe mutagenesis. We will test the biological importance of proposed pseudoknot  interactions in rRNA, and will test the requirement for proposed non-canonical base pairs for ribosome  function. Finally, we wish to understand the role of a newly discovered protein that we believe may be  involved in assembly events involving the 5' terminal region of 16S rRNA.  %%%  It is becoming clear that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) plays an important role, not only in the assembly  and structure of ribosomes, but in their function in protein synthesis as well. Using genetic  approaches, we propose to study the molecular basis for the folding and function of rRNA. From  biochemical and phylogenetic approaches, key nucleotides in rRNA have been identified. For  example, many well-known antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth by interacting with specific s ites in the  rRNA of bacterial ribosomes. These sites turn out to be functional sites where other important  macromolecular components of the translational system, such as transfer RNA and elongation factors,  interact with the ribosome. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we can change the identity of these  nucleotides and study the consequences of these changes to try to deduce how they play a role in these  fundamental processes. Using genetic approaches that we have developed over the past few years, we  can also search for mutations that affect other sites and functions of rRNA, by screening or selecting  for their effects on specific ribosomal processes. By combining the results of these genetic approaches  with the results of biochemical, phylogenetic and structural studies, we hope to be able to gain a  clearer understanding of how the ribosome is put together, and how it works.  ***",
