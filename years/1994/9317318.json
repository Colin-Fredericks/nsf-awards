 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317318  Stock  This award supports a marine geophysical study of the southwest Pacific between 170  degrees E and 80 degrees W longitude.  Recent marine geophysical cruises in the  southwest Pacific and a high-resolution altimetric gravity field declassified Geosat data  have allowed significant progress to be made towards deciphering the complex history  of the rifting between the Campbell Plateau/Chatham Rise landmass and the Marie  Byrd Land margin.  A revised history of plate interactions explains many enigmatic  features seen in the magnetic and gravity fields yet several questions remain that  require new data for resolution.  The marine geophysical survey proposed will: (1)  elucidate plate interactions at the evolving triple junction between the Antarctic and  Australian plates and the mosaic of SW Pacific plates; (2) define the boundaries and  interactions of the mosaic of plates that accommodated the rapidly changing plate  geometry associated with subduction of the Pacific-Phoenix ridge outboard of New  Zealand, the rifting of continental and oceanic lithosphere, and hotspot activity; and (3)  map the development of Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and the assembly of the several small  plates into the modern day Pacific plate.  This survey will help to elucidate the  dynamics of plate interactions and the plate tectonic evolution of Antarctica and New  Zealand.  ***",
