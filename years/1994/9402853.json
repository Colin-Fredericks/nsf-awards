 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402853  Ducharme  This is an initiative to establish collaborative research between  the Principle Investigator's laboratory and the Electronic  Materials Laboratory, headed by distinguished scientist Dr.  Vladimir Fridkin, in the Institute of Crystallography of the  Russian Academy of Sciences.    The interests and capabilities of the two laboratories are  complementary.  Fridkin's laboratory has extensive background and  current activity in photoferroelectric and photovoltaic phenomena  in crystals and polymers.  Ducharme's laboratory is studying  photorefractive and related properties of polymers, as well as  other novel photonic materials and devices.    We propose to bring one of Fridkin's associates, Dr. Valeri  Lazarev, to work in Ducharme's laboratory for two years.  Lazarev  will conduct experimental studies of photorefractive and  photovoltaic phenomena in polymers and transient grating studies of  the pyroelectric gratings in electro-optic materials.  He will also  contribute to other ongoing research in Ducharme's laboratory.    Fridkin and his colleagues in Moscow will provide samples of  photonic materials, including ferroelectric polymers and electro-  optic and photorefractive crystals.  Fridkin will develop  theoretical models of the results and also provide guidance to the  direction of the ongoing research in Ducharme's laboratory.  ***",
