This residential Summer Science Camp Project will serve 40  middle school youth annually from the Lincoln, Nebraska, Public  School District.  The Project will recruit underrepresented  minority students from low-income backgrounds whose parents lack a  college degree and involve these students in educational activities  following their seventh or eighth grade year.  Over the 36-month  period from 1 April 1994 to 31 March 1997, there will be 120 total  Project participants.    one of the Project's strengths is that it will draw on the  complementary talents of university professors, active  professionals in the field, and certified public school teachers  working together as an integrated team.  The paid staff will  include a Project Coordinator, six Educational Consultants from the  university faculty, three certified secondary-education  Instructors, and four live-in Residential Advisers responsible for  supervision and peer interaction in the residence halls.   Uncompensated volunteers will include a team of mentors drawn from  SEM-based industries in the locality.  Leadership will be provided  by a Director who has over 20 years' experience in educational  administration and whose salary is paid by the University of  Nebraska.    The Summer Science Camp will consist of three components.  First,  eligible students will be recruited for the Project, selected for  participation, and invited to an orientation meeting with their  parents in the spring.  Second, during the six-week summer  component, participants, will be offered a  variety of activities  including motivational science and math enrichment courses, field  trips, practical applications, and actual research experiences at  the University.  These activities will enhance students' awareness  of SEM career options, prepare them to succeed in the related  preparatory courses, and build a sense of community for positive  peer support.  Third, through the academic year component, the  Summer Science Camp Project will make available numerous resources  to promote the continued academic success of participants.  The  faculty involved in this Project will publish its details and  results in professional journals.     ***",
