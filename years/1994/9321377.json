 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321377  Buikstra    With National Science Foundation support Drs. Jane Buikstra, Jane  Wheeler and collaborators will study archaeological camelid  remains recovered from a number of sites in Southern Peru.  Because of the excellent preservation characteristic in the dry  desertic environment, the mummified remains permit examination of  hair and stomach contents and the extraction of DNA. The sites  span several centuries and the camelid remains were recovered in  clear cultural contexts since the animals were in fact purposely  buried and not consumed as food. The research team will conduct a  number of specialist analyses which will shed light on the degree  of domestication of these animals, clarify species  identifications and illuminate the role domesticates played in  prehistoric Peruvian society.    Several camelid species, including llama and alpaca, were  domesticated in the New World and played a central role for  prehistoric peoples of the region. They served as sources of  transportation, of fiber for both utilitarian clothing and highly  valued woven objects and as food. The rise of complex societies  both worldwide and in the Andes is closely tied to the  development of domestic plants and animals. Howevep because the  skeletons of different camelid species look much alike and  because it is difficult to separate domestic from wild animals,  archaeologists have found it hard to determine when camelids were  domesticated and how they were used. The proposed research which  examines mummified remains from a variety of scientific  perspectives will help to answer this question.    Camelids play an important role in many areas of highland South  America today. An understanding of their prehistoric use may help  to devise more efficient herd management practices.",
