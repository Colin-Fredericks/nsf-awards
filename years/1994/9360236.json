 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360236  McElroy  Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an important worldwide food legume,  capable of growing with minimal rainfall and capable of fixing  nitrogen.  The crop is often grown in rotation with grains on  nitrogen deficient soils.  For the plant to reach maximum  sustainable yields without supplemental nitrogen, it must be  inoculated with a Rhizobium and planted during winter seasons.   Planting under cool wet conditions, however, subjects the crop to  Pythium caused damping-off resulting in serious crop loss.  Seed  treatment with chemical fungicides is effective but kills the  Rhizobium.  Thus, an alternative method to prevent Pythium caused  damping-off is desirable.  This project will examine the  feasibility of using biological disease control agents (BDCAs) in  combination with Rhizobium to prevent Pythium disease and maximize  the sustainable yield of chickpea.  Greenhouse Phase I studies will  test five BDCAs with special chickpea Rhizobium in four different  agricultural soils.  If successful, this unique method of  preventing Pythium disease could be used in other sustainable food  legume crops in the U.S. and worldwide, and therefore, is directly  related to U.S. technical and economic competitiveness in  agricultural biotechnology.",
