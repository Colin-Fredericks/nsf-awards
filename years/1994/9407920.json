The objective are to:  1, isolate virescent mutants from EMS, fast-neutron, and T-  DNA  mutagenized Arabidopsis; 2, characterize the  development of the photosynthetic apparatus in these mutants  using absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence emission,  transmission electron microscopy, and native Deriphat gel  electrophoresis; 3, to analyze mutants with regard to  temperature sensitivity as well as sensitivity to differing  light intensities; and 4, to perform a genetic analysis.  The genetic analysis will include reciprocal backcrosses to  determine if mutations are inherited maternally or through  either parent, complementation studies between the different  mutant lines, and crosses between mutant lines and a wild  type line of a different ecotype to permit RFLP mapping.  The long term goal is to clone and characterize genes whose  products are involved in the regulation of chloroplast  development in higher plants.  %%%  The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis and carbon  fixation, and its development is critical for plant  survival.  The chloroplast originated as an endosymbiont of  photosynthetic bacteria, and over time many regulatory  functions of the bacterial genome wre taken over by the  nucleus.  Although many mutations that alter the chloroplast  have been isolated from a large number of different plant  species, none so far have led to clear understanding of the  molecular events that regulate chloroplast development in  higher plants.  The model plant system, Arabidopsis  thaliana, offers an opportunity to understand this process  because genes involved in plastid development that are  identified by mutation can be cloned.  The objective of the  work proposed in this research planning grant is to isolate  mutants in Arabidopsis that display a delay in greening  phenotype (termed virescent) in order to evaluate mutations  most likely to be involved in the regulation of chloroplast  development.  Several mutants have alr eady been obtained,  and more will be obtained.  These will be characterized  biochemically, structurally, and genetically in order to  identify those of the greatest potential for understanding  chloroplast development.  The long term goal of this work is  to clone the genes responsible for these mutations and to  understand their functions.  ***",
