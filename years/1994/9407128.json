The PE is thin membranous sheath that lines  the midguts of insects, which is the section of the  digestive track where digestion of food and absorption of  nutrients occurs. Several functions have been proposed for  the PE: (1) protection of the gut lining from damage by  abrasive food items; (2) prevention of access to the gut  wall by bacteria  and viruses; and (3) compartmentation of  the midgut resulting in improved efficiency of digestion and  assimilation. In this study the PI will test the hypothesis  that the PE also serves as a barrier to the absorption of  many toxins. The PI has already demonstrated that the PEs of  two caterpillar species are impermeable to tannic acid,  which is a toxic phenol that occurs in plants. In order to  determine whether the failure of common plant toxins to  penetrate the PE is a general phenomenon, or one limited to  tannins, we will determine the permeability of the PEs from  a selection of species of both caterpillars (Lepidoptera)  and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) to a wide range of toxin  classes that include compounds with a variety of chemical  and physical properties.       Possible mechanisms that might result in the  containment of chemicals within the PE include: (1)  absorption on the inner surface; (2) the presence of pores  in the PE that are too small for the toxin molecules, either  free or complexed within other molecules, to pass through;  (3) association of the toxin with lipid aggregates that are  too large to pass through the pores of the PE; and (4)  repulsion between negatively charged groups on the toxin  molecule and negative charges present in the matrix of the  PE. Results obtained to date rule out absorption as the  mechanism in Lepidoptera, and measurements of PE pore size  suggest that the pores are too large to restrict the passage  of uncomplexed toxin molecules. Additional expe riments will  be conducted to test the other possible mechanisms.     This study will advance our understanding of the basic  physiological and biochemical adaptations of insects to  natural and synthetic toxins. Our findings might have  practical significance in the area of pesticide development  and in efforts to produce pest-resistant crops by plant-  breeding programs or by genetic engineering.  ***",
