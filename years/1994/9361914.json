 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361914  Vickery  Estimates of design windspeeds in the nonhurricane-prone  region of the United States are derived from historical  records of windspeeds obtained from surface level  anemometers.  These surface-level windspeed measurements are  subject to errors produced by terrain effects, nearby  structures and vegetation, changes in the height of the  anemometer over time, and observation errors.  These  measurements are made only at fixed anemometer stations and  there is no first principle method to estimate winds at  other locations.    This research project investigates an innovative method for  determining windspeeds and their spatial variations for  extensive pressure systems (EPS) using a first principle  direct analysis approach.  The proposed methodology makes  use of the recently available, and inexpensive, data set of  historical records of surface pressures for the contiguous  United States.  Using this data, the pressure field can be  reconstructed on an hour-by-hour basis.  From the  reconstructed pressure field a continuous record of  windspeed and direction at gradient height can be generated  at any one location or multiple locations in the United  States.    The approach eliminates the problems which plague surface-  level measurements and provides a means to estimate area-  wide risk associated with the passing of intense, large-  scale, low pressure systems.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***",
