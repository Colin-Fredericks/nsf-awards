 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311121  Warnow  \"Big\" science has now reached the point where no one institution  can supply the financial resources, personnel or equipment to  undertake a research project.  200 or more authors are not uncommon  in publications resulting from these projects.  The authors come  together from many different institutions in order to form  temporary collaborations of varying durations.  How do they  operate?  How do they communicate?  How do the senior leaders in  the project exercise control over the more junior investigators?   These and many other questions need to be answered if we are to  understand how big science operates.    Under the direction of Ms. Warnow, the AIP Center for History of  Physics has completed two phases of a three phase study of multi-  institutional collaborative research in different areas of physics.   Under two prior grants, the AIP has intensively studied  collaborations in high-energy physics, space science, and  geophysics.  Under this third grant, the AIP is modifying its  approach to the study of collaborations in order to promote a  comparative perspective and to develop policies and recommendations  to improve documentation of such collaborations generally.  Under  Ms. Warnow's leadership, the AIP team is investigating ten fields  of science and technology that have used multi-institutional  collaborations from the mid-1970's to the present. These fields  include not only physics but also biology, chemistry, and computer  science. The staff are conducting a total of 90 interviews--enough  to develop a profile of organizational structure, operational  functions, and patterns of communication of collaborations in each  field.  Interview subjects include not only scientists but also  administrators and technical support staff.  They are using a  single question set to solicit easily compared data from  interviewees on the basis patterns they have seen.  Three reports  will result from this study:  (1) A report on multi-institutional  collaborations over recent d ecades to the present; (2) Guidelines  for the appraisal of records created by multi-institutional  collaborations; and (3) A summary and a set of final  recommendations to serve the needs of archivists and policy makers  in the scientific community. The oral history recordings and  transcripts will be accessible in the AIP Center's Niels Bohr  Library.  ***",
