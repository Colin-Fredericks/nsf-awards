 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ARI (Academic Research Infrastructure) Application  requests a high pressure liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS) system for the  Chemistry and Biology departments at  Lehman College. This system will facilitate the research of  three faculty members, as well as the  research of a new faculty member in the Biology Department.  Lehman College qualifies as a Minority  Institution.    HPLC-MS is a new and powerful technique for the analysis of  natural products. In one step, it allows  researchers to detect, separate, and perform a preliminary  structural characterization of substances in a  mixture. Since the mixtures under study can have hundreds of  components, it allows easy analysis of  hundreds of compounds in one experiment.    The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) component of  the system is the most powerful  method known to separate small and large organic molecules.  Natural materials have thousands of such  molecules in each cell. In each HPLC run, hundreds of peaks  can be seen. However, these peaks  cannot easily be identified in a simple HPLC apparatus.    Compound identification in a simple HPLC apparatus depends  typically on the availability of a  reference compound from other sources and demonstrating that  the reference compound has the same  mobility and UV spectrum in several solvent systems as does  the HPLC peak in question. Most HPLC  peaks seen in natural mixtures remain unidentified since it  is not easy to find, by intuition and chance,  the appropriate reference compounds.    The Mass Spectrometer (MS) component of the instrument takes  each effluent peak from the HPLC,  fragments it into ions, and determines the mass of each  resulting ion. A tentative structural  identification for each HPLC effluent compound can usually  be determined from the masses and  fragmentation patterns of each HPLC peak. With a tentative  identification in hand, determination of a  positive identification by use of reference compounds or by  computer searching o f MS fragmentation  pattern libraries is much simpler.",
