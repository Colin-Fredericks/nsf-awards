The student has delayed her planned fieldwork, and requests support beginning March 1994.  She has affirmed that her research visa is in process, and has provided additional justification for her request for a video recorder.  Recorded conversations can be used to elicit subtle codes and understandings in later interviews.    She has a small amount of other funding, which does not duplicate this award.    I recommend that this proposal be funded     DAMmmm d, yyyy    PG   9313987  Barth     This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology student from Emory University, studying how people in a rural Indonesian hamlet understand health and illness.  Using ethnographic methods of in-depth interviews and participant-observation, the student will study how people discuss and analyze illness episodes in themselves and others.  She will focus on the metaphors people use, in order to understand their underlying cultural models of vulnerability to illness and misfortune.  This area of Indonesia is well known for black magic, and people are especially conscious of the potential for misfortune.  The student will videotape extensive discussions of a small number of illness cases, in order to analyze the knowledge people bring to bear.    This project is important because this case study, in a region of the world where people have heightened concern about personal misfortune, will give in-depth information which can be compared with people's models of health and illness from other cultures.  At a time when health care is so much in our national attention, such comparative information will give valuable cross-cultural perspectives on our own health syst em.  It is also important because because it will increase our expertise about this fast-growing area of the world.  People everywhere must confront their personal vulnerability to illness, and the sort of comparative case-study information this project will generate will help us understand general human coping processes.     ***  LBRV 2    LBLG STU                                      LBCD 07C90A0E             LBCT 0F292924        LBAU STU                                      LBMD 07C90A12             LBMT 09100504        LBRP      LBPJ                      LBCM                                              LBKY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \"",
