 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buchanan  9316496  This proposal is based on recent evidence that the NADP/thioredoxin  system (consisting of thioredoxin h, NADP-thioredoxin reductase and  NADPH) functions in seed germination.  Thioredoxin specifically  reduces major storage proteins of cereals (gliadins and glutenins  in wheat), thereby enhancing their solubility and susceptibility to  proteinases, and reductively inactivates a disulfide protein that  inhibits alpha-amylase, an enzyme of starch degradation (barley  alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor).  An extension of this research  has shown that the thioredoxin system strengthens the gluten  protein network, thereby enhancing bread quality, and inactivates  trypsin inhibitor proteins, thereby potentially improving the  nutritional quality of soybean.  A patent application covering  these findings has been filed, and precommercial development of  thioredoxin technology has commenced.  The proposed research  addresses fundamental new questions: (1) Does thioredoxin have  additional regulatory functions in the germination of cereals such  as wheat? (2) What changes in redox state and abundance does  thioredoxin undergo during germination? (3) Does the activity of  enzymes necessary for the reduction of thioredoxin change during  germination? (4) Does thioredoxin function in the germination of  other types of seeds such as soybean?.  The research will add to  our understanding of thioredoxin function, enzyme regulation and  seed germination.  %%%  This proposal stems from research in which we have presented  evidence for an enzyme system (the \"thioredoxin system\") that  functions as the earliest known signal triggering the germination  of cereals such as wheat.  The thioredoxin system functions by (1)  activating storage proteins of the grain, thereby enabling their  use as a source of nitrogen and energy by the seedling, and (2)  activating enzymes required for the degradation of starch, thereby  enhancing energy production in the early phase of germination.  An  extension of  this research indicates that the thioredoxin system is  of technological value.  Application of the system to flour  strengthens gluten and enhances bread quality.  The thioredoxin  system also neutralizes plant protein inhibitors of animal  digestive enzymes.  Application of the thioredoxin system to foods  like soybean may enhance their nutritional quality.  A patent  application covering these uses has been filed, and precommercial  development of thioredoxin technology has commenced.  The current  project represents an extension of the fundamental aspects of this  research.  The experiments planned will show whether the  thioredoxin system has additional functions in wheat and whether  the system is important in the germination of other seed types.  ***",
