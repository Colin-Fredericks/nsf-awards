 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several years, Stevens Institute of Technology  has constructed a modern centralized facility for  microstructural characterization. Matching funds are  provided to the Institute to purchase a field-emission  scanning electron microscope. With this instrument,  approximately 50 graduate students 10 faculty at the  Institute can attack research problems that they could not  address previously. A significant fraction of materials  research at the Institute concentrates on ceramics and  polymers. Some current problems are the synthesis of  nanocrystalline silicon carbide whiskers, the tribological  properties of silicon nitrides and the interphase structure  in fiber-reinforced polymer composites and in polymer  blends. These involve 3-D structures where information  gathered by imaging surfaces using scanning electron  microscopy is essential. Because they are poor electrical  conductors, however, ceramics and polymers do not lend  themselves well to high-resolution electron-optical imaging.  Morphological information is limited by artifactual  structure introduced by conductive specimen coatings.  Problems associated with specimen charging can be  significantly ameliorated, however, with a field-emission  electron-optical system. A field-emission source has a  brightness several orders of magnitude greater than  traditional thermionic sources and a smaller incident  electron energy spread. These features enable SEM imaging of  uncoated specimens at low accelerating voltages (-lkeV)  while preserving very good resolution (approx. 4 nm). At  higher voltages (approx. 30 keV) the resolution can be as  high as l nm.",
