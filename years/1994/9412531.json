This kind of legal integration  provides a model for the development of democratic  constitutionalism in regimes such as post-colonial states and newly  unified territories.  A hallmark of such regimes is legal  pluralism, which poses serious problems related to the integration  of laws across legal cultures, the enforcement of cross-cultural  legal codes, and the legitimation of new legal institutions.  This  research will provide the empirical basis for understanding these  processes in the European Community and for formulating explanatory  theoretical models.     The project focuses on litigation because it is through private  claims that the critical doctrines will evolve and be enforced.   There is already evidence that the doctrines of supremacy and  direct effect, enunciated by the European Court of Justice, are  being applied by the national courts in litigation.  It is this  process, often dominated by private actors such as interest groups  rather than by public authorities, that will bring about legal  integration across the members of the European Union.  Enforcement  of rulings, in the event of non-compliance, does rely on public  authorities.  Therefore, the key actors include private litigants,  national judges, and governmental officials.     Data will be collected first from the national court decisions on  EC law in which the doctrines of constitutionalism and direct  effect are at issue, and from scholarly commentaries pertaining to  them.  The PI will then interview judges and other legal actors  involved in important litigation at each of the national courts.   Finally, the PI will gather data on the policy impact of legal  integration and constitutionalism in three crucial areas:   environmental policy, free movement of goods, and gend er equality.   The data collection will include tracing litigation involving  claims against public authorities for violating EC norms in these  three policy areas, and interviewing the participating governmental  officials, judges and interest group litigants.  ***",
