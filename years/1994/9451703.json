This equipment enables students to  gain first-hand experience in the instrumented investigation of the  physical environment of buildings and develop confidence in  physical measurement techniques. It is anticipated that the project  will lead to the participating schools' permanent acquisition of  field equipment, and to a broader acceptance in undergraduate  education of quantitative methods for the assessment of physical  building performance. Teaching materials have been developed to  support the field investigation of physical building performance,  and summer workshops are to be offered for faculty to learn how to  use these materials.",
