 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1994 IEEE/IMS Information Theory Workshop on \"Information  Theory and Statistics\" will present papers in the related fields  of (1) Stochastic complexity and universal data compression, (2)  randomization complexity and information theory, (3) Markov  random fields, (4) Vector quantization, classification, and  regression trees, (5) theory and applications of wavelets, and  (6) nonparametric function estimation. In addition to these  specific topics, there will be two open poster sessions  supporting research in all fields related to the theme of the  workshop.  The workshop will be held in the Old Town Holiday Inn,  Alexandria, Virginia over the dates of October 27 through October  29, 1994.  The IEEE Information Theory Workshops play an  important role in exploring and supporting critical research  trends in the broad areas of communication system utilization and  digital data storage.  This area of research is commonly referred  to as the field of Information Theory and over the last forty  years has played a central role in the development of the  nation's communications infrastructure.  Recently, there has been  a significant rise in common research conducted by Information  Theorists and Statisticians.  It is the aim of the 1994 IEEE/IMS  Information Theory Workshop on \"Information Theory and  Statistics\" to enhance this work and improve the  cross-fertilization of ideas between the respective research  communities.  To support this collaboration, this workshop is  being co-sponsored by the IEEE Information Theory Society and the  Institute of Mathematical Statistics.",
