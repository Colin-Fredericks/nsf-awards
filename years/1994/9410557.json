 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410557  Huang  It is proposed to continue the study of Floqoet theory for  differential delay equations and dynamics of coupled oscillators.  In pratice, a system often depends  not only on its present  states but also on past states.  As a result, we are lead to the  study of differential delay  equations. Linear periodic systems  constitute a very important in the field of differential delay  equations.  Studying Floquet theory of such systems enables one  to understand the behavior and structure of their solutions. We  plan to extend our study of Floquet theory for linear  differential delay equations to broader classes of equations. We  would also like to investigate the conditions under which there  are no small solutions.  Models  of coupled osscillators arise  naturally from problems in physics and biology. Since in pratice,  oscillators can be coupled in many different ways,we  can get a  variety of equations that describe their motion.  To understand  the dynamics of these systems, we try to generalize the known  results for two coupled oscillators to them.  We also would like  to study the stabilities of the discrete rotating waves and  cluster solutions for globally coupled  oscillators.  ***",
