 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405738  Fechheimer     Cell movements such as phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and  cytokinesis require precise control of the assembl of actin  filaments into either randomly gelled networks or highly  polarized bundles.  Formation of these cross-linked actin  structures is mediated by actin cross-linking proteins.  This project focuses on the structure and function of the  Dictyostelium 30,000 dalton actin bundling protein, one of  eight actin cross-linking proteins present in Dictyostelium.  The binding sites for actin and calcium ion, and the  parameters controlling the formation of either actin gels or  bundles will be investigated.  The molecular mechanisms by  which the 30 kD protein is recruited to the phagocytic cup  during ingestion of food, the cleavage furrow during  cytokinesis, and sites of cell to cell contact in developing  cells will be investigated.  The function of the 30 kD  protein in cell structure and movement in Dictyostelium will  be probed using gene disruption by homologous recombination  to create cells lacking the 30 kD actin bundling protein.  This work will promote our understanding of molecular  mechanisms of cell movements essential to the growth and  division of eucaryotic cells.  Significance also derives  from probing the apparent redundancy of function of actin  cross-linkng proteins.  %%%  Cell movements, such as phagocytosis, locomotion,  cytokinesis, morphogenetic transformations accompanying  cellular differentiation are essential to the life of  eucaryotic organisms.  Actin microfilaments contribute to  the control of cell shape and generation of mechanical force  for cell movements.  The properties of actin in cells must  be explained from the structure and chemistry of actin and  the properties of actin binding proteins.  The conservation  of actin binding proteins throughout the eucaryotes provides  strong evidence for the significance of these proteins as  regulators of actin utilization by cells.   Studies of the  structures and functions of these protein s will provide  important insights into the control of cell shape and  motility in eucaryotes.  In addition, understanding of the  molecular basis for actin microfilament assembly and  organized supra-assembly is a critical prerequisite to the  exploitation of cellular structures and biomolecular  machines by materials scientists and nanofabrication  engineers.  ***",
