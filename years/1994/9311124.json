 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311124  Schatzberg  Dr. Schatzberg is illuminating the nature of technical change by  investigating the extent to which ideologies of progress influenced  technical choice.  Ideologies can affect technical choice by  shaping expectations of future changes.  Assessing the influence of  ideologies of progress is only possible through detailed case  studies of technical change.  Dr. Schatzberg is extending his prior  work on the role of ideology in the choice of airplane materials  and is applying it to two new case studies:   one in electric  traction and the other in electric lighting.  In the first study,  he is examining the choice between steam and electricity for  streetcars when they were both reasonable options for providing  public transportation in and between cities.  In the second study,  he is examining the choice between electric and gas lighting when  Thomas Edison first tried to convince cities to substitute electric  for gas lighting.  The case studies test Dr. Schatzberg's  hypothesis on the influence of ideology by examining alternative  explanations, based on structural factors, most importantly the  ability of the supplier firms to innovate.  The case studies are  primarily American, but his analysis is supplemented by comparisons  with European technology.    ***",
