 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452264  Schreiner                            Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy  has been established as the most important technique in the  identification and structural assignment of all organic and  organometallic compounds.  It also lends itself to structure  determination of biochemical macromolecules, and can be used to  study molecular dynamics.  The objective of this project is to  educate chemistry and other science majors in the theory and  operation of this powerful technique by introducing them to NMR at  a gradually increasing level of sophistication throughout the  entire chemistry curriculum.  Student use of the instrument occurs  in course ranging from introductory chemistry to undergraduate  research projects.  Starting with basic l-D 1H NMR, students  advance to multinuclear and 2-D methods.  This effectively ensures  proper training in modern NMR techniques for our students who go on  to industrial positions or excellent graduate schools.  In addition  to the students and faculty of Randolph-Macon College involved in  this project, one nearby Community College (J. Sargeant Reynolds)  and the local Mathematics and Science Center are using this  equipment.",
