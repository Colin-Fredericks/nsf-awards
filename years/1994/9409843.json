 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409843  Peters    In 1992, record numbers of women successfully won seats in the  U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, making these  institutions more descriptively representative of society.   Previous research points to policy differences between female and  male officeholders.  Largely unexplored, however are questions  about the institutional impact and political leadership styles of  women.  The steady rise in number and the increasing tenure of  women in state legislatures now make these questions accessible.    This Doctoral Dissertation research project seeks to explore the  experiences of women committee chairs in the 50 state  legislatures.  The objectives revolve around three questions:   First, do female committee chairs differ in background,  leadership behavior , and outlook from their male counterparts?   Second, how are gender-related leadership styles expressed in  different settings?  Third, as women increase their  representation, do gender styles transform institutions?    The 343 women chairing state legislative committees represent an  important and sizeable leadership cohort to study.  This  investigation will contribute not only to gender insights but  also to knowledge of leadership behavior in legislative  committees and cross-jurisdictional generalizations.    The research consists of three complementary elements:  1) a  survey of male and female committee chairs, 2) focused peer group  interviews with women committee chairs, and, 3) participant  observation in three state legislatures.  The support provided by  the National Science Foundation will allow the student to  undertake the second and third components.  This will greatly  enhance the ability to generalize findings from the survey and to  explore cross-jurisdictional implications.",
