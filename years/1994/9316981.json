 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316981  Aguilera  The goal of this research is to further characterize the  molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in lymphocyte-  specific DNA recombination. We have isolated and partially  characterized a nuclease activity, Endo-S, which we believe  is intimately involved in the isotype switch recombination  process. We will continue to biochemically characterize  Endo-S, sequence the native protein derived from it and  generate a specific antisera to it. We will attempt to clone  the gene encoding Endo-S and express it. We will also  isolate and characterize any factors associated with it.  %%%  It is thought that this endonuclease, Endo-S, is involved in  the DNA rearrangements which account for the large numbers  of different antibodies which can be made by mammals. There  is also suggestive evidence that it may also be involved in  somatic DNA rearrangements which could have less desirable  consequences, such as DNA translocations associated with  oncogenes. A complete characterization of this protein could  lead to a better understanding of its functional role in  several different cellular processes.  ***",
