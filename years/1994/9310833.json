 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310833  Foster  The Harvard Forest is a 1300-hectare field station in central New  England.  In addition to the resident science and technical staff  of approximately 35, over 50 researchers from over a dozen  institutions conduct a major portion of their field studies at  the Harvard Forest.  In the area of education the Harvard Forest  activities include (1) serving as a host to 2-4 visiting faculty  annually through the Bullard Fellowship Program in Forest Biology  at Harvard University (2) sponsoring approximately 24 students  annually as summer research assistants to faculty and science  staff, (3) hosting more than 15 university courses for field  studies, (4) convening numerous state, national, and  international conferences in science and policy, and (5)  educating more than 5000 visitors annually in the Fisher Museum  of Forestry.  Research at the Harvard Forest is integrated around  the central theme of studying and dynamics of forest ecosystem as  affected by natural and human disturbance processes.    In recent years there have been much higher demands for  laboratory facilities, offices, and equipment in the areas of  biogeochemistry, atmosphere-biosphere interactions, and microbial  ecology.  Education-related demands on laboratory facilities have  risen as both graduate student research and undergraduate  research program have expanded.  Beyond the need for expanded and  improved laboratory facilities, there is the critical need to  archive soil and plant tissue samples in a systematic and orderly  fashion.  Currently, samples collected at Harvard Forest are  stored at various places.  None of these locations have adequate  archive facilities.  Valuable samples have been discarded simply  because storage space is unavailable.    The project will support the development of a multi-user nutrient  analysis and new offices in the current J.G. Torrey Laboratory  and to construct a soil/plant tissue archive facility.  Major  acquisitions will include CHNS Analyzer, balances, drying  ovens,  grinder, fume hoods, muffle furnace, pH meter, work benches, and  storage cabinets.  The nutrient analysis facility will create  1048 ft2) will provide storage and electronic cataloging for over  32,000 samples.",
