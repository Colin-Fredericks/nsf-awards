 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413218  Monson    This award will support a training program for undergraduate, graduate and  postdoctoral students with a focus on biosphere/atmosphere interactions across  several spatial scales.  This area of research plays a central role in  understanding the impact of the environment on ecosystems at several different  levels of organization.  Greater understanding of the mechanisms of trace gas  emission and of their influence on the environment will be emphasized.  The  group of faculty is drawn primarily from the University of Colorado, but  includes several staff from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) facilities in  Boulder.  The training program includes courses and fieldwork, workshops and  internships at the NOAA and NCAR labs.  The training will expose students to  both theory and measurement, the latter using some unique equipment.  Besides  student support, the award will enable purchase or construction of unique  research equipment and will cover some costs of student research, travel and  publication.    This award is also being supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the  Division of Atmospheric Sciences.  ***",
