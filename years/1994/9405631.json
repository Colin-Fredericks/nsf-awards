 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405631  Rojstaczer    This study proposes to extend work on the causes and timing of  temporal changes in permeability induced  by seismicity.  The  research is designed to obtain a more definitive understanding of  the coupling that exists between fault motion and hydrology.  Such  information provides constraints on the time dependence  of the  hydrology of the shallow crust.  The research also has application  to the storage of high level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain  and to understanding the timing and location of major ore and  hydrocarbon deposits.  Finally, it may also provide prehistoric  information on the rupture cycle of the San Andreas Fault.    The project will examine: whether ground motion induced shear  stress is capable of generating increases in permeability near the  San Andreas fault; and whether  the influence of seismicity on  groundwater flow over geologic time can be seen in the rock record.   The field aspects of the research will focus on the San Lorenzo  drainage basin.  This basin accounted for 35% of the excess  streamflow produced by the Loma Prieta  earthquake (10/17/89, M  7.0) and has already been studied extensively by the PI.  Hydraulic  fracture tests will be performed in granodiorite on the edge of the  San Lorenzo drainage basin. The results from these tests will be  used in conjunction with models of ground-motion induced shear  stress to examine the constraints on ground motion induced  permeability enhancement. These constraints will be used to test  whether permeability enhancement can explain the spatial patterns  of earthquake-induced hydrologic change in the region.  Core will  be obtained from the granodiorite to a depth of 300 m for  petrologic analysis of the calcite cement which partially fills     fractures.   The influence of pre-historic faulting on subsurface  hydrology will be examined by analyzing the isotopic signature of  calcite fracture fills in the existing and newly obtained core.    The research will be done in cooperation wit h Stephen Hickman of  the U.S. Geological Survey who will provide all of the equipment  and manpower associated with the hydraulic fracturing tests.  Funds  for Stephen Hickman's portion  of the project will be provided by  the US. Geological Survey.",
