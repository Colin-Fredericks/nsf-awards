SMT is the prevailing technology  used by major electronic circuit board manufacturers, whether their  board production is captive, that is for use in their own products,  or they are a contract circuit board manufacturer for others who  will assemble the board into a product.  SMT must use a concurrent  engineering approach to the design, manufacturing, and testing of  a device. This lab will demonstrate these principles by not only  allowing the students to manufacture circuit boards using both SMT  and through-hole principles and devices, but also by allowing the  students to observe, through the requested instrumentation, the  results of errors in the process.  The course and lab is also  intended to educate the target audience of electrical engineering  technology students as to actual uses for the courses in heat  transfer, strain, and chemistry they have taken but wondered what  to do with. Principles from these areas will be applied during this  course to both predict and demonstrate issues such as heat  transfer, cracking of solder joints and the results of using an  incorrect solder paste mixture.  This project is intended to be  used as a demonstration to the engineering education community the  value of teaching SMT at the undergraduate level. To that end the  results will be disseminated to that community, as will updates as  progress continues past the term of the grant.",
