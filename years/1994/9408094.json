 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fisher  9408094  In the gram-positive sporulating soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the synthesis of some permeases and nitrogen degradative enzymes is derepressed during nitrogen-limited growth.  These changes in gene expression promote logarithmic growth on compounds which are slowly degraded to nitrogen-containing metabolic intermediates.  In this project, the regulation of the dicistronic nrgAB operon in response to nitrogen availability is being studied.  Expression of the nrgAB operon is derepressed over 4,000-fold during nitrogen-limited growth.  Nitrogen regulation of nrgAB ( and of all other known nitrogen-regulated genes in B. subtilis) expression requires the wild-type glutamine synthetase protein, butnot the glutamine synthetase repressor protein, GlnR.  Thus, nitrogen regulation in B. subtilis is mediated by a unique global regulatory system which is distinct from the Ntr regulatory system present in Escherichia coli.  The cis-acting site(s), nrgO, required for nitrogen-regulation of nrgAB expression will be identified by deletion and mutational analysis.  Two trans-acting gene products are known to be required for nitrogen regualation of nrgAB expression.  Mutants deficient in glutamine synthetase (glnA) express derepressed levels of nrgAB during growth in the presence of excess nitrogen.  The role of the glutamine synthetase protein in nitrogen regulation will be studied by isolating mutations which suppress the nrgAB derepression in glnA mutants.  This experiment should identify gene products which transduce the glutamine synthetase-dependent nitrogen signal to the nrgAB regulatory proteins.  Secondly, tnr mutants are unable to derepress nrgAB expression during growth on any nitrogen source.  Thus, the tnr gene product(s) may mediate nitrogen regulation of nrgAB expression.  DNA complementing the trn mutations will be cloned and sequenced to identify the trn gene products.  The ability of the Tnr gene products to bind at the nrgO site will be examined in gel mobility shift assays .  %%%  An understanding of the role of the glutamine synthetase protein in nitrogen regulation in B. subtilis should identify novel mechanisms of gene regulation and provide insight into the regulation of cellular metabolism in gram-positive bacteria.  In addition, these studies should provide genetic tools for the production of useful products in Bacillus spp. during fermentation or growth in the soil, where nitrogen-containing nutrients are relatively scarce.  ***",
