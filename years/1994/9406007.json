 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406007  Estrin       The  proposal begins with a brief review of the evolution of  multicast routing and identification of the scaling issues raised  by the introduction of multicast services in a global-scale  internet.  We then present criteria for evaluating different  solutions to the scaling issues. Given these evaluation criteria we  outline our proposed solution, called PIM.  PIM could significantly  improve the scaling properties of multicast routing and is capable  of providing better service quality than alternative scalable   multicast schemes such as Core Based Trees.       We present preliminary simulation results comparing the  performance of different distribution trees.  However, fully  characterizing the performance of multicast routing schemes in very  large, heterogeneous, internetworks is not trivial; and ``learning  through experience'' in operational networks that are of the size  of our target environment (i.e., the global internet), is not  feasible .  Characterizing multicast protocols is not only  challenging because of the scale of the target internet, but also  because of the complexity and flexibility built into the protocols  themselves.  Moreover, a single multicast protocol such as PIM, may  be used (or configured) in a variety of ways that directly impact  performance. Therefore, to characterize our proposed multicast  approach, and to evaluate it relative to alternatives, we propose  extensive simulation studies.        The proposed research is composed of three parts: 1) an  extensive simulation study to characterize the scaling properties  and tradeoffs presented by the proposed mechanisms, 2) an  investigation of alternative aggregation mechanisms to further  extend scalability (using our constructed simulation tools for  their evaluation), and, 3) a  prototype implementation of the  proposed scheme for testing in laboratory and testbed networks.   ***",
