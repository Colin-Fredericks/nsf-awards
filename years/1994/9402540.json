 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402540  Shahriari  The research aims to develop and test a fiber optic sensor for pH  and dissolved oxygen monitoring simultaneously in sea water.  This sensor will utilize a porous glass optical fiber immobilized  with pH and oxygen sensitive photochemical compounds via a sol-  gel coating technique.  The microporous nature of the non-  densified sol-gel coatings, in which photochemical dyes are  immobilized, provides a unique local environment that is  environmentally stable and immune to photochemical bleaching and  chemical leaching due to decomposition or degradation of the  immobilized photochemical compounds.  The research for the  proposed fiber optic sensor consists of three parts: (i)  development of an optical coating material which is  photochemically sensitive to both pH and dissolved oxygen, and  characterization of its optical and photochemical properties;  (ii) preparation of a fiber optic pH/dissolved oxygen sensor  based upon this coating, and determination of its photochemical  stability and optical quality; (iii) evaluation of the sensor in  simulated sea water environments in an effort to optimize the  sensor parameters under a range of chemical and physical  conditions.  Such a development offers potential applications for  marine environmental monitoring.    In this proposed reseach the combined resources of Rutgers' Fiber  Optic Materials Research Program (FOMRP) and those of its  Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences will be devoted to  development and implementation of optical fiber pH/DO sensor for  monitoring of sea water.",
