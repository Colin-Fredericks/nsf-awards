 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matching funds are provided for the acquisition and the  construction of a unique facility for the study of  superconducting films and structures in magnetic fields at  ultralow temperatures. The instrument consists of a high  cooling power dilution refrigerator, capable of achieving  temperatures below 5 millikelvin, a 7-tesla horizontal/8.5-  tesla vertical vector magnet system, and associated pumps,  power supplies, and gas handling system needed for the  operation of the refrigerator and magnet system. Since many  of the investigations involve the study of films prepared by  deposition onto substrates held at low temperatures, the  equipment will be built into an existing ultrahigh vacuum  growth chamber. This will be done in a manner which permits  insitu deposition of films onto cold substrates, but which  also retains the option of free-standing operation of the  refrigerator and magnet. Funds also are provided for the  purchases of a nuclear orientation thermometer which will  serve as a primary temperature standard, and a dc SQUID  system which will be configured in a voltage-measuring mode  to gauge transport properties at very low current  excitations. The equipment would be used to extend the  measurement of properties of superconducting films and  structures in high magnetic fields (7 to 14 tesla) to  ultralow temperatures (below 0.005 kelvin). The facility  would be used to investigate the quantum properties of  selected electronic systems in the limits of ultralow  temperatures and two dimensions. For such systems, under  appropriate conditions, quantum fluctuations are more  important than thermal fluctuations, and many systems  exhibit quantal rather than thermal phase transitions. The  particular interests are in insulator-to-superconductor  transitions in both ultrathin films and junction arrays, the  macroscopic quantum tunneling of vortices in  superconductors, and the critical fields of reduced  transition temperature superconductors. These studies have  important implicati ons and applications in developing and  characterizing new technologically significant materials.",
