 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321504  Oliver  Ice scouring is the most disruptive and widespread physical  disturbance to marine bottom communities in polar waters.  At  high latitudes, ice pressure ridges scour the sea floor to depths  of 60m, and larger ice bergs ground as deep as 400m.  This  project will explore the ecological implications of this  disturbance to arctic benthic populations and communities.  It is  a multi-disciplinary and joint Canadian-U.S. Program involving  two major components.  The first is to characterize and model the  physical disturbance regime over a three-year period by  repetitive mapping the study areas with high resolution side-scan  sonar, and to quantify the scour recovery process by divers.   This approach will enable us to identify newly formed scours each  season, and to generate quantitative and ecologically relevant  data on disturbance coverage, frequency, intensity, and physical  recovery.  The second component is to investigate benthic  population and community responses to ice scour, documenting the  successional stages of biotic recovery.  They will test whether  observed widespread patterns of zonation and larger spatial and  temporal community mosaics are correlated to this key  disturbance.  This combined physical and biotic approach will  enable them to develop a conceptual model of scour aging and  recovery, and to evaluate the impact of this disturbance on  benthic production and diversity.  ***",
