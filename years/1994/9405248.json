 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405248  Holten      The reaction center (RC) of photosynthetic organisms is the  membrane bound pigment-protein complex within which light energy  is converted into chemical energy via a series of fast and highly  specific electron transfer reactions. The overall process  separates charge across the RC (and hence across the membrane)  with an essentially unity quantum yield. The ultimate goal of  this research is to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of  this process at a molecular level. To this end, transient  absorption spectroscopic measurements spanning the femtosecond to  millisecond timescales as well as other spectroscopic techniques  will be used to directly identify and study the intermediate  states of charge separation and the rates of their formation and  decay. These studies will be carried out on both wild-type RCs  and a wide variety of mutant RCs in which one or more amino acids  are changed using the techniques of molecular biology.  %%%      This research has broad implications that transcend  photosynthesis reasch. The investigations will impact on the  general understanding of electron transfer. The RC is in many  respects a mini-laboratory for the investigation of this  fundamental process in view of knowledge of the structure of the  RC and the ability to manipulate and investigate the charge  separation events in detail. The studies will also address the  role of the protein in the energy conversion process, and thus  will impact on the important area of how the interactions between  amino acids and the imbedded cofactors influence biological  events. This work additionally forms the foundation for  understanding and developing efficient mechanisms for the capture  and storage of solar energy.  Hence, this research is important  not only for understanding a natural process essential for life  on earth, but also for gaining further knowledge in areas of  broad importance in biologyand chemistry.  ***",
