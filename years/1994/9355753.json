It is a four year program to  prepare 40-middle school teachers in 3 and 4 member teams to  implement \"integrated environmental science and technology  education into their science curriculum.  Each team participates in  a two-year program; teams include a science teacher, a computer  science or mathematics teacher and a technology education teacher  from the same school; teams come from DC, MD, PA, VA and WV.  Two  sets of teacher teams will participate.    During the program, each teacher team will:  (1) increase their  knowledge of environmental science, mathematics, computer  technologies and technology education, as well as pedagogical  content; (2) adapt and develop units of study that link science  content with appropriate teaching and assessment strategies; and  (34) disseminate to other teachers the process for developing an  integrated curriculum and team approach to teaching.  At GMU  teachers will work in small groups to solve problems related to  scientist/engineer partners and school administrators.  The  comprehensive project evaluation is designed to determine (1) how  successful (in terms of student outcomes) are the teachers and  units they adapted/developed, (2) how well the team concept  transfers, and (3) how successful (in terms of student outcomes)  are the teachers trained through the dissemination workshops with  units developed by others.",
