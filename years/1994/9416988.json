Donnelly   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9416988  United Health Services Hospitals is a not-for-profit  organization, located in Upstate New York and composed of two,  community, teaching hospitals, an urgicenter, and five primary  care clinics.  UHSH fosters a strong primary care physician base  referring to medical and surgical specialties in an atmosphere of  commitment to education and research.    Through Internet, many clinicians, educators, researchers and  administrative personnel at UHSH will have global electronic  mail, immediate access to electronic publications, active  membership in discussion lists, on-line search from extensive  databases, instant transfer of files and software from remote  sources, and entry to network and remote computer services.   There is already an optical fiber connection between the two  hospitals.  There are plans for the parent company to implement a  similar connection for the Ideal Senior Living Center by the end  of 1994.      This will enable Internet access for three institutions.  This  proposal presents the significance of the connection to clinical  care, education and research at UHSH and shows the methodology  and hardware for making the connection effective.",
