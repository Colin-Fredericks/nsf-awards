The purpose of the  conference is to review recent findings and determine  priorities for shorebird research and management in  the Western Hemisphere.  Coordinators for the  conference, which will be held in Ottawa, Canada,  October 1994, are Dr. Gonzalo Castro and Dr. Julie  Sibbing, of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve  Network.  Other coordinators include representatives  from Canada, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.  The  conference will include presentations of papers by  researchers and managers, and working group sessions  for developing conclusions and recommendations.     Most species of shorebirds depend upon wetlands as  sources of food throughout their annual cycle of   extensive, interhemispheric migrations.  Wetlands in  the Americas continue to be drained, or otherwise  rendered unsuitable for use by the birds at a rapid  pace, resulting in a precarious relationship between  them and their habitats.  This serious loss of  shorebirds habitats across the hemisphere has  generated conservation research efforts aimed at the  protection of the species.  However, successful  conservation programs demand information-sharing and  cooperation among the nations that host the species  during their travels.   This conference presents an  opportunity for interaction among researchers of the  Western Hemisphere and provides a forum for  discussions of the latest findings in shorebird  migration, ecology and conservation.   ***",
