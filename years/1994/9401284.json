 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401284  Ivanov       The principal investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, intends to  continue his work on the mapping class groups of surfaces, braid  groups of surfaces, complexes of curves of surfaces, and  Teichmueller spaces.  The investigator intends to concentrate on  the interrelationships between these notions in order to shed new  light on the algebraic structure of the mapping class groups of  surfaces on the one hand, and the global geometry of the  Teichmueller spaces on the other hand.  An important guiding  principle here is a still fairly mysterious analogy between the  mapping class groups and Teichmueller spaces on the one side and  arithmetic groups and symmetric spaces on the other side,  established in earlier works of the principal investigator and  other mathematicians.  In particular, the principal investigator  intends to prove that braid groups of surfaces have only the  obvious automorphisms, and that there are no nontrivial  homomorphisms from the arithmetic groups of rank at least two  into mapping class groups.  The principal investigator intends to  continue his study of the rigidity properties of the mapping  class groups and Teichmueller spaces.  He also intends to give a  general explanation of various phenomena in the topology of  surfaces exhibiting stabilization over the genus, including  presentations of the mapping class groups by generators and  relations and the quantum field theory representations.  Finally,  the investigator will continue his investigation of rigidity and  stability phenomena in the universal Teichmueller spaces.       Mapping class groups and Teichmueller spaces serve as a  meeting ground for several of the main branches of mathematics,  including topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry.   Recently they have also proved to be important in some questions  of theoretical physics.  These objects in a subtle way both  resemble and differ from the much more well understood arithmetic  groups and symmetric spaces.  Various approaches to m ade this  analogy (and difference!) precise and explicit form the core of  the project.   While symmetric spaces form a well established  pool of possible spatial images investigated in mathematics (and  arithmetic groups to a big extent control their structure),  Teichmueller spaces gradually emerge as a new, richer and equally  important pattern (and mapping class groups are similarly  expected to control their structure).  The principal investigator  intends to concentate on two of the most interesting and striking  properties of these objects: rigidity and stability.  Because of  rigidity, the structure of these objects is expected to be  completely determined by their shape only.  Stability tells us  that when these objects become more and more complicated with a  natural parameter (genus) growing, their main characteristics  cease to change at a certain point.  The stability phenomena is  expected to be relevant not only to the mathematical but also to  the quantum physics applications of the mapping class groups and  Teichmueller spaces.  ***",
