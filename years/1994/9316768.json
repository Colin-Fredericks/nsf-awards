This research program focuses on  understanding the unusal electronic and geometric structures of  active sites in magnetically coupled binuclear non-heme iron and  manganese cluster enzymes.  Hemerythrin, methane monooxygenase and  ribonucleotide reductase have  FE(II)Fe(II)  sites which bind,  activate and reduce O2, respectively, while purple acid phosphatase  is active in catalysis in its mixed valent  Fe(II)Fe(III)  state.   The active sites in these proteins can generally be obtained in the   Fe(III)Fe(III) ,  Fe(III)Fe(II)  and  Fe(II)Fe(II)  states and  model complexes exist for all of these oxidation states.  Oxy-  intermediates or analogues are now available for a number of these  proteins and for non-heme iron model complexes at the peroxy and  oxo-ferryl levels.  The manganese-oxo cluster enzymes of interest  include manganese catalase, manganese ribonucleotide reductase,  manganese substituted iron ribonucleotide reductase and the water  oxidation catalyst in Photosystem II.  Again, model complexes are  available for all the biologically relevant oxidation states from   Mn(II)Mn(II)  to  Mn(IV)Mn(IV) .  A spectroscopic approach is  presented which emphasizes the application of absorption, circular  dichroism,magnetic circular dichroism and resonance Raman methods  to study the excited states in these enzymes and model complexes  and variable temperature variable field magnetic circular dichroism  to probe the ground state sublevel splittings which relate to the  bridging ligation responsible for the coupling.  The results from  these spectroscopies are combined with ligand field  and self  consistent field-X-scattered wave calculations to determine the  electronic structures of these active sites.  These studies are  directed toward defining active site geometric and electron  structure differences which relate t o differences in function in  the non-heme iron enzymes, determining active site similarities and  differences between the binuclear non-heme iron and manganese  enzymes, and understanding the electronic structures of the  metal-oxy intermediatesand metal-oxo bonds as related to dioxygen  activation and O-O bond formation.  %%%  Many proteins and enzymes contain metal ion active sites which play  a key role in biological function.  Often these exhibit ususual  spectral features which reflect novel electronic structures that  can make significant contributions to calalysis.  This research  program focuses on understanding the unusual electronic and  geometric structures of active sites in magnetically coupled  binuclear non-heme iron and manganese cluster enzymes.  These  clusters are found in hemerythrin (reversible oxygen binding),  ribonucleotide reductase (conversion of ribonucleotides to  deoxyribonucleotides in DNA synthesis), methane monooxygenase  (catalytic conversion of methane to methanol), catalase  (detoxification of peroxide), and the water oxidation catalyst in  photosystem II (generation of oxygen by green plants).  These  studies are directed toward defining active site geometric and  electronic structure differences which relate to differences in  function in the non-heme iron enzymes, determining active site  similarities and differences between the corresponding binuclear  non-heme iron and manganese enzymes, and understanding the  electronic structures of the metal-oxygen intermediates involved in  dioxygen activation and O-O bond formation.  This research will  provide fundamental insight into geometric and electronic  structural contributions to function in biology and lay the  groundwork for the design and development of new catalytic systems.  ***",
