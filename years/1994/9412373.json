 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eisberg is examining the life of the astronomer, Beatrice  Tinsley (1941-1981).  Despite her short career, Tinsley is  significant to both the intellectual and the social history of  science.  Tinsley's career exemplifies many of the most striking  difficulties encountered by female scientists.  Nevertheless, she  played a central role in originating the modern study of the  evolution of stellar populations and galaxies, now among the most  active fields of astronomy, and a field with crucial links to  cosmology.    Dr. Eisberg's study promises to place Tinsley's scientific work in  context of the history of stellar and galactic astrophysics and  cosmology as well as the history of women in science.  She has  access to Tinsley's large collection of scientific papers and  family correspondence.  She is also able to conduct interviews with  many of Tinsley's surviving colleagues.  This study will allow Dr.  Eisberg to explore gender differences in the practice of science as  well as the social and intellectual history of astronomy.  Thus, it  promises to have significance not just for STS scholars, but also  astronomers and those interested in the advance of women in  science.",
