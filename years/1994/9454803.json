 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454803  Dodl    This proposal for a one-year planning grant (8-16-94 to 8-15-95) describes development of a  partnership alliance among the Montgomery County School system, commercial educational  service providers, and the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV), an established partnership  among Virginia Tech, the Town of Blacksburg, and Bell Atlantic-Virginia.  The primary goal  of the planning period is to lay the groundwork for developing and documenting a virtual school,  an unbounded educational environment with no walls, no halls, no bells, where (virtual)  collaborative classrooms encompass the entire community and exploit connections among diverse  educational resources - schools, libraries, homes, businesses, local and global networks.  This  virtual school, to be implemented and evaluated over a three-year development period following  the planning grant, is enabled by the Blacksburg Electronic Village which, by providing high--  speed full connectivity throughout the entire town of Blacksburg, offers a unique opportunity for  us to create a virtual school.    In the one-year planning period, we will undertake a series of planning meetings, workshops, and  preliminary evaluations of basic equipment, network links, and network services for an emergent virtual  school comprised of teachers and classes in one elementary school, one middle school, and one high  school in Montgomery County, Virginia.  This is a rural area with broad geographic and demographic  diversity.    Also in the one-year planning period, we will plan for study of the sociological, educative,  methodological, economic, and political processes by which a replicable, sustainable virtual school model  for educational (and community) networking can be constructed and maintained in a rural setting.  We  will also begin documentation of our development efforts, and will formulate and initiate studies to  evaluate ensuing changes that occur, as well as begin documenting the processes by which these changes  occur.    The prim ary output of this planning period will be a proposal to be submitted to NSF for a three-year  development effort to create and evaluate a virtual school.",
