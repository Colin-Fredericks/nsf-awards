 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319118  Stoltman    Under the direction of Dr. James Stoltman, Mr. Jeffrey Shokler will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will focus on lithic  materials - stone tools - excavated from a large number of sites in  the Estremadura region of Portugal and use both macroscopic  examination and chemical sourcing to determine the source of raw  material origin. To accomplish this he will continue his ongoing  surveys of flint source areas which are abundant in the region.  Preliminary work suggests that, although in the same general  region, different sources are distinct enough to allow attribution  of tools recovered in archaeological sites material to source of  geological origin. With such data Mr. Shokler should then be able  to address a number of anthropologically significant questions  which concern how prehistoric hunters and gatherers moved over the  landscape and how they related to each other. He will examine how  observed patterns changed over the course of the last ca. 40,000  years and how a developing lithic production technology affected  raw material selection.    About 40,000 years ago cultural traits such as art and religion  first appeared in Europe. Over this part of the last Ice Age  archaeologists can trace their intensification and further  development. What is harder to discern however is the underlying  social context in which these traits developed and Mr. Shokler's  research is directed towards this goal. Based on evidence in  Southern France and Northern Spain, it has been postulated that  population increased over time and that groups adapted a yearly  cycle which involved dispersal into smaller units and then  aggregation into larger multiband groups. Aggregation requires  social mechanisms which allow peaceful and organized interaction  and this need served as incentive for change. Lithics provide a  window which will allow Mr. Shokler to examine such questions.     This research is important for several reasons. In recent years  much archaeological data  has been collected in Portugal with NSF  support. Relatively little analysis has been done and the results  of Mr. Shokler's research will be of interest to many  archaeologists. The work examines the mechanisms by which modern  cultural traits develop and will support the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
