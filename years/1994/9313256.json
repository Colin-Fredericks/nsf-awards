Singh, of the Indian  Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and their  graduate students, to continue and complete a  collaborative research on the observations and  modeling of atmospheric turbulence and  diffusion at low wind speeds.  The main  objective of the study is to determine the  variation of turbulence and diffusion processes  in the surface layer during daytime convective  conditions and nighttime stable conditions.   Another part involves test and development of a  reliable model to predict diffusion in low wind  speeds.    Scope:  This project deals with modeling of  weather conditions in a tropical area, which  applies to many of the countries in South Asia  and South East Asia.  The two scientists have  set up elaborate facilities in India for  measuring atmospheric conditions at all times,  and are developing and adapting computer models  that can be tested and modified to best  describe the prevailing conditions in the  region.  The completion of the work is  important to reach reliable models of  dispersion at low wind speeds.  Such models  have many applications such as in predicting  dispersion of industrial or chemical pollutants  in warm climates.  The interaction between the U.S. and Indian  sides is clearly beneficial to the research of  the two scientists and in developing new human  resources in the two countries.  ***",
