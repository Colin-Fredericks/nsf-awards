A universal behavior  of this kinetics has been predicted by a recent theory due to  Kardar, Parisi and Zhang.  It is proposed to capitalize on the  recent advances in surface x-ray diffraction using synchrotron  radiation which now permit the exploration of surfaces and  interfaces in the time domain.  The primary aim is to seek out  model systems which provide a test of the universal behavior and to  understand the underlying physics.  The kinetics of a simple  monolayer on a metal substrate will be studied using the Pb/Cu(100)  system.  The Pd2Si/Si (lll) system will be used to study the  complex interface formed by the reaction between metals and silicon  in the formation of thin films of crystalline silicides.    Non-technical abstract:  This proposal supports an experimental  program that will be based at the National Synchrotron Light Source  in Brookhaven, N.Y.  The beamline to be used was designed for  state-of-the-art diffraction experiments on surfaces.  The proposed  experiments are aimed at understanding the details of how a surface  grows on an atomic scale and on a time scale of 0.00l seconds.  In  addition, the work will have direct application to understanding  the formation of thin films of crystalline silicides.  Such  materials are increasingly important for semiconductor  interconnects, especially for electronic devices with ultrasmall  dimensions.  ***",
