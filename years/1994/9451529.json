The new course will provide a laboratory environment centered  around a modular integrated manufacturing cell, permitting students  to perform experiments and develop scientific and technical skills  in the fields of applied metallurgy, precision measurement,  statistical process control, robotics, metalworking, computer  numerical control, and programmable logic controller theory in any  integrated format which simulates the interactive, process-based  technology of modern manufacturing.  While the college presently  teaches the individual skills described above, there is no  opportunity for students to perform experiments and projects which  apply these techniques in the collaborative, integrative structure  which is typical of a modern production environment.    The equipment required to develop the proposed course includes a  lab-scale Computer Integrated Manufacturing cell, together with a  personal computer for process input and statistical process control  data analysis, and two computer output devices.",
