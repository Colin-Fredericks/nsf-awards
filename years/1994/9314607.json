 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314607  Zannis    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in  genetics between Vassilis Zannis of Boston University and Jean  Chambaz of the Department of Cellular Biology, Hotel Dieu.  The  Hotel Dieu is a major hospital located in Paris.  The objectives of  their research are to isolate and characterize the tissue specific  transcriptional regulators of the ApoA-II (apolipoprotein) gene  from mice.  The regulation of apolipoproteins is important since  they determine the cellular recognition and catabolism of  lipoproteins by cell receptors.  They also play a role in the  maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis and in the  pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.    The U.S. investigator, who is a biochemist, brings to this  collaboration expertise in lipoprotein research, including  structure and function of the apolipoprotein and gene regulation.   This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in cell  biology and gene expression.  The project also takes advantage of  a transgenic mouse facility at the Hotel Dieu where most of the  testing will take place.   ***",
