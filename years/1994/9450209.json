Two  of  the  conferences,   \"The  Economics  of  Child  Poverty,\"  (conducted  jointly   with   the  Children's  Defense  League)  and \"Economic,  Health  and  Family  Status  Indicators\"  will  be  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation.   The conferences will bring together social  science  researchers, community and government agencies, members of funded  USI cities and other interested parties.  They will probe beneath  factual  associations  to understand the  primary  and  secondary  causal  mechanisms for children's learning and  living  problems.  Their objectives include:  *  reviewing existing knowledge.  *  focusing public attention on conditions affecting the teaching  and learning of mathematics and science.  *   suggesting  educational programs that will lead  to  systemic  reform.  *  promulgating conference results.  *  identifying topics for further research.",
