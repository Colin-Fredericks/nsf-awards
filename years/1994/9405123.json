This proposal  requests funding to support undergraduate research concerning the  sedimentology of the fluvial to mid-estuarine transitions of  Pennsylvanian incised valley-fill deposits from the Douglas Group  (Missourian-Virgilian) of eastern Kansas.  The research project  involves the acquisition of drill cores to study the  sedimentological details of these paleoestuarine facies  transitions.  Given the fine-grained, silty-through-muddy  lithologies which characterize these facies, they form few good  surface exposures.  However, the existing outcrops have been  analyzed in great detail in terms of their sedimentology,  stratigraphy, and paleontology, which will allow for a similarly  detailed projection of this information into the subsurface.   Although regional in its focus, these studies have broad  implications with regard to the sedimentology and sequence  stratigraphy of incised valley-fill successions.  The research is  ideally suited for undergraduates insofar as it well-defined in its  goals, scientifically significant in its application, and confined  in its scope.",
