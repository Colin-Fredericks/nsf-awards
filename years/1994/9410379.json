This  live teleconference is two-fold.  First, the program  provides U.S. middle and high school students (and their  teachers) with an interesting insight into the work of  engineers in a novel teleconference setting. Secondly, the  Discover Engineering telecast is the centerpiece of open  houses at many industrial, government and college locations.  The telecast series is central to many local activities  wherein engineers welcome students and teachers to the  workplace, providing tours and wrap around discussions which  are stimulated by the telecast.    Since this proposal is for conducting a teleconference, it  is exempt from peer review in accordance with NSF Manual No.  10, Section 122.1-3.  Award of a grant is recommended.            William Butcher                                   February  3, 1994",
