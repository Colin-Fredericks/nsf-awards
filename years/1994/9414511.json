The research project  focuses on the dependance of interface  structure on processing conditions and the  effect on mechanical properties in  directionally solidified in-situ composite  materials.      The project takes advantage of the process  expertise of the Japanese group led by Dr.  Yamaguchi and the specialized equipment present  in his lab.  The economic implications of the  development of these high-temperature materials  is significant, especially for the aerospace  industry.  The research should lead to the  development of several candidate materials  systems, whose applications should increase  steadily over time as the materials are  improved and costs are reduced.  In addition to  carrying out research at Kyoto University,  Professor Luzzi will visit Japanese companies  which are active in high-temperature materials  research.   ***",
