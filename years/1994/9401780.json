Under this condition one is able to define the notion of  a flat and of a little Weyl group.  There exist three different  constructions of the Weyl group.  The first is by looking at the  boundary of the space.  For spherical varieties, there is a  canonical construction of a compactification and one part of the  project is to prove that it has no singularities.  The second  construction is accomplished by looking at the action of a  certain subgroup of the symmetric group.  The principal  investigator will find a way to reconstruct all other data needed  to describe all compactifications of the space.  Finally, there  is a construction accomplished by looking at the moment map on  the cotangent bundle of the space.  A major problem of the  project is to obtain a better understanding of the moment map.            Many different algebraic objects can be represented as  algebraic sets of transformations of other algebraic objects.   Through these representations their structure can be determined.   This project is concerned with the representation theory of  infinite dimensional Lie algebras.  The study of these algebras  has applications throughout mathematics and mathematical physics.  ***",
