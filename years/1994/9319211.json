The projects is a continuation of the principal investigator's previous work along the line of real-time holographic recording technique using optical heterodyne scanning.  Briefly, in the technique, two optical beams of different temporal frequencies are use to scan an object to extract the holographic information for the object.    In the present proposed research we investigate and compare the coherent, partial coherent and incoherent nature of the scanning holographic information reduction techniques, 3-D coding and multiple-exposure holography are explored and extended to multiple holographic information of the object simultaneously.  Advantages of multiple-beam scanning includes real-time operation and large multiplexing capability. The integration of an electron-beam-addressed spatial light modulator for coherent reconstruction with the scanning holographic recording system also is investigated in the context of real time holography in video rate.  The results of the proposed work could lead to better 3-D information processing and coding such as in the areas of real-time 3-D  image processing, microscopy, data storage and acquisition and optical remote sensing.",
