The equations are an  outgrowth of the classical wave equation which lies at the heart  of the theory of hyperbolic equations.  Refined estimates in the  linear case will be derived, to analyze the properties of  solutions to the physically more realistic nonlinear problems.  Among the questions to be considered are:  estimates of time  decay for appropriate measures of the size of a solution  and analysis of nonconstant coefficient problems corresponding  to nonuniform media in which wave propagation takes place.   Such estimates will also be considered for solutions to wave  equations on domains with boundary, such as in the exterior of an  obstacle, to find the best possible time decay subject to the  weakest restrictions on the data.  Finally, smoothness properties  of solutions to nonlinear wave equations as determined by  the corresponding properties of the data will be treated.   The general propagation of smoothness in a wave satisfying  a nonlinear equation will be reconsidered in a setting of  less initial smoothness.  Examples will be considered where  the formation of nonlinear singularities develop in cases in  which nonsmooth surfaces appear, both for interior domains and in  the presence of a boundary.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
