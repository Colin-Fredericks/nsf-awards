 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314894  Platz  The generation of carbenes by photochemical methods and   reactions of these transient intermediates will be studied.   Experiments will be carried out to provide fundamental   information about the geometry, singlet/triplet energy   levels, heats of formation, and rates of intra-and   intermolecular reactions of carbenes. An emphasis will   placed on understanding the rearrangement of alkyl carbenes,   where low activation enthalpies and large negative entropies   of activation have been observed. In particular, the   possibility of tunneling as an explanation for the unusual   activation parameters will be pursued. The chemistry of   excited state diazirines will be studied in detail, since   these precursors to carbenes may mimic some of the chemistry   of carbenes. Several points along the reaction surface will   be characterized for the reaction of excited state   diazirines.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Matthew S. Platz at Ohio State   University. Carbenes are high energy compounds which contain   only two bonds to other elements from carbon, while stable   compounds of carbon contain four bonds to other elements. In   a large number of reactions, carbene intermediates are   generated. The lifetimes of these fleeting intermediates   will be determined as a function of structure of the   carbene, solvent polarity, and temperature. These studies   will lead to a basic understanding of these important   intermediates and to their use in synthesis.  ***",
