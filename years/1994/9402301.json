 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402301   Ellis  A group of six science and technology centers across the country  proposes to form a pilot collaborative effort to establish  connections to NSFNET.  These institutions share the vision that  access to the resources provided via NSFNET will significantly  enhance their ability to achieve their common missions and goals in  providing informal science education for students, teachers, and  the general public.  Further, it is expected that this group of  institutions will serve as a model for other museums and represents  the vanguard in what will become a general movement for science and  technology centers to become full participants in this national  communication network.    The partner institutions of this collaboration are: The Franklin  Institute (PA), Liberty Science Center (NJ), Museum of Science  (MA), Center of Science and Industry (OH), Oregon Museum of Science  and Industry (OR), St. Louis Science Center (MO), The Science Place  (TX).    Connection to NSFNET will bring a wide range of remote information  resources within immediate reach of museum researchers, educators,  and visitors.  Specifically, access to the NSFNET will help the  partners of this pilot group to improve operations in the areas of  teaching, research, and service.",
