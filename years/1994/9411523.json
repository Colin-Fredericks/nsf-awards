The comprehensive curriculum development process will rely heavily on engineers from industry to produce a product which is responsive to industrial needs and requirements.  Industrial partners will also participate in teaching of courses.  Using jointly-developed educational modules and a variety of delivery systems, the Center expects to reach at least 2,000 individuals, including unemployed, minority and women engineers, in the three year grant period.  Expanded outreach to minority populations will be provided through Northern Arizona University's connections with the Native American communities and the University of Arizona's relations with the Hispanic population.  ***",
