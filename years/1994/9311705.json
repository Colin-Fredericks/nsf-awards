 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311705, PI-Stanford:  Established in 1899, the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) has a long tradition of field based education and research, with emphasis in limnology.  FLBS has a 15 member staff and an annual budget of $700,000 (50% extramural).  Since 1983, over $2 million has been invested by the State in new housing, labs and equipment.  Two professorships and technical support positions (Data Manager and Assistant Director for Operations) were added in fiscal year 1992.  Recent research has addressed on groundwater ecology (1987 90) and food webs of oligotrophic lakes (1990 93) have been added to the stations array of facilities.  Collaborative studies involv e visiting investigators from around the world and encompass many aspects of limnology, from organism level work on the phenology and genetics of stream biota to ecosystem level examinations of materials flux in large lakes and river floodplains.  To enhance research capability, this project will retrofit and improve the lake and stream water delivery system to the Elrod Laboratory.  The present approach is to supply water from the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Flathead Lake, and from a springbrook on the Station grounds, in order to provide an array of sources, temperatures and food supplies to biota confined in laboratory microcosms within existing wet rooms.  Also requested is new instrumentation (CHNS analyzer, scintillation counter, 2 research microscopes, ion chromatograph, field fluorometer) to replace outdated units.  These items are required for continuation of long term limnological data bases and growth of multi investigator research.",
