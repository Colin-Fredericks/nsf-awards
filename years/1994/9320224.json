 "awd_abstract_narration": "McGuire    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Randall McGuire and  his colleagues will continue archaeological excavation at the  site of Cerro de Trincheras. Located on a large isolated volcanic  hill in northwest Sonora, Mexico, the site covers over a hectare  and includes more than 870 terraces on the slopes of the hill.  Some observable walls run for a hundred meters or more and  approach heights of up to 3 meters. Previous work at the site  indicates an occupation which extends from approximately 800-1450  AD. Excavation to date shows that terraces were used for  cultivation. Domestic structures were also constructed on these  surfaces. Building on a completed site map, Dr., McGuire and his  team will excavate approximately 3-5% of the surface area. The  excavation sample will be double-stratified by feature types and  by loci defined in the mapping project. This procedure will allow  for the estimation of parameters such as the number of houses per  residential terrace and permit inferences about population and  labor investment. The broadly based sample will provide  chronometric dates for all portions of the site and allow  reconstruction of synchronic activity structure across the site.  The materials to be recovered - these include among other  categories, ceramics, lithics, shell, bone and pollen - will be  analyzed by a range of specialists.     Cerro de Trincheras is a major and little known archaeological  site which lies just South of the US border. The project will  test a number of propositions about its prehistoric socio-  political organization. At a lower level the research will  address issues such as the timing of growth, the size and  permanence of the human population, the nature of activities at  the site and the role of the site in a larger regional and inter-  regional economic system.  At a higher level the work will  address the nature of regional interaction in technologically  simple prehistoric systems. It has been argued that major  arhaeological cultu res in the US Southwest owe their existence to  ties with central Mexico and that they can best be interpreted as  parts of a much larger interaction network. An equally plausible  interpretation sees the two as only weakly linked, essentially  independent phenomena. Cerro de Trincheras because of its  location between the two provides a means to examine these  alternatives.",
