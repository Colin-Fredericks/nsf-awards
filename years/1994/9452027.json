 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452027  Brittain  Modern NMR principles and practice are being integrated into both  lower- and upper-level courses in the chemistry curriculum. The  innovations in the lecture and laboratory affect not only the  department's chemistry majors, but also students enrolled in the  biology and pre-professional programs.  The department is  networking a 200 MHz Fourier transform NMR spectrometer with  broadband and variable temperature capabilities to personal  computers located in a novel laboratory/computer-workstation  environment in a newly designed science building to permit  real-time spectral processing and discussion.  The curricular  changes begin in the sophomore organic chemistry sequence: NMR  spectroscopy is being introduced early in the first course, and  lecture discussions of isomerism, nomenclature, reactions and  reaction mechanisms are illustrated with broadband-decoupled 13C  spectra and 13C DEPT spectra.  1H-NMR is integrated with 13C through  HETCOR spectroscopy.  In the organic laboratory, the opportunity  for students to generate 13C and DEPT or HETCOR spectra of their  products complements the use of these spectra in lecture.  The  instrument also is used to illustrate phenomena such as rotational  isomerism and stereo- and regioselectivity in organic reactions.   In the junior year, students enrolled in Inorganic Chemistry  synthesize a ligand and create a new complex, then utilize variable  temperature NMR to slow the fast-exchange dynamics of reversible  complexation and determine a complex dissociation constant.  Senior  students in the biochemistry sequence obtain and interpret COSY and  NOESY spectra of neuropeptides, determining peptide secondary  structural features in various chemical environments.  In physical  chemistry, these students utilize NMR to observe the effect of  solvent on molecular conformation and perform a thermodynamic  analysis of the conformational change.  The instrument receives  additional usage in directed studies (undergraduate research)  cou rses; research projects in inorganic, physical, and biochemistry  are available.",
