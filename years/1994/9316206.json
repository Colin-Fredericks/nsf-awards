Determination of their mechanism of action will help advance our  understanding of RAS action and the events involved in normal cell  growth.  Preliminary evidence discussed in a later section suggest  that these genes play important roles in yeast.  ESP18 encodes a  serine and threonine rich protein and is an essential gene that  inhibits the function of RAS.  It is particularly interesting  because it may encode a new class of proteins that are able to  regulate Ras activity.  IKS4 encodes a putative serine and  threonine protein kinase that opposes the function of the cAMP-  dependent protein kinase and it is  a candidate for a growth  inhibitor in yeast.  SCP7 encodes another serine and threonine rich  protein that inhibits the function of adenylate cyclase and may be  part of a complex that includes adenylate cyclase and the  associated protein, Cap.  The specific aims of this research are:   (1) To determine the function of the ESP18 gene:  We will determine  the function of the ESP18 gene by identifying other molecules that  interact directly or are within the same pathway as ESP18.  This  will be accomplished by the isolation and characterization of  extragenic mutants of an ESP18 temperature sensitive mutant. (2) To  characterize the function of the IKS4 gene:  We will characterize  the function of the IKS4 gene by performing genetic analysis to  determine its relation to other protein kinases that affect the  RAS-cAMP pathway in yeast.  (3) To better define the role of the  SCP7 gene in the function of adenylate cyclase by performing  genetic analysis to determine its relation to adenylate cyclase and  the associated protein, Cap.  We will also determine if the product  of the SCP7 gene associates with adenylate cyclase or Cap by co-  immunoprecipitiation of epitope tagged proteins.  %%%  The RAS genes of yeast are similar to cancer  causing genes of  animals.  This research could provide insight into the origins of  cancer.  ***",
