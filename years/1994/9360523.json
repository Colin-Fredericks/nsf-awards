 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360523  Shtessel      Self-propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS) is a novel process for synthesizing intermetallic, micro and nano phase composites.  SHS powders can be consolidated via plasma spraying to high densities to produce high temperature structural or wear-resistant materials.  SiC reinforced MoSi2 intermetallics are of particular commercial.  Brittle MoSi2 can be toughened through incorporation of dispersed phases.  Uniform, micro/nano dispersions of SiC, other carbides, nitrides or oxides, and other intermetallic/ceramic matrices can also be produced by SHS.  There is a growing need for materials which can extend component lifetimes and improve reliability in the increasingly severe high temperature environments of heat engines and materials processing (e.g. burners for glass production).    this research will evaluate the synergistic SHS production and plasma spray consolidation of SiC reinforced Mosi2 composites to understand process-structure relationships.  Processing relationships originating from SHS and plasma spray forming will be linked through microstructures and phase contents.  Research will establish SHS processing conditions which produce powders optimized to yield dense plasma spray deposits.  Evaluations will also explore the limitations of SHS on a commercial scale.    Success in the Mosi2/SiC system will be extrapolated in Phase II and Phase III to include Si3N and TiB2 reinforcements in MoSi2 matrices.  Once processes are established, Exotherm Corporation will develop commercial partnerships to commercialize the SHS/Plasma Forming technology.  ***",
