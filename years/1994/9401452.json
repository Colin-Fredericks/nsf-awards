 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gasper  9401452        The award supports mathematical research on fundamental  properties of hypergeometric and q-(basic) hypergeometric series,  classical and non-classical orthogonal polynomials, and on the  development of new methods for proving that certain orthogonal  polynomials and entire functions have only real roots.  In  particular, investigations will be made into the nonnegativity of  the coefficients in linearization formulas, the positivity of  kernels in product formulas (both of which lead to new  convolution structures and hypergroups), and necessary  and sufficient multiplier conditions (via norms involving  fractional differences) for certain systems of orthogonal  polynomials.  Continuing work will also be done on sums and  integrals of squares of real-valued functions and their  application in deriving explicit identities which prove that  certain entire special functions have only real roots, and in  deriving new families of inequalities, which also prove that all  of the rootsare real.       The theory of special functions and orthogonal polynomials  has fruitful connections with many branches of mathematical  analysis and applied mathematics, such as differential equations,  operator theory, numerical analysis, integration, continued  fractions and control theory to name a few.  This particular  program makes interesting connections with some of the most  outstanding mathematical questions considered in the mainstream  of interest at this time.  Of particular note is the study of  roots of entire functions which relates directly to the Riemann  hypthesis.  ***",
