 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is a study of the impact of the ejido reform  in  rural  Mexico.   That  reform,  initiated  in  1991-92,   is  designed  to  make  possible the eventual  privatization  of  lands   that  were  formerly  held  communally  by   Mexican  cultivators.   The project will be conducted  through  pilot  research  in  the  Zamora Valley, Michoac n,  Mexico.   This  project is funded through NSF's program of Research Planning  Grants for Women Scientists and Engineers.        Communally  held  land has been  a  basic  feature  of  agrarian  Mexico  since the time of the Mexican  revolution.  Critics  of the ejido system claim that it hinders  economic  development; defenders of the system argue that its  erosion  will lead to increased inequality and landlessness.  A study  of  the reform from its early stages will throw light on the  merits  of such opposing arguments.  It will also illuminate  the  impact  of  this important reform  on  the  social  and  economic  lives of Mexican farmers and on Mexico's political  stability   and   links   to  the   world   economy.    Land  privatization  reforms have been proposed or tried  in  many  other  parts  of the world, and the Mexican experience  will  contribute  to  growing  scientific  understanding  of   the  consequences of such reforms.  In addition to its scientific  and  practical importance, this grant will enable a talented  young  researcher  to conduct pilot research  to  prepare  a  request for funding for a larger project.",
