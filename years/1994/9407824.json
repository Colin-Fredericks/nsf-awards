 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407824  Sanderson       The flowering plant genus Astragalus, of the legume family,  containing upwards of 2500 species worldwide, is a remarkable  example of rapid evolutionary diversification on a global scale.   Reconstructing the evolutionary relationships or phylogeny within  such a genus can provide clues as to why it is so ecologically  successful.  However, the technical and logistical problems  associated with phylogenetic analyses of large genera have  prevented significant progress in understanding relationships  within Astragalus.  One promising approach is to identify major  subgroups, establish the phylogenetic status of these (whether they  are monophyletic), and then reconstruct their relationships to each  other.       The present study will evaluate three phylogenetic hypotheses  regarding one large putative monophyletic group within Astragalus.   This group consists of a series of some 500 species distributed in  the New World, which all possess an unusual chromosome complement  (they are aneuploids) that differs from the rest of the genus.  The  three hypotheses are (1) that all New World aneuploids form a  monophyletic group distinct from rare Old World aneuploids and  equally rare New World euploids; (2) that Old World aneuploids  represent evolutionarily independent origins of the aneuploid  chromosome condition; and (3) that New World euploids are not the  closest relatives of New World aneuploids, rather they are more  closely related to Old World species.  Evidence from mutational  differences in nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA will be  gathered from hundreds of New and Old World species, and integrated  with chromosome counts and morphological features.  Efforts will be  made to detect reliable morphological characters associated with  the origin of the aneuploid groups in the New and Old World.",
