Dr. Wakeley will work with Dr.  Fumio Tajima on a research project entitled  \"Models of Nucleotide Substitution and the  Demographic History of Natural Populations.\"    Dr. Wakeley will pursue two main areas of  research in Japan.  The first involves  inferences about the pattern of DNA sequence  evolution.  The investigators will develop a  computer-based method of quantifying variation  in the rate of nucleotide substitution among  sites in DNA sequences.  The method involves  the random placement of hypothetical nucleotide  substitutions on a genealogy relating the  sequences.  The second area involves developing  statistical approaches to making inferences  about the demographic history of populations.   Having recently derived the variance of the  average number of nucleotide differences among  pairs of sequences in a sample from two  populations that exchange migrants, and  comparing this variance to previously published  results for two populations that have been  completely isolated from each other for some  length of time, Dr. Wakeley found that the  variance is greater under migration than under  isolation.  Thus, he plans to develop a test to  distinguish these two biologically interesting  cases.  ***",
