 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410726  Stahl, Anne    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Ann Stahl and her  colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological and  ethnographic research in the Banda region in west central Ghana.  The history and prehistory of the Banda peoples can be clearly  traced back to the 17th Century AD. Oral tradition and written  documents indicate four distinct forms of political organization  over that period. From an essentially independent base, they were  first conquered and incorporated into the Ashante Kingdom. In the  19th century they became part of the British empire and subject  to indirect British rule. Finally they were incorporated into  independent Ghana. Dr. Stahl wishes to examine how the social,  political and economic organization changed across these periods  and will employ ethnographic and archaeological, as well as  archival data in her research. She will focus on the timing and  impact of New World crops on subsistence ecology; the changing  uses over time of wild and domestic fauna; changes in ceramic  production to address the impact of external exchange networks on  craft specialization; and document the role of exchange in the  local economy. To achieve these goals she will conduct extensive  interview with Banda people and observe present day manufacturing  and subsistence practices. She will also excavate a series of  known sites with span this time period and are direct historical  antecedents of the present day Banda village in which she will  work.    This research is important for several reasons. First, it will  provide data of interest to many Africanist archaeologists.  Secondly, it will constitute a basic contribution to world  systems theory. Social scientists have come to realize that small  scale, third world societies have long and complex histories.  Through examination of specific cases it is possible to gain  insight into processes of adaptation and change and to elucidate  the mechanisms which societies employ to survive in a changing   world. The project includes several students and will contribute  directly to their scientific training.",
