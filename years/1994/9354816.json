The course is designed to introduce first-year  engineering students to their chosen field in a creative and  exciting way. The course will be developed by an  interdisciplinary group of 10 engineering faculty, and will be  taught by these faculty to pilot groups of first-year students.  Integral to the design of the course is an ongoing assessment  of its success in achieving its objectives. These objectives  include: encouraging students to form a supportive academic  community, improving study skills and survival tactics of  first-year students, nurturing creativity in design, providing  a foundation in engineering science in several areas, involving  each student in hands-on laboratory experiences, providing  several opportunities for students to design, providing  connections between engineering faculty and first-year  students, introducing students to the engineering profession in  a variety of ways, improving the retention rate of engineering  students from the first to the second year, and ensuring that  each student makes the choice of engineering on the basis of  reliable information and experience.  GATEWAY TO ENGINEERING targets a pilot group of first-year  engineering students; it involves an interdisciplinary team of  engineering faculty; it provides significant engineering  science content, hands-on laboratory experience and design  opportunities for each student; it enables students to join the  engineering academic community by coming to know their peers,  their teachers, and some upper division students in  engineering; it combines the results of previously-successful  first-year programs with innovative pedagogical techniques in  a new and creative way; and it gives the first-year students a  clear understanding of both the study and the practice of  engineering.",
