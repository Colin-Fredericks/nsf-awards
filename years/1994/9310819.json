 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310819  Mooney       A general goal of machine learning is automating the  construction of efficient knowledge-based systems.  Current methods  tend to focus on either the acquisition of the basic domain  knowledge (inductive learning) or the acquisition of search-control  knowledge (speedup learning).  However, these two tasks are not  always cleanly separated.  This research investigates the general  framework of learning search-control heuristics for logic programs,  which can improve both accuracy and efficiency.  Logic programming  provides a very general and well-understood representational and  computational platform on which to build.  Recent methods in  inductive logic programming can be used to automatically learn  search-control heuristics from a set of training problems.   Efficiency may be improved by learning control rules that eliminate  backtracking during the search for a proof.  Accuracy may be  improved by learning control rules that eliminate search paths that  produce incorrect results.",
