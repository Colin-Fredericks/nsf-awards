In addition to  data on the rate of growth of offspring, the project will yield  information on offspring dominance ranks, territorial behavior  and choice of mates by daughters.  Finally, the reproduction of  sons and daughters in small outdoor enclosures will be measured  using a new DNA fingerprinting technique.  These results will  provide the first detailed information on how maternal  nutritional state during pregnancy influences the development,  behavior and reproduction of offspring.%%%       The study will help resolve the controversy about whether  maternal nutritional state has different effects on the  reproduction of sons and daughters in a mammalian species such as  house mice.  The results also will yield information about the  physiological impact of maternal nutritional state that may be  useful to animal breeders.  In addition, if these results are  generalizable to other mammal species, they may offer some  insights into human development and behavior.***",
