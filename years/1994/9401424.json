 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401424  Lee       The research is concerned with the modeling and investigation  of solution techniques for nonlinear-objective combinatorial  optimization problems.  Three basic solution techniques are to be  investigated.  These techniques are (1) a combination of  linearization and polyhedral methods, (2) combination of eigenvalue  bounding methods with polyhedral and Lagrangian methods, and (3)  model assessment through geometric methods. Three classes of  problems are identified as sources of problems to be used in  testing the models and their solution methods.  The application  areas for which the algorithms will be tested are network design  problems with inter-link costs, fixed charge facility location  problems, and experimental design problems.       The outcome of this research are the development of (1) more  general methods for tightening integer programming formulations of  difficult discrete planning problems with nonlinear objective  function, (2) techniques for integrating algebraic bounding methods  for planning problems with nonlinear objective functions, and (3)  general principles for the design of branch-and-cut procedures for  integer programming based approaches for discrete planning problems  with both linear and nonlinear objective function.  Other outcomes  of the research will be the development of understanding similar to  those of planning problems in network design and experimental  design problems.",
