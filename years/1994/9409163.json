 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409163  Gruzglina   This award is for research to develop a theory of the compaction process for powder materials, based on the concept of modeling the compacted blend as a viscous fluid.  An analysis of the formation of asymmetrical briquettes using conventional forming elements will be conducted.  The process of counter-motion of the blend in the pressing zone will be studied.  New improved forming elements will be developed.  Thus, the research is directed at replacing current empirical design methods for compacting machinery by an analytical approach, based on the proposed theory.   Briquetting machinery is widely used in powder metallurgy, nonferrous metallurgy, coal production, and production of food and pharmaceutical products.  The results of the research will therefore be of potential use in all these industries.",
