 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Fink  This proposal will identify the specific genes involved in pathway  of IAA biosynthesis, the tissue specificity of these genes, the  phenotypes of mutations that prevent expression, and regulatory  mutations affecting the pathway.  The plant hormone, indole acetic  acid (IAA) has remarkably diverse effects on plant growth and  morphogenesis (22) (e.g. apical dominance, cell division, cell  enlargement and lateral root formation).  Our belief is that once  the gene(s) specifically involved in IAA biosynthesis are cloned,  the role of internal IAA in each of these processes can be  understood.  As most of the structural genes in the pathway are  found in multiple copies, mutations will be sought in each member  of a set so that the role of gene redundancy in the tryptophan/IAA  pathway can be determined.  To achieve this goal experiments are  designed to improve transformation, gene targeting, and the control  of gene expression by antisense.  %%%   Indole acetic acid is a plant hormone which affects many growth and  morphogenic characteristics of plants. Most of what is known have  been determined by external application of IAA to plants. However,  little is known about its synthesis and function in an in vivo  situation. The aromatic amino acid pathway is utilized for the  biosynthesis of IAA and we will identify and clone the genes  encoding the enzymes of this pathway, determine gene copy number  and attempt to gain insight into the internal functioning of the  hormone. We will, as necessary, develop the technology needed to  achieve these goals.  ***",
