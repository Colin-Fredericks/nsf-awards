Further, the diversity of inorganic  chemistry, from molecular substances to structurally extended  materials, will be presented within the context of a single,  coherent laboratory course. This approach is already under way, and  student experience to date has run the gamut from photochemical  preparation and characterization of an organometallic complex to  the preparation and ion exchange of a zeolite. Four new initiatives  are incorporated into the proposal: 1) use of a diode array kinetic  spectrophotometer in the study of reaction kinetics and mechanisms,  2) electrochemical characterization and preparation techniques  (e.g. cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis), 3) preparation and  manipulation of air sensitive complexes by Schlenk techniques, and  4) use and maintenance of inert atmosphere enclosures. In addition,  desktop computers will be employed for calculating X-ray powder  diffraction patterns and for free energy minimization calculations  to predict optimum reaction conditions.",
