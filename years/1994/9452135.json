A network  information retrieval system has been designed by the project  director that gives convenient campus-wide interactive graphic  access to data in the Brookhaven National Laboratory Protein Data  Bank. This laboratory will facilitate the integration of molecular  modeling of complex bimolecular into course work and research in  undergraduate chemistry, interdisciplinary studies, and biology.  The impetus for this project comes from a desire to make the  learning of bimolecular structure a more active discovery-oriented  process for students as well as to expand the modes through which  our students and faculty access the chemical literature. In course  work, students can now be asked to find structural evidence that  supports their claims about biological function, underlying  chemical principles that determine structure, mechanisms for enzyme  catalysis, and much more.",
