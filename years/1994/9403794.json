 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major direction of the proposed research is in sequential  change-point detection schemes. Powerful techniques to tackle  this problem are currently available from recent advances in  sequential testing theory and boundary crossing problems in  random fields. It is expected that relatively simple algorithms  which are not too demanding in computational and memory  requirements for on-line implementation and yet are nearly  optimal from a statistical viewpoint will be developed for a wide  variety of practical applications. Not only will the methodology  to be developed address the widely recognized discrepancies  between the assumptions underlying conventional control charts  and today's industrial processes, but it will also integrate both  the detection aspect and the quality measurement aspect of  industrial quality control. Another closely related direction of  research is in fixed sample change-point problems and its  applications to econometrics, signal reconstruction and genetic  linkage analysis. Related fundamental problems in boundary  crossing probabilities of random processes and random fields will  be investigated, and are expected to lead to definitive solutions  of some long-standing problems concerning the distribution of  generalized likelihood ratio statistics in change-point models. A  third related area of research is estimation and control of time  series models and stochastic dynamical systems whose parameters  may change with time. Although in practice abrupt parameter  changes typically occur very infrequently, the unknown times of  their occurrence have led to prohibitive complexity of the Bayes  estimators and controllers in the literature. By using parallel  recursive algorithms and combining some new ideas in sequential  change-point detection with empirical Bayes methodology, it is  anticipated that asymptotically efficient estimation and control  schemes which have manageable complexity and which can be  implemented on-line will be developed.   An important objeat ive of the proposed research is the  development of a powerful statistical methodology for quality  control of modern industrial processes and for automated fault  detection in complex manufacturing systems. Another important  goal is to develop statistical methods appropriate for analysis  of genetic linkage data related to disease susceptibility and  other traits in humans, animals and plants and for extraction of  relevant information from these data that may lead to better  diagnostic tests and treatments of the disease.",
