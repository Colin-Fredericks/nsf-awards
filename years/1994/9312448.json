 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Konkowski plans to continue her mathematical study  of mild singularities and Cauchy horizons in spacetime  models.  Mild singularities include quasiregular and  nonscalar curvature singularities.  In the former, particle  paths may end with no accompanying physical catastrophes,  while in the latter, some particles moving near the  singularity will feel infinite tidal forces, but not all do.  In most cases the spacetime models examined satisfy  Einstein's equations.    It is important to study relativistic spacetimes with mild  singularities, together with the behavior of particles and  fields in these spacetimes, in order to better understand  the nature of mild singularities.  The nature of  singularities which occur in the classical solutions of  Einstein's equations is largely an unexplored area.  The  singularity theorems which predict the occurrence of  singularities in broad classes of spacetimes give little  clue to their nature.  In order to better understand them,  it is important not only to study their mathematical  structure but to study the behavior of physical processes in  singular spacetimes.  Such a study will lead to a fuller  understanding of the relevance of spacetimes with different  types of singularities both within the mathematical  structure of Einstein's equation and within the physical  universe.",
