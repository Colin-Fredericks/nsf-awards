 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321626     Oberbauer  Global warming will substantially increase the length of the  active season for high latitude ecosystems, but many plant  species in these areas have phenological patterns adapted to  short growing seasons.  Some, but not all, of the factors that  affect phenological stages will change with global warming.   Those species constrained by cues that will be unchanged with  global warming, such as photoperiod, will be unable to respond to  extended season length.  As a result, species composition,  productivity, and carbon fluxes from these ecosystems will change  substantially.  Using Alaskan tundra as a model system, this  project addresses the questions: 1) What are the constraints on  phenological patterns for the dominant species? 2) What  physiological adjustments will species make in response to an  extended period of resource availability? 3) How will growth of  the dominant species, ecosystem productivity, and ecosystem  carbon fluxes change under field-simulated extended seasons?   These questions will be addressed using a combination of  controlled-environment studies and field manipulations of season  length.  Growth chamber studies will examine the effects of  photoperiod, soil and air temperature, and leaf age on  phenological patterns and carbon gain of selected species of the  dominant growth forms.  Field studies will examine the effects of  extended active period on phenology, growth, productivity, and  ecosystem carbon balance.  Results from this study will be used  to develop a model of phenological patterns of tundra plants that  can be used to evaluate species' responses to extended growing  season.  ***",
