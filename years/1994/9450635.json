Students:  student pool is bifurcated into well-prepared and  ill-prepared \"at-risk\" students; students with interdisciplinary  interests must decide among traditional majors; science literacy  among the nonscience students is extremely low; student learning is  more visual, making the lecture format less effective.   Instruction:  rapid expansion of science has over-extended  curricular content (\"more is good\" philosophy); liberal education  needs preclude expansion of science requirements for majors;  research experiences are too focused at the senior level; the  divisional structure of Chemistry (and, to some extent, the  departmental structure of science) is inconsistent with the  practice of science.  Our premises are that:  a comprehensive  overhaul of chemistry instruction (both structural and content) is  needed; an incremental approach will not achieve the objectives of  improved instruction; inquiry-based instruction should replace the  content-based approach to many topics in order to better reflect  the practice of science; current curricula lead to wasteful  duplication of material, particularly among departments; curriculum  reform should be based on a top-down plan that emphasizes student  outcome in the development of the model.",
