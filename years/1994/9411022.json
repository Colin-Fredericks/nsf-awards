The Workshop participants will grapple with  practical issues based on the experience of fellow  participants and their organizations.  How does industry  perceive the need for training, continuing education, and  professional development?  What makes sense in the short and  long term?  How can industry work with the various  providers, particularly universities, to develop more  accountability for dollars spent on professional  development?  In addition to providing a forum where ideas  and resources can be shared, Industry 2000 will provide IEEE  with an opportunity to learn about industry needs first  hand.    Since this proposal is for conducting a workshop, it is  exempt from peer review in accordance with NSF Manual No.  10, Section 122.1-3.  Award of a grant is recommended.      Paul J. Herer                                February 9,  1994",
