 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416184  Goel  The primary objective of this research project is to develop  methods for evaluation and upgrading of existing \"non-  ductile\" (ordinary) concentric braced frame structures of  steel for survival during future earthquakes.    Whereas, widespread connection failures in steel moment  frames due to the Northridge earthquake were quite  unexpected, it is also generally recognized that concentric  braced frames (CBF) are among the most efficient and popular  structural systems in steel for lateral load resistance.  There exists a large inventory of these structures which are  potentially hazardous.  A significant number of such  structures suffered widespread damage during the Northridge  earthquake and required extensive repair and upgrading work.  Current or past design practice and codes did not focus on  providing ductility in these structures previously studied.    The Northridge experience has emphasized the need for  developing methods for evaluating and upgrading existing CBF  in order to ensure satisfactory performance during future  more severe probable earthquakes.    Two theme structures are selected for the study.  The four  story building in North Hollywood which suffered the most  dramatic failures and which represents the typical CBF  structures designed by modern codes and practice has been  chosen for detailed investigation including correlation of  the results with observed damage.  The second part of this  project is devoted to the development of practical and  effective upgrading schemes to mitigate future earthquake  hazard.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
