 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shocked solar wind plasma, or magnetosheath, provides the  basic input and outer boundary condition for the Earth's  magnetosphere.  The most direct access of this magnetosheath plasma  into the magnetosphere and ionosphere occurs in the region of the  outer polar cusp.  Thus, an enhanced understanding of plasma  processes at the magnetosheath/cusp interface is essential to the  advancing magnetopause and boundary layer physics.  Because of  tailward bending of the magnetic field near the outer  magnetospheric boundary, the entire magnetospheric boundary layer  is mapped through this cusp region into the frontside, high-  latitude ionosphere near local noon.  Although the interaction of  plasmas and fields in the outer cusp play a key role in linking the  magnetosheath and boundary layer to the ionosphere, very few  satellite measurements are available in this region.         This project's objective is to advance the knowledge of  plasma, field and plasma wave interactions in the outer and mid-  altitude polar cusp with a focus on plasma and momentum transport,  field fluctuations, and the resulting cusp current system.  The  investigators will identify and test those plasma and field  interactions most relevant to enhancing unique observations  available from satellite and used as a baseline sample of particle  and field characteristics in the outer cusp and mid-altitude cusp  regions.  Although very limited, available observations in the  outer cusp provide enough information on overall geometry and  plasma conditions to apply state-of-the-art 2-D MHD and hybrid  simulations of the magnetosheath-cusp interaction region including  coupling to the ionosphere.  Such simulations will provide  information on the local time-dependent flows and magnetic fields  in the outer cusp as well as the more nonlocal cusp/ionosphere  current system.  Understanding anomalous cross-field momentum  transport is crucial for developing quantitative models of the cusp  and dayside current systems.  The PIs  will therefore focus on  shear-flow driven instabilities and associated turbulence and  transport.  Realistic 2-D and 3-D hybrid simulations of shear-flow  across the magnetosheath/outer cusp and mid-altitude cusp wall  boundaries will be completed.  Theoretical predictions of electric  and magnetic fluctuation spectra will be compared, especially with  observed ULF-ELF wave spectra.  In turn, cross-field transport will  be calculated based on the observed fluctuation spectra to assess  the importance of anomalous diffusion processes in the cusp region.",
