 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is project will a pilot effort to develop, deliver, and  evaluate national curricula to educate the technicians who will be  employable in the 21st century manufacturing enterprise.   Instrutional delivery will be assisted by distance learning  technology and the National Information Infrastructure.  Added  funding will come from local, state, and other federal sources.   CAM-I will lead the Advanced Technical Education (ATE) Alliance,  including as members Lawrence Technological University, C.S. Mott  Community College, and the Goodrich, MI, area schools, and as  affiliates other school districts in the Flint, MI, area, clusters  of community colleges, school districts, and CAM-I company members  in Oak Ridge, TN, Kansas City, MO and KN, Los Angeles, CA, and the  Mescalero Apache Reservation NM, and Lehigh University and National  Technological University.  The knowledge and skill needs for a new  breed of agile technicians, able to respond knowledgeably,  effectively, and quickly in highly competitive, rapidly changing  global manufacturing, are described.  The ATE Alliance will meet  these needs by combining existing best practices modules, already  developed by its members and affiliates, with newly developed  modules in an integrated, flexible, grades 11 14 program in math,  science, communications, computing, and manufacturing enterprise  technologies in a pilot program centered on C.S. Mott Community  College and Goodrich MI area schools.  The Alliance will share the  modules using nationally scalable distance learning techniques.   The curricula will be reinforced with teacher training, jobsite  education for teachers and students, and public information  programs.  The ATE Alliance will establish a virtual school,  combining a national network of educational resources to provide  locally and temporally optimized education for employability.  The  pilot curriculum modules will be disseminated via distance learning  techniques to the members and the affiliated Associate degree  grant ing institutions and school districts. The curricula will be  evaluated through performance based assessment.  Successful modules  will be further disseminated throughout the United States by CAM-I  in publications, public fora, and through CAM-I's national network  of industrial members.  The ATE Alliance will provide 21st-century  education in clusters with large, diverse minority populations,  preparing students for employment in challenging and rewarding  careers.",
