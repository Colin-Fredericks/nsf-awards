 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361977  Schmidlin  A simple powder marking process  known as Direct Electrostatic Printing  (DEP) was  invented by the Principal  Investigator to enable the development  of affordable desktop color printers. The  process proved to be capable of  printing images with 12 dots  per mm.  resolution at speeds up to 15 cm/sec;  but fell short of becoming practical due   to its sensitivity to wrong sign toner. A  new electrostatic process has now been   conceived by the Principal Investigator  that should overcome the limitations of  DEP  while preserving all of its  desirable attributes. The feasibility of  this new  proprietary process will be  demonstrated by DPI Technologies in  the proposed research  via the design  of a new structure and process (based  on analysis) and experimental  fests  using an existing laboratory fixture.  Successful results from the proposed   research will justify the follow-on  development of a revolutionary  innovative technology. This technology  will enable the subsequent development  of a wide variety  of new and improved  non-impact printers. There is an  enormous market need for the kind of  simple, reliable, robust, low-cost  monochrome or color printers that this   technology is capable of enabling.  Products with the unique ability to form  durable,  tamper-proof pictures and  labels for security applications are also  possible.  ***",
