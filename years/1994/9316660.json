 "awd_abstract_narration": "Serwer  9316660  By use of a model system that has several advantageous properties,  we purpose to investigate the changes in structure that occur when  multimolecular nucleoprotein complexes accomplish a biological  task.  The model system consists of the components required during  the packaging of double-standard DNA in the DNA-free procapsid of  bacteriophage T7.  The advantageous properties include  accessibility to two of our recently-developed procedures of  analysis:  isolation of capsids that have incompletely packaged DNA  and high performance production of mutants that have an altered DNA  packaging pathway.  The long-range objective is to obtain a  complete physical description of a biologically-evolved process;  that is, we are exploring the interface of biology and physical  chemistry.  The short-range objectives are the following:  (a)  Characterization will be performed of both the DNA and capsid  components of capsids that have incompletely packaged DNA.   Structural analysis will be performed by use of the following:   chemical probes for structure, ultraviolet light-induced DNA-DNA  and DNA-protein cross-linking, one-oligonucleotide probes,  analytical ultracentrifiguration, electron microscopy and Raman  scattering.  (b) To assist in accomplishing the first short-range  objective, isolation will be performed of T7 mutants that have an  altered studies of static viral structure for developing both a  fundamental understanding of structural dynamics and a new approach  to antiviral strategies.  Our studies of genetics will provide a  state of the art analysis of the control of morphogenesis by genes.   This proposal is interdisciplinary.  %%%  Biological processes have always been too complex to describe  completely in terms of the concepts of physics and chemistry.  By  use of a model biological system that has several advantageous  properties, we propose to obtain a relatively complete chemical and  physical description of a biological process.  The biological  process is the  packaging of a double-stranded DNA molecule in the  outer shell of a bacterial virus; the DNA is packaged in a space  that has a volume twice that of the DNA.  By use of our newly-  developed technique for both determination of structure and  isolation of capsids with incompletely packaged DNA, we will  determine the structural changes that occur during DNA packaging.   This approach complements studies in which only the structure of  the completed virus is studied.  The product of work is both  improved understanding of changes in structure during formation of  viruses and new approaches to developing antiviral strategies.  ***",
