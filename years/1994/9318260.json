 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318260  Walling  Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that hydrolyze the N-terminal  amino acid from peptides and proteins.  In animals, aminopeptidases  have an important role in nutrition and modulation of the  activities of gut and brain peptide hormones by converting them to  active or inactive forms.  In addition, these exopeptidases may  have a role in modulating half-lives of proteins in vivo.   Surprisingly; little is known about aminopeptidase activity during  plant development.  Although aminopeptidases are known to be  induced after germination and during senescence, the expression of  these genes during the plant life cycle or in response to biotic or  abiotic stress has not been characterized.     Dr. Walling has isolated and characterized a leucine aminopeptidase  (lap) cDNA clone from Lycopersicon exculentum (tomato).  Leucine  aminopeptidase mRNAs are induced to high levels after mechanical  injury, insect feeding, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  infection.  LAP proteins and activity are also induced after  wounding.  Two wound-induced lap genes are present in the tomato.   The proposed research is a multi-faceted approach to understanding  the expression, localization, and function of LAPs during the  plant-defense response.  Furthermore, these studies will be exteded  to gain a comprehensive understanding of lap gene expression  throughout plant development and in response to abiotic stress.    Only recently, have plant leucine aminopeptidase genes been  isolated, and few directed efforts have been made to understand  their expression and impact on the plant responses to the  environment and to developmental cues.  Elucidation of the role of  LAPs during the plant defense reaction and during development will  enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that favor optimal  growth and development.  These factors will directly impact on  optimal crop productivity and potentially yield insights for  strategies to enhance a plant's endogenous protection mechanisms.  ***",
