Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising  proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.   Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the  conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications  and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture  capital or other non-federal financing.  This Phase II project  involves research in three areas related to new sequence generation  in multiple access applications:  theoretical, practical and  complementary.  The theoretical research plan consists of the  generalization of the {D}-sequence minimum distance properties, the  availability of mutually orthogonal Latin squares, derivation of  sequence length with respect to {D}-set parameters, and the  applicability of general symbol matrix size.  The practical  research plan addresses the computer programs to be established for  simulation and evaluations of Phase I tasks.  The complementary  research plan proposes the derivation and evaluation criteria of  {D}-sequence detection in interference environments, the  compatibility of sequence transmission through ATM cells, and the  error coding and ciphering problems and solutions for {D}-sequences  to be used with multimedia applications.  ***",
