 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dataflow networks are a paradigm for concurrent computation in  which a collection of concurrently and asynchronously executing  processes  communicate by sending data values over FIFO  communication channels.  ``Determinate'' dataflow networks, which  are composed of processes with  functional input/output behavior,  are a well-understood special case, whereas  ``indeterminate''  networks, which can contain non-functional processes, still  present some puzzles.  In particular, the goal of discovering a  useful and  powerful logic for reasoning about indeterminate  networks, has not yet been  fully achieved.    A step in the direction of such a logic is a formal theory  called  ``dataflow calculus''.  The syntax of the calculus is designed to  reflect in a natural way the  mathematical structure that has  seemed most important in previous semantic  studies of dataflow  networks.   In previous research a soundness and  completeness  theorem has been proved for a set of equational axioms for  dataflow networks, which shows that these axioms characterize an  interesting  notion of equivalence for dataflow networks.    This research project is  concerned with continuing the study of  dataflow calculus, and its uses, as a  concrete foundation on  which to build a more powerful logic of dataflow  networks, and as  a tool for understanding better the relationship between the  various abstract semantic models for dataflow networks.",
