 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317231  Martinson  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program  (\"Anzflux\") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here concerns the collecting of hydrographic and  geochemical tracer data to determine the three-dimensional oceanic  structure on various spatial scales and to provide data for the  validation of oceanic models.     The eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined by  the intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near  +1 deg C, and a cold regime exist side by side.  The cold regime  occurs to the west, where deep water is overlain by a thick near-  freezing mixed layer. In both regions however enough heat is  seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely.      The objectives of this project are to allow the reconstruction of  the overall configuration of the Weddell Gyre, the warm and cold  regimes, and to determine the large-scale baroclinicity, upwelling,  and ventilation of intermediate water masses.  On a smaller scale  this work will characterize the specific differences between the  two drift stations and provide initial conditions for modeling the  oceanic processes.  The tracer measurements will complement the  direct observations, and will constrain estimates of the net  transfer of warm deep water into the surface layer.    These measurements, in conjunction with the other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***",
