 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314453  Fouad       Today's heavily loaded and stressed power transmission  networks exhibit very complex dynamic system behavior, when  subjected to small or large disturbances.  Several aspects of  this complex behavior are alarming to the power system analyst,  since they are likely to reflect structural weakness in the power  network.  When subjected to small disturbances, the main concern  is the power system conditions which lead to the phenomenon known  as the interarea mode of oscillation.  When subjected to a large  disturbance, a stressed and heavily loaded interconnected power  network may experience a system split involving generators far  away from the location of the disturbance.        Analysis of the fundamental modes of oscillation play a  crucial role in power system dynamic performance.  Controls are  tuned to mitigate lightly damped modes.  The analysis is usually  done using a linearized system model.  If fundamental modes  interact due to nonlinearities, then it becomes important to  understand the nature of these interactions and to incorporate  them in the analysis and design procedure.         The proposers intend to study the dynamic power system  behavior under stressed (e.g., heavy load) operating conditions,  using normal forms of vector fields.  The approach to be used is  to obtain nonlinear corrections to the linear behavior through  normal form analysis, i.e., through incorporating higher order  (polynomial) terms.  The objective is to obtain a more precise  understanding of the local and \"almost global\" behavior of a  system via polynomial approximation, invariant manifolds (stable,  unstable and center manifolds), unfolding via bifurcation  parameters, sensitivity analysis and incorporation of random  perturbations.  This approach, which is a standard approach in  the theory of dynamical systems, has not been used for the  analysis of large electrical power networks, and we propose a  systematic study of normal form analysis for these systems to  assess the us e of information from higher order nonlinear  analysis for power systems operation.     ***",
