CDPKs are a novel family of protein kinases which are  defined by a unique structural arrangement: Within a single  polypeptide, a kinase domain is fused to a C-terminal  calmodulin-like regulatory domain. The regulatory domain contains  four Ca2+-binding EF-hands, which makes CDPKs a primary target  (decoder) of Ca2+ signals. Understanding the process by which CDPKs  decode and transduce a Ca2+ signal is the primary focus of the  proposed research. The first specific aim addresses the question of  how Ca2+ activates a CDPK? The second specific aim complements the  first by investigating the mechanisms of autoinhibition and Ca2+  activation in the holo-enzyme. The third specific aim is to develop  a tool which will permit the in vivo activity of CDPKs to be  monitored using fluorescence ratio imaging on live cells. Finally,  the fourth specific aim is to identify endogenous substrates for a  specific CDPK isoform. Since there appear to be many CDPK isoforms,  this research assumes that each may have a different substrate  specificity, and that each may have evolved to decode a different  Ca2+ signal. The short-term objective of this combined research is  to propose a potential function for one specific CDPK, isoform AK1  from Arabidopsis.  %%%  In plants, calcium signals are involved in many aspects of growth  and development, including regulation of water use, activation of  plant pathogen defenses, and the ability to respond to gravity. The  long range goal of the proposed research is to understand how  calcium ions are used to communicate information within a cell.  This research is being conducted with a model plant system,  Arabidopsis, and will contribute to our basic knowledge of cellular  function. It is anticipated that this research will be useful in  exploring new approaches to improved agricultural crops and   practices. The focus of the proposed research is on the structure  and function of a family of novel protein kinases, called CDPKs.  Protein kinases regulate many cellular functions by modifying key  enzymes through phosphorylation. CDPKs, unlike any other protein  kinase, are directly activated by calcium, making them primary  targets of calcium signals. Nevertheless, it is not known what  cellular functions are controlled by these kinases.  ***",
