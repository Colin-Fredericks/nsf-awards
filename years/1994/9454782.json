The Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, (MMSA), a nonprofit 501 (c) 3  organization, the administrator of Maine's Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI), is proposing an  eight-month planning project, Discovering Community Networks, where three diverse  communities, York, Houlton, Mt. Desert Island, will develop strategies for building synergy for  inter and intracommunity communication with electronic networks to work toward systemic  changes in mathematics, science and technology education.  Discovering Community Networks,  through planning forums aimed at sustainability of a network and educational reform, will build  partnerships within and across communities.    The objectives are:          1. To develop community technology plans focused on using telecommunications to       improve science and Mathematics education.          2. To develop plans for intra and intercommunity communication.          3. To plan community links for appropriate use of electronic technology.          4. To document the process of community technology planning for a transferable model.          5. To research how mathematics and science reform is enhanced by telecommunication.    The co-principal investigators and a project director will work in concert with the communities'  coordinators, technology teams and a cross-site team.  Membership on the technology teams will  represent all community populations including teachers, parents, students, industry, research  laboratories, higher education institutions, municipal government, cable television companies,  retired people, and civic groups using and providing network services. Three one-half time site  coordinators will simplify the planning and work with the project director and existing  governance structures.    In response to our earlier question, the evaluation of the project will reflect the answers we  discover.  Discovering Commun ity Networks will formatively assess in the planning portion and  a summative evaluation will conclude the project with what we've learned about intra and inter  community collaboration and the products produced.  This will be available to interested  communities, the Maine State Library as they work toward providing networking services for  Maine, the Maine Department of Education's State Educational Technology Task Force, and be  incorporated into funding requests to carry out the plans.",
