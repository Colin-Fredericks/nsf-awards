Enrollment  each summer will be 50 students.  The curriculum is inquiry-based.   Students entering 7th, 8th and 9th grades will conduct one major  group study and additional defined investigations at the St. Louis  Zoo, Science Center and Botanical Garden.  Campers and their  parents will interact with practicing SEM professionals in career  exploration activities.  The rational for this curriculum approach  is that all students should have the opportunity to be motivated by  the scientific discovery process.  Research (developing science  projects--doing science) can tap into natural curiosity.  This  \"doing\" allows students to learn processes (how to investigate)  that are fundamental to developing personal connection/commitment.   Personal commitment is key to understanding content.  (see  \"Curriculum Models Coming Into Focus\", 2061 Today, American  Association for the Advancement of Science, Fall, 1991.)    Camp Triple E will be based at Crossroads School which is located  1/4 mile from Forest Park ( a multi-acre park which houses the St.  Louis Zoo, Art and History Museums, the Science Center and numerous  recreational facilities for biking, hiking, skating, ball playing,  etc.)  The Crossroads School was selected because no St. Louis  Public School buildings are air conditioned and none is equipped  with adequate lab facilities.  None of the cooperating  colleges/institutions has adequate space/facilities for a program  of the scope and duration of the summer camp.  A description of the  Crossroads school facilities is attached.      Project Goal:  The summer science camp is an essential activity is  the St. Louis region for increasing access to mathematics-based  careers for African, Hispanic and Native  American students.  The  under-represented population in science in St. Louis is  predominantly African-American.  Camp Triple E will serve a  critical function in the continuum of mathematics and science  mastery/enrichment activities designed as the Comprehensive  Regional Center for Minorities (CRCM) \"pipeline\" supporting  students' movement from middle-school to undergraduate school as  SEM majors.       ***",
