 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361884  Anthony  In-service  performance  of  treated  wood  products  depends  on  consistently   inducting  specified  quantities  (retention)   of  preservative   chemicals  to  require   depths   (retention)   of  preservative  chemicals to required depths  (penetration)  within  the   wood.   Quality  control  procedures  to  ensure   adequate  penetration  and  retention currently  rely  on  the  removal  of  increment  cores  from  a  subset  of  all  treated  members  for  subsequent  laboratory  analysis.   The  proposed  research  will  examine   the   feasibility   of   magnetically   tagging    wood  preservatives  to  enable  simple  nondestructive  evaluation  of  penetration  and retention of preservative chemicals  in  treated  wood.   In  magnetic  tagging, a small amount of  extremely  fine  \"sensor\"  particles  is  uniformly  distributed  throughout   the  preservative  prior to treatment.  When subsequently interrogated  by  eddy  current  nondestructive  evaluation,  the  tagged  wood  responds with a characteristics signature than can be related  to  preservative  distribution.  a feature of  eddy  current  testing  involving  magnetically tagged materials is that  electromagnetic  energy can penetrate significant thicknesses of conducting tagged  materials.   This  permits  the  volumetric  characterization  of  tagged  materials.   The  technical objectives  of  the  Phase  I  research  are  (1)  to  evaluate the feasibility  of  introducing  ferromagnetic particles into preservative chemicals and achieving  penetration  of the magnetically tagged preservative  into  wood,  and  (2) to evaluate the feasibility of measuring penetration and  retention of magnetically tagged preservative with eddy current.  ***",
