The program focuses on organic and  inorganic conductors with incommensurate charge-density-wave and  spin-density-wave instabilities.  The objective is to discover the  correlation between the fascinating transport and thermodynamic  behavior with the elementary microscopic excitations.  The program  includes samples preparations and characterizations, and  experiments conducted at the home institution and national user  facilities such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and  the National Synchrotron Light Source.  The present capabilities of  the laboratory will be expanded.  The materials preparation  facility will be improved.  Higher accuracy will be sought in  transport and thermodynamic experiments under high pressure and in  magnetic fields.  Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments under high  pressure will be performed.    % % % %    A large number of materials have high electrical conductivity like  metals but only along specific crystallographic directions.  Such  materials are referred to as quasi-one-dimensional.  They have  specific physical properties different than the conventional  metals.  Electrons interacting with each other and with the lattice  in such restricted dimensionality, are likely to form states of  matter known as density waves (charge or spin) distinct from metals  but with fascinating electrical and magnetic properties.  This  program is designed to investigate the correlation between the  underlying microscopic interactions and the macroscopic properties  such as electrical conductivity.  The Principal Investigator will  synthesize the materials and perform experiments in the department  of physics at University of California at Los Angeles as well as at  two national facilities, National High Magnetic field Laboratory  and the National Synchrotron Light Source.  ***",
