 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450336  U of Tennessee Memphis  Memphis, TN  Moore, Leroy    \"Summer Science Camp\"    The University of Tennessee, Memphis Summer Science Camp (SSC), a  four-week, computer science and mathematics discovery project,  increases the awareness and curiosity of 50 underrepresented 7th  graders for Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) careers.   based on the concept of \"learning by doing,\" the SSC project design  is driven by the objective to increase their students' factual  knowledge and skills about algebra and science concepts via a  series of computer-based, interactive physical science experiments.    Assigned mentors, in an apprenticeship relationship, demonstrate  how the mathematics and science concepts are utilized in finding  solutions to problems in their research laboratories.  Student  support activities, including a parental component, increase the  students' perceptions about their own abilities, resulting in a  feeling of \"I can do it.\"  Exposing students to a variety of SEM  practitioners (role models) and work sites, and demonstrating the  role of science and mathematics in work settings, further  stimulates students' interest in and enthusiasm about SEM careers.   An academic year Saturday Camp maintain student interest heightened  during the SSC, by engaging them in a \"research\" activity related  to minority health and social concerns.  The UT Memphis SSC feeds  into a local high school science/mathematics intervention, Project  ACHIEVE, designed to increase the pool of minorities prepared to  enter health professions.  Such collaboration with the project  \"Project ACHIEVE\" creates an educational pathway that fosters  students' continued interest in and excitement about science and  math.  Following their SSC experience, students are tracked, via  the UT Memphis Minority Student Tracking System.  Given the  continued paucity of Black youth in this local setting who elect to  pursue science and math studies, the SSC is an important step in  stimulating them to become aw are of and become interested in  careers in science and math.",
