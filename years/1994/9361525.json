The objective of the research is to fabricate and test a high-  sensitivity nanoprobe with the capability of directly determining the lateral location of atoms and  molecules on nonconducting surfaces with high spatial resolution (100nm) and very high  sensitivity in the atomole range. The nanoprobe will combine sub-picosecond laser techniques  in MPRI with focused ion beams from TOF-SIMS in surface imaging applications. During Phase  I, the development of a post-ionization ultrashort pulse laser source will be emphasized. Laser  source parameters will be optimized to boost nanoprobe sensitivity. A two to three order of  magnitude improvement in sensitivity over systems with identical spatial resolution is anticipated.  %%%  There is a clear market in surface science and biology for imaging tools with sub-micron  resolution and high chemical sensitivity.  The proposed nanoprobe complements existing  capabilities in optical and electron microscopy, provides the ability to identify chemical species  with high spatial resolution, and promises to enhance our ability to image biological surfaces.  ***",
