This program will be designed to explore technical  options for interconnection, programmatic opportunities for simultaneously reforming schools  and the education of educators, and the implications, for knowledge access and exchange,  particularly in the sciences, of deploying computer-mediated communications through the Interior  region.    Fall, 1994    The network engineer will inventory, in collaboration with district and school personnel,  districts' computing capacities, existing technology infrastructure, and potential level of  infrastructure investment.    Although all possible forms of network connection will be explored, particular attention will be  paid to the possibilities of satellite-to-cable connections for opening the Internet to these rural  sites.    Winter, 1995    Consultations and collaborative inquiry will continue, as districts clarify the extent of their  commitment - physically, financially, and programmatically - to this collaboration, and develop  action-plans for technological deployment and educational improvement.  District leaders expect  to interact with each other and UAF colleagues from the central UAF campus, as well as those  at the rural campuses through dial-up access during this planning period.    Spring 1995    Circulation of ideas and plans for development will begin the physical and programmatic  interconnection of these educators, across the educational continuum, in Fairbanks and Alaska's  rural Interior.    Progress and plans will be reported and shared externally, as well. Just as work-to-date in  extending Internet access to our K-12 colleagues has been discussed and reported in national and  international meetings (Smith, Keating and Li, 1989; Smith and Keating 1990; Keating and  Smith, 1991; Keating and S mith, 1992; and Keating, 1992), I anticipate that the special case of  rural Alaska 1) in terms of technological deployment; 2) the explicit attention to technologically  linking schools and Schools of Education for systemic school improvement and simultaneously  improving the education of educators, which goes well beyond the formal partnership envisioned  by Goodlad and colleagues to regular, real-time communication and exchange, and; 3) the  potency of this medium for improving science education through the connection of scientists and  science educators with science teachers in schools - especially rural and remote school sites -  will yield even more information about internetworked computing and communication in  education which will be reported and shared in the appropriate communities.",
