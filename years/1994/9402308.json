The study is mechanistic  and designed to elucidate the role of the seasonal cycle in  controlling the relative importance of the solubility and  biological pumps.  It explores the possibility that extreme  conditions prevailing at the end of winter, not only determine key  dynamical properties of the main thermocline- such as its  ventilation rates, temperature and salinity properties- but also  has a major effect on the rates and geographical pattern and  seasonality of the carbon flux, both across the sea surface and  through the base the mixed-layer.  The inclusion of a realistic  seasonal cycle can change these rates by as much as a factor of two  and cannot be ignored in discussions of the natural or  anthropogenic carbon cycle.    The study employs a bio-geochemical model of the carbon cycle,  driven by off-line transport parameters from a general circulation  model of the North Atlantic undergoing a seasonal cycle. A  hierarchy of experiments is proposed in which the model is  integrated separately with representations of; a passive tracer;  air-sea transfer and inorganic chemistry of carbon; nutrients and  biology. The sequence will culminate in a comprehensive experiment,  bringing all three processes together, biology, chemistry and the  dynamics as well as the effect of enhanced air-sea exchange  associated with winter storms.    The experiments are designed to identify those processes which  control the rate at which the ocean inducts carbon into its  interior in different dynamical regimes.  They are a crucial first  step towards understanding the response of the ocean to the  anthropogenic input of carbon.",
