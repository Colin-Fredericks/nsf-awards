 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the renovation of research space in the Nuclear Physics  building located on the Busch Campus of Rutgers University.  Constructed in 1963, the structure  was previously dedicated for nuclear research activities.  However nuclear research is no longer  conducted in the building, and the vacated space will become available for the Laboratory for  Surface Modification (LSM).  The LSM is a multidisciplinary laboratory composed of faculty,  postdocs, and students from five academic departments:  physics, chemistry, ceramics, materials  science and electrical engineering.  Research at the LSM focuses on advanced developments in  the science and engineering of surfaces and thin films.  Presently, individual LSM laboratories  are dispersed throughout the Physics building and five other buildings on the campus.  ARI funds  will be used for substantial renovations to laboratory space, including the installation of new  walls, partitions, and upgrading the electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems.  Moving the LSM  to this building will benefit the program by relieving overcrowding, and by providing a central  location to house individual labs and shared facilities.  The relocation will produce enhanced  focus, visibility and identification of research, fostering new opportunities for the education of  students, collaborative interactions between researchers across traditional departmental  boundaries, and for the expansion of interactions with high technology industries.",
