 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404120    Brown        The proposed project represents the first systematic  investigation of working memory in an invertebrate.  Working  memory refers to a flexible, dynamic short-term memory  system that simultaneously represents multiple, independent  items of information.  This memory has been extensively  studied in a range of vertebrate animals.  The working  memory studied in animals is generally thought to correspond  in important ways to memory systems used by humans in  manipulating information during the performance of cognitive  tasks.  Honey bees gather nectar from discrete locations  (flowers) that can be depleted during a single visit.  Thus,  it would be advantageous for bees to avoid revisits to  recently depleted food sources.  Recent data collected by  the PI provide evidence that honey bees do so in a  laboratory foraging task.  Bees deplete sugar solution from  a matrix of six locations, and tend not to revisit them  within each foraging bout ( trial).  The data demonstrate  that this ability is based on working memory.  This task  therefore provides an experimental preparation in which the  properties of working memory in honey bees can be  investigated.  This research project will begin the process  of examining working memory in honey bees.  The major goal  will be to determine the similarities and differences of bee  working memory and vertebrate working memory.  This project  will provide a much broader comparative context in which to  understand the mechanisms of working memory performance that  is currently available.  Thus, insights into the fundamental  mechanism of working memory in humans may result from the  project.",
