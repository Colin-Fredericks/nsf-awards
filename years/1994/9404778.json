 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404778  Fukushima    The potential use of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) for  measuring fluctuating parameters in two-phase flow will be  explored.  The two-phase parameters include solids and liquid  velocity fluctuations, mixture density fluctuations, diffusion  coefficients and velocity cross-correlations.  The key issue is the  reduction of the time necessary for each imaging.  Other objective  is developing techniques necessary to interpret the fluctuations  and their correlations determined by NMRI, and to define the limits  of the method.  Current optical methods are not suitable for most  liquid-solid mixture systems which are opaque, particularly in  industrial applications.  The Lovelace Institutes will provide new  equipment for the reduction of eddy currents in the magnets, which  is the main hardware requirement of the project.  The gradient  switching speed for individual measurements in the preliminary  tests has been increased by three orders of magnitude by  controlling the eddy currents.  It is expected that velocity  imaging in a two-dimensional domain could be performed in 0.05  seconds for a 64X64 mesh, which would be qualitatively superior to  previous results and would be sufficiently fast to be used for  velocity fluctuations in turbulent flows with relatively low  Reynolds number.  The experiments will be performed in a relatively  simple geometry for which there are reference data on two-phase  fluctuating parameters.  The budget covers educational type of  expenses, in collaboration with the University of Washington in  Seattle.    Advanced NMRI has application as a versatile non-destructive  measuring technique to control multiphase flow systems in chemical  manufacturing and other processing industries.  If successful, the  present project will demonstrate the feasibility of using NMRI to  a large group of two-phase flow measurements, with important impact  on advancing the science (new instrumentation, reference sets of  data for opaque multiphase system s) and technology (nonintrusive  in-situ sensors) of multiphase flow.  ***",
