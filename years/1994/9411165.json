 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the   research efforts of Professor Hussey and his graduate students on the   electrodeposition of alloys from room-temperature, chloroaluminate molten   salts.  The deposition process will be characterized using   electrochemical methods, scanning electron microscopy and light   microscopy.  Through these studies, the attendant nucleation mechanisms   for thin film growth will be characterized.  Professor Hussey will   collaborate with Dr. Gery Stafford at the National Institute of Standards   and Technology on the metallurgical aspects of this research.    This work is focussed on the synthesis and characterization of novel thin   films of metal alloys that could provide materials with enhanced   properties for a variety of technological applications.  These films are   produced by the electrodeposition of metals from aluminum containing   salts that are liquids at room temperature.  This approach should result   in alloy films with a much lower degree of contamination than was   previously possible to achieve.",
