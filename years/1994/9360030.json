 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 9360030  PI Last Name: Barnett         Technology International Incorporated (TII) shall perform  research involving a rapid prototype of a microprocessor simulation  toolkit (MSTKit) and education software for learning the  intricacies of computer processing technology.  The kit would be  developed for customization of education modules for high school  senior level up to the sophomore year at the college level, as well  as vocational training.  Powerful graphics capabilities will allow  the user access to information unattainable by emulators presented  by hardware boards or by costly software/hardware combinations.   The feasibility of the concept of developing nonexpensive, flexible  education software for learning about microprocessors will be  evaluated taking into account the availability of expensive  hardware emulators and platform-specific kits.  The feasibility of  the kit will be evaluated in terms of the capability to learn about  various microprocessors using appropriate microcomputer instruction  sets.  By creation of an environment where the computer of interest  is simulated, users will be able to write and debug a program in  the related instruction set and interactively see the inner  workings of that particular microprocessor, including timing  diagrams.  Consideration will be given to advanced optical  computing and neural computing.  Other microprocessors (real or  fictitious, that is, user-created) could be added to the kit.  ***y",
