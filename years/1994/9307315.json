 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307315  Schnabel  This project is concerned with making massively parallel MIMD  computers more usable and used by application scientists and  engineers.  It now seems clear that massively parallel, distributed  memory MIMD machines either are or soon will be the most powerful  supercomputers available, in terms of memory and speed.  So far,  however, their use by applications scientists has been seriously  hampered by the lack of easy-to-use, efficient, and portable  programming support.  It has also been hampered by the natural  reluctance of scientists and engineers to move their applications  to a new computing environment.  This proposal addressed both of  these problems, through the symbiotic development of language,  compiler, and run-time support for parallel scientific programming,  along with the development of substantial parallel scientific  applications in computational fluid dynamics and optimization.",
