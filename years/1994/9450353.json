 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450353  Parker    RCMS at the City College of the City University of New York, Phase II    In the second phase of RCMS funding, City College of the City University of New York proposes an ongoing  comprehensive effort aimed at encouraging minority students to enter research careers in engineering and  science, beginning with the recruitment of potential RCMS Scholars from City College undergraduates and  culminating in their placement in appropriate doctoral programs.  The hear of the program to shaping the next  generation of minority researchers in Phase II will continue to be a four-year multifaceted approach based on a  careful balancing of enrichment programs, research experience, academic counseling, professional counseling,  communications development, community awareness, summer internships, and graduate school counseling.    RCMS shall of course continue to draw on the resources of the many existing special programs for outstanding  students at the College, but the RCMS Scholars will continue to have many additional opportunities for academic  enrichment.  Through their involvement with faculty mentors, RCMS scholars continue to be given first-hand  experience with scientific research.  In addition, RCMS will continue to provide an environment where Scholars  can become actively involved members of a close-knit community of scholars and students from several  disciplines.  RCMS Scholars, both among themselves and along with scholars from similar program, will  participate in a number of activities that draw them together as a group, teaching and learning from one another,  as well as from the faculty, each Scholar guided and supported in a wide range of experiences that comprise his  or her apprenticeship as a prospective researcher.  Moreover, the program not only will benefit the intended  group of RCMS Scholars and increase the probability that they will pursue careers as researchers, but will also  enrich the academic experience of all students and faculty at the College.  This eff ort to recruit researchers is  envisioned as at once the hub of various special activities on campus and as a means of bringing into clearer  focus a great many key issues in the effort to increase the numbers of minority researchers in science and  engineering.    RCMS shall also continue to draw on other resources by continuing to forge collaborative relationships with  colleges, universities, research laboratories and community-based organizations.  With a highly successful  summer internship program already in place with several universities across the United States, RCMS is already  well positioned to significantly expand on the summer internship program.    RCMS, in Phase II, will maintain a steady state of 60 RCMS undergraduate scholars as well as 15 \"AMP  Affiliates\" -- New York Alliance undergraduate students transferring from community colleges to the RCMS.   The total cost of the project over a four year period will be $2,514,845, with NSF providing $1,669,663, City  College contributing $545,212, and CUNY-AMP providing $300,000 for \"AMP Affiliates,\" with $30,000 for  supplies.  RCMS will in turn provide ancillary support to all AMP students at City College consisting of  enrichment activities, counseling, mentoring, communications workshops, monthly scholars' meetings and the  like.  RCMS will also seek out additional funding.    An evaluation will be conducted to learn the extend to which the program has been successful in identifying and  fostering the development of students who go on to careers as research scientists and engineering.  This  assessment will involve direct measurement of the impact of the program upon students and learning from  mentors and other associated faculty how they view the program's accomplishments.  To these ends, pre- and  post-program evaluation instruments will be designed, applied, and analyzed.",
