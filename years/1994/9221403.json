This installation will occur in concert with the University's half million dollar renovation program for the herbarium, part of which involves the installation a climate control system, which is essential to protect the collection against infestation. The herbarium at Michigan houses one of the most important plant collections for systematic and biodiversity studies, is very active and is one of the best curated in the nation.  Because of its level of activity, collection crowding has become critical; the cost-share solution of  herbarium renovation and installation of a compactor storage system is creative, opportunistic and cost-effective.  This collection improvement will help conserve the valuable plant collection, and provide much greater access to the collection for researchers and students.  %%%  The University of Michigan Herbarium houses one of the most important research plant collections in the nation in terms of its international scope and historical depth.  It is a vital research and educational resource to professionals and students in many disciplines of biodiversity.  The support from this award will enable the herbarium to conserve its holdings, relieve severe collection crowding, and provide much better access to the collection for the user community by installing a compactor system for the herbarium cabinets.  This installation will occur in combination with the University's refurbishment of the herbarium area and installation of climate control facilities.  ***",
