 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451321  Seeber  The goal of this project is to provide students with a broad array  of experiences and learning activities that will prepare them for  employment in the Fiber Optics field. One of the basic  characteristics of technical education curricula is its ability to  respond to rapidly changing technology. New developments must be  incorporated into the curriculum so that graduates of these  programs can compete for jobs and meet not only the present needs  but also the future needs of their employers.  Key to this success  is the acquisition of equipment for the development of a long  wavelength (850 to 1550 nm) fiber-optic advanced laboratory for  communication and power transmission. Long fiber-optic wavelengths  are extremely important to study because of recent discoveries and  advances made in fiber-optic communications. The long fiber-optic  equipment in the near infra-red range and beyond will permit  students to make comparisons to other popular wavelengths now in  use.  The development of a long wavelength advanced fiber-optic  laboratory will assure that fiber-optic graduates will be properly  prepared for immediate employment now and in the foreseeable  future.  Long wave fiber-optic systems are now being studied by a  number of universities and communications industries, i.e. A.T. &  T., for the development of a global highway.",
