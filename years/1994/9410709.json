 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kopelman  The novel methods of near-field-optics (NFO) present an opportunity  for spatial superresolution in optical and spectroscopic  measurements. Visible light imaging and probing of single molecules  has become a reality. The recent work is utilized towards the  following aims: 1) Characterization of interfacial domains in  molecular nanostructures, using ultra-fast near-field optical  imaging and nanospectroscopy as well as tip-to-single-molecule  energy transfer (Forster-Dexter) and spin-orbit coupling (Kasha),  ultimately measuring individual molecule matrix elements. 2)  Development and study of ordered single supermolecule light and  energy antenna and their utilization as scanning optical probes, to  be used towards the above aims. 3) An experimental study of the  enigmatic light-matter interactions in the near-field-optics  domain, with applications to the above nano-domain and single  molecule studies. 4) Utilization of our molecularly engineered,  optically active and photostable, ordered supermolecule for the  production of a new, higher efficiency light emitting diode (LED).   %%%  We have recently developed new optical nano-probes and nano-imaging  techniques. These are particularly appropriate for mesoscopic or  submicroscopic optical studies. The proposed research is  committed  to both the further development of these techniques and to their  utilization for the study of basic problems: excitations at  interfaces and nanostructures, molecular aggregates and even single  molecules. The techniques combine time-resolved spectroscopy,  near-field optical microscopy, scanning force microscopy and  nanofabrication. The goals are to solve some long-standing basic  problems of excitation dynamics as well as some newly emerging  questions on the interaction of light and matter in the near field  and on kinetic processes involving nanosystems and single  molecules. Ultimately, these studies are of major interest to  biology, medicine, chemistry and materials science.",
