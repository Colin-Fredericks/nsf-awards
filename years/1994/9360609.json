This project brings in theoretical and  experimental expertise in structural dynamics and experience  in vibration sensors to study innovative slope mode and  modal energy transfer sensors and measuring systems that  could make structural behavior evaluation and health  monitoring more feasible and accurate.    The ultimate goal is to develop a series of slope  accelerometers, which are not yet available commercially,  based on a newly developed complex energy theory.  The  objective in phase one is to develop the accelerometers and  calibration systems, to examine methods for modal energy  measurements to perform the vibration signature analysis for  medium size structures.    The methodology and transducers considered in this project  may have a significant impact in structural measurements and  applications in transducer industries, bridge and large  civil engineering structure inspections.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***",
