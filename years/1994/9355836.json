SuperQuest, an NSF  funded program, was designed to bring computational tools and  techniques to high school students and their teachers, with an  ultimate goal of incorporating computational science into the high  school curriculum.  To date, SuperQuest has involved a national  competition, wherein teams of students and their teacher-coaches  propose computational science or mathematics problems to  investigate.  The winning teams are selected by a national review  committee.  Winners attend three-week summer institutes at one of  four SuperQuest Centers, where they learn how to use high-  performance computing and visualization to solve their scientific  problems.  The winners' high schools receive workstations and  communications links to the internet.  The early success and  enthusiasm of these teams has sparked interest in moving SuperQuest  toward the next phase in its evolution - to provide broad-based  instruction and guidance to educators nationwide in how to  integrate computational tools and techniques into secondary science  and mathematics curricula.    The Cornell Theory Center seeks support from the NSF to conduct a  detailed, systematic external evaluation of the SuperQuest program  to assess and understand the impact of the program on the high  schools and to establish long-term directions and goals as the  program evolves to foster secondary school computational science  education.  The Cornell Theory Center will contract with the Center  for Technology in Education to conduct this evaluation in  cooperation with the SuperQuest project director.  Specifically,  the evaluation will answer the following questions:         What is the range of models for implementing SuperQuest       activities in the schools that have participated in the       program?       What has been the impact of S uperQuest participation within       the different schools on the students, the teachers, and the       curriculum and learning environment?       What can be learned in general about how advanced computing       resources are most effectively and efficiently made available,       supported, and used in schools?       What kinds of professional development experiences are       required for teachers to use computational resources well?       What kinds of outreach took place to the broader community?       Among the non-winning schools, were there any lasting       consequences of the application process?       What kinds of information sources do schools who apply to the       SuperQuest program use?",
