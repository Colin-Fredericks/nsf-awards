It is a study of the  influences  on   the  way  in  which  parents  and  teachers  communicate  in  discussing child performance in school.  The research will  focus  on  scheduled conferences between African-American, Hispanic, and  Anglo  mothers and kindergarten teachers.  Through a  combination  of  participant  observation  in the  school  setting,  discourse  analysis  of  videotapes of the parent-teacher  conferences,  and  interviews with both parents and teachers before and after  these  conferences,  the  researcher will test ideas about  the  way  in  which pre-existing mental schema and variable power differentials  influence  how  effectively parents and teachers understand  each  other.       Previous research has indicated that parental involvement in  school  has  an  influence  on the school  performance  of  their  children.   However,  there  are a number  of  barriers  to  such  involvement,  and difficulties communicating with teachers  is  a  central  barrier.   Through systematic study of  the  process  of  communication  between parents and teachers,  this  project  will  help  us  understand  these  communication  barriers  better  and  provide  advice about how parent-teacher communications could  be  improved.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved  by  the   research,  this  award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student  in  completing  research  for  the   Ph.   D.  dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social scientists.  ***",
