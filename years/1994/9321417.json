 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321417  Shklovskii  This theoretical project will build a qualitative theory of the  quantum Hall effect including such characteristics as the widths of  the diagonal conductivity peaks and the depths of the corresponding  minima.  The basis for this work is the generally accepted idea  that the localization length diverges only at some isolated values  of the filling factor.  Thus, at almost all other filling factors  the low temperature conductivity is determined by hopping.  In the  present work the steps of the Hall conductivity will be studied.   The hopping corrections to the quantized values at the plateaus  will be calculated.  The prefactor of the hopping conductivity,  which is necessary for an understanding of the universal shapes and  heights of the peaks, will be investigated.  This approach will be  extended to the fractional quantum Hall effect including a theory  of hopping transport of fractional excitations.  %%%  The theoretical research will study the properties of the two-  dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field  - a subject for which the Nobel prize was awarded a number of years  ago.  This Quantum Hall Effect has presented physicists with an  exciting new state of matter which is not yet fully understood.   The present research will explore a number of properties of the  Quantum Hall Effect by taking a different approach (hopping  conductivity) than others and for which the principal investigator  is an international expert.  ***",
