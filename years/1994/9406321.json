 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kyte  9406321  The topology and functionally important conformational changes of  acetylcholine receptor and anion carrier, two proteins in the  plasma membranes of animal cells, will be examined with protein  chemical and immunochemical techniques.  Sealed right-side-out  vesicles or intact cells will be used to determine on which side of  the plasma membrane particular amino acids with reagents impermeant  to the vesicles or the cells will be established by isolating  peptides containing the modified amino acids by immunoadsorbents.   Changes in the rate of modification of particular amino acids in  anion carrier by neutral or charged electrophiles will be followed  by isolating modified peptides by immunoadsorption.  These results  will implicate particular locations in this protein in functionally  important structural changes.   The topology of acetylcholine  receptor will be correlated with recent high resolution structures  of the protein.  Both the topology of the protein and the  conformational changes involved in the coupled anion transport  catalyzed by anion carrier from erythrocytes will be related to the  mechanism of its catalysis.  In addition to being structurally interesting, these two proteins  are of central importance to several physiological processes.   Acetylcholine receptor transforms the neural action potential into  muscular action potential at the synapse.  Anion carrier is  responsible for the bicarbonate transport across the plasma  membrane of the of the erythrocyte which permits efficient transfer  of bicarbonate from peripheral tissue to the lungs.  %%%  The plasma membrane is a thin bag that encloses the living  cytoplasm of a cell.  This bag protects the cytoplasm from the  unexpected changes that occur on the outside of the cell, much as  our skin contains and protects us.  The passage of chemicals across  the plasma membrane is carefully controlled.  This control is  enforced by proteins that are embedded in the plasma membrane.   Each of these proteins acts  as a gatekeeper opening and closing to  permit particular molecules to pass through the membrane at  specific times.  We are studying a protein that is the gatekeeper  for sodium and potassium ions and a protein that the gatekeeper for  chloride and bicarbonate ions.  The first protein is located on  muscle cells and remains closed until a nerve cell and potassium to  flow out, an event that causes the muscle cell to contract.  The  second protein is located on red blood cells and allows the cells  to pick up bicarbonate in the muscles and transfer it to the lungs  where it becomes carbon dioxide.  We are studying the design of  these proteins that permits them to perform these roles that are  essential to the function of muscles and of the blood.  ***",
