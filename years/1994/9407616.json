 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407216  Smith    Embryonic development in marsupial and placental mammals differs  in a number of ways, one of the most important being that  marsupials are born at an essentially embryonic stage. In  previous studies, the PI has examined the morphological  consequences of this pattern, with focus on what morphological  adaptations allow marsupials to survive at such a premature  level. In these previous studies a number of hypotheses about  significant differences in the way marsupial and placental  mammals develop were presented. In the current study some of  these hypotheses will be tested. These are three specific aims.    Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the growth and  differentiation of the brain controls or constrains the  development of neurocranial skeletal tissues. To this end the  interface and interaction between neural and skeletal tissues  will be examined in detail in a variety of morphological ways.    Specific aims 2 will examine the differentiation of cranial  skeletal tissues at a molecular level. A number of extracellular  matrix proteins as well as bone specific molecules are important  in  accumulation of these molecules will be examined using in  situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. This study will  provide information on the mechanisms of bone formation.    Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that patterns of  development observed in previously studied systems are  characteristic for other placental and marsupial mammals with  broad-based comparative studies of development in a variety of  mammals. This study will provide information on the variation in  the ways that the skull can develop in mammals.    This project  is expected to provide basic data on the  interaction of tissues during embryonic development and on the  constraints that these interactions place on the evolutionary  diversification of the skull in mammals.  ***",
