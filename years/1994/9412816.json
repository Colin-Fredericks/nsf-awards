 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412816  Abstract  The bacterium E. coli provides a good model system for the study of  genetic recombination.  The ease with which it is maintained and  genetically manipulated has allowed the isolation and analysis of  a large number of recombination deficient mutants and the  subsequent identification and analysis of the genes and respective  gene products.  Many of the genes involved in homologous  recombination are also required for some aspect of DNA repair.   There are at least three distinct recombination pathways termed  RecBCD, RecE, and RecF which differ from each other with respect to  the gene product(s) required.  Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways  function in wild type cells, and both are believed to require the  recA gene product.  At least twelve additional recombination genes  are involved in some aspect of RecF pathway recombination, yet very  little is known about the interaction between the RecF pathway gene  products and how they function together in recombination.  All RecF  pathway mediated recombination requires the recO and recR gene  products.  In addition, both gene products are essential for DNA  repair following UV irradiation or mitomycin C exposure.  Purified  RecO protein shares some biochemical activities with RecA protein  including D-loop formation, and RecO can substitute for RecA in  vivo, suggesting that the two proteins are functionally similar.   The goal of this research is to further investigate the function of  RecO protein in vivo, and to identify and characterize the  biochemical properties associated with RecO in vitro that are  relevant to RecO function in recombination and DNA repair.  ***  One aspect of DNA metabolism that is not well characterized at the  molecular level is general recombination.  Recombination mechanisms  are essential to generate genetic diversity, to maintain cell  viability after DNA damage, and to accurately segregate chromosomes  during meiosis.  %%%",
