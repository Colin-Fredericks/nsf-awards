This information is made available to  about 20,000 researchers, teachers, and students through the  biennial publication of the \"Review of  Particle Properties\" and  the \"Particle Properties Data Booklet.\" The Center and its  collaborators also produces other compilations of value, \"Current  Experiments in Elementary Particle Physics,\" and \"Guide to  Experimental Elementary Particle Physics Literature.\" The Center  provides computer network access to its databases via the SLAC-  SPIRES system and other more modern public interfaces to its  databases.  The Center is also involved in the Contemporary  Physics Education Project, which has developed educational  materials such as a wall chart, teacher activity packet, and  computer software on \"Fundamental Particles and Interactions,\"  and it has been involved in other activities such as the ICFA  Review of Detector Properties and a pilot project, the AIP  Physics Data Diskette.  The Center's scientific staff are also  active in current theoretical and experimental high energy  physics research and in teaching at the University of California  at Berkeley.  ***",
