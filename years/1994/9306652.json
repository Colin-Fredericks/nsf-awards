 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306652  Hand    This work will investigate how certain cells and tissues are able  to survive long periods of time in dormant state, where energy  metabolism and development are shutdown. Shrimp embryos (Artemia  franciscana)are the focus of the outlined experiments, because  their remarkable capacity to survive dormancy for months and even  years is well known.    For any dormant state, there are two problems that must be solved  if an organisms is to tolerate bouts of quiescence. First, there  must be a coordinated suppression of both energy use and energy  production. Second, the integrity of macromolecules must be  preserved during this period when little energy is available for  their replacement or repair. Previous work with these embryos  suggests that one cellular signal may be involved in mediating  both of these phenomena.    The first goal of the work is to explain how an energy consuming  process like the synthesis of protein is indeed shutdown. The  relative effect of limiting the copies of message (i.e.,  messenger RNA) that direct the cell to synthesize proteins,  versus actually inhibiting the machinery itself (ribosomes) that  builds the proteins will be compared. Finally, since synthesis is  in some way suppressed during dormancy, then the rate of protein  degradation must also be arrested in order to avoid depletion of  macromolecules. Therefore, the second aim is to understand how  degradation of protein (a normal process in an active cell)is  reduced.    Explaining how proteins are preserved during dormancy (in effect,  placed into suspended animation) should provide insights that  will be useful for other biological systems where survival  depends on successful recovery from physical and chemical  insults. The mechanisms by which cells can withstand long bouts  of quiescence are apt to have important implications for numerous  cases where metabolism is unavoidably suppressed or disrupted--  organ tissue transplantation, acute blockage of blood flow to  tissues, and oxygen  deprivation.  ***",
