 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314349  LUTHER    The concentration of trace metals in anoxic and sulfidic  environments is controlled by the precipitation of metal sulfide  phases as well as the complexation of the metals by sulfide and  other sulfur species.  Stability constants of a variety  of metals  of environmental significance with sulfide, thiosulfate and  polysulfides will be determined.  The constants will be obtained by  voltammetric methods using the peaks of the sulfur species and/or  the metal.  The research also requires titrations of the complexes  with acid and base to determine the number of protons attached to  the sulfur species. This work will build on initial work in  seawater which shows that iron (II) and sulfide form two complexes  which are Fe(SH)+ (log B=5.5) and Fe2(SH)3+ (log B= 11.1).  These   constants are orders of magnitude higher than constants evaluated  by linear free energy relationships.  In fact, Fe2(SH)3+ was not  predicted by this or any experimental approach which uses sulfide  as a titrant.  Thus, Fe(II) solubility at anoxic interfaces and in  sulfidic environments can be enhanced over previous estimates.",
