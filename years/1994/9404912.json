 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friedman         Homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, also referred as  connecting orbits, are orbits of infinite period connecting fixed  points of a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations.  Appearance and disappearance of a homoclinic orbit can lead to  creation or destruction of periodic orbits.  Bifurcations of  codimension 2 of homoclinic orbits can play the role of organizing  centers for the interesting dynamics.  Existence of a structurally  unstable connecting orbit can lead to bifurcations associated with  the birth or death of a strange attractor.  Connecting orbits often  arise as traveling wave solutions of parabolic and hyperbolic  PDEs.  Recently Doedel and the investigator developed and analyzed  an accurate, robust, and systematic method for computing branches  of connecting orbits in the case that the solution approaches the  equilibria exponentially as well as in the case of center  manifolds, and considered some applications.  The investigator  extends these results in several directions: 1) Generalizing the  algorithm for locating starting connecting orbits, 2) Improving  detection of bifurcations on a branch and selecting specific  branches, 3) Locating multi-hump homoclinic orbits. 4) Qualitative  global error analysis of orbits for the discretized problem and  Adaptive choice of the truncating interval using a posteriori  error estimates, 5) Computation of connecting orbits in a Banach  space.  Applications include: The completion of the investigation  of the bifurcations of connecting orbits in the sine-Gordon  equation and the Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley equations.  Bifurcations of  traveling wave solutions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations and its  generalization: a heteroclinic loop bifurcation, searching for  twisting points.  Computational investigation of orbits homoclinic  to resonance bands.  Bifurcations of connecting orbits in an  electronic circuit.  Bifurcation curves in dynamical systems with  discrete time.  Bifurcation of heteroclinic orbits in a Bana ch  space, with applications  to the phase field model of  solidification phenomena.       Connecting orbits are of special significance in a variety of  applications.  They have been shown to underlie the phenomena of  intermittency in fluid mechanics, \"bursting\" phenomena in  mathematical biology, chaotic behavior of electrical circuits,  chaotic behavior of lasers as well as light pulses in fiber optics  applications, chaotic behavior in structural mechanics and in a  variety of  chemical reactions.  The need is therefore paramount  for the development of software for global analysis of connecting  orbits.  The investigator extends the results obtained under prior  NSF support on development of robust numerical algorithms for  global analysis of connecting orbits and incorporates the  resulting algorithms into AUTO, a well known continuation computer  program,  to make them more accessible to a wider scientific  community.  The investigator also considers various applications  that are of independent interest, and that will also be used to  test and refine the developed algorithms.  The final goal is to  create an integrated interactive system that incorporates various  starting procedures and continuation methods.",
