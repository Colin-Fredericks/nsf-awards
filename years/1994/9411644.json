Kelly.  The research project of this student involves utilizing morphological and molecular data in a phylogenetic analysis or study of relationships among species groups in the genus Asarum and among Asarum and the five other genera that constitute the plant family Aristolochiaceae.  This family is understood to be the plant group most closely related to the monocots, the grasses, bamboos, lilies, etc..  This study will clarify relationships among major lineages, begin work on a full species-level treatment or monograph of the genus Asarum which includes approximately 80 species.  The phylogeny or pattern of relationships derived from these studies will be used to test hypotheses concerning the associations of swallowtail butterflies with these plants relative to their production of certain plant acids and modifications adapting these plants to pollination by fungus gnats.  %%%   This study will clarify relationships among members of a very interesting group of plants and test predictions about certain members and their biological associations with swallowtail butterflies.  Support for the training of graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.  ***",
