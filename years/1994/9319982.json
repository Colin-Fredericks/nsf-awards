 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for work to formally specify and then implement a  modular, extensible backend engineering database supporting data  translation between an open-ended set of applications.  The unique  features of the data model and its prototype implementation are:  (1) dynamic extensibility, allowing new applications to be added    throughout the process of design, and later throughout the    product life cycle, with expectations that new applications  interfaces can be implemented by users, not database  administrators, (2) support for the iterative nature of design, in  the form of explicit monitoring and management of partial  integrity, (3) a richer data model tailored to the needs of  engineering design,   reducing the impedance mismatch between the  current functionality of advanced CAD systems and current  databases. (4)  a new model of translation between applications,  that does not rely on a neutral file approach, but rather treats  translation as a set of transformations over a type network.  The concepts supporting these capabilities will be developed and  formalized.  The prototype implementation will be general,  supporting a variety of engineering design areas.  Applications to  be tested on top of the database will be drawn from civil and  mechanical engineering design research literature.  The prototype  implementation will be developed to be easily portable, and made  available to other research groups.",
