 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452615  Mahdi  The University of Texas Pan-American (UTPA) has applied to the  Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) to expand from  the 2 year Pre-Engineering program to 4 year Baccalaureate programs  in Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering. The  application was approved by THECB on April 24, 1992. This proposal  is for the development of an undergraduate laboratory in heat  transfer to support the Mechanical Engineering Program. The  proposed grant will provide the financial resources in order to  purchase the following equipment: 1) conduction heat transfer  apparatuses, to investigate conduction in solids, 2) 6-pass heat  exchangers, to determine the heat transfer characteristics of heat  exchangers under various flow conditions, 3) temperature measuring  units, to investigate the characteristics of several temperature  measuring devices, 4) boiling heat transfer units, to study the  different modes of boiling, 5) bench top cooling towers, to  investigate their operation 6) thermal radiation units, to  investigate the laws of thermal radiation and 7) convection heat  transfer units, to study free and forced convection. The proposed  laboratory will be an integral part of the MECE 3360/MECE 3160 Heat  Transfer course which is required for all mechanical engineering  majors. The laboratory will illustrate/reinforce the concepts  covered in class. Its main emphasis and effort will be placed on  gaining information from the experiments, experiencing the trials  and tribulations of experimentation and not simply demonstrate  physical principles.",
