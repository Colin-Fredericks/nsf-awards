 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seed germination is a critical phase in the plant life  cycle, both ecologically and agriculturally, and is  sensitive to both endogenous hormones and environmental  factors.  Seeds integrate physiological and environmental  information to determine whether to germinate or remain  dormant.  Two important physiological regulators of  germination are gibberellin (GA), which generally promotes  germination, and abscisic acid (ABA), an inhibitor of  germination.  A key environmental determination of  germination behavior is the availability of water, since  radicle emergence requires water uptake and cell expansion.  Single-gene mutations in tomato which block synthesis of  either GA or ABA result in contrasting effects on dormancy,  germination rates, and sensitivity to reduced water  availability.  These mutants have been used in combination  with hormonal application to demonstrate that the regulation  of germination occurs via alterations in the water potential  threshold, allowing radicle emergence.  A quantitative  mathematical model has been developed that can describe the  responses of seed germination to the plant growth regulators  GA and ABA and to the seed water potential.  A key feature  of this is the recognition that individual seeds vary in  their threshold responses to GA, ABA, and water potential.  The sensitivity thresholds for tomato seed germination are  determined by the mechanical resistance of a thin endosperm  layer to penetration by the radicle.  When stimulated to  germinate, the walls of these endosperm cap cells are  degraded and weakened, allowing radicle emergence.  Multiple  factors are likely to be required for successful completion  of germination, with their combined influence setting the  sensitivity threshold for a given seed.  The goal of this  project is to determine whether the transition from  quiescence or dormancy to germination is associated with  specific changes in gene expression.  The effects of GA and  ABA on mRNA populations in mutant tomato endosper m caps will  be visualized by a differential display reverse  transcription PCR technique.  Imbibed wild type seeds will  also be sorted into dormant and nondormant categories prior  to visible germination using a single seed assay.  The mRNAs  expressed in the endosperm caps of the two categories will  be similarly displayed.  Messages that are consistently  associated with either dormancy or germination in all  comparisons will be evaluated by RNA blot and in situ  hybridization to determine whether their abundance, timing  and tissue location are regulated by GA, ABA, and water  potential as expected.  Expression of selected genes under a  range of hormonal and environmental conditions will be  investigated in single seeds using tissue printing to  determine whether they are regulated among seeds within a  population in keeping with the predictions of the threshold  models.  This approach will distinguish genes involved in  the regulation of radicle emergence from those that are  associated with post-germinative events such as reserve  mobilization.  Characterization of the function of these  genes and their promoters will provide insight into how  plants integrate multiple internal and environmental signals  to control a critical developmental process.",
