 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453810  White    The Lawrence Hall of Science will develop a 3000 sq. ft.  traveling interactive chemistry exhibit  in which visitors will  conduct a variety of basic chemical tests within the motivational  genre of solving a mystery.  Chem-Mystery will invite visitors  into an Old House facade where two non-violent mysteries have  occurred.  Visitors will chose a mystery (either the case of the  missing toy boat for youngsters or the case of the missing money  for older children and adults) to solve.  After learning the  facts surrounding the case from videos of the chief detective and  the suspects, visitors will collect evidence from the scene of  the mystery and then proceed to the Forensics Laboratory.  The  Lab will contain 15 hands-on stations where visitors explore  fundamental chemistry concepts while using chemistry as a tool to  analyze clues.  Complementary educational materials will be  developed.  A 20 page Going Further Guide will contain activities  that can be done at home using techniques introduced in the  exhibit.  Teacher workshops will be held to introduce teachers to  concepts in the exhibit and methods on how to incorporate the  exhibit activities in their curricular agenda.  These materials  plus other general set-up information will be included in an  Exhibit Installation Handbook.  After opening to the public at  the LHS in January 1996, it will begin its tour in October, 1996  to nine US science centers.  It has the potential of reaching  about 800,000 people during the twenty-seven month tour.  The  exhibit design will be reviewed for universal accessibility.  It  will be produced by the staff of the Lawrence Hall of Science and  circulated by ASTC.  ***",
