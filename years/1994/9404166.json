 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  will  establish an Electron Spin  Resonance  (ESR)  laboratory  at  the University of California in LosAngeles  which  will  be  used  by  faculty from UCLA, UCSB, Los Alamos  National  Laboratory, Columbia University, Georgia Institute of Technology,  and  industrial staff.  This laboratory will be the only  one  of  its kind in the United States and has two goals.    First,  to conduct research in some of the most recent  areas  of  solid state physics, emerging under the name of nanocrystals, the  most  prominent examples being the fullerene (e.g. C60 and higher  homolog)  compounds. The common character of these  materials  is  that an intermediate length scale (nanometers) occurs, leading to  a spatial segregation of the different strength interactions. The  various  spin  state  nanostructures are expected  to  result  in  richer  ESR  signals  than in simple, bulk materials  because  of  weakness of the interstructure couplings. Pulsed ESR provides the  necessary sophisticated means to separate and identify the nature  of the different  spin states.    Secondly, to expand the range of applications of time domain  ESR  spectroscopy.  UCLA faculty intend to work in close collaboration  with  industry  regarding  technical developments,  in  order  to  maintain  the  spectrometer's integrity. The aim is to  implement  the  technical changes in parallel in the laboratory and  in  the  industrial research facility in a way which is suitable not  only  to  specific  daily  research needs but for the  widest  possible  range of applications and for production of industry as well. The  personal contacts, from the production line to the management  of  the industrial sponsor, and the understanding of their capacities  and  interest,  provide an unique opportunity  for  an  exemplary  collaboration,   a  mutually  beneficial  two  sided   technology  transfer  process between UCLA and industry, while maintaining  a  state-of-the-art, growing laboratory at UCLA over an extended  perio d of time.         The presence of the laboratory at UCLA will enhance research  potential  in different areas as well, such as organic  chemistry  and  biochemistry.  Over the first five  years  an  estimated  15  graduate  student will acquire experience with the technique  and  will learn to exploit the potentials of time domain ESR.",
