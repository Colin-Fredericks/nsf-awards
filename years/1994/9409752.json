 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409752  Narasimhan  This investigation addresses the Sparse Geometric Spanner problem  and its many variants.  Given a graph G and t1, a t-spanner is an  edge subgraph G' of G such that the distances between every pair  of vertices in G' are within a factor of t of their distances in  G.  Geometric graphs have vertices corresponding to points in the  Euclidean space and their edge weights correspond to Euclidean  distances.  Many practical applications require sparse geometric  spanners.  Sparseness is measured in terms of size (number of  edges), and/or weight (sum of weights of edges).    Various aspects of the problem will be studied:  How to construct  sparse spanners (algorithms)?  How to analyze quality of the  output (geometric analysis)?  What is the complexity of the  problem (complexity and approximability)?  How to design  efficient algorithms (practical implementations)?  The study of  variants of the problem including connectivity-constrained  spanners and single-source spanners will also be undertaken.  This has applications in analyzing the performance of many  practical geometric algorithms and studying optimal geometric  structures like minimum steiner trees, optimal spanners, and  optimal triangulations.  ***",
