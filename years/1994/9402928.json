The  purpose of the research is to study quasilinear problems, with  the goal of establishing global results about the solution  structures of such problems, with emphasis on the development of  a bifurcation theory.    Problems with nonlinear partial differential equations of  elliptic type which are parameter dependent and subject to  nonlinear constraints arise in a multitude of applied areas, such  as the study of porous media, plasma problems, and astrophysics.   The theory of quasilinear equations is just now being developed,  and an understanding of the bifurcation possibilities is an  important aspect that needs to be studied.  Both researchers are  considered experts in the field, and their collaboration could  result in a major contribution to this area.              ***",
