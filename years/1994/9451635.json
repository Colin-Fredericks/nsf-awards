The database links digital images of hand  specimens and thin sections with relevant observations from other  techniques, models of physical and chemical processes, and tectonic  setting.  A student using the database as a self-study guide  becomes empowered by determining the agenda for his or her learning  session within the context of a specific course, and thus is an  active problem-solver and not a passive recipient of information.   At the center of the database metastructure is the \"Image  Database.\"  It consists of a set of digital images of hand  specimens and thin sections for each of the minerals and rocks,  which now form the teaching collection used in the 4 core  laboratories.  Every image in the Image Database is multiply linked  and selectable from a dialog box offering the following options:   1) other images of hand specimens of related rock types; 2) other  examples of the same mineral in different rocks; and 3) additional  images of photomicrographs of other primary mineralogical  constituents of a rock.  Links are recursive, i.e. once a mineral  is selected from option (3), the user can explore all the images  linked to it, and in turn all their mineralogical constituents.   Text, such as brief descriptions of terms normally used to describe  the selected mineral or rock, tabulated chemical data, and  graphics, including mineral structures or rock classification  diagrams, also are linked to the images.  Introduction of the image  database of rocks and minerals organized around a conceptual  framework based on Earth System Science and plate tectonics  improves our teaching effectiveness by allowing students greater  control in the learning  process.  Increased computer literacy among  our students is an additional benefit.",
