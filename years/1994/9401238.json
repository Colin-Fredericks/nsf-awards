 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, is  concerned with elucidation of the mechanisms of excited state relaxation in square planar, four-  coordinate complexes of platinum(II) and copper(II).  The work is based upon earlier  observations that the lifetimes of excited states of such compounds are strongly affected by  secondary interactions of the complexes with their environments.  As a result they have potential  as molecular probes and sensors.  Specific studies will include characterization of the  photochemistry of platinum(II) terpyridine and copper(II) porphyrin complexes both in fluid  media and intercalated into DNA, and attempts to increase the excited state lifetimes of the  former complexes by modification of the terpyridine ligand through substitution.  Techniques  to be employed will include luminescence, absorption and CD spectroscopies in conjunction with  quenching reactions and temperature dependent measurements.    Absorption of electromagnetic radiation generates excited electronic states that may revert (relax)  to the ground state by non-irradiative (heat generating) or irradiative (emission of light)  pathways.  A great deal of information can be obtained about the electronic structure of  compounds that undergo irradiative relaxation by studies of their emission spectra.  Irradiative  relaxation can be highly dependent upon the environment in which the molecule resides and  under favorable circumstances the observation of an emission spectrum can be used as a probe  of the molecular environment.  This project has as its major objective the development of a  better understanding of the ways in which relaxation of excited states of certain transition metal  compounds occur and how these are determined by the molecular environment.  There are many  potential applications in a number of areas including photosensors, photodynamic cancer therapy,  and molecular electronics.",
