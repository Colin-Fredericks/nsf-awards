 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central step in flower development is the decision of a  group of undifferentiated cells to adopt a floral fate.  A  key role in this process is played by the LEAFY gene, whose  activity is required to promote floral over shoot  development.  This investigator has cloned the LEAFY gene  from Arabidopsis and shown that it encodes a novel type of  nuclear protein, which is the earliest known gene product to  be activated in nascent flower primordia.  He proposes to  study in detail how LEAFY controls floral fate by  elucidating how LEAFY protein exerts its function at the  molecular level, and by dissecting the cis-regulatory  elements of the LEAFY promoter.  Since LEAFY encodes a  nuclear protein, it will be determined whether it encodes a  novel type of transcriptional regulator.  The protein  contains two domains with similarity to transcriptional  activation domains of known transcriptional regulators.  The  in vivo activity of these domains will be determined by  introducing in vitro engineered deletion variants of LEAFY  into transgenic plants and testing these constructs for  complementation of leafy mutations.  The possibility that  LEAFY acts as a novel type of DNA-binding protein will be  explored by testing in vitro synthesized LEAFY protein for  its ability to bind DNA.  In addition, the molecular  interaction of LEAFY with other proteins known to have a  role in floral development will be studied.  In the future,  new proteins will be isolated based on their ability to bind  LEAFY protein in vitro.  Cis-acting elements mediating the  temporal and spatial control of LEAFY expression will be  identified by three strategies:  First, constructs  containing combinations of 5' and 3' sequences as well as  intron sequences fused to a LEAFY cDNA will be tested for  complementation of the lfy mutant phenotype in transgenic  plants.  Second, the promoter sequence of the LEAFY cognate  homolog from snapdragon, FLORICAULA, will be compared to  that of the LEAFY promoter, in order to identify co nserved  sequence elements.  Third, various parts of the 5.4 kb  fragment, including 5' and 3' as well as intron sequences,  will be tested in transgenic plants for their effects on the  expression of a reporter gene.  The analysis of LEAFY  regulatory sequences with reporter gene constructs will be  complemented by studying whether expression of LEAFY under  the control of two floral specific promoters, those of the  two floral control genes APETALA1 and AGAMOUS, can  completely or partially complement the leafy mutant  phenotype.  These experiments will allow for assessing  whether the early expression of LEAFY, which is activated  before APETALA1 and AGAMOUS, is indeed required for its in  vivo function.  The proposed research will further our  understanding of how flowers are initiated, and will be an  important step toward the ultimate goal of achieving a  mechanistic understanding of this process.  In the future,  this will permit for directed manipulation of flowering not  only in model systems such as Arabidopsis, but also in  other, economically important flowering plants.  This should  lead to improved partitioning of photoassimilates between  reproductive and vegetative organs, and thus to better crop  yields.",
