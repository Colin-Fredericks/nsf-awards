 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matching funds are provided for the purchase of a state-of-  the-art x-ray fluorescence spectrometer to be used in  support of research in the areas of materials and minerals  at Michigan Technological University. Primary users will be  faculty and graduate students from the Department of  Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, with significant  use also from the Department of Geological Engineering,  Geology and Geophysics. Research programs in the materials  area requiring the new spectrometer include studies of:  structure-property-composition relationships in  intermetallics, austempered ductile irons, and mechanically  alloyed materials; macrosegregation in castings;  microstructural development in multi-component oxide  systems; means of minimizing hexavalent chromium effects in  steelmaking refractories; parameters for powder forging low  alloy steels; compositional effects in grain boundary  segregation; and welding electrode wear mechanisms. Programs  in geology that would use the new instrument include studies  of: volcanic ash and rock; paleomagnetic effects in rocks  and sediments; techniques of enhanced petroleum recovery;  ground water effects related to fluid flow in porous media  and remediation strategies; and the Precambrian rocks in the  Lake Superior basin. The new instrument would replace a 16-  year-old spectrometer in the x-ray analytical facility at  the University. The old instrument, which has been used  heavily by a large number of users, is no longer reliable,  and is inadequate for current and future projects requiring  analyses of a large number of samples with greater  precision, accuracy, and much lower detection levels.",
