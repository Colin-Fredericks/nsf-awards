 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404718  DORN       Alluvial fans are semi-conical landforms comprised of stream  deposits and debris-flow materials.  Alluvial fans generally form  where canyons exit mountain ranges.  Although fans may be found  in other environments, they usually are associated with drylands.  Although considerable attention has focused on the processes that  produce alluvial fans, full understanding has not yet been  achieved regarding the ways that different environmental factors  influence their development.  Both tectonic and climatic forces  have been identified as playing important roles, although  research has been inconclusive regarding which are the most  important factors, how the influences of different factors can be  identified and distinguished from each other.  This doctoral  dissertation research project will focus on analyses of varnish  layering from rocks gathered in selected sites on alluvial fans  in Death Valley, California.  The layers in rock varnish, which  are analogous to stratigraphic deposits, will be analyzed through  the use of high-powered light microscopes, back-scatter electron  microscopes, and electron microprobes in order to correlate and  date the timing of events producing the varnishes.  Once  calibrated, information from these analyses will be used to  record paleoclimate changes in Death Valley as well as to  associate different fans in the area.  Spatial generalization of  this information will be undertaken using data from the SPOT and  Landsat TM satellites.       This research will make a number of important contributions.  It will add to knowledge of the degree to which climatic and  tectonic factors affect alluvial fan development.  It will make  methodological contributions by establishing interpretation of  rock-varnish layering as a tool for correlating alluvial fans.  The project will yield a new rock-varnish record of paleoclimatic  changes for the Death Valley region, and it will result in a map  of Quaternary alluvial fans in the region.  As a doctoral  d issertation improvement award, this award also will provide  support to enable a promising student to establish a strong  independent research career.",
