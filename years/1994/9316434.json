 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316434  Furilla      Blood passing through the lungs of air-breathing animals picks up  oxygen and eliminates carbon dioxide on inspiration when fresh  air enters the lung, but not on expiration.  This process leads  to rhythmic oscillations in the level of oxygen and carbon  dioxide in the blood leaving the lungs.  Recently, a relationship  was shown between these oscillations and respiration in mammals.  Moreover, the rate at which carbon dioxide rises may be an  adequate stimulus in controlling breathing frequency.  These  oscillations are not only influenced by breathing, but are also  altered by the state of activity (e.g. exercise).  Therefore, it  is the purpose of this study to examine the role of lung and  blood gas oscillations on the control of breathing in birds and  reptiles.  These studies are possible because birds and snakes  (unlike mammals) have lungs that are open at both ends, making it  possible to pass air through the lung in one direction only.  Oxygen and carbon dioxide  will then be made to oscillate in the  airstream.  The effect of these oscillations on nerves that  respond to these gases will be recorded.  In another series of  experiments, the effect of the oscillations on breathing will be  examined.  A computer will monitor breathing and control gas  mixing; therefore, the animal can control the gas mixer with its  breathing movements, thereby controlling its blood gases.  The  contribution of nerves monitoring lung and blood gases as well as  interactions between these nerves and the central nervous system  will be examined.  This information will provide insight into the  influence of these dynamic processes in air-breathing animals,  including mammals.  ***",
