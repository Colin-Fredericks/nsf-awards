Topics of the investigator's research on  which the equipment will be used includes mechanisms of the  reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organic compounds by  elemental iron, gas/particle partitioning of organic compounds in  atmospheric aerosols and gas/particle partitioning of toxic  compounds in air that has been polluted with tobacco smoke.    Acquisition of the equipment to be purchased with this support  will have a significant effect on improving the productivity of  this investigator's laboratory in connection with its work on  topics of important environmental significance.  The proposal  leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 93-155,  Research Equipment Grant Program.  ***",
