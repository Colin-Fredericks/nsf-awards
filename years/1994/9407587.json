 "awd_abstract_narration": "Martin  9407587              Differences among species in mortality of food limitation are generally assumed to cause   differences in fecundity.  This study examines a new hypothesis: fecundity increases, even at the   cost of reduced survival, as breeding opportunities become more limited.  A quantitative model   shows that even small reductions in breeding opportunities (e.g., 10% reduction) can have large   effects on fecundity and these effects are independent of any mortality effects.  Moreover, such   small reductions in breeding opportunities can commonly exist across any taxonomic group   through limited availability of nesting sites, oviposition sites, or social behavior restricting access   to mates.  Cavity-nesting birds that excavate their nest holes (excavators) provide a model   system for testing this hypothesis because they are so easy to study in their natural nests, they   include closely-related species that cover nearly the entire range of fecundities found among   small land birds, they vary in abilities to excavate nest holes and potentially obtain breeding   opportunities, and clutch size is correlated with this variation in excavation ability.  The proposed   study will include experimental analyses of 4 species to test the hypothesis.   The proposed work challenges long-standing theories of underlying causes of differences   in clutch size and fecundity among species.  Hence, this work will advance our understanding of   factors affecting demography of populations, and will provide new information on life histories of   several previously unstudied bird species.  In addition, this study will provide critical information   that is pertinent to conservation of cavity-nesting species; land management agencies have   explicit recommendations for maintenance of snag (nest site) densities that may be insufficient.     variety of studies indicate that nest sites are commonly limiting for cavity-nesting birds.  Such   limitations can affect populations in additional subtle ways  such as influencing fecundity, survival   and hence population fluctuations of such species.  This study will advance understanding of the   extent to which nest sites are limiting and affecting population dynamics and population size.",
