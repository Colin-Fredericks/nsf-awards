 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416424  Darragh  The aim of this project is to increase the understanding of site  effects that may have caused the large shaking at Tarzana and the  Santa Monica Freeway collapse near La Cienega during the 1994  Northridge, CA earthquake.  The anticipated results at Tarzana  will be useful for site characterization, topographic  amplification and microzonation at similar sites. The anticipated  results at I-10 will be useful for site characterization as well  as design and construction practices of freeway structures at  similar sites.  The results will be shred with bridge designers.    The study focuses on the site response at two California Strong  Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) stations:  Tarzana and  Baldwin Hills (located near the Santa Monica (I-10)freeway  collapse at La Cienega).  The objectives at both sites are to  clarify:  (1) the effects of different geology on site response  by the acquisition and compilation of seismic, geologic and  geotechnical data at the surface and from drill holes; and (2)  the contribution of the site in strong motion records of the  mainshock by using aftershock recordings of particular interest  are the causes of the sustained and high amplitude shaking of  over 1 g that was recorded at Tarzana, and the local site  response effects that may have amplified seismic waves and caused  damage at the collapsed I-10 freeway at La Cienega.    The following methods are employed:    1.Site characterization through standard shear-wave and    compressional-wave velocity measurements (surface and    downhole) and geotechnical testing of drillhole samples    damping, density and modulus reduction) from surface to    bedrock (or to very stiff material).    2.Site response is estimated by calculating the ratio of the    smoothed geometric-mean Fourier amplitude spectra from    aftershocks recorded at both the strong motion station and    nearby sites  For stations located at similar distances and    azimuths from the earthquake, the spectral-ratio method    is olates the site response from source and path effects.    3.Site response predictions from one-dimensional linear and    equivalent-linear models and a two-dimensional nonlinear model    are compared to actual response from strong motion recordings    to identify site effects and separate them from possible    source and path effects.  ***",
