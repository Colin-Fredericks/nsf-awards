 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354722  Reingold  We are completely restructuring the material traditionally covered  in the first three years of college chemistry curricula. Our new  structure solves many of the problems we and others have found with  the traditional approach, including the widely advertised  shortcomings of the freshman course and the less-widely  acknowledged problems with the organic course, chief among which is  the fact that it covers too much synthetic chemistry and too little  biochemistry for the majority of the students taking it, who tend  to be biology and premedical students.  Our solution is to move the  organic course to the freshman year and tailor it to its audience,  emphasizing biomedical connections and removing much of the pure  synthetic organic chemistry.  Obviously, this has a trickle-down  effect on the rest of the curriculum:  some of what used to be  freshman chemistry is now being taught in the sophomore year, as  inorganic and analytical chemistry, and the parts of organic  omitted from the freshman year are being addressed in the junior  year.  The restructuring has also given us the opportunity to work  with the biology department in a complete overhaul of labs for the  first two years, resulting in a joint freshman lab experience and  an intensification of the sophomore lab experience.  Finally, we  have created a course designed to introduce our environmental  science program.  Overall we expect this new curriculum to serve  both chemistry students and students in the other sciences better  than the old curriculum.",
