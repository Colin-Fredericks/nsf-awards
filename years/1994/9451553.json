 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451553  Poston  The goal of this proposal is the development of a laboratory  component requiring students to solve problems utilizing multiple  laboratory techniques. An advanced laboratory course will be  developed in which students draw upon laboratory skills acquired  in general, organic, analytical, and instrumental analysis to  solve problems posed in real life scenarios that simulate  investigations a laboratory chemist might encounter. The students  will gain experience in developing problem-solving approaches,  obtaining and preparing samples for analysis, analyzing data  collected from several techniques, determining the relevance of  collected data, and articulating the results of an investigation  in a format appropriate to the type of inquiry. The  investigations will rely heavily on such instrumental techniques  as gas chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA), infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR), and mass spectroscopy (MS). This proposal  requests funds for the acquisition of the GC-MS system, graphite  furnace (AA applications) and ion specific electrodes necessary  to enable implementation of this course. Use of the requested  equipment will not be restricted to the advanced laboratory  course described in this proposal. The GC-MS system will be used  throughout our program. It will be introduced in general  chemistry and extensively used in organic and instrumental  analysis. The graphite furnace will be used in instrumental  analysis and the ion selective electrodes in the general,  analytical and instrumental courses. It is anticipated that about  150 students per year will gain direct experience with this  equipment.",
