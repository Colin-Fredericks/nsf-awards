Data will be collected from archives  located in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, England and the United  States, and these data will concern missionary work in nations  such as Ghana, Cameroon, India and China.  Comparative and  interpretive analysis will contrast conflict theories with  Weberian theories of values.  Among the hypotheses to be explored  are the possibility that the secular effects of the missionary  movement often went beyond the expectations or even contrary to  the intentions of the participants.  Another hypothesis is that  religious opposition to the political and economic interests to  which the missions were symbiotically tied was especially likely  to occur when a religious vision of the ideal social structure  was threatened.  %%%       This project will contribute to the sociology of religion,  and it will improve our general understanding of colonialism and  imperialism.  Extensive religious missionary movements exist  today, and this historical study will provide the theoretical and  factual basis for understanding their consequences for the  developing democracies in the modern world.    ***",
