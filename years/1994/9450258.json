Cambridge, MA                                       Middle School Mathematics Literacy Project    Over the past several years, the Algebra Project, Inc. has been  developing a set of inquiry-oriented, experience-based middle  school materials designed to prepare minority youngsters to enter,  and successfully complete, a college track mathematics program in  high school.  The Algebra Project materials, designed to be used as  a supplement to other middle school curricula, are currently being  implemented in a number of (mainly urban) sites around the United  States.  The present project involves both implementation and  evaluation activities at just one set of sites in Mississippi,  primarily in the Spring Semester 1994.  The project targets some 32  schools, including a few schools in Jackson, as well as many  isolated rural schools in the Delta.  Project staff supports the  implementation efforts of the 78 teachers by periodic workshops,  meetings, and class visitations, as well as the development of a  broad-based community support system that includes school  administrators, parents, and community leaders.  Concurrent with  the implementation efforts, a national panel of 6 evaluation  experts is conducting an intensive short-term evaluation study to  look at the Algebra Project materials themselves, as well as the  Mississippi Delta implementation model--with a view to determining  the replicability of this model.     Non-NSF contributions to this project are 10% of the NSF   contribution.",
