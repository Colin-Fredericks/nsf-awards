Trioan  Institution:  Princeton University     Dr. Troian proposes a theoretical and experimental investigation of novel fingering instabilities in Marangoni-type spreading of liquid drops on thin films of higher surface tension.  Emphasizing surfactant solutions near the critical micel concentration, theory will reduce the film depression at the base of radially spreading drops and vertical diffusive transport of soluble surfactants, with the drop acting as a reservoir.  Seeks to determine the dominant through analysis of competition of stabilities and destabilizing effects.  Experimental flow visualization is based on image processing.   Pauley strongly supports identification and insightful analysis of important new elements of a problem that has old origins.  Excellent work by PI with excellent background.  Potential applications well motivated; but some of them a bit removed from engineering, or else it is not clear that the pertinent Marangoni instability is dominant or major effect (e.g., droplet inhalation- very complex).  well written proposal covers insightful asymptotic theory and experiments.   Some concern that appropriate collaborator for theory is at post doctoral level, and not in realm of graduate {SYMBOL 222 \\f \"Symbol\"} Ph.D. education - made as a general comment.  But area is definitely ripe for training chemical engineers in very sound fundamentals.   Overall, impressive physics.",
