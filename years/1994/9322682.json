 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322682  Stadtherr       Advanced computer architectures, in particular those involving  some form of parallel and/or vector processing, provide the power  to greatly enhance the ability of the engineer to realistically  model, simulate, design, and optimize complex chemical  manufacturing processes, steady- and unsteady-state.  The goal of  this project is to develop techniques for solving such problems,  taking full advantage of this enhanced processing.  One focus of  this work is the development of techniques for efficiently solving  these systems on vector/parallel computers.  The techniques to be  considered are based on the frontal and multifrontal direct  methods, and on iterative Krylov subspace methods with incomplete  factorization preconditioners.  A second focus for this project is  the use of parallelism to maintain robustness in process simulation  and optimization computations.  Techniques based on interval  analysis will be applied.  Since interval methods are amenable to  parallel computing, their use on these problems is now feasible.       The application of advanced computer architectures in chemical  process engineering is one of great potential.  The rapid  turnaround that can be provided by vector/parallel machines  improves engineering productivity, meaning more critical deadlines  met, faster times to market, and more timely responses to changes  in business, economic, and regulatory conditions.  The ability to  use more complex and realistic process models means a better  understanding of process fundamentals, thus reducing the need for  overdesign, and providing the insights needed to better attain  environmental and quality control goals.",
