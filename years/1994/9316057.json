 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316057  Read  This proposal request funds to study superb outcrops and the  extensive core collections of Middle and Late Ordovician rocks in  Kentucky so that we can compare them with the Early Ordovician  strata, to search for the stratigraphic evidence of possible change  from low amplitude eustasy of Early Ordovician greenhouse times to  possible higher amplitude eustasy developed during Late Ordovician  Gondwana glaciation.  We presently have a very large data base on  Early Ordovician and Middle Ordovician rocks characteristic of  greenhouse conditions, that will serve as a basis for comparison  with the younger units.  We propose to log bed-by-bed the later  Middle and Late Ordovician carbonates and shales which appear to  have developed on storm-dominated ramps, documenting any peritidal  and shallow to deeper water subtidal cycles, their degree of  lateral continuity, their stacking patterns and relation to  depositional sequences, and bounding surfaces.  We will also  examine the cycles for evidence of:  1. long term climate change  and 2. evidence of short term emergence (including paleosols,  erosion surfaces, negative departures of stable isotope profiles,  and meteoric cementation); all these might become more pronounced  if glacially driven sea level amplitudes increased into the Late  Ordovician.  Using detailed regional cross sections of cyclic  lithofacies, we will define depositional sequences, and document  the relationships and timing of bounding surfaces to the tectonic  history of the foreland basin, including peripheral bulge  development and prograding clastic rocks along the tectonically  active proximal margin.  Finally, we will computer model the cycles  and the depositional sequences to better constrain the roles of  tectonism, low- and high- frequency eustasy, and sediment supply.   Defining the stratigraphic signature of greenhouse to global  glacial conditions appears to hold the key for a future more  detailed global climate subdivision of the Phanerozoic than h as  been attempted.",
