 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320497  Grether  Psychologists have identified a number of rules or heuristic that  individuals may use in making judgements about the likelihood of  uncertain events.  Recent studies in experimental economics and  psychology have focused on finding the best fitting model from an  ex ante natural class of models to some experimental data in ways  that allow for subject differences in decision rules.  But these  data mining exercises limit subjects to a few pre-determined  rules.  Proper statistical analysis of these data may be  impossible, if patterns of behavior do not fit into one of the  pre-specified models.  The contribution of this project comes  from generalizing the single model selection approach by allowing  subjects to be explained by different models and generalizing the  standard data mining approach by choosing rules that best explain  the subjects' behavior from a large potential class of rules.      The project develops a procedure for analyzing data on individual  choice and market experiments that rigorously estimates the  number of rules used by subjects, estimates what those rules are,  and classifies subjects by decisionmaking rules used.  The  theoretical and practical aspects of this procedure are studied.   The procedure is used to design and conduct experiments that can  best discriminate between different decision rules, minimizing  misclassification errors and biases in estimates.  The technique  is applied to data from double auction experiments.",
