 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360606  Nelson         The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in the  marine surface layer are large enough to compete with the hydroxyl  radical as the major tropospheric oxidizer has received  considerable speculation.  Chlorine atoms participate in the  oxidation of hydrocarbons and dimethyl sulfide and can also  directly influence tropospheric ozone loss through catalytic cycles  with chlorine monoxide and the hydroperoxy radicals.  The net  effect on the ozone budget may be highly dependent on the  partitioning of the inorganic chlorine pool between hydrochloric  acid, hypochlorous acid, chlorine gas, and chlorine nitrate.  In  order to assess the potential importance of chlorine chemistry,  direct measurements of these species are necessary.  In Phase I of  this research, the PIs will assess the feasibility of detecting  hypochlorous acid at the 10 to 20 ppt level using tunable diode  laser infrared absorption.  This will require (1) measurement of  pressure broadening coefficients for selected absorption lines, (2)  identification of suitable spectral regions, (3) investigation of  photolytic modulation of hypocholorous acid to implement background  subtraction, and (4) design of novel multiple pass absorption cell  with a path length of at least 600 meters.  Phase II research will  improve the basic spectroscopic parameters for quantifying  hypochlorous acid concentrations and develop a prototype field  instrument capable of simultaneous measurements of hydrochloric  acid and hypochlorous acid in the marine atmosphere.  ***",
