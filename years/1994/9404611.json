 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404611  Schnell       The cells of higher plants contain a unique organelle,  the chloroplast,  which offers an excellent model system to study the problem  of the mechanism by which cytosolically synthesized proteins  are targeted and assembled in their proper subcellular  compartments.  The majority of the protein components of the  chloroplast are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized as  precursors on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and are post  translationally imported into the organelle across the  double membrane of the chloroplast envelope.  The long term goal of this research is to understand the  mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts.  This  proposal concentrates on the identification and  characterization of chloroplast components involved in  protein translocation across the chloroplast envelope.  The  first phase of the proposal is concerned about translocation  intermediates representing polypeptides that are blocked at  various stages of translocation as tags to identify envelope  polypeptides that mediate envelope translocation.  The  second phase of the proposal concerns the involvement of  putative components in membrane translocation and to  determine the specific roles of each protein in the import  process.  These studies will provide information of how the  outer and inner membranes cooperate to facilitate  simultaneous transport of proteins across the chloroplast  envelope.  The studies are significant for several reasons.  First, the  protein translocation plays a central role in chloroplast  biogenesis.  Therefore, the definition of this process is  essential in obtaining an understanding of the mechanism by  which the photosynthetic and metabolic machinery of the  organelle are targeted and assembled.  Second, understanding  of the import process is important for applications directed  at optimizing the metabolic and photosynthetic capabilities  of genetically engineered plants by directing foreign or  altered proteins to chloroplasts.  Finally, the parameters  governing  the chloroplast protein import undoubtedly will  contribute to the formulation of broadest principles  concerning the mechanism of protein targeting and membrane  translocation in all cells.  %%%    The green tissues of higher plants are organized to carry  out the process of photosynthesis in which light is  converted into chemical energy.  The cells of these tissues  contain a specialized compartment or organelle, the  chloroplast, that serves as the site of the photosynthetic  reactions and many of the essential metabolic processes of  the plant.  The long term goal of this research is to  understand the mechanism by which resident proteins are  recognized and transported in this organelle.  An  understanding of this process is a necessary requirement for  future genetic attempts to improve the green plants  photosynthetic efficiency, that controls such important  agricultural features as crop yield, improved nutritional  value, etc.    ***",
