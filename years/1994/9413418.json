 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal, we request funding for the purchase of a  multi-purpose state-of-the-art flow cytometer / cell sorter (Becton  Dickinson FACS VantageTM Cell Sorter system or Coulter EPICS Elite ESP  system) to update and expand our current multi-user Flow Cytometry Core  Research Facility of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Center  for Biotechnology. The new equipment will replace our fourteen year-old  Coulter EPICS V system which now requires frequent repairs. This  instrument has only a short life span remaining. The present flow  cytometer is also inadequate for the needs of several investigators on  the UNL campus who wish to perform bivariate chromosome analysis,  multicolor fluorescence analysis, and state-of-the-art sorting of  chromosomes and cells in their research endeavors. As a multipurpose  facility, we are requesting accessories for a new flow cytometer which  will permit: a user friendly operating system; multicolor fluorescence  analysis and at least two laser capability; cell sorting in less time;  computerized drop-delay setup; large-particle analysis and sorting;  sorting of 1-100,000 cells into microtitier trays, onto microscope  slides or filters. Importantly, the new flow cytometer system we have  chosen is designed to accommodate future upgrades and applications.  Even with the limitations of the present instrumentation, projects in  over 25 research laboratories have benefited from the services provided  by the Flow Cytometry Core Research Facility. Acquisition of a  state-of-the-art instrument will better service current users and most  certainly will attract additional users whose needs cannot be met with  the instrument presently in use.    Examples of specific research activities that would result from the  availability the new instrument include:    1) Univariate and bivariate flow karyotyping and sorting of chromosomes  from  important  plant  species  for the  purpose  of  construction  of  chromosome-specific DNA libraries.    Work  is already  in progress with tomato and corn chromosomes. We  will  actively  seek  collaboration from genome  researchers  throughout  the  world who want sorted chromosomes from other important plants. Our goal  is to make our Flow Cytometry Core Research Facility an internationally  recognized  center  for  plant genome analysis and  chromosome  sorting  research.    2)  Flow cytometric analysis of nuclei of animals and plants (both crop  plants  and native plants), and cell lines from animals and plants  for  the  determination  of ploidy level and/or estimation  of  nuclear  DNA  content.    3)  Immunofluorescence analysis (1-4 color) and sorting of  blood  cell  subsets  and  cell  lines  for  the  expression  of  surface  antigens,  receptors or internal substances.",
