The research is on a  comparative study of U.S. and Japanese interorganizational  technology transfer, focusing on the computer integrated  manufacturing industry.  Mr. Teasley will work with Professor  Fumio Kodama, Department of Innovation Policy, Saitama  University, Saitama, Japan.    The objectives of the research project are to collect data from  technology transfer projects in Japanese companies in order to  test the model of \"technology transfer project effectiveness\" and  to evaluate technology transfer differences between Japanese and  U.S. companies.  Japanese companies were chosen because of their  perceived ability to quickly and effectively develop new products  and processes from external, basic-level technologies that are  transferred into their organizations.  The computer integrated  manufacturing industry was chosen because it experiences a high  level of interorganizational exchange between basic research and  engineering development.  The results of this study should  contribute to our understanding of Japanese management and  cultural practices.",
