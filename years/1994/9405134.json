 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program,  is concerned with studies of compounds that contain metal-metal multiple bonds.  Objectives  include 1) the synthesis of new complexes that contain M-M multiple bonds, 2) further studies  of the underlying factors governing reactivity of M-M multiply bonded compounds, 3)  exploration of applications of M-M multiply bonded compounds in catalytic reactions and in  stoichiometric organic transformations, and 4) incorporation of M-M multiply bonded  compounds in macromolecular phases such as one-dimensional polymers and liquid crystalline  materials.  The latter may be of interest for molecular design of materials having potentially  interesting electrical, magnetic and optical properties.    Whereas the existence of multiple bonds in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen compounds has been  recognized for many decades, recognition of the existence of metal-metal multiple bonds is of  much more recent origin.  Consequently the fundamental chemistry of compounds that contain  metal-metal multiple bonds is poorly developed.  The primary objective of this project is to  expand our knowledge of the structural and reactivity properties of compounds that contain  metal-metal bonds, particularly with respect to possible applications in the catalysis of organic  reactions and in the preparation of new polymers and liquid crystalline materials.  The latter may  prove to be useful in the development of new materials having novel electrical, magnetic or  optical properties.",
