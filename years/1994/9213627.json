 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent increases in VLSI processor speeds have not been                         matched by proportionate increase in the number of I/O pins                     that connect processors to off-chip memory. Bandwidth between                   processor and off-chip memory has become the primary                            constraint to VLSI system performance.  A compression scheme                    know as Dynamic Base Register Caching (DBRC) has been                           developed that reduces address pin requirements by a factor of                  two without incurring a significant performance penalty or                      implementation cost.  This work will be extended along several                  fronts to further reduce bandwidth requirements between                         processor and memory.                                                                                                                                                (1) Schemes that have the potential to achieve even                                 higher levels of compression by exploiting successor                            information to predict address references will be                               explored.                                                                                                                                                   (2) Analogous compression schemes for data will be                                  investigated.  (Preliminary measurements show that                              data, like address information, is highly redundant,                            so a simple compression scheme may be possible.)                                                                                                            (3) Finally, trace data will be analyzed to establish                               tight upper and lower bounds on the information                                 content of address and data reference streams.                                  Accurate bounds will indicate how much compression is                           possible, as well as how much schemes can be                                    improved.",
