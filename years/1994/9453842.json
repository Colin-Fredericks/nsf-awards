The project will directly impact 2,900 of the district's 30,000+  minority students, their parents, and 390 teachers in 155 schools.   The project will replicate the concepts and activities of the  following successful models:  AVID (Advancement Vis individual  Determination), SECME (Science Engineering Communications and  Mathematics Enrichment), Kentucky K-4 Mathematics Specialist  program, SUM (Success understanding Mathematics), and TEAMS  (Teaching Elementary  Assessments in Math and Science).  The  project will use staff development, classroom instruction, and  student activity components to 1) prepare teachers to develop new  teaching strategies, 2) involve students in hands-on mathematics  and science activities, 3) encourage parents to take part in their  child's education, 4) improve study skills, 5) stress the  importance of science and mathematics education, and 6) expose  minority students to minority role models in the professional  community.",
