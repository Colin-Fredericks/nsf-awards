Webb  on seismic studies of large earthquakes in New Zealand.    New Zealand is an active seismic region located along the plate  boundary between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates.   Since 1915, 16 earthquakes of magnitude >6.5 have occurred within  the country. This project will examine the faulting process of 10  historic earthquakes using seismogram modeling techniques.  These  models will be compared to geological and geophysical features of  the existing fault zones to better determine fault behavior, slip  rates, and regional variations in earthquake processes increasing  an understanding of deformational processes along complicated  plate margins like New Zealand and western North America. The  research is a collaborative effort between Dr. Doser, an expert  in seismological studies of historic earthquakes, and Dr. Webb  who has extensive knowledge of the recent seismicity of             New Zealand.",
