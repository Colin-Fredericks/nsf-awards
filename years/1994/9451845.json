 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451845  O de Sa  This project creates a new course to provide integrated training in  the theory and practice of Molecular Evolution to science majors  using a strong \"hands-on\" approach.  Students select and carry on  experiments involving a wide range of molecular techniques. The  class format emphasizes two components: Inquiry and \"Know-how.\" The  first emphasizes exercises to develop communication and critical  thinking skills through evaluation and analysis of data,  experimental designs, and written assignments. The second component  focuses on four key approaches to generate productive and Ph.D.  bound science graduates: Collaborative Inquiry: Student teams learn  to use different molecular methodologies by pursuing their own  experiments; Core Molecular Methodologies: Students learn the  applications and advantages of each molecular technique and   acquire the needed technological competence; Critical Thinking: The  experimental data obtained provides an excellent opportunity for  students to critically analyze the experimental designs and to  develop their own research questions and proposals; Communication:  Students interpret and explain their experimental results, which  reinforces the development of their communication skills. The new  RC24 Superspeed centrifuge enables the students to carry out many  of the steps necessary for manipulating genes and vectors for  cloning purposes.",
