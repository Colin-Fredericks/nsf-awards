The project proposes to improve science  education through the collaborative efforts of teachers, school  and district administrators, scientists, community  representatives, and university faculty.  Through a series of  summer institutes and academic year follow-up activities WISE-  STEP will: 1.  directly assist approximately 40 teachers to  expand their understanding and appreciation of science and to  become leaders in their buildings and districts; work with  approximately 20 schools in 2 school districts to develop the  infrastructure needed to support quality science education in the  elementary grades; collaborate with institute participants and  school officials on the adoption of high-quality science programs  in their districts; and collaborate with other scientists,  teachers, and education faculty so that the institute model can  be expanded to the entire State of Washington.  ***",
