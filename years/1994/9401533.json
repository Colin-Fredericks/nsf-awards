He has found this to be a mine of applications to  topological and algebraic geometric problems.  Algebraic cycles  are seen as a topological group functor from the category of  algebraic varieties to the category of group objects in the  category of CW-complexes.  This functor associates principal  fibrations to closed inclusions, and their homotopy groups  provide a homology theory for algebraic varieties which he wishes  to understood more deeply.  An intersection theory for arbitrary  varieties will be developed, generalizing and simplifying an  existing theory for quasiprojective varieties.  On the purely  topological side, the investigator's research has created  equivariant infinite loop spaces using algebraic cycles, and the  generalized cohomology theories thus obtained have been related  with several other theories.  As an outcome of this interplay  between new and old theories, he has already answered  long-standing conjectures about the total Chern class map and is  presently computing several examples where algebraic geometry,  group representation theory, and homotopy theory come together to  illuminate the coefficient systems involved, the associated  transfer maps, and so forth.       A fundamental aspect and guiding principle in the  investigator's research is its unifying character, under which  diverse areas of mathematics come into play and yield  multifaceted applications of his algebraic techniques.  He thus  obtains a highly desirable economy of thought, in the sense that  a concise and unified approach to various seemingly disparate  questions attains deep results about each in a short period of  time.  He starts by endowing basic objects in algebraic geometry,  the algebraic cycles, with a topology which turns out to have  remarkable properties.  He then realizes that these cycles  provide new invariants not only for alge braic varieties (of  fundamental importance to algebraic geometers), but that they  also deeply relate with ongoing mainstream research in stable  homotopy theory, a major topic in algebraic topology.  Other  natural structures arise in this setting as he explores  constructions involving his algebraic cycles.  The study of  cycles from an equivariant point of view thus also provides  insight into various aspects of the theory of representation of  finite groups and group cohomology, enhancing the usefulness of  his unified approach.  ***",
