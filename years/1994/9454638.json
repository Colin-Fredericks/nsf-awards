 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a rapidly growing need for advanced technology  environmental education programs to prepare students for the  workplace of today and tomorrow.  To build a high performance  environmental education infrastructure, the Hazardous Materials  Training and Research Institute (HMTRI), the Partnership for  Environmental Technology Education (PETE), and the University of  Northern Iowa Center for Environmental and Energy Education is  establishing a national Advanced Technology Environmental Education  Center (ATEEC).  The vision is to create a world class network of  community college environmental programs linked with high schools  that inform and prepare students for entry into these two-year  programs.  The Center has established three broad goals:  (1)  Develop nationally validated curriculum models and advanced  instructional materials;  (2) Establish comprehensive programs of  professional development; and  (3) Build a clearinghouse to serve  as a national center of environmental information and as a hub for  the networking of environmental educators, business and industry,  federal agencies, and professional societies.  The Center will  provide leadership to: enhance core and advanced math science, and  technology components of environmental education; utilize advanced  electronic communications networks; focus upon meeting the needs of  diverse learners; encourage instructional materials which utilize  advanced technologies; and develop teaching and curriculum  standards for environmental education. The ATEEC will touch  hundreds of instructors and improve the education of thousands of  students throughout the nation.",
