 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451570  Jameson                              This proposal is for the assembly of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer for  undergraduate instruction from a decommissioned spectrometer. We  propose to utilize only the low-level rf section and the magnet  from older systems. The transformation includes a state of the art  PC based computer, peripherals, timing section, and pulse  programmer. The result will be a high-field spectrometer which will  be routinely used in many undergraduate courses. At Loyola  University we will transform our pedagogy from one in which  hands-on NMR spectroscopy is almost non-existent in the beginning  Organic courses into one in which a high-field spectrometer plays  a routine and integral part of the course, separating acquisition  from processing, thereby making possible 25 student spectra in one  hour of laboratory. In Instrumental Analysis the students will  understand the conversion between time and frequency domain data.  They will delve into understanding the manner in which optimal  control of experimental parameters is related to instrument design.  We wish to have our undergraduate students become more  sophisticated in the use of NMR spectroscopy so that their  undergraduate research will be significantly enriched, and make  them better prepared for their future chemistry careers. We suggest  that assembling an NMR spectrometer for undergraduate instruction  from existing commercial modules is quite possible, well within the  competence of capable spectroscopists (NMR or not) or Instrumental  Analysis instructor. We will demonstrate that a spectrometer can be  obtained for a cost well below $100,000. Ten year old (entirely  serviceable) 4.7T magnets (200 Mhz 1H) are becoming available from  the decommissioning of older instruments, prices ($15-35K)  depending on availability, extras and demand. An extremely useful  instructional tool is possible.",
