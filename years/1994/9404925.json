The initial photochemical process  in photosynthetic organisms occurs in a pigment-protein complex  called the reaction center.  The photochemical process is  initiated by light absorption that excites a bacteriochlorophyll  dimer and starts the transfer of electrons and protons that will  be used to generate energy rich compounds.  A critical feature of  these electron transfer processes is the relationship between the  rate and driving force.  We propose measuring the process after  we have significantly altered the driving force by making  specific changes in the energy levels of the bacteriochlorophyll  dimer.  We plan to use a wide range of techniques ranging from  femotosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and electron  nuclear paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to molecular biology.   The understanding of the electron transfer processes in this  complex should be useful for other biological systems, such as  respiratory and electron transfer chains and redox enzymes.  %%%  The goal of this research is to understand the function of  biological systems at a molecular level.  Fundamental to all  biological processes is the use of energy to create energy rich  compounds.  These research seeks to understand how biological  organisms efficiently convert light into chemical energy.  Our  approach is to study the complex called the reaction center, that  is involved in the initial steps of this conversion process.  We  alter the complex by use of molecular biology and then apply  physical techniques to characterize how the function has changed.   More specifically, we make changes that alter the driving force  for the reaction and then measure how the rate of the reaction  changes.  Although the study is applied to a specific complex, we  anticipate that the results will be general and applicable to  other biological  systems.  ***",
