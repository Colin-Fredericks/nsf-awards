To a large degree, the effort  continues several lines of research which have opened new  directions of investigation.  Work will be done extending recent  results on zero-divisors for functions in Bergman spaces defined  in a disc.  These are spaces of analytic functions whose norms  are defined with respect to area integration of their powers.   The long-sought solution to the zero divisor problem was obtained  by Hedenmalm; it opens the door to investigations into the  classification of invariant subspaces analogous to the classical  result of Beurling for the Hardy spaces.  Considerable work still  remains, almost nothing has been established about these spaces  to date, especially on the question of existence of extremal  functions.  Work will also be done investigating plane harmonic  mappings, i.e. mappings for which each component is harmonic.   Such mappings are directly related to solutions of minimal  surface problems.  Questions of concern center on finding good  estimates for the Gaussian curvature of a nonparametric minimal  surface above the disc in terms of the so-called dilatation of a  harmonic map and on determining the shape of images of extremal  harmonic maps.         Classical function theory has introduced geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than  first imagined.  The subject exploits the interplay between  geometric interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to  yield some of the most complete mathematical results in the field  of analysis.In this project, variational techniques and geometric  reasoning are expected to lead to results of valuable physical  significance.   ***",
