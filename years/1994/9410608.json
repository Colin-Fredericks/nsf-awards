 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gregory Voth is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform studies of quantum dynamical   processes in condensed phase systems.  He will employ the dynamical   properties of the imaginary time path centroid in the Feynman path   integral formulation.  The time position correlation function in   many-body systems will be computed using centroid molecular dynamics.  In   this method classical-like equations of motion generate centroid   trajectories which are correlated and statistically weighted with the   phase space Feynman path integral centroid density.  The resulting   correlation function can then be related by Fourier transform to the   quantum position correlation function.  New algorithms will be developed   to solve the centroid molecular dynamics equations, and they will be   applied to a number of condensed phase studies including: 1) quantum   tunneling and mode quantization effects in liquid water; 2) diffusive   transport of the hydrated electron in quantized water; and 3) the quantum   dynamical motion of an excess proton in water and related systems.    Gas phase chemical systems have been studied for a number of years, and   excellent theoretical and computational techniques have been developed to   model their behavior.  More recently theoretical and computational   methods are being developed which make it possible to treat more complex   condensed phase systems.  Most of the current theoretical models are   classical in nature, and cannot deal with the additional complications   imposed by quantum effects.   Voth's research addresses this additional   degree of complexity, and proposes the development of computational   approaches which will permit the treatment of condensed phase systems   which include various quantum degrees of freedom.",
