 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410510  Ault  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design  Projects Program category, and requests support for  undergraduate and graduate student engineers to provide  prototype \"custom designed\" devices and software to aid  persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust  is to provide meaningful design experience for the  engineering student that will directly aid a specific  disabled individual. A formal program is in place at  Worcester Polytechnic Institute which will ensure  satisfactory progress is attained on these projects.  A  group of students and the investigators on the grant will  work with a number of collaborating agencies and individuals  on these projects. Twenty-eight projects are planned during  the five year duration of this award, and a written report  on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual  publication.  Once completed, each project will be given to  the person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that this  \"real world\" experience will give engineering students a  sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve  the community, attract new students into engineering, and  raise student interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of  their undergraduate design requirements, and will also  benefit a population where customization is often needed for  rehabilitation devices.  ***",
