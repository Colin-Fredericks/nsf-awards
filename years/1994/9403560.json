 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter McCullagh will investigate a number of issues, all bearing  directly or indirectly on generalized linear models. Apart from  specialized models such as those arising in the analysis of  ranked data, the most pressing need has been for satisfactory  methods for dealing with non-linear models having several  components of variation.  Examples of experiments where such  models are appropriate are not hard to find.  The salamander data  (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, p. 440-444) has been widely studied  as an archetypal example involving purely binary data.  Linear  models having several variance components were developed early by  Yates and Fisher, but in the pre-computer era only balanced  designs could be tackled.  For the estimation of variance  components in unbalanced designs the residual likelihood, i.e.  the likelihood based on the residuals, has come to play a key  role in recent work.  A major aim of the present proposal is to  extend this work to models of the generalized linear type. A  second and related aim is to develop new methodologies for  longitudinal data, particularly where this occurs in an  epidemiological context.  An important difference between linear  and non-linear models is the distinction between subject-specific  and population-averaged parameters, the latter being more  relevant in epidemiological contexts.  The final part of the  proposal, a sort of counterpoint to the exponential-family, is  the study of transformation models with particular emphasis on  Mobius transformation and Cauchy models.  The results obtained  thus far are helpful for the light they shed on conditional  inference and asymptotics.  This proposal aims to develop  statistical methods that enable a scientist to draw reliable  conclusions from data where the model is non-linear and the  design is such that there is more than one source of variation in  the experiment.  Such experimental designs are rather common in  biological and agricultural research, where methods of analysis  for linear mo dels are fairly well developed.  For non-linear  models, likelihood calculations are generally difficult and  time-consuming.  I propose to develop useful analytical  approximations as an alternative to numerical Monte-Carlo  simulation techniques.",
