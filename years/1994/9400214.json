The organizers are Martin  Magid of Wellesley College and Leopold Verstraelen of Catholic  University in Leuven, Belgium.  Specialists from Germany,  Netherlands, Spain and Russia will participate. The purpose of  the workshop is to review new directions in affine differential  geometry and identify future research collaborations.  The  Europeans have done most of the recent work in this field.   Through this workshop, this small group of U.S. researchers will  expand their contacts and coordinate their efforts with the  European group.    Affine differential geometry is the study of invariants of  submanifolds under the group of affine motions.  The subject has  been studied for a long time; however, there has been resurgence  of interest in recent years. Recent discoveries now link affine  differential geometry to fundamental problems in computer vision  and image processing.  The proposed workshop examines these new  directions and is expected to stimulate new areas for research.  ***",
