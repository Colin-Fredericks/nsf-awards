 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NYU/NYBG Plant Resources Program will train a new type of  doctoral-level plant biologist:  those with the expertise to  find, characterize, and discover the economic importance of  plants and to conserve them.  Students will be trained in three  areas of plant biology (Molecular, Systematics, and Economic  Botany) and in fields which impact studies of biodiversity  (Anthropology, Environmental Science, International Law, etc.)   This interdisciplinary program combines the resources of two  major research/educational institutions whose complementary  expertise is uniquely suited to these goals.  Training begins  with a rigorous Core Course covering basic elements of plant  science, from structure and regulation of plant genes, to  practical skills and ethics required to negotiate agreements for  plant collections/conservation.  Students will attend an annual  seminar course to monitor recent developments in plant biology  and policy/environment issues, and an annual workshop which will  include parties from industry, government and academia.  Students  will receive practical training by performing three 0-week lab  \"rotations\", in an active laboratory in each area.  Students will  also complete six advanced courses and undertake thesis research  in their area of interest.  This will be the first program to  provide formal training not only in modern approaches to studying  economically and medicinally important plants, but also in  disciplines important for implementing the conservation of these  rapidly disappearing resources.",
