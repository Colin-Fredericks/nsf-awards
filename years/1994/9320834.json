 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320834  Sneddon    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Larry G. Sneddon,  Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, to pursue  with Professor Sang Ook Kang, Department of Chemistry, Korea  University, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on  metal promoted reactions of boron hydrides.  The focus of this  cooperative research is the development of new, high yield  synthetic routes for the construction of important polyhedral  boron compounds.  This research will emphasize the development of  transition metal reagents and catalysts, similar to those  employed in organic and organometallic chemistry, to activate  polyhedral boron compounds for reaction.    Because of their unique chemical and physical properties,  polyhedral boron compounds are of great academic and industrial  interest.  These compounds have a number of important properties  that give rise to potential applications as burn rate modifiers,  neutron-capture cancer agents, high temperature polymers, and  ceramic precursors.  Further research in this area has been  seriously hampered by the lack of general synthetic procedures.   Much of the synthetic part of the project will be performed in  Korea, where Professor Kang has recently discovered several new  reagents which have potential applications to promote new types  of boron hydride reactions.  Success of the project will depend  greatly on the sophisticated characterization techniques  available in the PI's laboratory.  The collaborators are highly  respected researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an   international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No. CHE-9001063.  ***",
