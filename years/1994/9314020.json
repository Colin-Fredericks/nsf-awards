 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314020  Badding    This work is concerned with the chemistry of covalently bonded  hard/superhard materials that are synthesized at high pressure (1  gigapascals to greater than 70 gigapascals), but can be quenched to  ambient conditions.  These experiments will be performed using  diamond-anvil cell techniques together with recently developed  methods for the synthesis and characterization of solids at high  pressures.  Syntheses at extreme pressures and/or temperatures will  be combined with detailed in situ observations of the formation and  properties of hard materials.  The topics to be addressed are the  synthesis of diamond and diamond-like materials from novel  polycarbyne network-backbone polymers and the synthesis of new hard  materials in the carbon-nitrogen and boron-oxygen systems.  The  goals will be to look for new hard materials, potentially with  properties superior or complementary to existing ones and to gain  new information about the relationship between crystal structure,  chemical composition, and hardness that will help in the design of  new hard materials.  ***",
