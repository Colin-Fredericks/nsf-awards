 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414227  Foley     Multimedia courseware offers solutions to some of the problems in the learning and teaching of computer science.  Beginning students in computer science are faced with learning abstract, invisible concepts without support for learning the processes of computer science (e.g., programming).  Intermediate and advanced students typically learn through experiments (on advanced tools) and lecture, but without the benefit of supportive learning environments (e.g., structure and explanation and connections from instances to general concepts).  Georgia Tech is developing courseware which (1) makes abstract, invisible concepts visible through use of software visualization; (2) supports the learning of process through software-realized scaffolding; and (3) integrates existing tools with pedagogical structure through inter-application communication facilities to create learning environments even out of advanced research vehicles.  The work involved focuses on three areas: the construction of pedagogically sound tools to facilitate the authoring of such modules; the creation of modules to use in computer science classrooms and to serve as models; and thorough evaluation of both the authoring tools and student modules.  ***",
