Targeted are 7th and 8th grade  children from 10 counties in South Carolina who will enroll in a  four-week residential summer science camp followed by intensive  academic year reinforcement activities.  The first week of camp  will be held at Long Leadership 4-H Center; the second and third  at Cooper Leadership 4-H Center; and the final week on the campus  of Clemson University. Students will be involved in camp  activities 10 hours each day for 20 days.  The disciplinary focus  of SEEKERS is mathematics as applied to a variety of sciences and  technical areas with curricula tailored to South Carolina  students.  Follow-up activities will be SEEKERS clubs; initiated  during summer camps and implemented in the home communities of  all camp participants.  SEEKERS will impact 300 children and  their families each of the three years of funding.",
