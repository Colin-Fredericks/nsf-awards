The lab content is divided into  three sections; (1) generic characteristics of instrumentation  systems, (2) Transducer systems, and (3) interfacing and control.  In the first section of material, dead weight pressure testers are  used to introduce static calibration concepts, while  spring-mass-damper systems are used to illustrate the dynamic  characteristics of instrumentation systems. In section (2), common  transducer systems, (e.g. LVDTs, strain gauges, thermo-couples  etc.), are demonstrated. The third section of labs introduces basic  signal processing and control ideas. Noise reduction techniques  will be explored for measurement systems, and micro-computers will  be used in temperature control and motor speed control  applications. The lab program described here is designed to  accelerate learning in the area of modern instrumentation and  control by drawing on students existing background in mechanical  engineering. Student projects based on case studies from industry  will be user to provide realistic experiences. The intended result  is that mechanical engineering students would gain very practical  knowledge of instrumentation and control not usually included in a  mechanical engineering curriculum.",
