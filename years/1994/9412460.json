 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412460  Changnon    The 1993  flood on the Upper Mississippi River Basin was a singular  event from several perspectives.  It ranked as the worst recorded  summer season flood with the combined flow at St. Louis achieving   a flood level rated as a once in 500-year event.  This basin, which  typically experiences flood  levels in the spring, indeed had  spring floods in March-April 1993.  However, continuous widespread  rains from mid-May through late August brought both the Missouri  and Mississippi Rivers and their major tributaries into extreme  flooding.  The summer season aspect was unique, as was the  prolonged nature of the flood on both rivers, lasting between two  months and three months at many locations.  The floods covered an  enormous area and produced one for of the worst natural disasters  in the history of the United States.  The primary activity of this project will be the collection of all  available data related to the floods from mid-1992 through 1993.   This will include data on rainfall, stream1flow, water levels in  reservoirs including spillway discharges ground water levels,  stream water quality, and ground water quality.  We will  produce  a \"flood data archive\" in digital format.  Data that cannot be  adequately digitized will be retained and made available in hard  copy formats.  This database will be made available to all  interested scientists and others who desire copies at nominal  costs.  The archive will be widely advertised in scientific  journals, relevant trade journals, and in government-related  publications.  If interested federal agencies such as the USGS and  USEPA wish to help in the distribution of the archive created,  these arrangements will be made.",
