 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James T. Hynes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of   chemical reactions in solution.  He is applying a combination of MD   simulations, quantum theory, and analytical theory to obtain insights   into the effects of solvation on the rates of chemical reactions.  A   number of new applications will be pursued including: 1) a treatment of   the ionization of simple acids such as HCl and acetic acid; 2) proton   transfers involving nitroalkanes and aryl nitroalkanes; 3) proton   transfers for hydrogen chloride at the ice-air interface, and for sulfur   dioxide at the air-water interface as a model for reactions involved in   ozone depletion and acid rain.  Hynes will also continue his longer term   project involving the ionization of t-butyl chloride in aqueous solvent.    Theories explaining the behavior of gas phase chemical reactions are now   quite predictive for small molecular species.  Although there is still   much work in progress regarding energy transfer which occurs during the   reactive collision process, most of the physics of the reactive encounter   is well understood.  However, by far the majority of reactions which are   of interest to chemists take place in the solution phase, and by far the   most important solvent is water.  The effect which the presence of   aqueous solvent has on a chemical reaction is much less well understood.    Hynes is applying a combination of theory and computer simulations to   determine the molecular nature of the solvent-solute interactions and   their effects on the rates of chemical reactions in solution.  He is also   applying these theoretical methods to studies of important environmental   problems such as acid rain and ozone depletion.",
