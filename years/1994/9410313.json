 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410313  Chong  This proposal deals with issues in parametric and nonparametric  decision and control problems for Discrete Event Systems (DESs).   DESs are dynamical systems that are driven by the occurrence of  physical events, and arise in virtually all man-made systems,  including manufacturing systems, communication networks,  distributed computer systems, logistic systems, and vehicular  traffic.  The proposal considers performance oriented DES models,  and focuses on the problem of performance optimization.  Methods  for optimizing DESs have received significant interest in recent  years, and show tremendous promise for the development of  efficient ways to optimize large-scale complex man-made systems.    An objective of the study is to couple perturbation analysis  methods with optimization algorithms (both parametric and  nonparametric), with the aim of gaining further rigorous  understanding into when and why they work, and developing  algorithms and tools that will be useful in DES decision and  control problems.  This work emphasizes applications in  manufacturing systems, communication networks, and real-time  computer systems.  ***",
