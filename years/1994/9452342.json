 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Mount St. Vincent is seeking to enrich teaching and  learning in the biology laboratory through the addition of  Macintosh microcomputers.  In many courses in biology, the mastery  of content has taken precedence over enhanced competence in  critical thinking and integration. Laboratories are highly  structured, with little opportunity for independent investigation  and analytical thinking by the students. Compounding these  problems, students display a decline in the level of preparedness  for learning biology, and possess a variety of learning modes that  render traditional instructional methods less effective.  In an  attempt to overcome these shortcomings, we seek to introduce  contemporary computers and multimedia software into biology  laboratory education. The initial focus will be on the Physiology  laboratory, with use of the laboratory stations by students in  several other laboratory courses as well. Several laboratory  exercises in Physiology will be interfaced with the Macintosh  microcomputer for sophisticated data collection and analysis, with  additional simulations to allow students to extend and reinforce  the knowledge obtained through their hands-on work. Computer-based  learning materials will be used to help students develop  problem-solving skills as well as content mastery. Multimedia  software programs will be used to help the student to organize  information, and to form cognitive links between various content  areas explored in lecture and laboratory.",
