The oscillations stimulate  mechanosensory cells called hair cells, which send signals to the  auditory nerve.  A remarkable finding around 15 years ago showed  that one group of hair cells, the outer hair cells, can themselves  show motility, and so act as electromechanical elements that can  modulate cochlear sensitivity.  As a byproduct of that function,  the outer hair cell activity is transmitted as acoustical energy  back out of the ear, producing measurable sounds called otoacoustic  emissions, which have been used by scientists and clinicians as a  non-invasive tool to study cochlear function.  This project uses  electrophysiology, computer simulation, and measurements of the  otoacoustic emissions to examine several novel hypotheses about how  the basilar membrane vibration and the outer hair cell activity may  be involved in normal cochlear function.  It will specifically  evaluate where the non-linearities in amplification occur in the  cochlea, and whether the basilar membrane may have modes of  oscillation different from the classical traveling-wave form.   Results from this unique combined physiological and modeling  approach will have an impact on all auditory neuroscience, and  novel findings will have important impact not only on handling of  hearing disorders, but on design of auditory communications, and on  biomechanics and bioengineering.  ***",
