The funds will augment the research of an ongoing  Center project entitled \"Silicon Integrated Optical Systems for  Robotic Sensor Applications,\" to enable preliminary work on  untested and novel ideas in microoptomechanical systems.    This research addresses the integration of micro optical systems on  silicon, for potential applications in robotic sensing, automatic  optical alignment, tunable filters and lenses for fiber-optic  communication systems nd holographic displays.  This advance is now  made possible by advances in microelectromechanical systems and  binary optics.  This award, In the SGER mode, supports initial  exploration of optimal technologies, and methods for design and  layout of microactuated optical elements.  Prototype designs will  be fabricated and tested    These funds are being cost-shared by the Robotics and Machine  Intelligence Program, Division of Information, Robotics and  Intelligent Systems and the Solid State and Microstructures  Engineering Program of the Division of Electrical and  Communications Systems.    The Program Manager recommends the University of California,  Berkeley be awarded $40,000 for one year for this SBER award.",
