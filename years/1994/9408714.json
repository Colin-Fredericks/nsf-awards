 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408714  Gibson    With National Science Foundation support, Drs. McGuire Gibson and  Tony Wilkinson will conduct archaeological research in the  highland region of Yemen. Previous archaeological work has  revealed the presence of widespread terraces which date to  prehistoric times and served, presumably, for agricultural  purposes. However their dates and cultural affiliations are not  well known. Drs. Gibson and Wilkinson will use aerial photographs  to locate such complexes. They will then conduct on the ground  survey and mapping. They will carry out trial excavation to  determine the geomorphological characteristics of the terraces,  to collect organic material for radiocarbon dating, and to  discern cultural affiliation. These data will provide the basis  for a larger, more long term research effort.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex civilizations  developed from smaller scale social units. Several theories  proposed focus on the agricultural process and the need to  coordinate large numbers of individuals to achieve common goals.  It has been argued that in semiarid environments, such as the  Near East, irrigation plays a central role because the  construction of irrigation canals requires large amounts of labor  and the allocation of water necessitates central hierarchical  control. The Yemen situation may be different because preliminary  indications suggest that terracing - which is a small scale  activity - and increased social complexity seem to go hand in  hand. Drs. Gibson and Wilkinson wish to examine this question.    This research is important because it will increase our  understanding of how humans adapt in semi-arid regions. It will  also shed new light on the development of complex societies.  ***",
