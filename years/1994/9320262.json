 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310162  Li    Neurotransmitters are the molecular compounds that are used for  communication signals between nerve cells, or neurons, in the  brain.  Development of the proper neurotransmitters is critical to  the normal development of the nervous system in any animal, to  establish and regulate communication between the nerve cells.  This  project exploits the extremely simple nervous system of a tiny  roundworm, known as C. elegans, which has the added advantage of  allowing sophisticated genetic studies.  A gene called flp-1 has  been discovered to encode a group of compounds called FRMF amide-  like peptides that are important neurotransmitters.  This work will  use molecular genetic techniques to examine the control of the  transcription process underlying the expression of the peptides  from the gene.  The work will characterize the flp-1 gene, and  identify the promoter elements and genes that interact with flp-1,  important to the specification and regulation of neuropeptide  expression.  Molecular characterization of this genetic pathway may  yield insights into the mechanisms of how neurons are  developmentally programmed to express specific neurotransmitters,  and results will have impact across many areas of neuroscience,  genetics and developmental biology.  ***",
