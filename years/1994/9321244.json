 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321244  Anderson         Marine biotoxins and harmful algae represents a  significant and expanding threat to human health and  fisheries resources throughout the United States.  This  problem takes many forms, ranging from massive \"red tides\"  or blooms of cells that discolor the water to dilute,  inconspicuous concentrations of cells noticed only because  of the harm caused by the highly potent toxins contained in  those cells.  Impacts include mass moralities of wild and  farmed fish, human intoxication's and death from  contaminated shellfish or fish, alterations of marine  trophic structure, and death from marine mammals, seabirds,  and other animals.  The nature and extent of the problem has  increased considerably over the last two decades in the  United States, but unfortunately, our national research,  monitoring, and regulatory infrastructure is not adequately  prepared to meet this expanding threat. To alleviate this  problem, national and international efforts underway to  develop and implement science programs to deal with the many  complex issues that are involved.  This proposal seeks funds  from NOAA and NSF for the P.I. to assist  in the development  and coordination of these activities.  This will involve  continued participation as the U.S. representative at  international workshops and study groups convened by ICES,  IOC, WESTPAC and SCOR.  Within the United States, activities  will include planning and advisory activities in support of  an Ad Hoc Interagency Task Force on Marine Biotoxins and  Harmful Algae, compilation of bloom reports through the ICES  Coordinating Center for the Exchange of Information on  Exceptional algal Blooms, and the organization of a workshop  to formulate a detailed science plan for research on the  ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms.",
