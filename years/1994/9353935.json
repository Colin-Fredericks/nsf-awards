This program utilizes a field-oriented  workshop format to investigate volcanic processes and examine  the methods by which investigations in volcanic terrains are  conducted.  During the workshop, five theses are addressed: 1)  volcanism and tectonic setting, 2) physical volcanology, 3)  volcaniclastic sedimentation, 4) volcanic hazards, and 5)  volcanism and resources.  These themes are examined through  hands-on investigations at carefully selected field sites  throughout Oregon.  The follow-up program encourages networking  among participants and program staff and the use and  modification of materials developed during the workshop in  classroom settings. The program is designed for faculty from  community colleges and primarily undergraduate, four-year  degree granting colleges and universities.  ***",
