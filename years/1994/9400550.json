 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Youssin will investigate singularities of complex  algebraic varieties. He will study the relationship between  decompositions of the L-2 cohomology that come from intersection  cohomology and those that come from modules over rings of  differential operators. He also intends to study relations  between Newton polyhedra and resolution of singularities.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-  century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and robotics.",
