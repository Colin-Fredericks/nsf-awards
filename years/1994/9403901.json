 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a multi-faceted investigation whose primary focus is the  application of partial differential equations and their optimal control to  problems in mechanics,population dynamics, mathematical ecology and  mathematical physiology.  Among the problems to be investigated are bilinear  control of Kirchhoff plate equations;viscosity solutions of systems of systems  of degenerate parabolic partial differential equations that arise in  population dynamics; optimal control of a system of ordinary differential  equations which models the interaction of the immune system with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the goal of devising an optimal scheduling  procedure for chemotherapy treatments; and optimal control of a model for  bioremediation of hazardous waste using the input pumping levels of nutrients  as the control variable. This project is jointly funded by the Applied  Mathematics Program and the Classical Analysis Program.       This is a multi-faceted investigation whose primary focus is the  application of partial differential equations and their optimal control to  problems in mechanics, population dynamics, mathematical ecology and  mathematical physiology. Among the specific problems to be investigated are  (1) the bilinear optimal control of plate equations, with applications to  control of elastic structures;  (2) an analysis of systems of partial  differential systems which model population dynamics, with applications to  competitive and cooperative scenarios in social, political, military, and  environmental situations; (3) optimal control of chemotherapy treatment  scheduling in a model which describes the interaction of the immune system  with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the goal of reducing viral  replication rates; and (4) optimal control of hazardous waste disposal through  the process of bioremediation in which the control variable is the delivery  pattern of the essential nutrients that optimizes the efficiency of the  bioremediation process.  Th is project is jointly funded by the Applied  Mathematics Program and the Classical Analysis Program.",
