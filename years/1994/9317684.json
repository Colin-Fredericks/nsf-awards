 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317684  Welch    Ryanodine is a plant alkaloid which binds to a specific receptor,an  intracellular calcium release channel, first identified at the  triad junction of skeletal muscle.  Subsequently, ryanodine  receptors (RyR) have been found in many non-muscle cells including  cells of the central nervous system.  Ryanodine has been shown to  be a powerful effector of calcium regulation in muscle.  Although  the ryanodine molecule is complex, important stearic and  electrostatic interactions can be localized to relatively small,  specific regions of the molecule.  The overall goal of this project  is to elucidate the relationship between ligand structure and the  biological activities of the ryanoids.  The aims are to (1) develop  biologically active ryanoids with minimal structure, (2) develop  agents which effect specific alterations in RyR properties,  (3)define the mammalian skeletal muscle ryanodine binding site,  (4)lay the groundwork for development of RyR isoform-specific  agents and (5) define endogenous effectors.  This project will  focus on rabbit skeletal muscle RyR.   Approaches will be: (I) New  ryanodine analogs will be developed.  (II) The biological activity  of these compounds will be assessed by measurements of ligand  binding to the RyR, the modulation of ion channel activity of the  RyR using ionic flux and planar lipid bilayer single channel  measurements, and functional effects on intact cells.  (III) The  conformations of the ryanoids will be deduced from the covalent  structures by molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics and quantum  mechanics.  The deduced conformations will be compared to NMR or  crystallographic data whenever possible (for example, the X-ray and  NMR structures of ryanodine have been solved).  A comparative  molecular field analysis (ComFA) will be produced for selected  analogs, and correlations between the stearic and electrostatic  fields computed to discern the relationship between the biological  activities and the structure of the ryanodine a nalogs.  (IV) The  results of the CoMFA will be used to design new ryanoids for  testing, refinement and correction of hypotheses.  %%%  Calcium ion regulates many critical cellular functions such as  muscle contraction.  The levels of calcium free in cells are  precisely regulated by physiological control mechanisms.  Ryanodine  is a plant alkaloid which has a powerful effect on calcium  regulation in cells and can serve as a useful tool in studying   calcium control mechanisms. Ryanodine acts by binding to a specific  receptor, an intracellular calcium release channel.  Ryanodine  receptors were first identified in skeletal muscle, but have also  been found in many non-muscle cells including cells of the central  nervous system.  Although the ryanodine molecule is complex, its  functional interactions with its receptor can be localized to  relatively small, specific regions of the molecule.  The overall  goal of this project is to elucidate the relationship between the  structure and the biological activities of the ryanoids.  This will  result in the development of important new probes which will  enhance our understanding of cellular calcium regulation.  ***",
