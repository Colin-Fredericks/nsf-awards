 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks partial support for a nonprofit workshop to be  conducted solely for the benefit of researchers and practitioners  in the signal processing, telecommunication, and mathematical  statistics communities.  Participation from individuals in  academia, industry, and government will be strongly encouraged.   This will be the second such workshop on cyclostationary signals,  and will be organized by the PI (Stephan V. Schell) and Dr. Chad M.  Spooner of Mission Research Corporation.  It is organized partially  in response to the consensus among attendees of the 1992 workshop  that another workshop should be held, and partially in response to  continued interest in the theory and applications of  cyclostationary signals among researchers and practitioners in  academia, industry, and government.    NSF support of this workshop would be used exclusively to encourage  recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students working in the field to attend  the workshop.  This encouragement would be accomplished by  providing an offset to the travel expenses incurred by these  participants.",
