There are generally many ways of describing or  constructing shift systems which have essentially the same  dynamical behaviour.  Even in the one-dimensional case,  effectively recognizing when two concrete models are equivalent  is a fundamental open problem.  Another natural and related  problem is to understand the different equivalences or symmetries  between two systems.  One approach to the classification and  symmetry group problems for one-dimensional shift systems which  has led to progress on some of the main problems in the field in  recent years involves analogies from algebraic K-theory.  In  turn, the geometry of both discrete-time and continuous-time  dynamical systems and their symmetry groups has very naturally  given rise to a new type of positive algebraic K-theory for  ordered rings, using the usual row and column operations on  matrices, but with certain inequalities imposed.       The main mathematical structures under investigation here,  shift dynamical systems and Markov chains, are useful models for  phenomena in areas ranging from differential equations, to  statistical mechanics, to information and coding theory.   However, their usefulness is impaired by the surprising  difficulty of deciding when two shift systems which arose in  different ways enjoy essentially the same dynamical behaviour.   This is related to understanding the different equivalences or  symmetries between two systems.  (Symmetries of a given system  are often called reversible cellular automata.)  Now the  investigator has shown that a very abstract algebraic theory  known as algebraic K-theory can be invaluable in addressing some  of these problems.  Analogies from algebraic K-theory have led  unexpectedly to exciting progress on some of the main problems in  symbolic dynamics.  Moreover, looking at matters the other way  round has led  to a new type of K-theory, whose problems are of  interest both intrinsically and for the insight they will bring  back to dynamical systems and their symmetries.  ***",
