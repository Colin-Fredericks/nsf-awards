 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452148  Narten  This project aims to improve the productivity of computer science  programmers and improve the quality of the software they produce.  We are creating a computer laboratory in which closed laboratory  sessions teach students how to use flexible, general-purpose tools.  Instead of focusing on specialized tools (e.g., CASE tools for  software engineering), we examine tools useful in a wide variety of  contexts, including the emacs text editor, make, awk, the command  shell, and multiple windows. Using and studying powerful tools make  students more productive software developers and allow them the  benefits of making software adaptable, customizable, and reusable.  Weekly laboratory sessions will be added to the three freshman and  sophomore introductory computer science courses required of all CS  majors and minors. In conjunction With the lab, we refocus the  emphasis in grading student programming assignments to provide  students with more detailed feedback on the design and structure of  their programs. Our goal is to teach students good programming  techniques at the time they are first learning how to program and  are picking up programming habits that they carry with them  throughout their careers. The novel ideas in this proposal include  having all freshman CS students learn and use general tools  starting with their first course, reinforcing the use of those  tools in the three consecutive courses required of all CS majors,  and having students revise and resubmit the programs they submit  for credit.",
