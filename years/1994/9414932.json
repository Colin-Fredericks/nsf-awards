 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1869, Claflin College, a historically black liberal arts college, in Orangeburg, South  Carolina, has been educating minority students for professional attainment in all academic areas,  including the sciences.  The James S. Thomas Science Center is home to the Division of Natural  Sciences and Mathematics, which includes the departments of biology chemistry, mathematics  and computer Science.  Originally designed to meet undergraduate teaching needs, all research  and research training is conducted in the building.  Therefore it is critical that the college  renovate space conducive for conducting research activities.  With support from the Academic  Research Infrastructure Program, rooms presently assigned for student research will be  consolidated, providing an efficient and interactive arrangement.  Several infrastructural utilities  will be upgraded and distilled water units will be installed to support experiments performed in  research laboratories and the greenhouse.  The chemical storage facility will be upgraded to met  safety requirements.  The availability of sufficient research space will allow students and faculty  to undertake research in molecular biology, environmental chemistry and computer science.  The  implementation of the renovation project will have a positive influence on increasing the  enrollment in the sciences,  and improving the performance of science graduates. Preparing  graduates to successfully compete in graduate school will increase the pool of minority scientists  and role models, immediately and for the future.",
