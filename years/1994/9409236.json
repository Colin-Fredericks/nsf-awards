 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has an effect on ventilation rate in animals, and some of the cellular mechanisms for that regulation are known.  In reptiles and amphibians, some of the olfactory receptor cells in the nose apparently are sensitive to CO2, but how these cells respond, and how they may contribute to controlling breathing remains unknown.  There is some evidence that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase is required to detect changes in CO2 in other systems.  This project addresses the role of carbonic anhydrase in detecting CO2 in the frog olfactory receptors.  The physiological response of the summed receptor potential of a population of olfactory cells in the epithelium is recorded before and after application of an inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase.  Histological experiments will determine the location of carbonic anhydrase contained in cells in the nasal epithelium, to correlate with the physiological data.  Results will increase our understanding of chemoreception and of ventilation control mechanisms, and so will have impact on general physiology as well as sensory neuroscience.",
