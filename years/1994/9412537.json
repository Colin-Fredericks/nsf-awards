 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jochim    With national Science Foundation support, Drs. Michael Jochim and  Margaret Glass will continue their archaeological study of an  area of Southern Germany which runs from the Swabian Alb, across  the Danube River to the Alps. It thus includes a variety of  environmental zones. Archaeological evidence indicates that human  prehistoric occupation was extensive and ranged across time to  include Paleolithic hunters and gatherers, specialist Mesolithic  collectors and Neolithic agriculturalists. Drs. Jochim and Glass  want to understand how humans adapted to this region under the  different climatic conditions which include both the terminal Ice  Age and warmer postglacial times. To accomplish this, they will  compile a data base which contains both environmental and  cultural information and will integrate these materials through  use of a geographic information system (GIS). Known sites will be  recorded and overlain on an environmental base. Both surface and  subsurface survey will then be employed to locate additional  archaeological occurrences. The GIS will permit the team to  relate behavior to environment and to determine how behavior  changed in different subregions, in different climatic regimes,  and at different levels of technological development.    This research is important because it will provide insight into  how humans adapt to and interact with their environment. This  process is dynamic, not static and archaeological data, which  covers long periods of time provide unique insight into this  issue. The project will also produce data of interest to many  archaeologists and will assist in the training of graduate  students.",
