 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of wavelet               transform technique as applied to the analysis of mechanical                    transients. Such transients are strong indicators of impending                  machine and machine component failure. Transients are signals                   which are much smaller in duration than the observation interval,               and are non-periodic, non-stationary, and often non-symmetrical.                The wavelet transform method is used as a powerful diagnostic                   tool for transient detection and classification. Typical examples               include generator arcing, rubbing in journal bearings, and spills               in internal combustion-engines. Significant improvements are made               in the repeatability of coefficients for modulated transients, in               the separability of transients using a mixed probability density                function approach, in the detectability using the transform as a                matched filter and using artificial neural network, and in the                  general performance of approach by automating the classification.               In addition, tests are conducted extensively on real data. The                  results of this research provide an industrial tool as powerful                 for the analysis of transients as the spectrum analyzer is for                  the analysis of periodic waveforms.*** //",
