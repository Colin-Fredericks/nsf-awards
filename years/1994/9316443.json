Pleistocene Lake Manly  in Death Valley was the end point for river discharges during the  Quaternary.  The supply of runoff was from three major sources:   The Owens River system draining the eastern slopes of the Sierra  Nevada in response to glacial meltwaters, the Mojave River draining  the San Bernardino Mountains in response to precipitation due to  orographic uplift over the Transverse Ranges, and the Amargosa  River which heads in the lower Black and Timber Mountains.   Presently, the Amargosa is the only river to flow into Death  Valley.  This project will address 1) how the Amargosa River  acquired its surface flow, from anamolous climatic conditions, or  from groundwater, and 2) the relative role the Amargosa River  discharge has in contributing to lake-building events in Death  Valley during the late Quaternary.  Understanding the geomorphic  and hydrologic evolution of the Amargosa River system is important  for the following reasons; (1) It contributions a significant  15,540 Km2 to the total potential drainage area of Death Valley in  the late Quarternary (Hunt et al., 1966)  (2) Amargosa River  surface runoff comes from a low-elevation drainage system that may  serve as a paleoclimatic indicator of late Quaternary climatic  regimes unaffected by glaciation or high elevation orographic  precipitation. (3) The drainage basin of the Amargosa River lies on  the periphery of climatic/physiographic zones where it has the  potential to indicate large-scale climatic fluctuations preserved  in fluvial/lacustrine sediments.  (4) it drains the potential site  of the nations's proposed high-level radioactive waste repository  at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  We propose to (a) reconstruct the late  quaternary flood history of the Amargosa River (b) determine the  modern  hydrologic and climatic conditions for floo ding  (c)  reconstruct late Quaternary lake-building events in Death Valley  and (d) the late Quaternary flood histories of the major drainages  and their relationship to paleoclimate dynamics.    ***",
