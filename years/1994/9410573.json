This  phenomenon of social referencing will be examined in two  overlapping short-term longitudinal studies which will follow the  individual development of social referencing during the period of  initial establishment during infancy (cohort 1) and during the  subsequent development later in the toddler period (cohort 2);   the studies overlap at the 12- and 18-month assessments.  Each  study includes four occasions of observation and at each  occasion, each parent-child dyad is exposed to at least three  different stimulus events that permit social referencing to  occur.  This design allows for examination of individual  consistency in behavior across stimulus events at a single point  in development and stability in behavior across development.  In  order to link the development of social referencing to other  related developmental milestones, measures of physical  development, communication development, and social development  are obtained and links with social referencing are examined.         People who are faced with situations of uncertainty, in  which they don't know what to do, are influenced by other  persons' interpretations of the situation.  Recent research has  provided evidence that even young infants, when confronted with  uncertainty, engage in social referencing of others.  When  infants encounter situations that seem potentially threatening,  they often check their parents' emotional reactions before  deciding how to behave.  The process of using the emotional  expressions of other people to make sense of ambiguous situations  is called social referencing. This important strategy for  interpreting new or mystifying events and figuring out how to  respond to them is an important process by which children and  adults are socialized int o thinking and feeling in ways that are  consensually accepted in a society. This project focuses on the  very early development of social referencing in infants.  Two  overlapping short-term longitudinal studies will follow the  individual development of social referencing during the period of  initial establishment during infancy and during the subsequent  development later in the toddler period.  The research design  allows for examination of individual consistency in social  referencing behavior across stimulus events at a single point in  development and stability in behavior across development.  In  order to link the development of social referencing to other  related developmental milestones, its associations with physical  development, communication development, and social development  will be examined. This study will provide information about the  early development of one important process of social influence by  which young children are socialized to adopt the behavior and the  affect of those in their environment.  ***",
