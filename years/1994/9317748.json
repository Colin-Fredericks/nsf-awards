The systems to  be studied are mostly prepared using state-of-the-art thin film  deposition and  electron beam and scanning tunneling lithography  techniques.  The condensed matter problems studied include dimensional  transitions from zero to one, one to two, and two to three dimensions  in superconductivity and magnetism.  A crucial and essential  ingredient proposed here is the structural and chemical  characterization of the artificial structures used in these studies.  The materials will be grown using sputtering and molecular beam  epitaxi.  The growth techniques will be correlated with in situ and ex  situ structural characterization techniques combined with simulation  and refinement methods developed in the principal investigator's  laboratory.    Non-technical abstract:  The study of novel materials in restricted  geometries provides the basic research basis and is directly related  to applications in the field of microelectronics, including the  development of novel sensors, devices and recording media.   The  condensed matter problems studied include dimensional transitions from  zero to one to two and three dimensions in superconductivity and  magnetism.  A crucial and essential ingredient proposed here is the  structural and chemical characterization of the artificial structures  used in these studies.  The materials will be grown using a variety of  growth techniques.  The growth techniques will be correlated with  structural characterization techniques developed in the principal  investigator's laboratory.  ***",
