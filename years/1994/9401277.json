The work revolves  around ideas relating to oscillatory integrals and their  applications.  Oscillatory integrals are an essential part of  harmonic analysis.  There are two kinds.  The first involves a  single function acting as a generalized Fourier transform with  nonlinear exponent.  The second is given by an integral operator  with a kernel carrying oscillatory factors.  This project  involves studies of both kinds.   An important class of  oscillatory integrals of the second kind is the class oscillatory  singular integrals.  As a combination of oscillatory integral and  singular integral, these operators are intimately connected to  problems concerning the convergence of Fourier series, singular  harmonic analysis on the Heisenberg group and other nilpotent Lie  groups and singular Radon transforms.  The project involves a  systematic study of oscillatory integrals to examine their  boundedness properties when applied to Lebesgue spaces, weak  (1,1)-boundedness, boundedness on Hardy spaces, optimal decay in  the quadratic norm and applications to convolution with measures  supported on submanifolds.       Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are  examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing a continuous decomposition. More recently the theory  of oscillatory integrals added new dimensions to some of the more  classical approaches to harmonic analysis.  ***",
