In addition to identifying further research needs, the  investigator plans on considering the potential role that a  museum exhibit could have in increasing public awareness of the  role played by synthetic materials in fabricating water supply,  distribution, storm and sanitary drainage components of the urban  infrastructure.  Special emphasis in this project is on those  components of the urban infrastructure that impact directly on  environmental and public health in contrast those that  concentrate on structures such as roads, bridges and buildings.    Results of this project are expected to assist in providing a  basis for determination of research needs and thus be useful for  program planning purposes.  The undergraduate student who will  assist the Principal Investigator on this project is Amy L.  Fetzner.  ***",
