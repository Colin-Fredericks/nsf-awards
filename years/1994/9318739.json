 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318739  Jain  Theoretical research will be done on the Fractional Quantum Hall  Effect.  The basis for this work is the composite fermion model  proposed by the principal investigator a few years ago.  This model  has recently been shown to explain well the Hall state at half-  filling.  In this renewal grant, the composite fermion model will  be further developed and applied to other aspects of the Fractional  Quantum Hall Effect with a particular emphasis on quantitative  agreement with experiment.  %%%  The quantum Hall state represents an exciting new state of matter  which has occupied researchers attention since its discovery a  decade ago.  This state of matter is one in which the electrons  interact very strongly and the usual techniques of condensed matter  physics fail.  The work to be done here deals with a model which  connects two different aspects of the Hall state under a common  theoretical formalism.  This work addresses very fundamental issues  in condensed matter physics and, at the same time, provides an  understanding which may impact the behavior of semiconductor  devices.  ***",
