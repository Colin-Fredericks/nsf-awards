The  US Panel on Structural Control Researches co-sponsoring the 1WCSC  with the Japan Panel on Structural Response Control.    The Panel. which was established in 1990, is charged wit the  following responsibilities: (1) facilitating the transmission of  information concerning state-of-the-art developments in the  field; (2)identifying and prioritizing needed research and  development; (3) developing preliminary plans for analytical and  experimental advancement in the field; and (4) developing plans  for the performance of full-scale testing and demonstration.    The Panel has assisted in convening several major workshops to  define the research directions and in NSF's Structural Control  Initiative.  The convening of 1WCSC will maintain the leadership  of the U.S. Panel in the international arena that is related to  the field of smart materials and systems an essential technology  area for the U.S. scientific community to be competitive in.  Furthermore, the joint funding and sponsorship of the Conference  with Japan will strengthen and develop new, major collaborative  efforts between the U.S. and Japan researchers in the emerging  fields covered by the Conference.  ***",
