 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406597  LAWSON       Households frequently migrate from one residential location  to another in search of better employment opportunities, but  relatively little attention has been given to examining the ways  that the different roles of women and men in households affect  their expectations before they migrate and their experiences  after they migrate.  Of particular concern are the ways that  different household roles and responsibilities for women and men  impinge upon their participation in the labor market, influence  their spatial mobility and their choice of destinations, and  affect their lives and household relationships after they have  moved.  This doctoral dissertation research project will compare  gender-related facets of migration within households and within  labor markets in two different parts of Indonesia.  The study  areas include both semi-urban and rural areas.  During lengthy  visits to each study area, in-depth interviews will be conducted  with both women and men and ethnographic data will be collected  and analyzed in order to obtain information about income levels,  relative allocations of time, and other variables before and  after moves.  These site-specific data will be analyzed with  reference to census and independently gathered village-level data  to ensure that the local samples are representative of broader  populations.  During the conduct of this work, the doctoral  student will collaborate with researchers at Indonesian  universities in Jakarta and Ujang Pandung.       This project will make a number of important contributions.  The comparative case studies will shed new light on the dynamics  of social and economic change in parts of Indonesia that have  experienced significant rates of in-migration in recent decades.  Because of the careful way in which the studies are structured,  the project will contribute to more general understandings of  gender-based differences in the migration experience of lower-  income residents in developing nations.  As a doc toral  dissertation research improvement award, this award also will  provide support to enable a promising student to establish a  strong independent research career.",
