 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317082  Banfield       The research in this proposal aims to bridge the gap between  natural and experimental mineral weathering studies by combining  high-resolution electron microscopic characterization of both sets  of reactions with dissolution kinetic data.  Research involves  chain silicate minerals.  Chain silicates have been selected  because of their geochemical importance and because their  structures are sufficiently similar to those of clay products to  allow us to predict that transformations might, under some  conditions, involve some structural inheritance.  Furthermore,  through collaborative arrangements, a suitable selection of  experimentally reacted materials and dissolution rate data are  available.        We have tested the proposed approach by comparing naturally  and experimentally weathered pyroxenoid minerals.  Results reveal  sub-nanometer-scale details of both experimentally and naturally  reacted surfaces and provide insights into reaction mechanisms.   Initial results show Si-rich leached layers on experimentally  reacted pyroxenoids.  Thus, models to explain measured congruent  dissolution rates must account for the fact that Si entering  solution may be largely derived from the leached-layer-solution  interface.  We find preliminary evidence for recrystallization of  the gel layer.  Thus, rates may also be limited by transport  properties, solubility, and crystallinity of the gel.  Initial data  for natural weathering reactions are consistent with at least  partial inheritance of polymerized units by smectite reaction  products.  Thus, we hypothesize that rates for pyroxenes may  reflect incomplete depolymerization of the silicate chains under  both laboratory and natural conditions.       The proposed work has two major goals.  First, we will  characterize the compositional, volumetric, mineralogical, and  structural aspects of natural pyroxene reactions and examine the  influence of microstructures (e.g., exsolution lamellae, grain  boundaries, antiphase bounda ries, chain width defects, dilocations)  on relative reaction rates.  Second, we will characterize  experimentally reacted pyroxenes and pyroxenoids and combine these  data with rate measurements to clarify details of possible  dissolution kinetic models.  Through this approach we hope to  enhance current understanding of the mechanisms and products of  weathering reactions and the conditions under, and extent to which,  experimentally measured rates apply to natural processes.",
