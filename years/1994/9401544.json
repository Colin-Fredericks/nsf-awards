Work by this investigator and co-workers on quasitriangularity  led to the development of a sub-optimization formula which has  impacted recent work by others in control theory with  applications to electrical and aeronautical engineering.  The  plan is to continue work in this direction.  A second area of the  plan concerns problems related to triangular and semitriangular  operators, and to reflexivity, that arose out of prior work by  this investigator and co-workers which yielded counterexamples to  open questions on these topics.  The third area of the plan  concerns an operator-theoretic approach to certain aspects of  orthogonal wavelet theory obtained by interpreting orthogonal  wavelets as wandering vectors for a special set of unitary  operators on Hilbert space.  The new idea used is that the set of  all orthogonal wavelets for the usual dilation-translation  wavelet system (D,T) on the Hilbert space of square- integrable  complex functions on the real line can be parameterized in a  natural way by a single wavelet v together with the set of all  unitary operators in the local commutant of the system at x.   Analysis of this unitary set yields information concerning the  set W(D,T) of all orthogonal wavelets.       The research plan involves three separate but related  projects.  The first builds onto  previous work by this  investigator in the area of operator algebras.  A  formula which  was derived three years ago to solve an open problem in pure  mathematics has recently  impacted  applications-oriented  research projects of several mathematicians and engineers working  incontrol theory. Further work in this connection is being  pursued.  The second project continues previous work on  properties of single operators and dual operator algebras.   Recent successes here include counter examples which have  impacted work of several other mathemati cians.  The third project  concerns wavelets.  Wavelet analysis has been the scene of a  sizable research drive in mathematics and engineering during the  past few years.  The new concept utilized in this project is the  idea of determining new wavelets and functional properties of  wavelets by analyzing structural properties of a certain  naturally related set of operators, using established techniques  of single operator theory and operator algebras.  This overall   plan accomodates the dissertation research of four doctoral  students.  ***",
