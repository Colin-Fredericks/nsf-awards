The project is organized  around instances of the following two general questions: Which  results on cardinal functions of compact spaces generalize to  countably compact spaces, and under which conditions do the  latter properties (at least consistently) already imply  compactness of the space?  Which results on compact spaces and  continuous mappings can be generalized to countably compact  spaces if the space is a topological group (and the mapping is  also a homomorphism)?       The concept of compactness of a topological space lies at  the heart of General Topology; it is its most important idea from  the point of view of applications.  In order to understand the  notion of compactness fully, one has also to study weakenings of  the compactness property.  Perhaps the most important such  weakening is a property called countable compactness.  The aim of  the project is to determine which theorems about compact spaces  and continuous functions between compact spaces remain valid if  the spaces in question are only assumed to be countably compact  instead of compact.  A similar investigation will be done for  topological groups, that is, for spaces which in addition to the  topology also carry the structure of an algebraic group.  ***",
