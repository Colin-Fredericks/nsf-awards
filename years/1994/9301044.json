 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301044  Jackiewicz    This two-year award supports US-Italy cooperative research in  waveform relaxation methods between Zdzislaw Jackiewicz, Arizona  State University, and Alfredo Bellen, University of Trieste,  Italy.  The objective of their research is to investigate  convergence, order, stability, and contractivity properties of  time-point relaxation and waveform relaxation Runge-Kutta methods  for ordinary differential equations.  Such methods are  appropriate in a parallel computing environment and have been  successfully used for time domain analysis of large dynamical  systems.      Jackiewicz and Bellen are specialists in waveform relaxation  methods, which aim to develop effective numerical methods for  systems of ordinary differential equations.  The topic area is  important because systems of ordinary differential equations  arise naturally in modeling a variety of important physical,  biological, and geological phenomena and in many industrial  applications.  This collaboration allows the Italian expertise in  parallel methods for differential equations to be complemented by  Jackiewicz's experience in general linear methods for  differential equations.  This should lead to a better  understanding of numerical solution of ordinary differential  equations in a parallel computing environment.  * * *",
