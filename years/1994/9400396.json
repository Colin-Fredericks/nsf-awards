 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at Harvard University supports interactive research  in four major groups covering a broad area of condensed  matter and materials science.    Researchers in the group focused on new materials are  concerned with synthesis, characterization, and theoretical  studies of superconductors and superhard carbon-based  materials.  Investigators in the group concerned with  interfaces  focus on collaborative aspects of interface  science including organic monolayers and thin films, wetting  and nucleation, mechanisms of interface motion in amorphous  materials, and characterization of semiconductor surfaces.  The group investigating electronic and photonic  nanostructures addresses size effects and new electronic and  photonic phenomena in a variety of materials.  The group of  researchers involved with design and manufacturing issues  aims to develop a new paradigm for choosing the optimum  materials and processes necessary to manufacture a  component.    The MRSEC also supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research,  has a minority fellowship program, and  fosters research  participation by undergraduates.  The MRSEC administers an  industrial outreach program which is likely to be enhanced  by the activities in design and manufacturing.  The MRSEC  currently supports 23 senior investigators, 12 postdoctoral  research associates, 9 technical staff members, 16 graduate  students, and 8 undergraduates.  The Harvard MRSEC is  directed by Professor Frans Spaepen.",
