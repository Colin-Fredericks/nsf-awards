 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request has been made for funding to help offset the costs of travel of invited speakers from Eastern Europe and Russia, graduate student (USA) travel, and publication costs in conjunction with the 12th International Symposium on Plasma Chemistry (ISPC 12) to be held at the University of Minnesota on August 21-26, 1995.  The ISPC serves as the primary international forum for researchers in the areas of plasma chemistry and plasma processing.  Topics ranging from the basic physics and chemistry of discharges to the modeling of industrial plasma processing and techniques will be covered.  It is expected that the conference will attract 500-700 participants, with representation from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  A strong effort is planned to attract researchers from Eastern Europe and Russia.  To that end a special workshop will be organized which will highlight research areas in which they are in the forefront.  This particular aspect of the meeting makes it especially attractive since the U.S. stands to gain much from such an interchange.  Special arrangements will also be made to encourage graduate student attendance by having reduced registration and inexpensive dormitory lodgings and partial travel support available to them.",
