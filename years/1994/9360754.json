 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360754  Morford  The Microsoft Windows NT (New Technology) Operating System  will be released in the second half of 1993, and is totally  inaccessible to visually impaired students and business  professionals.  This operating system will be in many colleges and  universities for science and mathematics courses and will severely  hinder the educational and career opportunities for visually  impaired people.  The goal of the Graphic Access New Technology  (GANT) project is to make Windows NT accessible to visually  impaired persons.  Automated Functions, Inc. (AFI) will design and  develop software that will accurately map the two dimensional  Windows NT graphic display to the one dimensional medium of speech.   GANT will use a innovative multiple task approach which uses  artificial intelligence pattern matching technology to accurately  convert the graphic pattern to text character.  AFI is expert in  the design and development of adaptive aids to assist visually  impaired people.  The GANT team is familiar with graphic based  operating systems and understands the needs of persons with visual  impairments.  A successful GANT system will enable visually  impaired people to use the same Windows NT System as their sighted  peers, enabling access to mathematics and science related courses  and professions without any sighted assistance. ***",
