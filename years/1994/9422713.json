 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422713 Hardwick  This award is made in support of the NSF initiative ENG-CISE-IITA94,  National Challenges.  It  is a joint initiative between the Engineering Directorate and the Computer Information and Engineering Directorate.  This is a joint award to the University of Iowa (ECS-9422722) and Rensselear Polytechnic Institute (ECS-9422713) in the National Challenge area of Advanced Manufacturing Technology.  It provides funding for an investigation into the requirements placed on product models of assemblies to support simulation based concurrent design of mechanical systems. It provides funding for an investigation into methods for coordinating design changes that result from simulations over a network, and funding for evaluating the ability of the product models of the ISO STEP standard (Standard for the Exchange of Product model data)  to support simulation-based concurrent design tools and a networked integration infrastructure.  An integrated simulation-based concurrent engineering environment will be constructed that will permit all members of a product development team to simulate the performance and effectiveness of product and process designs at a level of fidelity comparable to that which can be achieved using physical prototypes.  The simulation-based design environment produced will support the development of large scale mechanical system applications, particularly tracked and wheeled vehicle systems. The technology produced will reduce the time and cost of testing and introduce high quality products into the market in a shorter time than that required by conventional development methods.  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will be responsible for creating the product models, exchange of product models between engineering systems using STEP , and development of tools to support work flow control and engineering change processing.  The University of Iowa will verify these product models by integrating their CAD and design simulation tools with the product databases, performing simulat ions from multiple design perspectives, generating engineering design changes, and working with Rensselaer to develop tool to support work flow and engineering change processing.  Caterpillar Inc. of Peoris, and PDES, Inc., a joint industry/government consortium including Boeing, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, Hughes, IBM, and Lockheed will be involved with the review of the progress.",
