 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Crane is undertaking a case study of how electronic tools can  not only help researchers in Science and Technology Studies perform  traditional tasks more effectively, but can also make possible non-  traditional avenues of inquiry and can even open up bodies of  evidence to whole new groups. The case study he is using as a model  for the this field is Greek science.  He and his colleagues aim to  make more tractable and comprehensible to practicing scientists and  general historians the complexities of what is a very different, in  many ways alien, culture. Conversely, the scientific issues are  often equally obscure to those who are most familiar with the  culture.  They plan to exploit images, animations, notes, and the  general flexibility of the electronic environment so that the  cultural experts will be better able to come to grips with the  technical issues of such fields as biology, astronomy, and  mathematics.  They are thus designing an environment that  integrates more fully and naturally scientific and humanistic  issues.  By showing how science can be made accessible to humanists  and how the cultural context can be made accessible and  understandable to scientists, Dr. Crane promises to revolutionize  STS.  The aim is ultimately to transform the sources for Greek  science into a dynamic, readily updatable networked resource open  to any researcher on the electronic network.",
