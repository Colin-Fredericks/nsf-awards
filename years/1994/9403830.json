The requested funds are $10,000 to support graduate  student participation.  This international conference examines the  subject of solid -> solid phase transformations from both the  theoretical and experimental viewpoints in metallic, ceramic and  mineral systems.  The technical program includes 160 presentations,  12 invited talks, and 4 plenary lectures.  Focus groups are formed  to discuss (1) mathematical approaches; (2) teaching; (3) first  principal calculations; (4) elastic effects during coarsening; (5)  plastic deformation effects.  Over 200 people are expected to  attend, including several NSF scientists and scientists from other  countries.  %%%  Solid state phase transformations affect the properties of  materials used in industrial applications.  A key to improving  materials is understanding the nature and effects of these  transformations.  The conference provides scientists and engineers  involved in practical applications of materials an opportunity to  familiarize themselves with new developments in the field.   ***",
