For  further progress in plasma technology to occur, it is imperative  to supplement empirical knowledge with solid understanding of the  basic chemical processes involved. We will determine the  reactivity of plasma radicals at the surface of depositing films  using the IRIS (Imaging of Radicals Interacting with Surfaces)  technique that combines spatially-resolved laser-induced  fluorescence with plasma molecular beams.  We will examine plasma  deposited thin films as well as plasma environments that produce  films with desired qualities. Several analytical methods will be  used to characterize plasma environments and deposited films.  These include optical emission spectroscopy (OES), laser-induced  fluorescence, and light-scattering in the plasmas.  %%%  Plasmas have many industrial applications, including thin film  deposition and etching, surface modification, and polymer  synthesis. Plasma deposition is particularly versatile for  production of thin films and also provides environmentally-clean  routes to materials.  A primary aim of this work is to establish  plasma environments conducive to production of particular film  qualities or plasma species.  This research will contribute to  improving the general performance of advanced devices and  integrated circuits used in computing, information processing,  and telecommunications.  ***",
