 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the funding of five Graduate Research  Trainees to undertake research and training in the University of  Hawaii's Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology Program.    The students' training would expose them to one of the world's  most spectacular examples of adaptive radiation, provide first-  hand experience of Hawaii's native ecosystems, active  conservation policies, research and practice and integrate basic  knowledge with conservation practice in real situations.  The  training environment will be enhanced by an exchange agreement  with Cornell University at present being negotiated, the  development of a Center for Conservation Research and Training,  the closely-related Hawaii Evolutionary Biology Program, the  expansion of the Lyon Arboretum's role as a conservation research  area, and a summer field course with collaborating land managing  agencies.  The training will include a two-semester core course  that will provide professional level discussion of areas in  biology that are fundamental to the understanding of all biology.    Recruitment of ethnic minorities, already strong, will be  enhanced through keying in with existing undergraduate minority  programs.  Special efforts will be made to recruit women by  working through the American Association of University Women and  the American Women In Science.  Leading mainland candidates will  be flown to Hawaii for assessment.    To assist retention and the acquisition of skills students will  in the  first year be rotated through several research projects  with associated graduate faculty.",
