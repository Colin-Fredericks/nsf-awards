 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleague construct and explore a range  of physics-like models of computation, from chiefly conceptual to  more application-oriented.  Ballistic models of computation, for  example, suggest ways to exploit atomic-scale effects for  computer-logic operations.  Fine-grained digital models of  processes traditionally described by continuum methods (e.g.,  fluid dynamics) help in understanding what types of macroscopic  behavior can be obtained from given microscopic laws.         Information Mechanics is the study of computation viewed as a  distinguished mode of operation of dynamical systems with a  physics-like structure.  A main task for information mechanics is  to develop theoretical models of computation that more  expressively and accurately reflect essential aspects of the  underlying physics (such as locality, invertibility, inertia,  quantum character), opening the way to more direct and efficient  physical implementations of computing processes.  Results of this  line of investigation have a direct bearing on the theory and  practice of computation and on the computational modeling of  physics.  For example, logic invertibility is now being exploited  to reduce energy dissipation in computers; and lattice gases  provide theoretical models and simulation tools for a better  understanding of complex fluids.",
