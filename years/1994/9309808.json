Much  of modern growth economics has pointed toward education,  knowledge, and the coordination of talent as engines of  productivity expansion.  Forceful arguments and cross-national  evidence stress that the \"external\" effects of education are  critical to economic expansion.  Schooling seems to raise  productivity not only for those who receive it, but also for  those who live close to the well educated.  This research uses  evidence for American cities to (1) further test for the  existence of these external effects, (2) test the manner in which  these effects operate and (3) determine the magnitude of these  forces.  The methodology involves using both individual level  data from the census and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and  city level data.  Ultimately, the goal is to get an idea about  how intellectual spillovers work to enhance productivity and how  policy can use these spillovers to speed U.S. growth.  ***",
