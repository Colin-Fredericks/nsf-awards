This course is a major  component of the curriculum for junior-level physics majors and is  of vital importance in outfitting them with the ideas, tools and  experiences necessary to competently execute their Senior Theses,  the year-long independent research projects undertaken by all  fourth-year Reed students. Improvement of the Advanced Laboratory  will be realized through the development of eight modern physics  experimental stations and an updated presentation of  computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis (facilitated by  three new LabView systems). The eight stations will be constructed  from building-block components including a monochromatic light  source, digitizing oscilloscope, high resolution spectrometer,  temperature-controlled cryostat, tunable laser diode, multi-channel  analyzer and lock-in amplifier. A guided experiment will be  developed for each new station. Each of these experiments will  illustrate a physical concept of contemporary scientific importance  via research-style measurement methods and will provide experience  with generic data analysis techniques. The component-type nature of  these stations also will allow students to easily alter the  experimental parameters in search of new effects and to modify the  setups for independent projects. With the addition of these  flexible component-type stations, the Advanced Laboratory will  better fulfill its dual purpose of exposing junior-level physics  majors to the concerns and techniques of modern experimental  physics research and developing their skills as autonomous  researchers. Additionally, these stations will serve as a resource  for physics Thesis students.",
