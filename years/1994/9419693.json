 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archivists, librarians, and historians of science and technology in the Science and Technology Studies field are currently engaged in a number of new projects to preserve in digital format large bodies of material (text, sound recordings, images, video)  and to render them accessible, indexible, and searchable through a variety of different interfaces.  Other groups of  researchers in the STS field are engaged in designing software to be incorporated into the construction of multimedia databases and electronic digital libraries.   An urgent task for STS is to set priorities for tools and corpora that may join in the development of these digital libraries and to identify directions for future work most beneficial to the STS research community.    With support from this grant, a two day conference on the needs of the STS community is being held in New Orleans.  The aim is to bring together archivists and librarians engaged in digitization and preservation projects; researchers and scholars constructing multimedia databases in the STS field; computer scientists who have provided technical support and designed software for these projects; and representatives of funding agencies interested in digital libraries.  The meeting is being held prior to the national meetings of the History of Science Society, the 4S Society, and the Philosophy of Science Association, October 12-15, 1994.  A report of the conclusions of the conference will be made at the national meetings.",
