Major emphasis will be placed of cloning and  characterizing the lls1 gene as well as defining various  physiological and biochemical conditions that affect the expression  of the lls1 mutation.  We will continue to genetically characterize  Les* -2552, a DLM dominant mutant and to advance them further for  co-segregation analyses; co-segregation analysis on some mutants to  identify Mu-elements that may have caused these mutations will also  be attempted.  The action of lls1 appear to be cell autonomous  (confined to cells where it is expressed); on a number of plants,  somatic clonal sectors with sharp boundaries were observed either  as forward mutations or reversion events.  A new cloning strategy,  \"somatic tagging\", based on the use of these somatic sectors, is  being investigated.  Briefly, the Mu-hybridizing pattern of DNA  from adjacent mutant and wild type sectors is compared for  polymorphism.  Any extra band in the mutant DNA may harbor the Mu  element responsible for the mutation in question.  Using this  strategy a 6.5 kb Mu-1 hybridizing fragment has been identified  from one of the lls1 mutants and preliminary results from a co-  segregation analysis have indicated that this band is tightly  linked with the mutant allele.  We will also investigate the effect  of various physiological factors on the expression of lls1.  Our  preliminary studies have indicated that the expression of lls1 is  completely dependent on light.  Both the initiation and enlargement  of lls1 lesions are inhibited when the leaves are protected from  light.  However, lls1 mutants kept in the dark for about 48 hours  completely wilt and die within 10-12 hours upon return to light.   Normal siblings show no such damage.  On the other hand, continuous  bright light delays the onset and spread of lls1 lesions.  Another  physiological facto r, wounding, caused either by pin pricks or by  pathogen infections, induces lls1 lesions prematurely.  On leaves  which are not yet competent to express lls1 lesions, almost all  wounding or infection sites transform into lls1 lesions when the  potential to express lls1 somehow develops in these leaves.   Additionally, the expression of lls1 lesions is enhanced by  temperatures below 24 C and is very sensitive to the genetic  background of the plant.  From these observations, it seems likely  that lls1 may encode a factor that prevents maize cells from  cellular damage, possibly caused by free radical toxicity.  Similar  genes have recently been cloned from a number of animals, including  nematodes and humans.  %%%  A number of disease lesion mimic (DLM) mutations exist in maize  that promote the production of disease like symptoms in the absence  of any pathogen.  At present, nothing is known about the  biochemical nature of these mutations, or the function of the wild-  type alleles at these loci.  Since they are considered to  physiologically mimic the lesions caused during pathogen attack, it  has been suggested that some lesion mimic phenotypes may result  from mutations of disease development.  One feature that is common  to all lesion mimics is their association with cell death.   Accordingly, DLM mutations may represent excellent tools for  studying the genetic and cellular mechanisms controlling cell death  in plants.  ***",
