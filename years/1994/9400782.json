 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400782  Hofmann       This award supports mathematical research on problems in  singular integral theory and partial differential equations which  arise in connection with boundary value problems for parabolic  equations on non-smooth domains, whose boundaries are allowed to  vary with time.  The problems are motivated in part by physical  considerations, such as the expansion and contraction or  otherwise changing of shape of materials over time, and in part  by mathematical considerations.  The time-varying domains which  one would like to ultimately treat are in a natural sense  theparabolic analogues of the Lipschitz domains which have played  a prominent role in the elliptic theory in recent years.  The  main goal of the project is to solve initial boundary values  problems in this context by means of layer potentials.  Among the  tools which are likely to be employed or studied are the Rellich  identities, perturbation techniques, caloric measure  estimates, analysis of multilinear and nonlinear singular  integrals and the circle of ideas connected with theory of rough  singular integrals.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematicalmodeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  Among the  modern approaches to the study of these equations is the  application of singular integrals and the associated powerful  techniques of harmonic analysis.  ***",
