The goals are: 1. to identify key  advances in atmospheric technology that can be  applied to the Indian context, 2. to explore  establishment of a modern rainfall ground-truth  site in India for a Tropical Rainfall  Measurement Mission (TRMM) validation program,  and 3. to identify areas of mutual interest for  possible collaboration in atmospheric research  and instrumentation.  The technical sessions  will include topics in: weather radars, wind  profilers, advanced instruments for atmospheric  and surface measurements, mesoscale meteorology  and cloud physics, and aviation meteorology,  and hazards.  a proceedings will be published.    Scope:  The project is expected to include  scientists from Colorado State University and  from NCAR.  Also, at least one other USG agency  is expected to support its staff's  participation.  The study of the monsoon over  India is crucial to that country, and is also  very important to other countries around the  world, because of the impact of the monsoon on  the weather in other regions.  This planned  meeting will follow a similar binational  meeting held in December 1986.  It is receiving  strong support from the Government of India.   This project meets the objectives of the  Division of International Programs.  ***",
