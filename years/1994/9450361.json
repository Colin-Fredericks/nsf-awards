All teacher preparation institutions in the nine state area  of Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa,  Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, and Wyoming are invited to send  teams of four faculty, with at least one in mathematics and  one in mathematics education; other members of the team may  represent these areas or be administrators with interest in  pre-service preparation of teachers of mathematics.   Sessions of the workshop address the various roles  mathematics teacher educators play in moving toward systemic  change in mathematics education.  Of particular emphasis,  both in selecting participants and in organizing the content  of the sessions, is the joint responsibility mathematical  sciences and mathematics education faculty share in the pre-  service and continuing mathematical education of teachers of  school mathematics.  Working together these teacher  educators can reshape in a powerful way the undergraduate  curriculum in mathematics and have a strong impact on state  policies regarding initial certification, the development of  frameworks, and programs for additional endorsements.  Mathematics teacher educators also need to play more visible  roles in Statewide Systemic Initiatives efforts, State  Coalitions sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Education  Board, and state affiliates of national professional  associations.  Workshop sessions feature speakers as well as working groups  of institutional teams.  Speakers and advisory committee  members will be available as consultants.  Participants  develop a set of planned activities to be undertaken during  the 1994-1995 academic year.  During late spring and summer  of 1995, the outcomes from these activities will be  collected, compiled, and disseminated to all participants  and others interested in the revitaliza tion of undergraduate  mathematics education.  ***",
