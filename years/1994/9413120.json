 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413120, PI-Wunsch:  The Adaptive Critic Neural Network is a promising new technique of computational intelligence capable of solving large variety of applied problems in nonlinear dynamic identification, optimal real-time nonlinear control and time series forecasting.  This project will implement various Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs) in software based on different models of Neural Network and prove their efficiency for solving various problems in simulation.  IT will develop C/C++ code for all modules of ACDs in accordance with ANSI specification to provide a common graphical interface and portability across various platforms.  This will provide the tools for early industrial collaborations.  The PI will implement computer-simulated solutions of examples of complex identification problems (e.g., identification of chemical reactor dynamics), time series predictions (e.g., stock market forecasts) and those of complex optimal control problems (e.g., flight control of a Single -Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) plane).  These will come from published sources.  As application demands rise, and the volume of opportunities necessitates and rapid prototyping capability,  They will port these tools to a specialized neural coprocessor.  Proving numerically or theoretically the ability of ACD to approximate Lyapunov functions of a complex nonlinear dynamic system as a whole (i.e., a system  plus ACD-based controller), along with a study of real-time interaction of neural networks, is also a goal of the project.  This will significantly contribute to the knowledge of stability analysis of nonlinear dynamic systems.  Finally, these will be a special concentration on dissemination of the results, including educational activities for academia, industry and govern ment; software available for ftp, workshops, enhanced publishing, and further collaborations with government and industry.  This work will enhance the success of both neural networks and nonlinear controls as engineering disciplines by providing better tools and reducing the learning curve associated with their use.",
