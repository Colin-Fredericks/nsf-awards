 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320007  Whalen    In a collaborative project, Drs. Paul Minnis and Michael Whalen  will conduct archaeological research in the Casas Grande region  of northern Mexico. The ruins of the great adobe pueblo of  Paquime have consistently impressed visitors from Spanish  explorers to modern archaeologists. However research in the  region has been sporadic and the role which this site once played  and the extent of its influence are unclear. Drs. Minnis and  Whalen plan to conduct a systematic archaeological survey of the  surrounding area in order to situate Paquime within a broader  regional context. They will define \"inner\" and \"outer\" zones at  varying distances from the site and locate archaeological  occurrences within each. The size of material scatters and  associated structures and agricultural features will be noted.  \"Exotic\" or imported materials as well as selected pottery  samples will be collected and analyzed. The goal of the work is  to collect data on chronological and spatial variability in the  size, type and distribution of such sites, of productive and  ritual facilities and of artifacts. On this basis it will be  possible to trace the degree of control out from the center of  Paquime and to determine how this changed over time.    For many years archaeologists have studied prehistoric cultures  of the U.S. Southwest and have gained considerable insight into  the development of these societies which, at their height,  constructed pueblos which housed hundreds of individuals in a  complex stratified societies. However neither the origin nor the  geographic extent of these systems are well understood. While the  Rio Grande river today constitutes a international boundary, it  did not serve a significant function in the past. It is well  known that the Southwestern cultures extended South into Mexico  but comparatively little work has been done in this area. This  gap should be filled because further to the South groups such as  the Aztecs and their predecessors were present and th e degree of  stimulus they provided to the development of complex societies  further North is unknown.    This research is important because it will fill an important  archaeological gap in the New World. It will shed light on the  development of prehistoric cultures in the United States and  provide data of interest to many archaeologists.  ***",
