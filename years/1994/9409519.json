 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409519  Johnson       This research is aimed at developing supply chain models to  facilitate the analysis of the delivery performance of a product.   The supply chain of a product is the interdependent network of  activities from procurement of raw material through final  distribution.  Supply chain models are analytical tools for  analyzing the delivery performance of a product.  To buffer against  uncertainty in demand, manufacturers often hold excess inventory or  maintain excess capacity.  The models to be develop will analyze  tradeoffs between buffering with capacity and inventory.  These  models will aid in capacity planning and inventory control.       The outcome of this research will contribute to supply chain  theory through the development of models which reflect  manufacturing capacity limitations.  The results will provide some  guide to engineers and production managers in the design of supply  chain software.  Furthermore, knowledge will be gained as to when  supply chain models are applicable and how model results should be  interpreted by management.",
