 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will help the  Department of Chemistry at Stanford University acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and  solid state accessories to be used to upgrade the existing 400 MHz NMR spectrometer which will  be used in research.  The research activities to be supported include:  (1) studies on the  molecular basis of carcinogenesis, solution structures of peptide receptors, the synthesis and  mode of action of DNA cleaving agents, the synthesis of taxol analogues and studies on their  mode of action, mechanistic and synthetic organometallic chemistry, and mechanistic and  synthetic photochemistry, (2) stereochemistry and mechanism of organometallic reactions  in polymer synthesis and catalysis, (3) new approaches for synthetic efficiency, (4)  mechanistic enzymology of oxidosqualene cyclization, (5) Coenzyme A Analogs as Probes  of Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms, and (6) Theoretical and Computational X-ray  Absorption Spectroscopy.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
