 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal is to examine the mechanisms through  which integrins function during development.  Drosophila is  a model system for examining the functions of integrins  since combined classical and molecular genetic techniques  can be used to address the roles of integrins in a complex  developing organism.  The cellular molecules that associate  with integrins, determine their genetic regulation and their  potential roles in developmental signal transduction  pathways  will be identified and characterized.  Experimentally, the functional significance of two highly  conserved regions of the beta subunit of the Drosophila  position specific integrin family, which is encoded by the  lehthal(1)myospheroid (mys) gene will be determined.  One  region is derived from alternate splicing of mys and is  thought to be in or near a region required for ligand  binding and alpha/beta dimerization.  Previous studies  indicated that both alternate forms of the position specific  integrin family contributed to embryonic development.  The  alternate forms of position specific integrin family may  influence binding to particular ligands or alpha subunits  during specific embryonic processes.  The functional  significance of the small and highly conserved cytoplasmic  domain of the position specific integrin family is also  addressed in this proposal.  This region is associated with  the cytoskeleton and intracellular communication.  The  experiments in this proposal will address the following  questions: 1)  Which embryonic processes require the  position specific integrins?  2)  Which of these processes  can function normally with a particular form of the position  specific integrin family?  3)  Where are the alternative  mRNAs of mys and the alternative forms of the integrins  found in the developing embryo?  4)  Do particular forms of  the position specific integrin family influence cell  spreading on specific matrix molecules and influence  dimerization with alpha subunits?  5)  Which regions of the  cy toplasmic domain of the integrins affect developmental  processes?  6)  What are the molecules that associate with  the position specific integrins?  These questions will be  answered using molecular, genetic and cellular techniques.",
