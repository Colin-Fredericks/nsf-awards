This Alliance will establish and deliver a  new training program on the use of photonics technologies, tools,  and systems in the manufacturing workplace.  Photonics is the  program focus because it is a broad enabling technology for modern  manufacturing, the basis for an emerging global industry, and a  pervasive technology in modem warfare.  This program will help  assimilate earlier government investment in photonics into the  manufacturing economy by providing skilled workers for a multitude  of dual-use applications.  The program targets displaced defense  industry engineers, former members of the armed forces, and  manufacturing engineers in the commercial and defense sectors.   Curricula will be developed and delivered jointly by  representatives from industry and academia, and will consist of  intensive two-week classroom/laboratory courses.  Courses will be  held at established academic and industrial sites, and long-  distance training opportunities such as videotaped courses and  live, interactive video will be pursued.  ***",
