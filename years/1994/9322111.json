The participants will be involved in  closely related, individual projects in nine laboratories within  the Department of Physics and Center for Laser Research.  The  projects will focus on the properties of laser-host and electro-  optic materials, such as oxide and fluoride glasses, lithium  yttrium fluoride, bismuth silicon oxide, and III-V and II-VI  semiconductor compounds and quantum well devices, all of which  have present or near term application in optical devices.  The  participants will be actively involved in nine related projects  involving crystal growth, time-resolved site-selection  spectroscopy, laser instabilities, growth and optical  characterization of quantum well structures, thermal and  electrical transport properties, light scattering, and thermally  and optically stimulated luminescence.  %%%  This program introduces outstanding undergraduate scientists to  the area of optical materials and lasers at a formative stage in  their careers.  The materials to be investigated (e.g., laser  host, electro-optic, photo refractive and colloidal) are high  technology materials for current and future generation optical  systems.  All of the investigations will be undertaken in state-  of-the-art laboratories.  All of the faculty mentors have had  successful experience with undergraduates in their laboratories.  Particular emphasis will be given to the participation of women  and minorities.  ***",
