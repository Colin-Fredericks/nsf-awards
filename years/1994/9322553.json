Among these the most prevalent have been based upon the standard topdown structured analysis and design. This methodology is associated with the traditional procedure-oriented paradigm. However, the introduction of other paradigms such as logic-oriented, object- oriented and database-oriented paradigms suggested the possibility of developing new design methodologies. In particular, there is currently extensive research in integrating the logic-oriented, object-oriented and database-oriented design paradigms. The study of systems that are based on these multi-paradigms, provides a rich spectrum for undergraduate research.    Undergraduate research, like any other kind of research, is open- ended, requires innovation, and involves the incorporation of knowledge from a variety of sources. Research experiences includes experimentation, the comparison and evaluation of different viewpoints, and the production of publishable papers and their presentation to peer groups and professional organizations. The undergraduate researchers will review software development methodologies and will get instruction on the use of CASE tools. They will gain insight into the multi-paradigms involved in the study, and, they will learn how different paradigms encourage alternate solutions to problems.     This center has four primary goals:     (1) The involvement in research of undergraduates from underrepresented groups,     (2)  The exposure of these undergraduates to the state-of-the-art software engineering methodologies,     (3)   The research in multi-paradigm software design, and     (4) The production of undergraduate research papers which can be published and presented at regional or national conferences.     u    projects from neural network based learning in robotics to machine vision to VLSI design and implementation.
