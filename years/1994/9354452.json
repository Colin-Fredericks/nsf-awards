 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354452  Meinwald  There is a need to increase the scientific literacy of college  students in the USA. This proposal involves the development of a  new introductory course, The Language of Chemistry, intended  primarily for students who are not committed to a major in  chemistry. The immediate challenge is to provide an attractive  course which students from areas such as the social sciences and  the humanities will elect to help fulfill a \"distribution\"  requirement. The proposed course will illustrate how chemists study  problems involving chemical interactions in nature. Among the cases  likely to be included for study are (1) the chemistry of gamete  attractants; (2) the female pheromone of the silkworm moth; (3)  quinine, antimalarials, and synthetic dyes; (4) penicillin; and (5)  taxol.  Basic concepts in general chemistry and organic chemistry  will be developed as they are required for the understanding of  this set of particularly interesting problems at the interface  between chemistry and biology or medicine. The methods of analyzing  problems will be emphasized, rather than the memorization of  specific results or formulas. Students should gain an understanding  of subjects as diverse as: chromatography and other purification  techniques, spectroscopy, molecular formulas, molecular structures  (and how chemical and physical methods establish them),  stereochemistry, atomic structure, the periodic table, chemical  bonding, functional groups, Avogadro's number, and why synthesis is  important. There will be an opportunity for students, working in  small groups, to prepare and present short reports on chemical  topics, based on library research.  The project will work with  colleagues in the science education department on course  development and evaluation.  Course related materials will also be  generated.  ***y",
