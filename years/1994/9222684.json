The primary goal of the study is  to engage the talent of more mathematical scientists to work  on problems in computational chemistry, which should produce  advances of benefit to both the mathematical and chemical  sciences.  This study will produce a report, written in  language accessible to both chemical and mathematical  scientists, that presents a number of open problems in  computational chemistry that have mathematical components,  to give mathematical scientists sufficient background for  initiating relevant research either independently or in  collaboration with chemical scientists.  The report will  also identify some of the intellectual and administrative  barriers that often hinder crossdisciplinary research  related to computational chemistry, and make recommendations  to the research communities, policymakers, and federal  funding agencies on how to overcome or minimize these  barriers.",
