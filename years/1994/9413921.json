The cellular research program at the Scholl College  emphasizes the study of diseases involving the  musculoskeletal and vascular system of the lower  extremities.  This program offers a unique form of cellular  engineering in which cells will be examined in dynamic  environments.  Chronic repetitive mechanical stimulation  associated with ambulation ultimately leads to numerous  significant changes in the foot.  Diabetic and neuropathic  patients develop plantar ulcerations, and arthritic joints  become further degenerated as a result of this trauma.  Conversely, osteoporotic bones become more fragile, due to  the inability of certain patients to accumulate and retain  bone substance.  The understanding of the relationship  between macroscopic mechanical stimulation, and its  expression at the cellular level is not well developed.  New  methods and equipment used to apply specifically controlled  loads to cells in culture is critical to study these  cellular responses.  The focus of this research will be to  develop the specialized equipment needed to carry out these  experiments.  ***",
