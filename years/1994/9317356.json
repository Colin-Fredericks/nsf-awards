Aspects of  reproductive demographics and behavior, including return rate to  the colony, reproductive success, patterns of mate acquisition  and nest attentiveness have been monitored in a population of  penguins at Torgersen Island since 1990.  Methods will include  weighing and measuring birds in the breeding colonies and  collecting blood samples for hormone analysis from individuals  expressing known behaviors.  Intensive behavioral observations of  banded individuals will be carried out at every stage of the  reproductive cycle.  The hormonal and body mass changes that  accompany the different stages of the reproductive cycle will be  determined.  The relationship between those measurements and  reproductive success will be determined.  Competing hypotheses  concerning reproductive competency and general body condition  will be tested as explanations for why a high proportion of  breeders successful in one year do not breed in following year.   The physiological underpinnings for the long shifts that birds  spend in attendance at the nest will be studied in order to  understand the interaction of hormonal and energetic  considerations that influence incubation behavior.  Understanding  these proximate causes of individual behavior will shed light on  the evolutionary bases of life history patterns.  The effects of  stress will be measured in birds at different stages of the  reproductive cycle by determining basal levels of corticosterone  and its maximum rate of increase.  The hormonal effects of stress  will be compared in penguins.  This research will allow  determination of whether human interference affects penguin  reproductive success and whether such effects vary in degree  through the reproductive cycle.",
