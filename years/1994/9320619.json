Los Angeles    A systematic investigation of the chemistry of phenyl-alkyl   carbene derivatives in organic molecular crystals will be   made. Carbenes will be generated in the solid state both   thermally and photochemically by the extrusion of molecular   nitrogen from phenyl alkyl diazo compounds. The study will   include pure crystalline solids and mixed molecular   crystals, and will combine techniques from photochemistry,   solid state chemistry, and material science. Product studies   and rates of reactions will be followed as a function of   crystal and molecular structures, which will be determined   by X-ray crystallographic analyses. Correlations will be   sought for crystal and molecular structural features with   product selectivity and specificity. Bulk magnetic   properties will be measured to determine if ordered spin-  spin interactions occur, which would lead to ferromagnetic   behavior.    This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   work of Professor Miguel Garcia-Garabay at the University of   California, Los Angeles. Carbenes, which are divalent   species rather than the usual tetravalent carbon molecules,   will be studied in the solid state. Various carbenes will be   produced both thermally and by light irradiation by the   extrusion of molecular nitrogen from precursor molecules.   Crystal structures of these precursor molecules will be   determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis and the   products and rates of these reactions will be correlated   with the crystal and molecular structure. These studies will   provide insight to carbene chemistry and solid state   chemistry.",
