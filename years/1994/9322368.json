The program annually sponsors between ten to twenty undergraduates from  throughout the United States for an intensive ten-week long summer research  experience.  The students are housed on grounds and each one is assigned to a  permanent Laboratory staff member to perform an independent research project in the  mentor's field of expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the advisor's  close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work independently.  This allows  students to develop to their full potential and to sample first hand the excitement of  experimental science.  During the program the students present two series of seminars:  one in which the students describe their proposed research and a final series in which  the results of each project are summarized.  There is also a series of seminars specifically  for the undergraduates in addition to daily lectures given as part of the Laboratory series  of post-graduate biology courses.  This undergraduate research program is very  oversubscribed and, therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who, with proper  direction, are likely to make a contribution to science in their ensuing careers.  Strong  emphasis is placed on recruiting women, underrepresented minorities, and students who  attend undergraduate institutions where research opportunities are not easily available,  and on encouraging these individuals to pursue research careers.  The success of the  program is evidenced by the number of past participants who go on to excellent graduate  schools and have become eminent scientists.  ***",
