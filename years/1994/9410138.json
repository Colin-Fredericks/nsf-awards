Particular emphasis is on decision or inference, on testing or  estimation, the use of prior information, location and nature of  inference and sensitivity of sampling procedure.  Development of  skill involving statistical computing will play a major role in  this activity.  Methods such as bootstrap, exploration of  posterior distributions and likelihood functions, Markov Chain  Monte Carlo algorithms will be explored.  Some of these studies  will take place at the University of Minnesota where methods and  applications of Bayes and empirical Bayesian methods of inference  are being developed.       Statistical methods in the analysis of causal inference,  especially in studies of spread of infectious diseases and  effectiveness of vaccines is an important and highly developed  component of the mathematical sciences.  This project will  continue this effort in the study of disease transmission and  designs for vaccine evaluation.  ***",
