 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316912  Westpheling  Streptomyces are Gram-positive soil bacteria that are of special  interest because of their remarkably complex morphological  development and because they produce as secondary metabolites most  of the antibiotics used in human and animal health care.  Although  little is understood about the molecular physiology of these  bacteria, it is apparent that the regulation of carbon utilization  is of central importance in the gene expression pathways for both  morphological development and antibiotic biosynthesis.  To gain an  understanding of the mechanism of catabolite control in  Streptomyces we are studying the regulation of a family of genes  involved in the utilization of chitin, a complex carbohydrate and  a major source of carbon in the soil.  The synthesis of chitinase  enzymes is tightly repressed by glucose and strongly induced by  chitin.  In preliminary work we have established that regulation  for at least one of the chitin.  In preliminary work we have  established that regulation for at least one of the chitinase  genes, chi63, occurs at the level of transcription initiation.  We  have been a systematic analysis of mutations within the promoter  region of chi63 and used a transcriptional fusion to the xy1E  reporter gene, to identify chromosomal mutations that define the  pathway for glucose repression and chitin induction of chitinase  synthesis.  We are defining the elements of the chitinase promoters  that determine regulation and promoter activity; beginning a study  to identify and characterize genes that act to facilitate the  global regulation of catabolite repression in Streptomyces.  %%%  We hope as a result  of this work to contribute to the  understanding of gene regulation in an important class of bacteria  where relatively little is known about the way in which gene  expression is controlled.  ***",
