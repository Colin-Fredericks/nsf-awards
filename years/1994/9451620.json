 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451620  Newman  Life science and pre-medical students at Union College have studied  physics in a traditional two-term calculus-based sequence designed  for engineering and physical science students. Representing about  20% of our undergraduates, these students have been ill-served in  their introductory courses in physics. A newly developed two-term  sequence of courses will provide a modern introduction to the  applications of physics to biology (mostly at the molecular and  cellular level) by spending roughly 25% of the time on such  applications in a lecture/discussion format. These courses will  present fundamental physics in a challenging and relevant manner,  will use calculus, and will stress both conceptual thinking and  quantitative reasoning throughout. It is proposed to develop  laboratory experiences which are focused on life science themes for  these students. A totally new laboratory curriculum will be  developed to relate physical principles to the structure, function,  and the study of biological systems. Examples of experiments  include the study of the motion of bacteria, the stress/strain  relations in bone, the flow of fluids through arteries, model  electric circuits for nerves, feedback loops representing the pupil  of the eye, and chaotic circuits of importance in the  interpretation of heart rate and EKG, laser absorption and  fluorescence spectroscopy as applied to biological samples, and  depth perception and binocular vision. These novel experiments fit  well with the themes developed in the courses and should stimulate  student enthusiasm and interest in the underlying physics.  ***y",
