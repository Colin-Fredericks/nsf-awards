 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sampson  9405394  An intriguing problem of interfacial catalysis is exemplified by  the enzyme cholesterol oxidase.  This water soluble enzyme extracts  cholesterol out of the lipid membrane bilayer, with a net movement  of approximately 10A, into a deep active site pocket.  The  substrate is oxidized and isomerized, and the resulting ketone is  returned to the lipid bilayer.  There is no obvious pathway,  however; for the substrate to reach the active site.  Examination  of the X-ray crystal structure reveals an active site that is 11A  long (suitable for binding cholesterol), adjacent to the FAD  cofactor, and closed off from solvent by two surface loops (5 and  20 residues long).  (The dehydroisoandrosterone bound structure  reveals a 1-2 A movement in one of the loops to accommodate the  steroid in the binding site; cholesterol presumably causes a larger  rearrangement with its C-17 tail.)  It is postulated that these two  loops must open to expose the hydrophobic active site to the  substrate once the oxidase has diffused to the lipid membrane  surface.  The questions that will be addressed are:  (1) what is  the mechanism of the oxidative process and is it the rate-limiting  step in the enzymatic reaction?  (2) if we substitute side-chains  of the surface loops with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis,  what happens to the ability of the enzyme to sequester substrates  and intermediates and to catalyze their transformation?  The  consequences of the alanine-substitution mutations on the following  properties will be investigated:  (i) the catalytic rate and on the  rate-limiting step, using kinetic isotope effects.  (ii) the  oxidative process, by studying the effects of (a) deazaFAD  reconstitution (b) cyclopropyl radical traps (c) mutagenizing the  putative general base.  (iii) the affinity for and the turnover of  hydroxysteroids with various alkyl C-17 tails.  All of these  experiments will lead to a model for binding and catalysis at the  two-dimensional lipid interface.  This model  will be relevant to  understanding the mode of action of other steroid binding proteins  and enzymes, for example, the enzymes required for the biosynthesis  of steroids and proteins involved in sterol transport.   Furthermore, cholesterol oxidase is used extensively in clinical  applications for the determination of serum cholesterol levels.   Understanding how the structure effects catalysis will result in  the design of a cholesterol oxidase more suitable for  immobilization and clinical assay purposes.  How mechanical  conformational changes in proteins effects binding and catalysis  will be better understood as a result of the proposed research.   The capability to alter and modify enzyme function for a specific  purpose is still in the infant phases of development, and a set of  general rules for creating structure and function is only beginning  to emerge from the wide range of observations that have been made.   It is with the type of detailed study outlined in this proposal  that these rules will become more apparent.  %%%   Arteriosclerosis is a widespread disease amongst the American  population.  This coronary disease is partly a result of high  levels of cholesterol in the blood.  One way to reduce the  incidence of this disease is to monitor the blood cholesterol  levels of individuals and to prescribe measures to reduce  cholesterol levels for those with unhealthy levels of cholesterol.   Our research will lead to the development of more facile and  inexpensive tests of blood cholesterol levels, that will lead to  easier prescription of preventative measures.  The goal of the  proposed research is to study how the structure of the protein  catalyst, cholesterol oxidase, relates to function.  From the  structural information that is available, it is not clear how the  substrate, cholesterol, binds to the catalyst or how it is  released.  It has been proposed that two fragments of the catalyst  are essential for binding and release of cholesterol.  We will  modify the structure of t hese fragments using molecular biological  techniques.  The modifications affect binding and release of  cholesterol, use assays of serum cholesterol levels.  In addition,  this study will lead to basic insight into the mechanisms of  steroid (for example, cholesterol) transformation and transport in  the body.  It may be possible in the long term to develop new  biomaterials using information obtained from this type of study.   The interaction of the protein with the lipid interface is not well  understood.  Two dimensional lipid interfaces may be constructed  with novel proteins attached to them which will allow the  development of biosensors for cholesterol or other steroids.  These  biomaterials may be more stable and less susceptible to biological  degradation than some materials currently available.  ***",
