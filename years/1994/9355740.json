Seven thematic units  will be developed (three in both English and Spanish versions),  utilizing the basic design process and instructional model  developed in the earlier SERIES Project.  Each unit consists of  engaging hands-on activities performed with inexpensive materials  and incorporating home and neighborhood service applications.          During the three years approximately 500 teenage volunteers  will deliver the program to approximately 2,500 children through  a network of existing SACC sites operated by 4-H and other  community groups.  Capitalizing on SACC settings, the program  will collaborate with schools and reach out to parents through  development of \"Science Family Backpacks\" and \"Science Family  Activity Nights.\"         Program evaluation includes in-depth monitoring and use of  multiple assessment instruments and measures at 25 selected  sites.  In addition to formative and summative evaluation, data  will be available on parent involvement and the amount, nature,  and durability of positive influences on participants' school  science interest and success.  ***",
