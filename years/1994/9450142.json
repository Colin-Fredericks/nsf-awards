 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on algorithms that work limited  information.  Three topics are addressed, and each is motivated  by an application in online or distributed computation.  These  topics include:  (1) Distributed computation where a group of  agents must collectively solve a problem.  Each agent receives  part of the input, and a graph is used to represent knowledge  that is shared between the agents.  The goal is to determine how  to use shared information between the agents as well as to  determine the value of sharing information. (2) These issues will  be addressed with respect to problems in distributed job  scheduling and network routing.  Metrical Task Systems where the  set of tasks (inputs to the system) are restricted.  The  restriction on the input is part of the description of the  system.  A unified approach will be developed to a variety of  online problems by developing a general, simple algorithm which  uses the system specification to approximate the best online  algorithm for each particular system.  (3) The use of a  statistical adversary, which provides a way of bringing  theoretical results in online algorithms closer to practical  concerns by considering only those inputs which exhibit typical  statistical features.  It is a middle ground between  probabilistic analysis and competitive analysis where the input  is generated by an unlimited adversary.  The use of a statistical  adversary for problems in finance and computer systems will be  considered.    Interactive activities include: teaching a research seminar in  online algorithms; leading weekly meetings with computer theory  students to discuss research problems; involvement into the  Columbia Chapter of the Society of Women Engineers; & women in  the Computer Science Department.",
