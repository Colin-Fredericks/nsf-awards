 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315700  Suprenant    The proposed research is an investigation of how  microtubule assembly and function is regulated during the  cell cycle.  A multidisciplinary approach will be used to  test the hypothesis that a 77 kD echinoderm MT-associated  protein (EMAP) is part of a multi-subunit G-protein complex  whose function is regulated by phosphorylation and GTP-  binding.  Biochemical methods will be used to identify EMAP-  binding proteins and direct photoaffinity labeling will  determine whether any of these proteins are GTP-binding  proteins.  Immunological techniques will be used to  characterize EMAP-dynamin interactions in vitro by  immunoprecipitation and in vivo by immunogold labeling for  electron microscopy.  In vivo phosphorylation of EMAP and  dynamin will be accomplished by 32-P labeling followed by  immunoprecipitation.  Microtubule assembly dynamics will be  examined in immunodepleted interphase and mitotic extracts  by video-enhanced differential contrast light microscopy.  Affinity-purified anti-dynamin and anti-EMAP antibodies will  be microinjected into sea urchin blastomeres to determine  their effects on cell division.  Genetically engineered EMAP  constructs in baculovirus will be transfected into insect  cells and examined for their effects on endogenous  microtubule and organelle arrays.  The completion of the  proposed study will provide insight into the regulation of  cellular morphogenesis during mitosis.  %%%  Microtubules are essential and dynamic components of the  eukaryotic cytoskeleton, and are the mediators of such  critically important cellular and intracellular motility  phenomena as flagellar and ciliary beating (necessary for  such phenomena as spermatozoan or protozoan swimming,  movement of bronchial mucus, etc.), movement of particles  and vesicles from one end of the cell to another (e.g.,  movement of synaptosomes containing neurotransmitters from  the cell body of a nerve cell, where the synaptosomes are  packaged, down to the tip of the axon, where t he contents  are released by exocytosis) and separation of daughter  chromosomes during cell division.  The regulation of  microtubules, in terms of their spatial organization,  functional capabilities, and length and stability is not yet  well understood, yet obviously is critical to the proper  functioning of the cell.  Certain proteins are known to be  associated with microtubules, and are termed MAPs  (microtubule-associated proteins); these are presumed to be  involved in the regulation or mediation of microtubule-  associated functions.  Working with invertebrate cells as  models, a novel MAP (termed EMAP) was found in sea urchins  which, upon analysis, was shown to be similar to known  regulatory subunits of G-proteins (a class of regulatory  proteins in cells which are involved in a wide variety of  signal transduction phenomena) and which was also shown to  bind to dynamin, a GTP-ase implicated in certain microtubule-  mediated vesicle movement phenomena.  Based on these  findings, a testable model has been developed in which  dynamin and EMAP are postulated to be microtubule linker  proteins that associate with each other, with microtubules,  and with vesicles.  These associations may in turn be  regulated by GTP binding and phosphorylation. The  experiments proposed in this project will test key parts of  the model.  The research promises to shed light on how the  microtubule system works in cells.  ***",
