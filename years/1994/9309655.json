 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309655  Fischer  The recent years have seen the development of several knowledge-  based scheduling systems that facilitate the integration of design  information with the generation of construction schedules.  This  research proposes to extend the idea behind these planners and  schedulers by adding detailed models of construction methods.  Such  knowledge is needed in model-based form to enhance the practicality  of the schedules that are generated, and to overcome some of the  limitations of heuristic systems.  while the use of product models  to represent design information has been well documented over the  last few years, the formalization and implementation of detailed  models of construction methods still represents a major challenge  and opportunity.  When  interacting with a product model, such  construction method  models will be able to generate construction  schedules and cost estimates almost instantly.  This will enable  project participants to explore more alternatives to a greater  level of detail in less time.  This will lead to projects that are  more constuctible than some of today's projects which in turn will  lead to a reduced total delivery time and cost for constructed  facilities.",
