 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students will be introduced via laboratory course work to textile  testing and product analysis. Testing is extremely important in the  textile industry from fibers through to finished garments to ensure  that quality and performance is maintained. Because students could  possibly be employed in a number of different areas of the retail  or textile industries, knowledge of how a particular product  eventually becomes available to consumers is highly desirable.  Throught the use of a tensile tester, students will be introduced  to the myriad of different types of tensile testing that fibers,  yarns, fabrics, components, and garments may undergo. In addition,  students will be able to evaluate the effects of routine finishes  normally applied to textile substrates (i.e. dyeing, scouring,  bleaching, shrink proofing, mercerizing, etc.). Also students can  be introduced to the phenomena of photo degradation and the  deleterious effects it has on certain textile substrates through  chemical and physical analysis of the substrates' properties.",
