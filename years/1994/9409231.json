The technique, an analog of  parental involvement in false allegations of abuse, is fully  piloted and involves no deception.  In Phase 1, children between  the ages of 3 and 8 years will participate in a series of events  and will be interviewed to determine what they can report about  those events.  Three months later, parents will read the children  a story that includes descriptions of events the children had  experienced and events they had not experienced.  The children will  then be reinterviewed on two occasions with a stepwise procedure in  which nonsuggestive questions are followed by leading questions and  a series of questions that specifically ask the children to  distinguish between events they experienced and events they only  heard described.  Because the interview procedures yield  information about individual differences in recall, forgetting,  acquiescence (i.e., saying \"yes\" to a suggestion), and source  monitoring (i.e., distinguishing between memories from several  sources), these data will be a first step in constructing a  systematic theory of the factors responsible for developmental  changes in suggestibility.    This project will accomplish the following goals: (a) trace  developmental trends in susceptibility to false information  provided by parents; (b) evaluate the types of false reports that  are elicited by interview procedures with varying degrees of  prompting; (c) evaluate developmental changes in recall,  acquiescence, and memory source monitoring; and (d) test the  adequacy of various causal models that specify the contributions of  these processes to children's suggestibility.  The resulting data  will have important implications for how investigations of child  abuse allegations are conducted, and will contribute to the  development of interview procedures that more adequat ely test  alternative hypotheses about the sources of children's reports.  ***",
