A cluster of hydrophobic membrane proteins  provide ligation sites for the inorganic cofactors (Ca2+, C1, Mn)  required for minimal levels of O2 evolution activity.  However,  stable ligation of these cofactors and kinetically efficient H2O   oxidation minimally requires the presence of an extrinsic 33 kDa  polypeptide known as the Manganese Stabilizing Protein, or MSP.  A  critical function of this protein in vivo and in purified  photosystem II preparations is to confer stability to the site that  ligates the Mn atoms that catalyze oxidation of H2O.  Although     one site of binding to photosystem has been identified for MSP, the  protein's mode of action, whether purely structural or in addition  as a possible contributor of metal ligands, remaining unsettled.   The question of MSP function in photosystem II will be addressed by  site-directed mutagenesis.  Expression of mutagenized MSP in E.  coli will be used to obtain amounts of protein sufficient for  reconstitution, structural and spectroscopic investigations in a  system using purified photosystem II preparations from Arabidopsis  and spinach. Residues targeted for mutagenesis have been selected  on the basis of their possible contributions to the tertiary  structure of the protein or to binding of MSP to photosystem II.   Analyses of reconstituted preparations are designed so as to reveal  modifications in inorganic ion cofactor binding, alterations in the  structure of the manganese cluster that catalyzes H2O oxidation,  and defects in the ability of preparations reconstituted with  mutagenized MSP to bind other extrinsic proteins that area also  essential for long-term sustained activity under physiological  conditions.  The proposed experiments will provide a better  understanding of the structure of an important photosynthetic  protein and its contributions t o both the organization and  catalytic function of the site of photosynthetic O2 evolution.  %%%  Photosynthesis produces the oxygen that sustains life on earth.   The enzyme that carries out this process is called photosystem II,  and is found  in all plants and algae. Although, it is known that  certain ions (manganese, calcium and chloride) are needed for  oxygen production to occur, the role of photosystem II proteins in  oxygen production is not well understood.  This project will  examine a photosystem II protein, called the Manganese Stabilizing  Protein, that is essential to oxygen production, if it is removed,  oxygen production is impaired and exposure to light begins to  destroy the enzyme.  To examine how Manganese Stabilizing Protein  protects photosystem II and enhances oxygen production, the genetic  code for the protein is first transferred to a bacterium, E. coli,  which can be induced to produce the native protein or alternative  versions containing mutations in large amounts.  Once isolated,  these protein will be examines for mutation-induced changes in  their structure and, when they are added back to photosystem II,  for changes in their ability to affect the activity and stability  of oxygen production.  The method to be employed permits the    investigator to produce many mutations in the protein. By  systematic modifications, it will be will be possible to determine  which parts of the protein are important in stabilizing photosystem  II, and which parts of the protein are involved in promoting the  chemical reactions that produce oxygen.  Although these experiments  are directed at understanding a very fundamental biological  reaction, they also will provide new information that may prove  useful in 2 areas: first, when the mechanism by which model plant  system such as Arabidopsis and spinach produce oxygen is fully  understood, this knowledge may point the way to new chemical  methods for carrying out oxidation/reduction reactions that are at  present very energy-inte nsive.  Second, determination of protein  features that are required for efficient oxygen production can  provide information on methods that may prove useful in protecting  plant life from environmental factors such as global warming.  ***",
