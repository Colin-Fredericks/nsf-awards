The program involves six undergraduates  working under the supervision of the principal investigator for a  period of seven weeks.  The research problems center on a group  theoretic interpretation of confidence intervals and counting  problems in finite groups with the general area of computational  finite group theory.  The primary tool in the program will be  MAGMA, a high level programming language which enables the user  to define the algebraic structure in which one wishes to  compute and which is not generally available to undergraduates.   The problems have been selected and the format for  faculty-student interaction has been designed  to encourage  students to develop from receivers of mathematical fact to  providers of mathematical fact and conjecture.  The participants  will learn group theory and algebra, gain experience in  mathematical research and mathematical exposition (written and  oral) and develop the facility to use a computer work station as  a mathematical tool. The more successful projects will be  presented at future professional meetings and possibly be  published in appropriate journals.  ***",
