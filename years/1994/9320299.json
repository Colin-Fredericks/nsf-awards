The equipment will be used for several research projects including in particular:  \"High Performance Input/Output for Parallel Computing Systems\", \"Distributed Simulation of the Nonstationary Behavior of Communication Networks\", \"Performance Validation of Nonlinear Controllers for Electric Machines via Dynamic Simulation\",  \"Efficient Multi-Processor Computations in Electromagnetics\", and \"Real-World EMC/EMI Analysis using Finite Elements and Multi-Processor Workstations\".     Each of these projects involves the development and use of large computation-intensive simulations that require many hours of dedicated processor time, large main memory, and large local I/O capacity.  The use of the equipment will be restricted to those faculty and students involved in these projects, and will be accessed via an existing ethernet as a dedicated compute server.  The multiprocessor configuration will allow resources to be allocated among the processors as needed to provide effective use of the system and will allow computations to be run in parallel on many processors more efficiently than alternative configurations. In each case, by providing needed additional processing power, the system will improve the throughput of the large scale computations involved in these projects, thereby enabling more effective research.  ***            Pearson     This award will provide funds to purchase multiprocessor computer equipment which will be  dedicated to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 )   +   z                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              $         $         $              G                                                                                  Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                      e   e                        8    Pearson/Clemson    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
