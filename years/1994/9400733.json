 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400733  Rodin       The work supported by this award sets out to exploit recent  mathematical developments applying concepts of circle packing to  classical problems of conformal mapping.  If one packs a simply  connected region with circles of a fixed radius then there is a  combinatorially equivalent packing of the unit disk, and this  circle packing isomorphism converges to the Riemann map of the  domain onto the disk as the radius tends to zero.  This idea,  which has led to an entirely new approach to ideas of conformal  mapping in recent years, will now be applied to study mappings of  multiply connected domains onto domains whose complement  consists solely of slits radiating from the origin.  The result  is known for many special cases - even some domains with  infinite connectivity.  That one can do it in general, was  first conjectured by Koebe in 1908.  He proved it for  finitely connected domains.  The combination of new tools from  circle packing and other advances in conformal mapping will be  applied in a concentrated effort to settle the Koebe conjecture  in its entirety.       Conformal mapping is the study of mappings of plane (and  higher dimensional) domains by transformations which  preserve infinitesimal angles and orientation.  The maps play  central roles in the geometric theory of analytic functions and  potential theory by reducing many questions concerning functions  defined on arbitrary domains to the same questions restricted to  a class of highly symmetric domains.  ***",
