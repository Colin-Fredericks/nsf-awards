 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412017  Franzblau       In this project, the principal investigator aims to obtain  the following results: (1) an implementation of a practical  combinatorial algorithm to compute bounds on degrees of freedom  of a network (in 3 or more dimensions), (2) new combinatorial  conditions for rigidity or simple formulas for degrees of freedom  in families of graphs, (3) new, easily computed measures of  medium-range order in network models of glasses.  The methods  employed include those of combinatorial optimization, graph  theory, and discrete algorithm design.  Problems on network  models are addressed largely through computer experiments, and  make use of algorithms developed and implemented by the  investigator.       This project has two related aims, and is intended to  contribute new results both to mathematics and materials science.  The first aim is to address key open problems in the mathematical  theory of rigidity, including computing the degrees of freedom of  a network (also called a graph).  This theory has a long history,  which includes the work of Maxwell (1864) on determining whether  a \"scaffold\" made of rigid bars and movable joints is itself  rigid. The second aim is to address basic issues on network  models of solids; such models (also called ball-and-stick  models), in which points represent atoms and connections between  points represent chemical bonds, are often studied to better  understand the properties of both crystalline solids and glassy  materials.  One focus is to characterize the relationship between  the structure of a network model and its rigidity, and the other  is to find useful measures which capture this network structure.   The work therefore leads to a better understanding of materials  properties.",
