 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451880  Dawley  Computer will be used in creating introductory biology laboratories  that foster scientific thinking among students by encouraging  creativity, communication, and teamwork.  As important as it is to  give introductory students an experimental, instrument-rich  laboratory experience, this experience will be empty if it  emphasizes cookbook technique at the expense of scientific  creativity. Here we propose using computers specifically to nurture  scientific creativity in our students by giving them flexibility in  experimental design, encouraging teamwork, and making it possible  for them to communicate with a wide circle of their peers.  These  laboratories will foster creativity by requiring student teams of  four to design experiments in multi-week, open-ended exercises.  Each team will have its own laboratory bench equipped with a  Macintosh computer linked to a local area network and to the  Internet. Computers will be used to give students a wider range of  options in creating their experimental designs and to increase  their flexibility in asking the question \"What if we try it this  way?\" The software we propose using is sufficiently versatile and  general that it encourages students to explore different  experimental approaches without dictating a particular design.  Ideas, initially developed within student teams, will be exchanged  among teams using the local network and computer-based oral  presentations.",
