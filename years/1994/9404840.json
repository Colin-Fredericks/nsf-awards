 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tringham    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Ruth Tringham and  her collaborators will conduct three seasons of field research at  the archaeological site of Podgoritsa in Northeast Bulgaria.  Dating to the Neolithic period, this \"tell\" or habitation mound  was occupied from ca. 5000-4500 BC. Prior work indicates that  this period spans the interval when agriculture was introduced  into Eastern Europe. The mound, because it consists of a  stratified series of household areas which preserve abundant  cultural remains, provides an excellent potential window into how  human populations adapted over this period.  The research team  will conduct a general regional survey and focus, in particular  on the geographic distribution of important resources such as  flint which was used to produce stone tools. The area around the  tell will be intensively sampled through surface collection and  sub-surface soil probing. Finally extensive mound areas will be  excavated to expose house remains and collect cultural materials.  These latter will be analyzed by a team of specialists.    The significance of the Podgoritsa project lies at two levels.  First it will provide important new information on the culture  history of Eastern Europe and help to document the expansion of  settled village life. However the research will also address  questions of general theoretical interest for the study of  agricultural societies and these involve population growth and  expansion, the social consequences of sedentism, the  intensification of production and the role of the household as   an organizing social and economic unit. The work will also aid  the development of archaeology in Eastern Europe and help to  forge stronger scientific ties between Bulgaria and the United  States.",
