 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317368  Beachy       Many plant viruses direct the synthesis of one or more  proteins required for the spread of infection from the  initial; site to adjacent cells.  In the case of tobacco  mosaic virus the movement protein responsible for spread of  the virus has been identified and extensively studied.  Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanism  responsible for the spread are not well understood.  Previous studies have suggested that the ability of the  movement protein to facilitate virus movement is the result  of a combination of several functions or characteristics: 1)  association with plasma membranes; 2) association with cell  walls; 3) association with plasmodesmata with or without the  formation of fibrous material in the channel; 4)  modification of the plasmodesmata size exclusion limit; 5)  formation of large, soluble complex perhaps including RNA.  The proposed research will determine which functions are  required for biological activity.  Complementation of  nonfunctional mutants of the movement protein will be used  to identify regions of the protein that may be responsible  for separate functions.  A combination of in vitro and in  vivo studies will then be used to identify which functions  are associated with the mutated sequences.  %%%  The results of the study on the function of the virus  movement protein will lead to a better understanding of how  viral infections spread in plants.  In turn this may lead to  novel methods in preventing plant diseases.  In addition,  because the movement protein interacts with plasmodesmata,  the knowledge obtained will lead to a greater understanding  of intercellular communication in plants  ***",
