Students perform original research as a cooperative  group, parelleling a project underway at a neighboring research  laboratory. Through this experience, students are trained in modern  biotechnology and are prepared for future in-service research  opportunities.  This senior course is designed to break down the  barrier between prospective teachers and local researchers.  Investigative topics for each term are chosen in consultation with  principal investigators from nearby laboratories. These scientists  have agreed to assist in class experiments, and will give seminars  explaining their own studies. In addition, students will choose a  local research group to follow and will prepare a fellowship  proposal for future in-service research.  This course will be  required of all science education majors and will be open to other  students as space permits.",
