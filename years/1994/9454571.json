 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harrison  9454571  The Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center a joint effort between  Sinclair Community College and the University of Dayton submits  this proposal to create a National Center of Excellence for  Advanced Manufacturing Education (NCE/AME). Headquartered at the  Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center on the campus of Sinclair  Community College, the goal of the NCE/AME is to redesign the  infrastructure of technological education. The NCE/AME will be a  catalyst for educational change to improve science, mathematics,  and advanced manufacturing instruction at the high school,  community college, and university levels. The program will  accomplish the following objectives:  1.  Develop a new competency-based, occupationally verified,  seamless curriculum beginning in grade 11, through the Associate of  Applied Science degree, culminating with the Bachelor of Science  degree using advanced manufacturing as the focus; with gateways to  and from industrial employment throughout.  2.  Write, pilot test, and publish curriculum materials (laboratory  manuals, video, software, and other ancillary materials) to improve  mathematics, science, and manufacturing engineering technology  instruction.  3.  Disseminate the curriculum, curriculum materials, and model  program nationally.",
