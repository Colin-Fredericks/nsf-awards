This  behavior will be contrasted with the dipolar relaxation process  that is observed with viscous polar solvents which can be  distinguished on the basis of its characteristic red-edge  excitation behavior.  Hypotheses as to the origin of this behavior  will be tested.  These included a specific exciplex formation  process and electron ejection to solvating defects present in polar  solvents.  The data obtained with a variety of solvents (including  mixed solvents with variable composition), variation of  temperature, variable excitation and emission wavelength and for a  variety of indole analogs will be analyzed using the Maximum  Entropy method.   %%%  This project is a collaborative effort involving workers at the  University of Oregon and Professor Alex Demchenko of the Institute  of Biochemistry of Kiev, Ukraine.  The funds requested are  primarily for support of Dr. Demchenko's effort.  The benefits to  our research, particularly his development of the red-edge  excitation effect as a useful diagnostic method, his knowledge of  scientific literature in this field available only in Russian and  his familiarity with the Maximum Entropy method of analysis of  fluorescence data.  ***",
