It will be  used to support a newly designed Algorithms and Complexity course.  The new course integrates theory of algorithms with software design  in an experimental setting; and thereby follows the philosophy of  the new ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines: \"to integrate the processes  of theory, abstraction and design into each course and reinforce  them with laboratory work.\" AI91  The typical course in algorithms  does not include an experimental component. The introduction of  such a component is natural and serves to clarify the theory, as  well as to develop the students' skills in software design. Each  algorithm motivates a number of different experimental software  projects. These include: the development of an environment (often  graphics-based) in which to generate test data and measure the  algorithm's performance on special inputs; the design of a system  to experiment with variations of the algorithm which defy precise  analysis; and the implementation of an appropriate graphical user  interface to interact with the algorithm. The software environment,  in turn, motivates the discovery of new algorithms and theorems.  Experimenting with hard to analyze algorithms helps formulate  hypotheses about  the algorithm's correctness and complexity.  The  lab allows students to play in the sandbox of algorithms, measure  things, make conclusions and discover new ideas. The algorithms are  the motivation for the software design, and the software serves as  a tool to learn about algorithms. In each lab, students design  software to empirically study the complexity of an algorithm,  explore a new variation of an algorithm, or experiment with methods  of taming an NP-Complete problem. The students design an  environment that will let them experiment in the most productive  way. Often weaker students with better designed tools can succeed  faster with their Conjectures and conclu sions than bright students  with poorly designed tools.  The lab will also be used for honors  theses, and our new general studies course for non-majors, Talking  to Machines.",
