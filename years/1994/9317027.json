Experiments focus on  early events resulting from surface Ig triggering:  activation of  the various sIg-associated tyrosine protein kinases (TPK) and  phosphorylation of specific substrates.  Recent findings from this  laboratory indicate that B cells predominantly express and undergo  receptor-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane  translocation of a unique isoform of phospholipase C (PLC), PLC  gamma 2.  While tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 is an  important feature of signal transduction for many receptors, B cell  sIg is the only known receptor linked to PLC gamma 2.  Using ex  vivo B cells and B cell lines, experiments will be done to study  the mechanism linking tyrosine phosphorylation to PLC activation.   Specific goals are:  1) to define the regulation of PLC gamma 2  enzymatic activity by tyrosine protein kinses, 2) to establish the  molecular basis of Fc gamma receptor-mediated inhibition of B cell  proliferation, and 3) to study the relative roles of phospholipase  C gamma 1 and 2 in sIg-mediated cell activation.  The results  should define, in biochemical terms, the earliest events following  sIg stimulation and shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved  in inhibition of B cell proliferation mediated by the Fc gamma  receptor.  %%%  Cells receive important biological signals by means of receptors on  their surfaces.  These signals are then translated (\"transduced\")  through cascades of biochemical events to alter the cell's  physiological state or affect the expression of specific genes.   Cells have many different receptors for biological signals and the  receptors can be classified into different types based on their  structures and the types of biochemical pathways they trigger.   Identifying the critical components in the sequence of biochemical  events tri ggered by cellular receptors is an area of active  research.  The goal of this research is to work out the biochemical  details of the early steps in the signal transduction pathway  following the binding of a foreign material (antigen) to specific  receptors on the surface of certain cells of the immune system (B  lymphocytes).  This pathway of cellular signaling leads to  proliferation of the responding cells and ultimately to production  of specific proteins (antibodies) that bind the antigen and promote  its removal from the body.  ***",
