 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402065  WANG       The vision of the Biotechnology Process Engineering Center is  directed towards the technological barriers in the manufacturing of  therapeutic proteins.  The research is organized in two areas:   Therapeutic Protein Production; and Therapeutic Protein  Aggregation, Stability, Formulation and Delivery.       Research in the first area will be directed towards cellular  physiology, metabolism, and generics coupled with advanced concepts  in bioanalytical monitoring and systems' diagnostic in aid of  bioreactor performances and assurance of protein quality.  Research  in the second area will be directed toward protein aggregation,  stability, formulation and delivery.         The educational programs of the Center are designed to ensure  both breadth and depth with a balance in scientific and engineering  principles in the training of students.  The goal is to create a  new breed of professionals for the biotechnology sector as future  leaders in industry, university and government.  Educational  experience is intended to provide an integrated view of  biotechnology and bioprocessing within an atmosphere of cross-  disciplinary and team research, exposing students to the industrial  viewpoint.       Industrial collaboration and technology transfer are achieved  through a number of organized efforts.  Industry inputs in the  planning of the Center's overall activities through two annual  meetings with Industrial Advisory Board members.  In addition, an  Industrial Consortium Program is in place having 69 companies  representing the entire biotechnology sector ranging from small  (45%), medium (25%), and large (30%) businesses.  Workshops and  formal discussions with the Consortium members are held two to four  times per year to solicit their inputs and to develop collaborative  research programs.       The Center has in place a cross-disciplinary team of 11  faculty members from three departments:  Biology, Chemistry and  Chemical Engineering.  Outreach activities have involved  formal  participation of two other universities, Purdue University and Iowa  State University.  The second outreach activity is the Research  Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) where annually 10 to 12 non-  students perform research at the Center.         This award provides a new ERC award for the Center through an  intial five-year cooperative agreement.  ***",
