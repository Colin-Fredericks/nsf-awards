 "awd_abstract_narration": "Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds will be employed  to acquire equipment for the molecular engineering and  investigation of selected organic and oarganometallic materials  with potential applications for photonic devices. The equipment  will in include a neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG)  laser with a 5 nanosecond pulse width with substantial output  at the second and third harmonics; a pulsed dye laser with  substantial wavelength tunability to be pumped by the YAG  laser; a optical isolator; a fast digital oscilloscope; various  optical components such as mirrors, beam splitters, polarizers,  etc; a Langmuir-Blodgett trough for the preparation of Langmuir-  Blodgett molecular films; and an interface and control  computer. The research will be on photorefractive and other  nonlinear optical and electro-optical properties of  organometallic materials and doped organic materials and  polymers. These materials will be studied to investigate their  suitability for applications such as phase conjugate mirrors,  light modulators, optical switches etc. The photorefractive  studies will be studied by four-wave mixing, optical phase  conjugation, beam coupling, and diffraction efficiency  approaches. Doping with different metal complexes or donor-  acceptor groups and changing the length of the pi-electron  chains will be used to yield large nonlinear and electro-  optical responses.    Several lasers and associated optical equipment will be  acquired for the purpose of studying the photorefractive  properties of organic and organometallic materials. The study  of these materials will determine their suitability for use in  optical devices such as phase conjugate mirrors, light  modulators, and optical switches.",
