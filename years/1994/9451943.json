 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451943  White  Molecular biology is one of the fastest growing fields in modern  biology. Recombinant DNA technology has provided revolutionary  insight into a vast array of studies ranging from evolutionary  biology to medicine. Understanding the concepts of molecular  biology is a requisite for understanding current research in many  disciplines of biology and biochemistry. It is also critical for an  understanding of a variety of issues that will become more and more  important for students growing up in a world increasingly affected  by biotechnology. Courses at Southeastern Louisiana University  include discussions of molecular aspects of genetics, cell biology,  embryology, microbiology and biochemistry. Unfortunately practical  experience in these subjects has been limited by lack of equipment.    We propose establishing a teaching laboratory to provide students  with opportunities to gain hands-on experience in molecular biology  as relates to a variety of disciplines in biology and biochemistry.  Students will gain experience with techniques such as isolation and  analysis of nucleic acids and proteins, DNA sequencing, DNA  fingerprinting and others. These techniques will be presented where  appropriate in established lab courses including embryology,  genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, and virology. Practical lab  experience will reinforce concepts taught in the lecture portion of  these courses.    Exposure to theories and techniques of molecular biology offers an  important advantage to students. This field has among the best  prospects for employment in the biological sciences. Students with  a practical knowledge of molecular biology will be at an advantage  when applying for advanced degree programs or seeking jobs in  industry.",
