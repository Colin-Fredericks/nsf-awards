 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with building a new facility to study the  spin-polarized unoccupied bands of ferromagnetic thin films and  surfaces and Mott-Hubbard insulators. This facility will permit,  in conjunction with existing spin polarized photoemission  facilities, to identify the exchange splitting of large local  moment systems where spin mixing rather than exchange splitting  collapse occurs. As with ferromagnetic systems, we also plan, in  the case of systems exhibiting Mott-Hubbard transitions, to  identify the upper Hubbard band in systems where the Hubbard  bands exhibit ferromagnetic (as opposed to antiferromagnetic)  ordering. By building this facility, the characterization of not  only the occupied band structure (the occupied density of states)  but the unoccupied band structure (the unoccupied density of  states) is possible. This proposal is based upon existing  expertise of five research groups in photoemission, spin-  polarized photoemission, inverse photoemission, spin-polarized  electron sources, and magnetism.  %%%  Photoemission, has been the spectroscopy of choice in  characterizing electronic structure. The use of polarized light  in angle-resolved photoemission studies has made the  identification of electronic bands through symmetry selection  rules possible, greatly enhancing the technique. These techniques  probe the occupied part of the band structure: the valence bands  of semiconductors or occupied states of metals and condensed  matter systems. More recently, inverse photoemission studies have  found a unique role for exploring the conduction band of  semiconductors or the unoccupied states of metals and condensed  matter systems. Spin-resolved photoemission and spin-resolved  inverse photoemission have greatly enhanced the study of  electronic structure; particularly in the case of systems with  spin-ordered bands, such as ferromagnetic systems. We propose to  complement our existing facilities with spin resolved inverse  photoemission capability in order to chara cterize both occupied  and unoccupied parts of the band structure. This combination of  facilities will substantially enhance the ability to investigate  magnetic thin films and surfaces and nonmetal to metal  transitions. It is this combination of techniques at a single  center which would be unmatched by any other facility in the  world.",
