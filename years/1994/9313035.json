In the past ten years,  there have been a number of fundamental developments in  spectral graph theory brought about by the strong interplay  between graph theory and a variety of areas, including group  representations, number theory, differential geometry,  communication networks, algorithms and computational  complexity as well as chemistry and physics.  Such cross-  fertilization has produced powerful new techniques and  deeper understanding of the fundamental structure of graphs.  Also, results in spectral graph theory have led to numerous  applications in these diverse areas.       There is a strong cadre of active researchers in  combinatorics at several California universities.  The  conference will be an opportunity for interested researchers  to hear an informative set of lectures on the state of  research in a very active area.  It will encourage  newcomers, graduate and postdoctoral students, to do  research in the area of graph theory and combinatorics.",
