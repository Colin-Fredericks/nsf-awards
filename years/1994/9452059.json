Two types of laboratory experiments that use this device  have been developed. The first familiarizes students with concepts  related to static transducer calibration, analog to digital  conversion, signal conditioning, software and hardware gain and  problems of aliasing. The second type deals with the isotropic and  anisotropic consolidation and testing of soil samples using a  predefined stress path. Stress and strain controlled static shear  tests can be performed and essentially any stress path can be  simulated through the data acquisition and control software. This  laboratory capability shows the relevance of the various laboratory  strength tests with actual field conditions using the same testing  device, and illustrates the concepts related to electronic data  acquisition and control. An important benefit is that the same  device can be used to illustrate the drained and undrained  stress-strain characteristics of both isotropic and Ko consolidated  soil samples. The samples can be sheared under a predefined stress  path and the observed pore pressure behavior (for undrained  testing) can be compared. Soil testing programs are developed to  examine the issues related to type of consolidation, stress path  and the rate of loading.",
