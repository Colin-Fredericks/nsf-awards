The simulations are targeted at introductory and  intermediate courses in biology, psychology and neuroscience,  especially at large courses that do not include a laboratory.  Students in such courses often have difficulty understanding the  remarkably rapid and dynamic responses of neurons, because these  aspects are not conveyed well by static pictures in textbooks.  Realistic, interactive simulations in which students see and hear  neuronal responses as they control stimuli interactively give a  much better understanding of the pace and dynamics of activity in  the brain and nervous system.  The Neuroscience Simulation Project,  which will be extended and enlarged by this funding, was founded at  Smith College in 1990 with partial support from the New England  Consortium for Undergraduate Science Education. Its first software  release, MacRetina, generated strong interest in the neuroscience  community and won a Distinguished Natural Science Software Award in  1992 from EDUCOM. The pedagogical and technical challenges mastered  in producing MacRetina will serve as a strong foundation for the  proposed development of new simulation software.  ***y",
