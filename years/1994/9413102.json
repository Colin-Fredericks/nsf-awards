Stanford University is  committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the  acquisition of the instrument.       The ion microprobe will be used primarily in research  projects in isotope geochemistry, cosmochemistry,  geochronology, and materials science. The facility will be  open to scientists from Stanford University, the U.S.  Geological survey, and other research institutions. The new  design ion microprobe will be capable of quantitative in  situ measurements of isotopic and elemental  compositions of  geological materials with micron scale spatial resolution in  three dimensions and high sensitivity.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory  in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of  researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces, and Archean and Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods for the quantitative  measurement of the isotopes of hafnium.  ***",
