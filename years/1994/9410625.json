 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410625  MASKUS  Differences in patent laws across countries have been a major issue  in the multilateral GATT negotiations in the Uruguay Round, in the  negotiation of the North American Free Trade Area, and in U.S.  efforts to discipline foreign unfair trade practices.  It is argued  that weak patent laws in developing countries tend to distort  international trade and investment flows by inducing innovative  firms to withdraw from servicing markets with limited protection.   There is, however, virtually no reliable information about whether  varying international patent laws tend to expand or restrict trade.   Theoretical models suggest that either of two conflicting outcomes  are possible.  On the one hand, because stronger patents provide  additional market power to firms, the firms may choose to engage in  greater exercise of that market power through export limitations  and price discrimination.  On the other hand, stronger patent laws  tend to expand the available market size for innovative firms.  It  is important to determine how domestic regulations of this sort, as  opposed to standard trade barriers, influence international trade.    This project will specify a series of theoretical models that allow  for various market structures and changes in trading behavior  induced by marginal shifts in patent laws.  In addition,  econometric models will be used to test empirically the hypotheses  generated by the theoretical models.    ***",
