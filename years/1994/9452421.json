Classes in the Calculus I-II sequence and the general  education Applied Mathematics course are held in the laboratory so  that combined approaches to solving mathematical problems may be  used. The course materials call for simultaneously incorporating  collaborative methods, applying them to reality-based problems, and  using technological means for solution. The lab is available to  student use outside of the classtime for working on assigned team  projects.  The Applied Mathematics course uses the Annenberg  project For All Practical Purposes text. The laboratory facilities  allow the addition of: a statistics package and analysis of large  data sets, team projects which use technology to analyze the  results of students' own data collections, a geometry and a drawing  package to create and analyze symmetry and repeated patterns, and  a spreadsheet for the conjecture and analysis of growth functions.  In addition to the syllabus additions, the collaboration experience  gives students the opportunity to take ownership of their  mathematics through group discussion and debate.  The Calculus  courses are enhanced by the natural incorporation of symbolic  computing as a daily activity of the students in the course. The  collaboration experience has the same goals as in the Applied  Mathematics course and, in addition, it allows students to learn  the syntax of the technology more efficiently than by individual  pursuit. Team projects follow the form of several successful pilot  projects, including: designing a space capsule with certain  flotation properties; finding the effect of putting a spin on a  volleyball serve; determining schedules of dosages for medicine;  and analyzing the movement of recording tape over a tape hea d.  The  laboratory/classroom is designed with careful attention to the  learning process.",
