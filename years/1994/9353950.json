 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353950  Hughes   A two-week summer workshop focused on undergraduate faculty  enhancement in the area of computer networks. Sixteen computer  science and engineering faculty from small  colleges/universities (priorities were given to minorities)  were exposed to state-of-the-art developments in computer  networks, with emphasis on LANs, WANs, and high-speed networks.  During a typical day of the workshop, time was equally divided  between discussions on network concepts and theory, and  laboratory assignments involving various implementations of  protocol and network designs. Each participant was required to  maintain a complete notebook consisting of network lessons and  laboratory assignments for possible use in future network  courses at his/her home institution. Michigan State University  network facilities, including the Computer Science Department's  High-speed Networking Research Laboratory, were available to  participants for workshop related activities. As a follow-up of  the proposed project, a quarterly newsletter is available to  participants via e-mail. Participants attended an annual  professional meeting (e.g., Computer Science Conference) and  have the opportunity to share experiences. Experts on computer  networks were available to participants throughout the  workshop. This workshop follows a successful model of a similar  NSF computer network workshop, funded for the 1991 summer and  received extended support for the summer of 1992.  ***",
