 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412377  ROGERSON       This project will investigate intergenerational relations in  the U.S. be focusing on living arrangements of elderly persons  and their geographic proximity to their adult children.  Proximity and living arrangements are often critical in  determining access to caregiving and support among members of  each generation.  Increased life expectancy, the aging of the  baby boom generation, and small family sizes suggest a need to  further understand these dimensions of family behavior.  Employing panel data from the 1988 and 1993 National Surveys of  Families and Households, static models as well as transition  models will be analyzed to capture a fuller picture of the living  arrangements and proximity between adult children and their  parents during the study period.  A rational choice perspective  will be utilized to develop and test models of: (1) the choices  of living arrangements of elderly persons, (2) the structure  of  hierarchical relationships among living arrangement alternatives,  and (c) changes in individual living arrangement choices.  Finally models of intergenerational accessibility will be  developed, including the establishment of a proximity/living  arrangement typology and an evaluation of transitions in family  accessibility states.       This project will contribute to theoretical understanding of  intergenerational relations from both a geographical and a  sociological perspective.  The results of the study will also  have important implications for our understanding of the future  well-being of an aging population.  The research will be  conducted by an interdisciplinary team that will construct a  better synthesis of this important phenomenon.",
