 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to establish at Michigan  Technological University a model computer laboratory with  appropriate software for the learning and teaching of geometry  through inductive approaches. The laboratory will consist of eleven  Macintosh Quadra 650 computers networked together. Software  packages such as the Geometry Inventer, the Geometric  superSupposer, Geometer's Sketchpad, Terrapin LOGO, and the Factory  will be utilized in the learning and teaching of College Geometry  to preservice secondary school mathematics teachers. With this  software, students can create their own geometric constructions,  look for patterns, formulate conjectures, and test these  conjectures rather quickly.    The software packages will be explored for geometry ideas and  concepts which lend themselves to inductive learning via the  software. A plan for the use of the software on those topics will  be developed by the instructor, and summarized for the students in  a software guide. The software guide will serve as a supplement to  their text and as a directory to when and how they should use the  software packages. Student attitudes toward learning geometry in  this manner and the amount of material covered will be evaluated.",
