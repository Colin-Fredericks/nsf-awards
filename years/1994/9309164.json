A  special effort is made to include the work of graduate students  and assistant professors representing a broad range of  specialties, but with increasing emphasis on twentieth century  problems.  The scientific results of the cliometric history  movement have been impressive and promise to be equally important  in the years ahead.  The 1994 meeting is scheduled to be held in  May at the University of Arizona.  The 1995 and 1966 Conferences  well be held at other sites to be selected from other  Universities  offering to host the conferences.  ***",
