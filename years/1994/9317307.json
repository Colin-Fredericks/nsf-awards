 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317307  Fisk   This award supports a study of rocks from submarine volcanos and  hydrothermal vents in the Bransfield Straits region of the  Antarctic Peninsula.  This is a continental margin rift in which  volcanoes less than 1 million years old have formed on thinned  continental crust from melting in the upper mantle.  Prior to 4  million years ago, this region was undergoing active subduction  of oceanic crust.  Seismic studies of recent earthquakes in the  Bransfield Strait indicate the presence of an ancient slab of  oceanic crust approximately 55 to 85 kilometers beneath the  surface.  As a cold, wet, slab sinks into the mantle, it heats  up, dehydrates, and expels fluid into the surrounding mantle.   This fluid induces melting and the melts move upward; some magma  is erupted at the surface.  By examining the volcanic rocks in  the Bransfield Strait, the investigators will learn about  magmatic processes in the mantle and about processes related to  recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle that occurred in the  past, during active subduction.  An ancillary aspect of this  study relates to hydrothermal activity near the volcanoes.   Hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks will be analyzed in order  to determine the chemical changes that hydrothermal alteration  has caused.  This study utilizes rocks that have already been  collected and visually characterized.  ***",
