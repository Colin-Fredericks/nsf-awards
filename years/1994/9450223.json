Each of eight new programs to be  broadcast on ABC has the goals of:  1)  entertaining six- to  eleven-year-old viewers while increasing their familiarity  with and interest in basic science and technology  principles, 2) stimulating viewers' interest in science and  technology by showing that they are not abstractions, but  integral parts of daily life, and 3) convincing youth that  discovering the workings of science and technology can be  fun.    In addition to the television series, CTW will develop and  distribute a range of supporting materials.  These include a  twelve-page activity book; a four-color, four-page user's  guide for informal science education leaders; two four-  color, sixteen-page comic books that include puzzles, brain  teasers, and simple experiments; an eight-panel activity  poster; and inclusion of \"CRO\" material in 3-2-1 Contact  magazine.  Part of the distribution of these materials will  be through CTW's partnerships with youth-serving  organizations such as YMCA's , 4-H Youth Development  Education, and Boys and Girls Clubs.  The series also will  be released on home video and CTW is considering development  of an interactive product based on the series.    Key staffing for season two will include Franklin Getchell  who will continue from season one as co-principal  investigator and Joel Schneider, who will replace Ed Atkins  as the other co-principal investigator.  Schneider will be  responsible for content development of both the television  series and of the ancillary materials.  Jeffrey Nelson,  formerly Executive Producer o f Square One TV, will join  \"CRO\" as Executive Producer.  ***",
