 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409569  Vuong    Auctions are the mechanisms by which many prices in real world  markets are formed.  Further understanding of auctions can help  design more efficient pricing mechanisms and thereby improve  society's allocation of resources.  In the public policy arena  today, auction design questions are of real importance in  financial securities markets (auctions of U.S. Treasury bills),  the environment (auctions of emission's allowances), and  telecommunications (auctions for radio/personal communications  spectrum).  Despite the importance of auctions and the huge body  of theoretical research on auctions, there has been little  rigorous empirical research on the economics of auctions because  of severe computational difficulties with the structural  estimation of auction models.  This project builds on recent  breakthroughs by the investigator in obtaining computationally  tractable methods of identifying, estimating, and testing  theoretical auction models within a structural approach.    More specifically, the objective of this project is to address  the following challenges to structural estimation of auction  models on real data:  (1)  Previous structural analyses have exclusively relied upon       some parametric specification of the structural elements of       the theoretical auction model.  This project develops       structural methods that do not require such parametric       information; and  (2)  It is known that economic policy conclusions based on       parametric analyses may not be robust to misspecification of       the structural elements.  The project develops a two-step       nonparametric procedure that is not subject to this problem,       is quite simple computationally and behaves satisfactorily       for sample sizes typically found in auction data sets.",
