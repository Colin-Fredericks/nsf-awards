Dr. Sheares received her  doctoral degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill under the supervision of Professor Joseph DeSimone.  Dr.  Sheares will continue research at the University of Mainz under  the sponsorship of Professor Reimund Stadler. Her postdoctoral  training will introduce her to  the optimization and  large-scale synthesis of polymer-grade aminoisoprene monomers  and their subsequent living polymerization with the objective  of controlling the molecular weight, molecular weight  distribution and homopolymer microstructure. Longer term, she  plans to study structure/property relationships in a new family  of ionomers with ionic groups spaced at regular intervals along  the chains. Homo-, block and star block ionomers will  be  synthesized and characterized.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.",
