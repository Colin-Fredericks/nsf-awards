 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319623  Sehgal    All organisms display biological rhythms that are controlled  by endogenous clocks.  These endogenous oscillators often  have a period of  about 24 hours, i.e. they are \"circadian\",  and they control important functions such as sleep-wake  cycles, maintenance of body temperature, and secretion of  hormones.    In this proposal Dr. Sehgal will investigate the molecular  mechanisms underlying rhythmic behavior.  The organism  studied will be the fruit fly, where genetic technology has  already been used to dissect some components of the  circadian clock.  One regulator of activity rhythms in the  fruit fly is the period (per) gene.  When this gene  undergoes mutation, the period of circadian rhythms may  lengthen, shorten or even be abolished.  Dr. Sehgal's group  will study a gene called timeless (tim) which appears to  operate by influencing the products of the per gene.  A  combinmation of molecular biological and genetic methods  will be used to isolate and characterize tim and to  determine how it interacts with per.    Recent findings suggest that genes such as per are present  in the brains of many animals.  Therefore studying per and  tim in this system may yield important insights into the  molecular architecture of the clock that times all living  organisms.***",
