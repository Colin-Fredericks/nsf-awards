 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405332  Members of the mammalian HMG-I(Y) family of \"high mobility group\"  (HMG) nonhistone chromatin proteins are of considerable current  interest because they appear to play important roles in the  chromosome structural changes occurring during the cell cycle and  also because they have recently been demonstrated to participate in  the transcriptional regulation of a number of inducible mammalian  genes in vivo.  The HMG-I(Y) proteins are distinguished from other  HMG proteins by their ability to specifically bind to stretches of  A-T rich DNA both in vitro and in vivo.  Available evidence  suggests two different, though not mutually exclusive, models of  how the HMG-I(Y) proteins might function in chromatin as gene  transcription regulatory proteins.  The first postulates a  nucleosome positioning or \"phasing\" role for HMG-I(Y) whereby  binding of the protein to A-T sequences establishes a \"boundary\"  that influences placement of adjacent nucleosomes in important  areas such as some gene promoter/enhancer regions.  The second  model proposes that by inducing bends in substrate DNA HMG-I(Y)  facilitates the binding of transcription factors to enhancer  sequences and also functions to bring together separated enhancer  regions so that they can form a multiprotein complex necessary for  transcription initiation.  The objectives of a one year research  project are to begin initial experiments to critically test certain  predictions of the first of these two models.  We will employ  carefully selected in vitro systems to quantitatively evaluate the  binding of HMG-I(Y) to reconstituted monomer and dinucleosomes of  defined DNA sequence and investigate whether these proteins can  alter nucleosome positioning/phasing in such systems.  In addition,  we will also initiate experiments employing a newly developed DNA  affinity cleaveage procedure to determine both the position and  orientation of HMG-I(Y) protein on free substrate DNAs and in  chromatin reconstitutes.  %%%  Members of the ma mmalian HMG-I(Y) family of \"high mobility group\"  (HMG) nonhistone chromatin proteins are of considerable current  interest because they appear to play important roles in the  chromosome structural changes occurring during the cell cycle and  also because they have recently been demonstrated to participate in  the transcriptional regulation of a number of inducible mammalian  genes in vivo.

The findings from these experiments will begin to  address, in  a precise and quantitative manner, the important  question of how the HMG-I(Y) non histone proteins potentially  influence the structure and function of reconstituted nucleosomes  in vitro.  And perhaps more importantly, the results obtained from  these in vitro studies will set the parameters for, and define the  limits of, future experiments aimed at elucidating the in vivo  function of these unusual and intriguing nonhistone proteins.  ***",
