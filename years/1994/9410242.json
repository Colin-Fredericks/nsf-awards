To  achieve this objective, two subproblems will be solved.  The  overall aggregate control will then be an intuitive blend of  these results.  The first subproblem is to determine an optimal  control for a re-entrant manufacturing system with buffer costs.   The method of solution is to exploit structural properties, such  as piecewise continuity and monotonicity, of an optimal control  in order to reduce the problem to one with a known solution.  The  second subproblem is to determine the effect of the control on  several unreliable machines.  It will be show that, for a certain  class of controls, the buffer level probability densities satisfy  a set of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations.  The  solution of these equations will be explored using numerical, and  simulation methods.  The aggregate control will partition the  system buffers using three criteria: machine reliability, buffer  utilization, and distribution of the down and up times of  machines.  The results of the subproblems will then be used to  determine the appropriate controls.  In addition, regulators will  be implemented to smooth out the material flow, thus reducing  second-order effects.  Simulation will be used to test the  efficiency of the aggregate control.  ***",
