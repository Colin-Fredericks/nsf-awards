Nuclear magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spin  echoes  will be used as a microscopic probe, in conjunction  with  electrical  transport. Most of the work will be on the  Bechgaard  salts  (TMTSF)2X (X=PF6, ClO4, AsF6, etc.). Both  \"ordinary\"  and  field  induced spin density waves with varying degrees of pinning  will be investigated. The physical quantities to be obtained from  this  work  include  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  order  parameter, the displacement of the condensate in response  to  an  electrical  field  below  threshold, its sliding  velocity  above  threshold,  the spatial and temporal distribution of the  sliding  velocity  above threshold, SDW memory and repinning effects,  and  the   temperature  and  frequency  dependence   of   SDW   phason  fluctuations.    Non-technical  abstract:  The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  investigate an unusual property of several organic materials that  conduct electricity. At low temperatures the conducting electrons  form a semiconducting state with an undulating magnetic structure  called  a spin density wave (SDW). This SDW is usually pinned  to  the  underlying  material imperfections. When, however,  a  small  electric  field  above  a certain threshold  is  applied  to  the  material,  the SDW slides. Under these conditions, it  becomes  a  new  type of electrical current. The measurements to be made  are  electrical  conduction and nuclear magnetic resonance  spin  echo  studies  of the basic properties of these SDWs. They include  the  size  of the undulating magnetic field, how its size varies  with  temperature, its thermal vibrations, how it moves when driven  by  an  electric  field, and the complex way it becomes pinned  again  when the electric field is removed.      p:\\wickman\\abstract\\clark.doc",
