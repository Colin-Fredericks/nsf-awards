 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401351  Radcliffe       This award funds the research of Professor Andrew Radcliffe  into Sauer's theorem and its implications.  Prof. Radcliffe  intends studying traces of antichains, general trace problems and  antichains.  The work should have implications for learning  theory, empirical processes and the theory of Banach spaces.       This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,   which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting,  although this research is more involved with comparing the  results of counting.  Sauer's theorem is a general inequality  that allows one to know that one collection contains more objects  than another.  Of course the collections must be of particular  types,  but the conditions are not hard to satisfy. Although its  roots go back several centuries, the field of combinatorics has  had an explosive development in the past few decades.  This  growth comes from its importance in communications and  information technology,  and as in this work, artificial  intelligence.",
