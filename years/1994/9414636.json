 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fort Lewis College (FLC) is an undergraduate, state-supported liberal arts institution educates  students from the culturally diverse, four-corner's region of the Southwest, as well as other parts  of the U.S.  Originally an Indian High School in 1892, the college has a tradition and mandates  from the State of Colorado to provide education opportunities to all Native Americans.  As a part  of the broad liberal arts mission, the biology and chemistry departments have developed  nationally recognized undergraduate research programs.  The college administration has  supported these research programs  by giving priority status in its Academic Master Plan to the  training of future scientists in a collaborative environment.  Subsequently, the college has made a  commitment to the science program by supporting the renovation of outdated research and  research training space that is inadequate to sustain research activities.  This renovation project is  a component of a much larger planned science building addition that will create additional  teaching and research space for all the FLC sciences.  The college, with ARI funds, will consolidate interdisciplinary biology and chemistry research  laboratories that are currently dispersed throughout the science facility.  Renovations will consist  of: upgrading HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems; improving the fire protection system,  providing a laboratory workstation specifically designed for the physically challenged, and  installing fixed equipment such as fume hoods, a glass washer, and a cold room.  Once  renovations are completed, faculty and students will have all the necessary equipment and lab  space in one physical location, facilitating ongoing curricular development at FLC that  emphasizes a community of faculty and student collaborative research and training.  An  atmosphere where research at the interface of biology and chemistry will be created, attracting  and training future scientists in biotechnology and environmental assessment and  remediation.",
