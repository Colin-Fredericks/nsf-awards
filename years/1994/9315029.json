 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315029  Smith  The annual expansion and retreat of pack ice in the Southern  Ocean are the largest seasonal processes in the World Ocean. This  seasonal migration of the ice cover has a profound impact on the  pelagic community in the upper 100 m of the oceanic water column  where the interactions between ice cover and apex predators, such  as seabirds and mammals, are most intense.  This unique pelagic  community has been mainly studied with ship-based operations.  However, there are well recognized problems associated with  shipboard sampling of the epipelagic community under pack ice and  the need to monitor this community on long-time scales sufficient  to examine the extreme temporal variability of this environment.   To examine continuous temporal variability, the project will  develop a vertically-profiling pump sampler for the collections  of zooplankton and micronekton over programmable depth intervals  under pack ice in the Weddell Sea.  Once developed and field  tested, this instrument will be deployed concurrently with  previously developed upward-looking, vertically-profiling  acoustic arrays for a period of one year. The combined mooring  project will monitor the vertical distribution, abundance and  size frequency of acoustically detectable zooplankton and  micronekton in the upper 100 m of the water column in an area  that experiences ice cover during 7-8 months of the year.  This  project will also include seasonal shipboard sampling on three  cruises over the course of the one year field study.  A  successful deployment of these long-term mooring arrays and  retrieval of data from the field will contribute to a greater  understanding of how epipelagic communities function under pack  ice in the Southern Ocean.  This is a jointly sponsored project  of the Office of Polar Programs and the Division of Ocean  Sciences.  ***",
