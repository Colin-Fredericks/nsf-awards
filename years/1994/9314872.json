The objective of  their research is to analyze data from several international  field experiments, and integrate the data with hydrologic models  that focus on the transfer of heat and moisture in temperate,  arid and semiarid regions.  The experiments include the Monsoon  '90 experiment, sponsored by NASA, USDA-ARS and USGS, the  CNES/NASA multi-aircraft campaign and the hydrologic-atmospheric  pilot experiment in the Sahel.    Fluxes of moisture and energy between the land surface and lower  atmosphere are key components to understanding atmospheric  processes and climate.  The proposed multidisciplinary data  analysis of ground-based measurements and remote sensing  observations at different geological sites could lead to models  which are applicable to a range of conditions and sites.  The  project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the  U.S. and French teams in analysis of remotely sensed data and in  hydrologic modeling.  ***",
