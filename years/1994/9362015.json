 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362015  Buck       Measurement of trace amounts of water vapor is critical to  industrial processes such as semiconductor fabrication, where  moisture in gases must often be below a few parts per billion  (PPB).  Water in trace amounts is also critical in high altitude  atmospheric chemistry, affecting global climate change and ozone  depletion.  Current instruments for measuring trace moisture are  severely limited.  Some cannot maintain calibration; others have  slow response times.  Most have limited sensitivity.       A cryogenic chilled-mirror hygrometer capable of extremely  high sensitivity (below one PPB) and very fast response time (a few  seconds) has been developed.  It is accurate and simple to operate.   However, to be fully useful in industrial processes, the  relationship between dew/frost point and vapor pressure  (enhancement factor) must be defined for industrial gases.  This  instrument provides direct means to determine enhancement factors  at very low moisture levels in a variety of gases.  This research  is to test and optimize the instrument for use as a trace moisture  sensor in industrial gases.  This work will make possible fast,  accurate measurements of trace water vapor in industrial gases and  the atmosphere.",
