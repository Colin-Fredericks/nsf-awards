The project team led by three principal investigators representing industrial design, engineering design and manufacturing engineering has been developing design support tools appropriate to improve combined evaluations from industrial designers concerns and engineering and manufacturing considerations.  Specifically, four major tool development efforts will be made for (1) design history documenting system, (2) associative, shape design tools, (3) design for manufacture comparative cost models and design-to cost tools and (4) designer-friendly interface for rapid prototyping tools.   Based on newly developed design methodologies and tools for integrated engineering and industrial design, fully collaborated, innovative curriculum, composed of two core courses, will be developed in a tightly integrated design studio and prototyping laboratory.  Emphasis will be on the integrated design methods and tools in the first semester course, and on interdisciplinary team-based design projects sponsored by industry in the second semester course.  ***",
