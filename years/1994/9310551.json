 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310551  Eckelbarger  The Darling Marine Center is the marine laboratory of the  University of Maine System.  Strategically located on the Gulf of  Maine, the Center offers unparalleled research and teaching  opportunities for resident and visiting faculty and students who  require ready access to a wide variety of inshore and subtidal  habitats including salt marshes, beaches, seagrass beds, soft  bottoms of all grain size types, and rocky hard bottoms.  Over  the last two years, the University has made an unprecedented  financial commitment to modernize the facility and to expand  teaching and research programs to benefit both University and  visiting faculty and researchers.  During 1992, additional lab  and office space was created for visiting scientists, two-thirds  of the existing buildings were renovated or improved, visitor  housing was increased by 65%, a new dining wall was built, a  shoreside Dive & Field Staging Building was constructed, a small  wet classroom was created, a new boat was added to the research  fleet, and the research library was expanded.  In 1993, the  number of summer courses and workshops offered will be doubled  over 1992 and a unique Marine Biodiversity Program will be  inaugurated to begin building a biological database.  In the fall  1993, a newly created \"Semester-by-the-Sea\" program will be  initiated for UM undergraduates.  Because the Center has  experienced an abrupt upturn in use by resident and visiting  faculty, the University requests funds to construct a small  shoreside Visiting Investigator Lab/Classroom building to help  reduce crowding and to efficiently consolidate all teaching and  visiting investigator activities near the waterfront.  The  building would contain: 1) day lab/office space for summer  visitors that can be converted to a classroom during the academic  year, 2) a running seawater lab, 3) a small voucher specimen  museum, and 4) a chemical/radioactive tracer lab.  ***",
