The materials  focus on developing teachers' skills in observing and supporting  \"hands-on\" investigation and exploration.  The videos provide  documentary footage of the many ways in which students interact  with a range of materials common in middle school physical  science.  Print resources provide a surround for the videos.         The project emphasizes research and evaluation to identify  how the design and content of the materials can maximize the  impact on teachers' understanding and practice, and the use of  the materials by instructors in different settings.  The project  also explores strategies for distribution.  Following the pilot  it is anticipated that a full set of materials will be produced  and distributed.  ***",
