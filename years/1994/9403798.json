 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403798  Booty       Steady, one-dimensional, premixed flames (or \"deflagration  waves\") involving reactions that are highly activated can be  categorized by their propagation Mach number, with flames of  different Mach number having a different mathematical structure.   In practice, however, most flames are spatially narrow and  continually adjust both their speed and shape in accordance with  the local environment through which they travel.  The aim of the  project is to clarify some of the outstanding issues regarding  the unsteady and nonplanar propagation of different types of  flames.  These are governed by a coupled system of nonlinear  partial differential equations, viz. the reactive Navier-Stokes  equations, of which approximate solutions will be sought by (i)  the systematic use of asymptotic and perturbation methods, for  identifying significant or distinguished limits, and (ii)  numerical methods.       Steady, one-dimensional flames can be categorized by their  propagation speed, with flames of different speed having a  different mathematical structure.  In practice, however, most  flames are spatially narrow and continually adjust both their  speed and shape in accordance with the environment through which  they travel.  The aim of the project is to address some of the  outstanding issues regarding the unsteady and nonplanar  propagation of different types of flame.  In particular, (i)  circumstances should be established under which a freely  propagating, low-speed flame can either be extinguished or  develop into a high-speed detonation wave, and (ii) the mechanism  determining the different ways in which these events can occur  should be clarified.  This has applications to the control and  safety of combustion phenomena in various different contexts.",
