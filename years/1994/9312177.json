They will collaborate on  stimulus-response relations in olfactory neurons.       Signal transduction systems are often measured by dose-response  relationships.  This critical quantitative measure is unavailable  for olfactory receptors, due largely to the difficulty of  accurately delivering a stimulus of known concentration.  This  project seeks to provide this data by applying a novel means of  stimulus delivery, in which a single living cell can be  completely immersed in a particular odor solution while its  electrical response is monitored.  From this data, it will be  possible to construct the dose-response relations of individual  olfactory cells to a variety of odor stimuli.    Both investigators are established and highly regarded, the  problem is fundamental to sensory neuroscience, and the  collaboration exploits complementary skills with a novel and  unique approach.  The collaboration has the potential to have a  major impact on understanding chemosensory functions.  * * *",
