 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411952  Calkins  This project will provide support for an historian of international  relations to receive one year of training in nuclear engineering,  health physics and radiation protection fundamentals.  The  investigator will also undertake collaborative research with a  senior nuclear engineer and health physicist, to enable her to  study the radiation protection management strategies accompanying  the worldwide diffusion of non-military nuclear technologies.   Project research will develop along three related lines: i) a study  of the role of radiation protection management features in  developing countries' nuclear technologies acquisition programs  since 1955; ii) identification of the structures and content of  formal and informal international regulatory regimes for assuring  exposure risk minimization in the education, health and safety,  materials management, and facilities oversight sectors; and iii) an  assessment of developing countries' past, current, and probable  future engagement with those regulatory regimes.  The outcome will  be multi-dimensional and technically specific examinations of the  process of nuclear technology development and accompanying  radiation protection regulation outside the advanced industrial  states.  It will offer new insights into the utility of various  international regulatory regimes in non-military sectors and into  radiation protection and materials management worldwide.  Results  will be disseminated broadly through publications and presentations  in academic and policy-making communities, as well as through  university and public presentations.  ***",
