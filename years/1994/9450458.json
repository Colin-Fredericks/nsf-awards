 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450458  McBay    This project addresses the need to assess the status of the  mathematics and science teacher education programs at predominantly  minority institutions to determine what changes, if any, are  required to ensure that future graduates of these institutions and  current teachers who receive in-service training from these  institutions are able to provide the quality of mathematics and  science instruction needed by today's students.    The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will convene a  conference of approximately 80 people from among the Deans of the  School of Education or Chairs of the Department of Education and  Chairs of the Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics  Departments at 20 minority institutions that are major producers of  minority teachers.    Conference participants will assess the status of the current  mathematics and science teacher education programs at these  institutions; discuss national teacher and mathematics and science  curriculum standards and challenges in meeting them; learn about  advanced instructional technologies and model strategies at  participating institutions; and identify potential strategies and  collaborations to ensure the production of graduates who can meet  the standards expected.    Conference Proceedings will be produced and broadly disseminated.   A special target audience for the Proceedings will be other  predominantly minority colleges and universities with teacher  education programs throughout the country.",
