 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362031  Dunsmuir  Flavor in tomato fruit is associated with high levels of both  sugars and acids.  It is known that the level of malic acid in the  fruit declines by 50% with fruit ripening and that this reduction  is thought to be mediated by a cytosolic NADP dependent malic  enzyme (NADP-ME).  The tomato NADP-ME genes which are expressed in  the pericarp during ripening by using a heterologous probe for  NADP-ME from maize will be isolated and characterized.  Once  isolated, the tomato genes will be used in genetic engineering  experiments so that the induction of NADP-ME which occurs during  ripening would be reduced or inhibited and higher malic acid levels  would persist within the ripe fruit.  In parallel higher levels of  the same enzyme in the fruit will be engineered in order to gain  insight into mechanisms which regulate acid levels in the fruit.  %%%  The anticipated outcome of this research would be the ability to  directly engineer the acid levels in fruit which could  significantly affect the flavor of tomatoes in the treatment of  processing tomatoes.  ***",
