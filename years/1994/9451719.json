 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ducharme  9451719  Optical technology has become an increasingly important component  of the education of every scientist and engineer. This is  particularly true for physicists. Moreover, lasers are  intrinsically attractive to undergraduates, who are often highly  motivated to build and apply them. We intend to capitalize on the  laser \"magnet\" by integrating modern optics and lasers into  advanced laboratories in need of intellectual rejuvenation, into  the undergraduate research program, and into a proposed new  laboratory course which will feature experiments taken from the  forefront of optical physics and technology. The program is  structured to progressively implement sophisticated uses of lasers  and modern optical technologies, using them both as teaching tools  and as means of engaging student interest.  This project integrates into our advanced undergraduate  laboratories the research directions and expertise of three of our  newer faculty members, as well as current research interests in  other science and engineering departments, and research carried out  in several centers established at UNL by the state-funded Nebraska  Research Initiative. This program will offer our undergraduates the  opportunity to acquire concepts and techniques of optical physics  and technology that they will likely use in their careers. The new  laboratory course, \"Physics of Lasers and Modern Optics,\" will  attract and serve students from other sciences and engineering as  well as physics majors.",
