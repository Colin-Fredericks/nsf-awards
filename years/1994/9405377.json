Computationally intensive multiple  integrals arise in areas such as atomic and nuclear physics,  statistics and the analysis of sensory data.  This project  involves the design, analysis and development of a set of coarse  grain parallel and distributed algorithms for multivariate  numerical integration.    The main focus is on adaptive integration strategies layered over  a system for distributed queue management.  Implementations are  targeted to loosely coupled systems.  Adaptive integration is  used as the main tool for integrals over regions of low to  moderate dimension.  The queue management incorporates the  insertion and deletion of subregions (tasks) into and from the  distributed task pool while retaining balanced or approximately  balanced loads in the local queues.  It will be adapted to the  problem as well as the types of processors and the speed of  communications in the loosely coupled system.  For low  dimensionality special attention will be paid to the use of  (near) optimal degree rules and techniques dedicated to the  treatment of specific integration problems such as singularities  or particular weight functions.  Number theoretic methods will be  included for high dimensions, irregular regions or erratic  function behavior.  ***",
