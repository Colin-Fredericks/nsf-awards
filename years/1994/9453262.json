Students who complete one  of the associate degree programs will be ready to enter the  workforce as advanced technicians in a variety of science-based  occupations which target both sustaining and restoring natural  resources, or they can continue for advanced degrees. Associate  degree programs in diverse natural resource/environmental fields  are being created or are undergoing major curricular revisions to  focus on aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems. Secondary schools and  colleges and universities  complete the conduit that is providing  a seamless delivery of basic scientific content, principles, and  processes culminating with hands-on applications.  Internships in industries and agencies are providing the fertile  ground to produce a workforce capable of contributing to a unified  approach to restoration, environmental clean-up, watershed  enhancement, sustainable forestry and fisheries, and habitat  restoration. Innovative programs in biotechnology and energy  management are being developed in a region where industry itself is  driving the programs. The Center programs provide innovative,  transportable models for developing problem solving, communication,  and collaborative skills that match the requirements of an advanced  scientific/technologic workforce necessary to transform the  workplace to high performance. The NWRCSR is providing a model for  collaborative efforts to address important regional and national  needs.  ***",
