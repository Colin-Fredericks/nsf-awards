 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this research is the role of randomness  in  computation.  Randomization has proved extremely useful in almost  all areas  of computer science, such as Monte Carlo simulations,  cryptography, distributed  computing, and network constructions.  These uses of randomness seem wonderful,  until one realizes that  computers don't have truly random bits available to  them.    Most computers get their random bits by using pseudo-random  generators.  Usually, these pseudo-random generators work well in  practice.  Nevertheless, it is not at all unusual to find  instances where they don't.  It  is therefore important to find  generators that are provably good, if such  generators exist.  Can  we always remove the randomness from an efficient  randomized  algorithm, and be left with an efficient deterministic algorithm  that produces the correct answer?  This is the general problem,  which has  different theoretical formulations, depending on the  notion of efficiency used.  Since polynomial time is the most  common measure of efficiency, the most common  theoretical  formulation is as follows:  does randomized polynomial time   (BPP) equal deterministic polynomial time (P)?  Unfortunately,   the only  direct progress on  the BPP vs. P question has relied on unproven  assumptions.     This work focuses on  two more specific questions.  First, can BPP be simulated using a general weak  random source  that outputs n bits with bounded entropy?  Second, does  RSPACE(S) = DSPACE(S) or, more realistically with five years, can  randomized  SPACE(S) algorithms that use more that poly(S) random  bits be simulated  deterministically in SPACE(S)?",
