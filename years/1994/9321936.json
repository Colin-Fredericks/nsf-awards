 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321936  McCarthy       This project refines the design tools and trains industry and   academia to use them, and to expand this design technology to   include spatial 4C mechanisms.  These latter mechanisms retain the   simplicity of four links and hinges, with the bearings that slide   as well as rotate, and have a complexity of movement similar to   general robot manipulators.  With these design tools engineers will   be able to invent completely new, simple, reliable, and cost-   effective systems to guide a prescribed spatial movement.  This   capability will result in new commercial products and components   for manufacturing automation.       Spatial mechanisms provide simple elegant solutions to the   need for prescribed spatial movement.  Unfortunately, the three   dimensionality of their construction and movement is difficult for   a designer to visualize, and they are rarely employed in industry.   Previous research has used visualization tools to design and build   the simplest spatial mechanism, the spherical 4R linkage.  Open-   ended projects have resulted in a wide-range of ideas for new   products and new components for automation systems all based on   spherical mechanisms.",
