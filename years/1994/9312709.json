 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312709  Sweigart    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart, Department of  Chemistry, Brown University, to pursue with Dr. Young K. Chung, Department of  Chemistry, Seoul National University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research involving physical and synthetic studies of  organometallic electrophiles.  The project will include both organometallic  synthesis and electrochemistry.  The synthetic studies will involve the use of  manganese to (1) convert arenes to difunctionalized optically pure  cyclohexadienes and (2) produce new functionalized derivatives of indoles,  steroids, and natural products related to vitamins D and K.  The  electrochemical part of the research is designed to study the reactivity of  17- and 19-electron organometallic radicals with respect to ligand  substitution and other transformations.    The proposed research, if successful, will be of significant interest to a  range of chemists, including those concerned with organic synthesis in the  natural products and drug fields.  The PI and his Korean collaborator are  highly respected chemists in the fields of this research.  Their expertise is  complementary.  Dr. Chung's group is expert in a wide range of synthetic  procedures and will be responsible for perhaps two thirds of the synthetic  work.  The PI's group will do perhaps one third of the synthetic work and most  of the electrochemical and computer work.  The collaborators will be assisted  by three U.S. graduate students supported by this grant and several Korean  graduate students.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-  Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the  project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).   This project  adds an international cooperative dimension to the PI's research  under NSF Grant No. CHE-8821588.  ***",
