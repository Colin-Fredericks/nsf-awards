 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports work on algebraic groups.  The principal  investigator will study several aspects of the representation  theory of semisimple algebraic groups over fields of prime  characteristic, with applications to finite groups of Lie type.   The program of Lusztig relating quantum groups and modular  representations is of primary concern, with emphasis on injective  modules and tilting modules.  Representation arising from the  cohomology of line budnles on flag varieties pose related  problems; a major question here concerns the relationship with  Kazhdon-Luztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group.  The study  of algebraic groups should provide further insight into  representations of associated finite simple groups, and related  cohomology.             This research is in the general area of algebraic groups.   Roughly speaking, a group which satisfies a polynomial identity  is an algebraic group.  The proposed research falls under two  broad headings: cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties, and  injective modules.  Advances along these lines would both shed  light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as point the way beyond  it.",
