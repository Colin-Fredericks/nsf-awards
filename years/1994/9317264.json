 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jagus  9305314  The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of  action the dsRNA-dependent elF-2cx specific protein kinase, PKR, at  the molecular structural level, utilizing a vaccinia virus gene  product, pK3, that functions as a pseudosubstrate.  PKR, a potent  inhibitor of protein synthesis, is an enzyme that serves a  regulatory role in host defense against viral infection, cell  proliferation, cell differentiation, and the inflammatory response.   The specific aims are 1) to identify the substrate binding  domain(s) of PKR using pK3, the vaccinia virus homologue of elF-2cx  that binds stably to PKR; 2) to confirm the results of the invitro  studies in vivo, using wild-type and variant forms of PKR  transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and 3) to extrapolate the  conclusions of elF-2cx itself.  The methods to be employed are recombinant DNA techniques,  polymerase chain reaction, site-specific mutagenesis,  deoxynucleotide sequencing, in vitro transcription and translation,  protein kinase assays, gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting,  immunoprecipitation, and expression of recombinant proteins in  bacteria and mammalian cells.  PKR plays a key role in the inhibition of viral growth by  interferon, in the maintenance of low proliferation rates, the  initiation of differentiation, and the production of cytokines and  cellular adhesion molecules.  Despite the importance of this  enzymes and wealth of information recently uncovered on its  regulatory domains, little is currently known about how it  interacts with its only known cellular substrate, elF02cx.  This  proposal represents a strategy to identify substrate binding  domains in PKR using a vaccinia virus homologue to elF-cx that  binds stably to PKR.  The ability of pK3 to form tight associations  with PKR, as well as its homology to elF-2cx, forms the basis of a  simple binding assay to investigate functional domains of PKR and  pK3, and by extrapolation of elF-2cx.  %%%  The synthesis of proteins is accomplished by a c omplex machinery  involving hundreds of proteins and is regulated by the protein  synthesis factor, elF-2.  elF-2 exists in two forms, an active and  an inactive form.  The change from an active to an inactive form of  elF-2 is accomplished by a modifying protein called PKR.  To  increase our understanding of the mechanism of action of PKR at a  molecular level, we will identify the site within the molecule that  interacts with elF-2.  The gene for PKR will be mutated and the  variant PKR's will be expressed in bacteria and purified.  The  activities of the variant PKR's will be compared for their ability  to bind to a competitor for elF-2, pK3, a protein produced in  vaccinia virus infected cells.  The results from these studies  using isolated components will be confirmed by expressing the  mutant PKR's in a model cell system and monitoring their ability to  modify elF-2.  PKR plays a key role in many cellular processes such as the  inhibition of viral growth by interferon, the initiation of cell  differentiation, and the production of molecules that promote cell-  cell interaction.  In addition, PKR seems to function as a tumor  suppressor gene.  ***",
