 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical  abstract:  A study of the magnetic properties of ultra-thin  rare-earth  films and sandwiches will be conducted. The  issues  which  will be addressed will be the surface magnetic reconstructions and the  indirect exchange coupling across non-magnetic spacer layers  such  as  ytterbium. The films will be grown in an ultra high vacuum chamber and  characterized  in-situ  with  low energy electron  diffraction,  Auger  electron diffraction, angle resolved photoemission, spatially resolved  spin polarized secondary electron spectroscopy, and magneto-optic Kerr  effect.  Ex-situ characterization of the samples will include extended  x-ray  absorption fine structure, vibrating sample magnetometry, x-ray  diffraction,  and  magneto-resistance  measurements.  The  change   of  structural,   magnetic,   and   transport   properties   for   various  thicknesses, preparation temperatures, substrates, and cap layers will  be  investigated.  A more complete understanding of  the  surface  and  interfacial magnetic properties of the rare-earths is sought in  order  to  find  applications  for  their unique properties  in  non-volatile  magnetic storage applications and magnetic sensor technology.    Non-technical abstract:  Magnetic films are presently the mainstay  of  modern data storage devices such as hard disk drives and tape back  up  system. The films are used both as the active storage media as well as  in  the  heads  which read the data. Two main examples are  read-write  rnagneto-optic  disk  dnves, which use an alloy of  transition  metals  (iron  and  cobalt) together with a rare earth (ytterbium) to  form  a  film   with  magnetic  domains  which  represent  the  data)  pointing  perpendicular to the surface and layered pickup-heads made of magnetic  transition metals which have a large resistance change when they  pass  over  the various magnetic patterns on a storage tape. In the  present  study,   the  magnetic  domain  properties  of  very  thin  rare-earth  materials and lay ered structures will be investigated to determine the  suitability  of  these  materials for future generations  of  magnetic  storage media.",
