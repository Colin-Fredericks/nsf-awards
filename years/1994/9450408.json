Smith University plans a four-week intensive residential  Summer Science Camp and a monthly Saturday component for 50  seventh, eighth, and ninth grade minority students for the three  year period 1994-1997.  The program focuses on classroom and field  activities in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics,  mathematics, and problem-solving.  Activities invovle the  Scientific Method as students make observations, collect and  analyze data, and draw conclusions.  Field experiences involve  visits to industry, government labs, and science museums.  Group  meetings with minortiy scientists, engineers, and teachers, are  planned to promote careers which are mathematics and science based.    Participants will also be encouraged to consider teaching as one of  their career choices.  The Saturday component is designed for  further mentoring, follow-up activities, and for students to  continue working on their summer projects.  The program encourages  students to enroll in mathematics and science in school and to be  successful.  In so doing, we seek to address the need for a  scientifically literate society, and to help reverse the declining  achievement, interest, and participation by minority students in  science and mathematics.",
