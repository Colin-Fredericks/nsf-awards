Strong ecological  selectiv pressures for biological devices to resist pathogens and  predators must exist in embryos to assure survival of these  critical primary stages in oceanic life cycles. The egg capsule of  the Pacificc squid, Loligo opalescens, provides a model system to  study such embryo protection processes. These squid deposit their  eggs in large communal aggregates in shallow coastal waters such as  in Monterey Bay. During their month-long gestation period these  embryos endure little or no animal, fungal, or microbial  predations. Initial studies revealed the presence of several  distinct bacterial symbionts specifically associated with the egg  capsule sheath. These bacteria apparently are secreted from the  accessory nidamental gland connected to the squid ovary, which also  contains symbioticbacteria. This research project aims to identify  these microbes and assess their contribution to the protection of  the squid embryos in the wild. By integrating prokaryotic genetics  and molecular biology with more classical approaches to ocean  ecology, this research will address questions concerning both  marine embryo defense mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents  for use in aquaculture and medicine.  Additionally, the molecular  devices responsible for the mutualistic relationship between marine  bacteria and the eukaryotic host that will be studied may represent  a global phenomenon with implications for a wide spectrum of  disciplines including immunology, cell biology, and infectious  disease.   ***",
