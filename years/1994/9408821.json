 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine  the mechanism(s) of RNA transport into, and localization  within, the Drosophila oocyte and to relate such processes  to the establishment of dorsoventral pattern in the mature  egg and early embryo.  This research is focused on the  Drosophila dorsoventral patterning gene 'fs(1)K10(K10)'.  'K10' RNA is synthesized in ovarian nurse cells and  selectively transported via cytoplasmic bridges into the  oocyte during early to middle stages of oogenesis.  Several  other Drosophila RNAs that play critical roles in egg and  embryonic pattern fromation, including 'oskar' and 'bicoid',  are also synthesized in nurse cells and selectively  transported into the oocyte.  There is growing evidence that  'K10', 'oskar' and 'bicoid' RNA transport occurs along  microtubule tracts and therefore is similar in mechanism to  the transport/localization of RNA and organelles in higher  organisms.  The proposed studies seek to identify and  characterize the cis- and trans-acting regulators of 'K10'  RNA transport.  An investigation of 'K10' protein function  will also be carried out.  The PI's interest in this stems  from the observation that 'K10' is required for the  localization within the oocyte of 'gurken' RNA, which  encodes a TGFalpha-like signaling molecule required for the  asymmetric differentiation of the oocyte's neighboring  somatic follicle cells.  The proposed studies represent a  molecular, genetic, and biochemical approach to the problem  of RNA localization/transport and utilize mutagenesis, germ-  line transformation, protein-nucleic acid binding, in situ  hybridization, and immunocytochemical techniques.",
