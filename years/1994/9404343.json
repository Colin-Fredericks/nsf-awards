 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spectral envelope was recently introduced as a method for  analyzing categorical time series in the spectral domain and has  been successfully applied in analyzing DNA sequences. In  developing the theory and methodology of the spectral envelope  for categorical time series, it was discovered that there are  many interesting extensions to the concept. Although there are  numerous directions in which to pursue this idea, this research  will focus, at least, on extending the concept of the spectral  envelope to the analysis of real-valued time series. Here, the  main goals will be to obtain optimal transformations of  real-valued (univariate and multivariate) time series that may be  nonlinear, non-Gaussian, or have some unsuspected dependence  structure, and to envelop (or blanket) the spectrum of any such  transformation of the time series.  The spectral envelope was recently introduced as a method for  analyzing qualitative data observed sequentially in time or space  (time series) and has been successfully applied in analyzing DNA  sequences. In developing the theory and methodology of the  spectral envelope for such data, it was discovered that there are  many interesting extensions to the concept. Although there are  numerous directions in which to pursue this idea, this research  will focus, at least, on extending the concept of the spectral  envelope to the analysis of quantitative time series data.  Here,  the main goals will be to obtain optimal transformations of time  series that may be nonlinear, non-Normal, or have some  unsuspected dependence structure, and to discover any interesting  cyclic (repetitive) properties of these data.",
