 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is strengthening the soils curriculum with a hands-on,  field-laboratory approach centered around the acquisition of  microwave ovens and tumblers for conducting weathering and erosion  experiments, soil field laboratories, moisture meters, laser  levelers, with an atomic absorption unit. The course most  benefiting from the project is Soils and Land use. Enrollments  average between 2O and 25 per semester with approximately half of  these students enrolled in the teacher education program. Revised  units of the course feature: 1) weathering and erosion experiments  in the laboratory using the microwave oven and tumbler; 2) more  accurate soil nutrient inventories in various field settings using  portable soil testing laboratories that include spectrophotometers;  3) time efficient field mapping of erosive slopes using laser  leveling techniques; and 4) exposure to the sampling and  measurement of soil metal pollution through atomic absorption  spectroscopy. For each unit students form hypotheses, test their  validity, and describe the results of the soil processes being  investigated.  The equipment also benefits 2O-25 pre-service  teachers per semester in the Earth Science for Teachers class.  These students need a better field and laboratory background  regarding soils and the opportunity to use such experiences in  building their own lesson plans. Pre-service teachers submit a  major soils lesson plan involving an equipment or a field  demonstration to the grade level they expect to teach. The project  also benefits other courses such as Landforms, Biogeography,  Independent Studies, in-service teacher workshops, and a team  taught interdisciplinary science course for middle school students.",
