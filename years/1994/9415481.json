 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic ecosystems are sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, however,  fluxes are extremely variable over small spatial scales.  Therefore, large-scale measurements which integrate patch-scale  variability are needed to determine the magnitude of CH4  efflux.  Recent advances in laser technology have resulted in the  development of sensitive, rapid response CH4 sensors for  landscape-scale flux measurements.  However, many of these  instruments require elaborate support systems and large amounts  of power during operation, which inhibit their use in remote  field studies.  A fast response open path CH4 sensor was recently  developed that does not require a large amount of extraneous  supplies for operation. Although this sensor appears to be  practical for use in remote flux studies, it is unknown whether  it is sensitive enough to resolve the small CH4  fluxes  characteristic of arctic ecosystems, or robustenough to withstand  the harsh arctic environment. Therefore, the sensor will be  tested on a portable eddy correlation tower in a variety of  arctic ecosystems for two weeks during the 1994 field season.  If  the field test is successful, the sensor may then be implemented  for future tower and/or aircraft-based eddy correlation flux  studies in remote arctic ecosystems.  This award is made under  the SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) initiative. The  project is part of the Arctic System Science,Land/Atmosphere/Ice  Interactions Flux project.",
