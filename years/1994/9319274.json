 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319274   Gajewski  Thermally induced reactions involving 1, 1-, 1, 3-, and 3,   3-sigmatropic shifts, polar solvent effects, and additions   to aldehydes will be studied. Stereochemistry, deuterium   kinetic isotope effects, and temperature dependence will be   used to probe the course of these reactions. The 1, 3-shift   study will focus on the vinylcyclopropane rearrangement,   isomerizations of alpha-pinene, alkoxy-substituted   vinycyclopropane and vinylcyclobutanes, and the   methylenecyclopropane degenerate rearrangement. The 3, 3-  shift studies will focus on heteroatom substituted 1,5-  dienes and the 1, 1-shift studies will pursue the extent of   double bond rotation in the geometric isomerization of   trans-1,2-dideuteriospiropentane. Further development of a   multi-parameter equation to correlate solvolysis rates,   Claisen rearrangements, and Diels-Alder reactions will be   pursued. Nucleophilic additions to aldehydes will be studied   by means of deuterium isotope effects in order to determine   the amount of bond formation in the transition state.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Joseph J. Gajewski at Indiana   University. The results of this research will provide   fundamental understanding about the reaction paths that are   selected in the thermal rearrangement of organic molecules.   This is an important topic, since such thermal   rearrangements find applications in various areas from   processing of petroleum to synthesis of organic molecules.   The intricacies of these reactions will be probed by using   deuterium labeled compounds and the unique three-dimensional   structure of selected molecules. The effect of solvent on   rates of reactions and additions to carbon-oxygen double   bonds will be explored as well.  ***",
