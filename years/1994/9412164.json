This issue is addressed in the  present research in the context of adult attachment theory.   Self-report attachment style data will be collected on each of the  relationships in 200 two-parent two-child families according to a  round-robin design.  These data will be analyzed using the Social  Relations Model, which provides information on the contributions of  actors, partners, and unique interpersonal relationships in explaining  interpersonal data.  This analysis will evaluate the widespread, but  unproven, assumption that adult attachment styles reflect 'actor  effects'.  A longitudinal component of the study uses information  about the sources of variance (actor, partner, and relationship  effects) contributing to perceptions of interpersonal control as a  framework for a model predicting change in security of attachment in  family relationships.  Elaborating adult attachment theory, this model  holds that two types of control beliefs (i.e., effectance and fate)  mediate the relationship between two types of partner responsiveness  (i.e., positive and negative reciprocity) in determining change in  family members' security of attachment over a one-year period.  The  role of perceived control in the development of adult attachments has  not been previously studied, even though it is believed to be  fundamental to a sense of security.  June 15, 1994       According to Bowlby (1973), the 'glue' that holds family  relationships together is the degree of security a person finds in  their relationships with other family members and romantic partners.   Variations in this s ecurity give rise to \"attachment styles.\"  People  with 'insecure' attachment styles expect rejection or inconsistent  responses from others and view themselves as having less control over  their lives and as being less worthy of emotional support than do  people with 'secure' attachment styles.  People with secure attachment  styles are more likely to maintain their close relationships, reaching  out to others for comfort in times of distress.  This research will  investigate the determinants of attachment style at one point in time  as well as the determinants of change in style over time. Part 1 of  the research will assess whether a secure attachment to another family  member at one point in time is due to (a) the characteristics that the  person brings to the relationship, (b) the characteristics of the  other family member, or (c) the unique cognitive, behavioral, or  emotional adjustment of the person to that particular family member.   Part 2 will test the hypothesis that a family member's responsiveness  influences people's beliefs concerning their degree of control over  interpersonal relationships which in turn affects the security of  their attachment style. By elucidating the factors that contribute to  a secure attachment, this research will foster the development of  interventions that can optimize people's interpersonal functioning.    ***",
