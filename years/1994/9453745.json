 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453745  Warlick    The University of Texas at Austin intends to organize a national  workshop to bring together the representatives of all state  departments of education and their network stakeholders,  representatives from pertinent Federal Agencies concerned with K-12  educational network initiatives as well as representives from  various national professional education associations.  These  representatives will meet to develop a means for collaboration and  long-range planning for the integration of an information  infrastructure to support the needs of the K-12 educational  community.  The state representatives and their colleagues will  articulate the issues and provide feedback to clarify the current  status of state educational networking.  The workshop will provide  a forum to establish a clear understanding of needs and provide  insight to explore how federal and state regulations, policies, and  private sector partnerships can leverage current educational reform  initiatives to support the development of a National Information  Infrastructure for Education.  In addition, the electronic forum  will provide continual support for the cadre of individuals as they  work to develop and strengthen educational networking initiatives  in their own communities.  ***",
