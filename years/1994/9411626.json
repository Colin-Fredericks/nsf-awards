 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  a  project  to examine how  individuals  and  households adapt to traumatic economic hardship and  change.  The  research  will be based primarily on  a  survey  to  be  conducted in 600 households in both urban and rural areas of  Lublin, Poland.  The survey will collect systematic data  on  the  nature  of  the  economic hardships and  changes  being  experienced and a variety of conditions and past experiences  that influence how households adapt to economic stress.       The economic changes that are sweeping the countries of  the  former Soviet bloc are having a dramatic impact on  the  lives  of ordinary citizens in those countries.  The  future  stability  of  these  societies depends  to  a  considerable  extent  on  whether individuals and families  can  adapt  to  these  changes  and achieve family goals  better  than  they  could  under the old socialist system.  Poland, as a  leader  in  implementing  market  reforms in  the  post-Soviet  era,  represents  a  particularly  important  case  we   need   to  understand.  This project, by collecting systematic data  on  adaptation  to economic change in one area of  Poland,  will  increase our understanding of the momentous changes underway  in that society and their implications for the future.",
