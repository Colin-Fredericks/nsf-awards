Nearly all muonSR work in HTS to date has focused on  transverse magnetic field measurements.  The new development in  this work will allow use of the longitudinal field technique even  though the average internal field is neither along nor  perpendicular to the beam axis.  This technique will be used to  detect small internal fields, which are perpendicular to the  average magnetic field.  Experiments will be compared to the  theoretically determined tilt disorder induced by the transverse  field distributions.  Data on internal field correlation times will  be used to develop models for this motion which will aid to  understand the disordered vortex lattice melting process.    Non-technical abstract:  Magnetic fields enter high temperature  superconductors along axes of vortices.  Ideally these vortices are  straight and arranged in regular patterns.  However, in reality  these vortices tilt, flex, and move out of regular positions.  The  static and dynamic disorder of these vortices needs to be  understood because they contribute to energy losses in these  superconductors.  Such losses in turn have detrimental effects on  potential superconducting devices such as high field magnets or  electrical transmission lines.  The nature of the vortex order,  tilt, and motion will be studied both theoretically and  experimentally.  The experimental technique uses the elementary  particle called a muon to sense the local magnetic environment in  the superconductor.  ***",
