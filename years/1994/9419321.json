 "awd_abstract_narration": "The low-dimensional dynamic behavior of infinite dimensional  systems is a field of intense mathematical research, and the  theoretical part of this work explores and builds on a number of  such directions.  The investigator and his colleagues study  several new aspects of the theory of inertial and approximate  inertial manifolds, and explore and establish new connections  between them and the method of empirical eigenfunctions.  At the  same time, a goal of the proposal is the computational  implementation of the new methods and the study of certain  numerical analysis aspects associated with them (stability,  interaction with symmetries, and preservation of dissipation).        Dissipative time-dependent partial differential equations  arise from descriptions of a variety of important physical,  chemical, and biological phenomena.  The purpose of this project  is to develop, analyze, computationally implement, and test  methods for the reduction of such equations to accurate, small  dynamical systems.  This is a subject of intense research  interest in its own right; at the same time, it provides a bridge  to the study of many complex physicochemical and engineering  systems, with important implications for the simulation,  analysis, prediction and control of their dynamic behavior.  An  integral part of this work is the application of the techniques  to models of realistic systems of current research interest, such  as pattern formation in catalytic and electrochemical reactions.   The investigator and his colleagues believe that the attempt to  tackle realistic problems strengthens the theoretical and  computational aspects of the research, and provides new ideas and  directions.",
