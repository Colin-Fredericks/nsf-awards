 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416262  Bennett  Construction with masonry infills remains very popular,  particularly in the low to moderate seismic zones of the  eastern/central United States.  Infill walls may have both  beneficial and detrimental affects on the building behavior under  seismic loading.  Infill walls increase the stiffness of a  building, shift the structure's center of stiffness, and affect  the forces in the framing possible causing premature failure of  frame members.  The infills can also provide a redundant load  path for both horizontal and vertical loads, thus have a positive  influence on the structural behavior.    The objective of this project is to use data from the Northridge  earthquake to characterize the beneficial and detrimental  performance of infills, correlate the performance to numerical  methods, and evaluate the risk associated with both unreinforced  and reinforced infills.    Key aspects of in-plane performance of infills that will be  examined are the details of the interface between the infill and  bounding frame, the alignment of the infill with the bounding  frame, and the effect of the infill on the bounding frame.  With  respect to out-of-plane behavior, the stability of the panel and  applicability of arching theories under dynamic load will be  examined.    This research will impact both high and moderate seismic zones.  The level and priority of retrofit required for infills in high  hazard zones may be less than anticipated.  Perhaps just as  significant is the impact on infill construction in low to  moderate seismic zones, which cover most of the central/eastern  Untied States.  A better understanding of infills, which has to  be related to actual seismic performance, is needed to take full  advantage of infill construction in moderate hazard seismic  zones.  ***",
