The purpose of this study is to investigate the  processes of agrarian reform and rural industrialization in South  Africa and Malaysia to identify the commonalities and divergent  paths of local, rural economies set within an integrating global  system.  This research rests on a framework in which the  particular form and trajectory of rural transformation (in terms  of sectoral and distributional change) hinge on local power  structures, institutional arrangements, and types of resource  access and use. These factors are examined within the specific  context of macro-economic and macro-political structures and  processes.  Ethnographic, longitudinal, and comparative analysis  methods will be used to apply this framework to the conditions  and dynamics of rural change in the two settings.  Both South  Africa and Malaysia have experienced initial state development  efforts and, more recently, unplanned industrial decentralization  into selected rural areas, yet the circumstances, mechanisms,  outcomes, and implications for the distribution of power and  development vary substantially between them.       This study will make two levels of contributions.  At a  practical level it will help to inform policy debates in South  Africa.  Questions of rural industrialization in South Africa  assume particular significance in light of World Bank-led  discussions of agrarian reform and economic development in the  new South African political regime.  At a more theoretical and  methodological level, the proposed study will contribute to  bridging the gap between \"first world\" and \"third world\"  literature and debates on the socio-spatial reorganization of  work.",
