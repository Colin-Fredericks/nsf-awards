 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317359  Quarmby      The goal of this proposal is to analyze the signaling  pathways in Chlamydomonas, a unicellular, biflagellate alga.  Chlamydomonas exhibits three behaviors that all involve  increases in Ca++: these are phototaxis, mating and  flagellar excision.  The ultimate objective is to understand  the mechanisms by which different stress stimuli are  transduced to flagellar excision, while other stimuli, such  as light, result in the change of swimming behavior and not  in flagellar excision, even though all these pathways appear  to involve Ca++ in signaling.  The proposal has two  objectives.  The first is to isolate and characterize  excision mutants of C. reinhardtii to test the hypothesis  that low pH activates a signaling pathway that is different  from the signaling pathways activated by the chemical  inducers of flagellar excision.  The hypothesis for such a  dual pathway is supported by physiological and  pharmacological data, but a genetic analysis will verify the  existence of independent signaling pathways leading to a  common response.  Mutants will be generated by insertion of  exogenous DNA and selected for signaling defects.  Heterocaryon analysis will be used to study the relationship  of selected mutants.  The second objective is to use Ca++  flux and electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that  activation of a Ca++ channel is a key event in low pH  induced flagellar excision.  Dr. Quarmby has strong  circumstantial evidence that influx of Ca++ that is  stimulated by decreasing pH is necessary for acid-induced  flagellar excision.  %%%  The research objectives chosen by the PI provide a powerful  experimental system to study how different signals elicit  the same response, and how the different signals that use  Ca++ elicit distinctly different physiological responses.  Because it is presently thought that the fundamental  mechanisms of such signaling pathways have been conserved  throughout evolution, results of these studies will be  instrumental in our understa nding of how intracellular  communication takes place in living organisms.  ***",
