 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406144  Knobloch    This is a proposal to study the formation and stability properties of  patterns occurring in physical systems. Because such patterns often  exhibit a high degree of symmetry the techniques employed in the study  are designed to take full advantage of such symmetries. In practical  applications these symmetries are usually not exact. Therefore a  particular emphasis of the proposed work is to study the effects of  small symmetry-breaking ``imperfections'' in the system. The proposed  work is thus designed to make symmetry-based techniques applicable to  realistic systems. The proposal focuses on the effects of distant  endwalls on patterns in the form of propagating waves, patterns of  oscillations in acoustically excited spherical bubbles and the  formation of three-dimensional patterns in morphogenesis.    This is a proposal to study bifurcations and pattern formation in  systems with symmetry. Such systems occur naturally in a variety of  applications. The proposal focuses on pattern formation near onset. In  this regime the process is described by amplitude equations. In  symmetric systems these must respect the assumed symmetries. The  resulting equations enable one to compute not only the possible  patterns but also their relative stability. The proposal focuses on  extending this approach to three-dimensional patterns (such as those  created by the Turing instability or the modes of oscillation of an  acoustically excited bubble). In addition in order to make the  technique applicable to realistic systems in which the assumed  symmetries are usually only approximate the proposal emphasizes the  study of small externally imposed symmetry-breaking imperfections.  Such imperfections may have important  qualitative consequences and  may be responsible for the introduction of chaotic dynamics into  systems that would otherwise be nonchaotic.  ***",
