 "awd_abstract_narration": "White  9311538  In this project, the biosynthetic pathway(s) for the methanogenic  coenzymes 7-mercaptoheptanylthreonine-phosphate (HS-HTP) and methyl  reducing cofactor (MRF) will be established.  The first phase of  work will be to establish the presence of HS-HTP and MRF in  different species of methanogenic archaebacteria and to determine  any possible precursor/product relationship between these  coenzymes.  The presence and interconversion of the molecules will  be determined by fluorescence measurement of their monobromobimane  derivatives using procedures recently developed by the author.  The  incorporation of individual subunit and groups of subunit molecules  into HS-HTP and MRF will be determined.  Both in vivo and in vitro  experiments, using stable isotopically-labeled molecules and mass  spectrometry to measure incorporation, will be performed to help  define the biosynthetic pathways.  %%%  The biochemistry of the metabolic reduction of carbon dioxide to  methane by the methanogenic archaebacteria represents an exciting  area of microbiological metabolism.  One important aspect of this  metabolism is the discovery of seven new coenzymes.  Many of the   coenzymes in the methane pathway have chemical structures  completely different from other well known coenzymes and vitamins.   Because of this each structure represents a new biological compound  with unusual functions to be discovered.  In this award, the  biosynthesis, structure, and to a limited extent, the distribution  of two cofactors, 7-mercaptoheptanylthreonine-phosphate and methyl  reducing cofactor, will be explored.  Specific questions to be  addressed are; how are each of these cofactors biosynthesized and  assembled, and are they biosynthetically interrelated?  Answers to  these questions may complete another chapter in our understanding  of the biosynthesis of the methanogenic coenzymes, and also shed  more light on the microbial biochemistry of the formation of  methane, an important energy source.  ***",
