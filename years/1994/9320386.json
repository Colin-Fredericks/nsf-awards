This  research investigates changes in the returns to schooling  and experience for the  male and female labor force,  using  a newly developed econometric technique for quantile  regression. The technique describes the entire conditional  distribution of wages and  also allow an examination of  within-group inequality.       The use of the  quantile regression technique raises  serious theoretical concerns related to sample selection  bias. In order to handle this, the first part of the  proposed project is devoted to the theoretical derivation of  the asymptotic properties of the quantile regression  estimator. The second part proposes to use nonparametric  methods to investigate changes in the female labor force  wage structure. The application uses Census of Population  Survey data from 1964 to 1992. The findings from this  empirical enquiry would shed light on important issues that  relate to changes in the entire conditional distribution of  the female labor force.  The third part of the project uses  the results from the second part to investigate educational  choices of the female labor force over time. The application  uses data from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics  and the National Longitudinal Survey to track individuals  over time.  The findings from the two empirical analyses  would help explain mobility of wages and earnings. If wages  are immobile, then changes in wage inequality would be  indicative of real welfare implications, otherwise  differences among individuals would average out over time.  ***",
