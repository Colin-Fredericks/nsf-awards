Animals live for more than 75  years in the wild and are not subject to overwhelming infectious  disease in captivity.  Yet, their immune system, by mammalian  standards, appears to be very limited.  Although antibody responses  occur and non-specific cytotoxic cells are present, there has been  no direct demonstration of T lymphocytes, which initiate and effect  cellular immunity in more evolved vertebrates.  The goal of this  project is to characterize T lymphocytes in sharks, if they exist.   Both cellular and molecular approaches will be taken.  Using  cognate antigens, antigen-reactive lymphocyte populations will be  identified in sharks.  In addition, the role of class II MHC  molecules in their reactivity will be investigated using class II-  specific cDNA and a monoclonal antibody.  Three molecules  characteristic of T lymphocytes will be used as tools to identify  and isolate T cells:  interleukin 2, perforin, and the T cell  receptor.  The major approach will use PCR amplification of  phylogenetically conserved gene sequences coupled with cell  fractionation.  Lastly, the cytotoxic lymphocyte-like cell will be  identified using electron microscopy.  This study will determine  whether T cells had evolved by the time of emergence of sharks, and  may begin to clarify the origins of the adaptive immune system.    %%%  Sharks evolved more than 300 million years ago, and have remained  a relatively successful species.  Animals live for more than 75  years in the wild and are not subject to overwhelming infectious  disease in captivity.  Yet, their immune system, by mammalian  standards, appears to be very limited.  Although antibody responses  occur and non-specific cytotoxic cells are present, there has been  no direct demonstration of T lymphocytes, which initiate and effect  cellular immunity in more evolved vertebrates.  The long term goals  of this laboratory are to  define and understand normal immune  function in the shark, to explore the natural history of the  vertebrate immune system, and to determine the immune functions  which permit this primitive vertebrate a relatively disease-free  existence even though it apparently lacks the complexity of the  mammalian host defense system.  The goal of this project is to  determine whether sharks have T lymphocytes and if so to identify  and characterize them.  The results of this research will  contribute to our fundamental knowledge of the natural defense  mechanisms of an organism that occupies an important place in the  evolution of immune function in vertebrate species.  Knowledge such  as this should contribute in the long term to our ability to  maintain biodiversity.  ***",
