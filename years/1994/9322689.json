 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bass       Professors Bass and Burdzy propose to study some problems in  the areas: boundary behavior of Brownian motion and harmonic  functions, reflecting Brownian motion, diffusions on fractals,  occupation times for random walks in two dimensions, exceptional  points of planar Brownian motion, intersection local times for  planar Brownian motion, iterated Brownian motion, and numerical  results for Fleming--Viot processes.       Brownian motion as studied in probability theory is a  mathematical model of what one sees when one watches how cream  gets mixed into coffee or how smoke diffuses through the air of a  room. It is not surprising that the study of Brownian motion has  applications to physics, chemistry, engineering, and quantum  mechanics; however, it is also extremely useful for filtering  noisy signals, studying the growth of populations, the behavior  of the stock market, and a whole host of other applications.  Professors Bass and Burdzy propose to study how Brownian motion  and related objects can be used in solving problems that come up  in mathematical physics. Many of these problems can be reduced to  the solution of certain partial differential equations, which in  turn can be resolved through the use of Brownian motion and other  diffusions.",
