Mitchell   Connection to NSFNET  Proposal No. NCR-9417227  The University of Missouri-Columbia Health Sciences Center (HSC)  requests support to provide Internet access to its outlying  health care facilities in the city of Fulton.  This access will  be provided by means of a high speed extension of the internal  backbone at the Center.  The Health Science Center network is in  turn connected to the Internet through the MU campus backbone, so  its extension to the remote facilities will provide users at  those sites access to the full array of both Internet and HSC  resources.    The Fulton location is especially significant for the HSC in that  it will serve as a model for network communication to many other  remote sites in the future.  The satellite facility in Fayette,  described in this document, similar to the operation in Fulton  and would be the next location to be brought into the HSC  backbone network with the technology outlined in this proposal in  a phased approach.",
