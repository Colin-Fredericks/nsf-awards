 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319909  Anne Pusey    In the past 30 years, Jane Goodall revolutionized our  understanding of chimpanzee behavior, and in the process  gave us an extraordinary perspective on ourselves and our  behavioral origins. Chimpanzees are fascinating in their own  right.  They are one of the few mammalian species to show  female dispersal and male-male cooperation, and this  continuing study will provide new insights into the causes  and consequences of this unusual social organization.  Though less prominent than the chimp study, the Gombe baboon  study is the longest and most extensive field study of any  African monkey.   This current research effort, in  coordination with Goodall and Tanzanian collaborators, will  involve three interconnecting projects.    First, long-term demographic and behavioral data on  chimpanzees and olive baboons will be analyzed and new data  will be collected.  This will include Goodall's records from  the past three decades.  The emphasis will be an examination  of the costs and benefits of female dispersion and male  sociality.   In contrast, olive baboons show the social  organization typical of old world monkeys, with home ranges  maintained largely by the females and males moving between  troops.  This research effort will investigate group-level  factors influencing female reproductive success, and the  causes of individual variability in male reproductive  success, social relationships and paternal care.  The large  sample sizes allow sophisticated statistical analysis of  demography and social behavior.      The second project involves a highly detailed survey of the  diversity and distribution of vegetation in the entire park  -- an area of unusual plant diversity.  The vegetation  studies will clarify the ecological basis of chimpanzee  social organization, the importance of inter-troop  competition in baboons, and will also contribute to the  inventory of biodiversity in Tanzania.    The third project will use DNA extracted from feces of both  species to  assess paternity, measure genetic relatedness and  levels of inbreeding.  By perfecting the extraction of  nuclear DNA from feces and developing baboon-specific  primers, the team will facilitate paternity studies in other  primate field studies.",
