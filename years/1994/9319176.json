 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the   Chemistry Division Paul Devlin of Oklahoma State University will use   vibrational spectroscopy to characterize molecular behavior at the   surface of various water ice forms including cubic ice, amorphous ice,   acid hydrates, and clathrate hydrates.  One focus of the proposed work is   on the behavior of \"dangling\" hydrogen bonds at the surfaces as well as   of various types of adsorbed small molecules.  Adsorbates of interest   include H2, CO2, SO3, HCl, ethyne, benzene, and CO and N2.  The nature of   structural defects in ice and their importance in the properties and   phase transitions of ice and clathrates will also be investigated.    Devlin will collaborate with a theoretician who will simulate his   experimental data in order to learn more about the adsorption process.    This project entails in part a fundamental laboratory study of processes   which take place on ice surfaces, many of which are involved in natural   phenomena of considerable current interest.  Among these are the   environmentally urgent issues of the formation of the ozone hole, acid   rain, and smog.  In addition, these experiments will help elucidate such   areas of astrophysical interest as the mechanism of the formation of   molecules in interstellar space and the composition of cometary tails.",
