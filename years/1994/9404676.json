 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to expand our knowledge  of the elementary learning processes of Pavlovian  conditioning and instrumental training.  These learning  processes are fundamental not only to much of animal  behavior but also to human normal and pathological  functioning.  Instrumental learning, which involves learning  about the consequences of one's actions, is commonly  conceptualized as having three component elements:  a  behavioral response (R), an outcome (O) of that response,  and a stimulus (S) in the presence of which the response  produces that outcome.  Prior work from this and other  laboratories has identified the development of associations  among each of the pairs of these elements as contributing to  behavior.  Thus, organisms learn associations of the form R-  O, S-O, and S-R, and each contributes to behavior.  But they  also acquire more hierarchical structures of the form S-(R-  O), in which a stimulus activates an association between R  and O.  The development of the techniques of transfer and  devaluation has allowed the separate measurement of these  associations.  The devaluation technique involves the  changing of the value of an outcome after it has been earned  by a response.  Such devaluation of the outcome produces  substantial and immediate depression of the value of both  stimuli and responses that have led to that outcome, thus  allowing measurement of both R-O and S-O associations.  The  transfer technique involves the ability of a stimulus  trained with one behavior to transfer to the control of  another behavior based on their sharing a common outcome.  It therefore allows one to detect both the S-O and R-O  association.  Recent evidence suggests that these  associations show amazing persistence even when they no  longer accurately reflect the consequences of responding, as  in extinction.  The present research project will use the  devaluation and transfer techniques, together with others to  be developed, to measure the persistence of those  a ssociations.  It will explore the possibility that  associations with goals persist but are suppressed by  superimposed inhibitory associations not involving the  outcomes.  This research will also explore the fate of  hierarchical associations.  Similar procedures will also be  applied to Pavlovian conditioning, which involves the  learning of relations between two stimuli in the world.  New  results suggest that there, too, previously learned  associations persist when conditions change.  Moreover,  there too hierarchical modulatory structures seem to  contribute to performance.  These studies will influence our  thinking about elementary associative learning processes.  They will particularly illuminate the process of extinction,  a process important in many implications for understanding  learning at the neural level.",
