 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chitnis  9405325  Photosystem I, the light-dependent plastocyanin-ferredoxin  oxidoreductase, is a multisubunit pigment-protein complex in the  photosynthetic membranes of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria.  Photosystem I contains at least twelve proteins, 100 chlorophylls,   -carotenes and a series of electron transfer centers. To identify  roles of individual polypeptides in the function and assembly of  the complex, we initiated a program to clone and mutate genes that  encode protein subunits of photosystem I of the naturally  transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our  NSF-supported research has provided insights concerning the  functions of several subunits of photosystem I. This proposal  describes our plans to continue the investigations by focusing on  (1) role of the accessory subunits, PsaL, PsaJ and PsaI in  particular, in mediating and stabilizing assembly of photosystem I,  and (2) mutational dissection and biochemical analysis of the  reducing side of photosystem I. Recently we showed that PsaL is  required for the formation of trimeric quaternary structure of  photosystem I. PsaL binds calcium ions which stimulate  trimerization. Site-specific mutations and biochemical  characterization will be used to dissect the structural and  regulatory basis for the role of PsaL. We postulate that the small  (<4 kDa) hydrophobic subunits of photosystem I (PsaJ, PsaM, PsaI)  function as 'nuts and bolts' in the structure of the complex by  anchoring and stabilizing other proteins. Characterization of our  PsaJ-less mutant shows that PsaJ is necessary for the stable  assembly of PsaF, a lumen-exposed subunit, and possibly PsaE, a  peripheral subunit on the n-side. We will examine the interactions  of PsaJ by biochemical and mutational analysis. We will also  generate mutants lacking PsaI and further test our hypothesis. The  terminal reduction reaction of photosystem I involves electron  transfer from the reducing site on the complex to ferredoxin. The  reducing site on photosyst em I consists of surface-exposed domains  of PsaD, PsaE, and PsaC subunits. PsaD and PsaE are required for  reduction of ferredoxin and therefore form essential topological  components of the docking site where ferredoxin interacts and  accepts electrons from PsaC. We have identified the solvent-exposed  regions of PsaD on the basis of protease accessibility and labeling  with NHS-biotin. Site-specific mutations in these domains will be  used to identify residues that interact with ferredoxin.  Physiological, biochemical and spectroscopic analyses will be  conducted to investigate roles of mutations in specific subunits  onthe assembly and function of photosystem I.  %%%Photosynthesis is the major source of biological energy and  oxygen on the earth. Betterunderstanding of this process is  essential for facing the food and environmental challenges of the  future. Photosynthesis requires coordinated and efficient  functioning of membrane-embedded andsoluble enzymes in  cyanobacteria and plants. Photosystem I is one of two  pigment-proteincomplexes in the photosynthetic membranes, that can  utilize light energy to produce high-energybiochemicals.  Photosystem I contains at least eleven proteins, 100 chlorophylls,   -carotenes and series of electron transfer centers. The long-term  research objective of our research is to determine the roles of  different proteins of photosystem I in its function and  organization. We initiated a program to genetically manipulate  photosystem I of a naturally transformable cyanobacterium that is  easily amenable to genetic engineering. Our NSF-supported research  has provided insights concerning the functions of several  photosystem I proteins. We plan to continue these investigations by  focusing on how these proteins mediate and stabilize the assembly  of photosystem I. We will also study the role of photosystem I  proteins in the transfer of electrons from photosystem I to soluble  proteins. An interdisciplinary approach that uses molecular  genetics, physiology , biochemistry and biophysics will lead to a  better understanding of how light energy is utilized by plants to  generate chemical energy.  ***",
