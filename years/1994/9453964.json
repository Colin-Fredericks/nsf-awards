 "awd_abstract_narration": "As time spent on design becomes an increasingly significant  fraction of the cost of digital system design, concurrent hardware  and software development through codesign becomes increasingly  important.  Also, emerging field programmable logic technologies  permit digital system codesigners to easily migrate system  functionality between software and hardware during the design  process.  Yet few codesign tools exist currently, and among those  there is often an inverse relation between usability and  functionality.  They lack interfaces that fit with designers' ways  of working, or they do not integrate with existing frameworks for  chip and program development.    We propose to recruit five students from Spelman College, Jackson  State University, and Tuskegee University, all Historically Black  Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and provide them with support,  mentoring, and advising as they pursue courses of study leasing to  the PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Auburn  University, investigating topics in hardware-software codesign  interface and tool development.  We can significantly increase not  only the supply of codesign specialists but also the nation's  supply of African American computer scientists by guiding students  in investigations of topics in hardware-software codesign tool and  interface development:  language development, graphical user  interfaces, algorithms for automatic migration of functionality,  inter-tool frameworks, and formal methods for codesign.",
