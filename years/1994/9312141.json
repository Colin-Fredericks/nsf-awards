 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312141  Breig  The proposed research will lead to an improved understanding of the  coordinated behaviors of neutral atomic hydrogen and the  temperature in the polar thermosphere near solstice.  It will give  special attention to several modes of coupling between this  atmospheric region and its neighbors at higher and lower altitudes.   Local H concentrations are to be derived from the condition of  charge-exchange equilibrium between hydrogen and oxygen atoms and  ions in conjunction with satellite plasma observations near the F-  peak.  Measurements of ion temperature at these heights provide  good estimates of the neutral gas temperature.  Principal use will  be made of the unique, and still highly useful, sets of aeronomic  data acquired with the Atmosphere Explorer (AE)-D and Dynamics  Explorer (DE)-2 satellites, both in high-inclination polar orbits.   General emphasis will be given to the latitudinal and longitudinal  distributions of H density and neutral temperature through the  summer and winter polar thermospheres, seeking a more firm  confirmation of earlier indications for a polar hydrogen depletion  and a related enhancement in temperature in this region.  A  multitude of comparisons will also be undertaken - seasonal  differences between summer and winter high latitudes and the effect  of different levels of solar activity.  These results should help  fill a serious deficiency of reliable observational polar data, and  contribute to refinements in current models of the high latitude  thermosphere.  ***",
