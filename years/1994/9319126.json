 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract         The UAB-Georgia Tech International Conference on Differential    Equations and Mathematical Physics is devoted to topics in the general    area of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations and their    relation to  mathematical physics. This will include topics such as the    analysis of multiparticle Schroedinger operators, stability of matter,    relativity theory, quantum field theory, spectral and scattering theory    including spectral geometry, inverse problems, Korteweg-de Vries    equations, as well as related topics.         This conference series has been very successful in bringing together    scholars from around the world for fruitful scientific exchange in an    active area in which modern mathematical analysis comes to grips with    problems of scientific importance. Typically, the conference will    attract participants from over twenty different countries. Since 1992,    it is now a joint project between The University of Alabama at Birmingham    and The Georgia Institute of Technology. The next conference in this    series will take place at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, 13-17    March 1994. On March 11-12, the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, will    hold a workshop supported by NSF EPSCoR in Alabama on ordinary differential    equations, which was planned for participants who will arrive early before    the beginning of the UAB-Georgia Tech International Conference. On March    18-19, a regional meeting of the American Mathematical Society will take    place at the University of Kentucky with special sessions in differential    equations and mathematical quantum theory. Many people have planned to    participate in two or three of these conferences.",
