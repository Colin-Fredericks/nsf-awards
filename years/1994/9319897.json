People smile at each other when the situation is  pleasurable, but they also smile when the context is painful,  tense, or even antagonistic.  Smiles appear to possess a number  of meanings and seem designed to effect a variety of social  purposes, such as showing good will, affirming social  connections, conveying concession or apology, or enacting social  position.  This research employs multiple methodologies to  determine how the diverse meanings of smiles are achieved,  including meta-analysis, experimental studies, and content  analysis of existing verbal records.  Two processes are proposed  to be involved in differentiating smiles: their physical  qualities and the interaction context in which they occur.         The research will investigate particular facial features, in  addition to upward turning of the corners of the mouth area, that  may differentiate smiling expressions associated with affiliation  from those associated with appeasement. It will also investigate  temporal qualities of smiles, such as time to onset, duration,  and offset, that may differentiate smiling expressions associated  with affiliation from those associated with deference or  dissension.  Finally, it will determine whether the  differentiation among smiles is also a function of the degree of  reciprocity of smiling between people who are interacting with  one another.      Prior research on smiling has focused primarily on its   relationship to experienced emotion, neglecting the social  functions of a smile. Yet, this apparently small social gesture  contributes to and alters the nature of many social interactions.  This research will make an important contribution to our  understanding of these effects and thus to our ability to improve  interpersonal communication in situations where smiles may be  misread. A prime example is the examination of gender differences  in smiling in  the present research, which will test the  generality of the observation that women smile more than men as  well as various explanations for this difference, including  women's higher affiliation motives or lower social power.  ***",
