 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies randomized algorithms and  derandomization techniques; specifically, randomized  algorithms for on-line  problems, randomized algorithms for  graph connectivity questions, techniques  for ``derandomizing''  (making deterministic) algorithms for on-line and  connectivity problems, and general techniques for  derandomizing large classes  of randomized algorithms.    An on-line problem is one in which the input is  revealed to  the algorithm only one piece at a time, and the algorithm is  required to respond without knowledge of the future.  An  example is the problem  of paging in a computer system:  the  operating system does not know which pages  will be requested  in the future, and therefore does not know which pages put  in fast memory and which to leave in slow memory.  Recent  research has shown  that randomized algorithms can be  dramatically better than deterministic  algorithms for some  on-line motion planning, scheduling, and graph coloring.  The (edge) connectivity of a connected graph is the minimum  number of edges one has to remove to disconnect the graph.  Determining the  connectivity of a graph is an important  problem in the area of network  reliability.  Recent advances  have provided the key to faster algorithms to  determine the  edge connectivity of a graph.  But the new algorithms are  not  likely to be the fastest possible algorithms.  This research   builds faster connectivity algorithms,  randomized if necessary, deterministic if  possible.    Much research over the past few years has dealt with  derandomizing  randomized algorithms.  This work continues this effort in the hope of  derandomizing  algorithms for certain on-line and connectivity problems,  and  also providing new general techniques for  derandomizing randomized algorithms.",
