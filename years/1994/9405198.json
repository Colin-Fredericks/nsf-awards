 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405198  SCHAETZL       As early as the 1880s, geomorphologists like William Morris  Davis developed and tested models of landscape change in the  central and southern Appalachian Mountains.  Only recently have  new approaches and theories been used to interpret the complex  intermixture of landforms in the region, however.  New methods  for dating materials offer considerable promise for developing a  chronology of landforms and materials.  This doctoral  dissertation research project will elucidate the geomorphic and  soils history of the southern Blue Ridge as recorded in colluvial  deposits and associated soils from the Little Tennessee River  basin of western North Carolina.  Sets of colluvium samples drawn  from carefully selected series in tributary valleys will be  extracted in addition to other data derived in the field.  The  relative ages of the colluvial samples will be determined by  examining soil morphological properties, ratios of iron species,  and rations of differentially weatherable minerals.  The samples  also will be examined using relatively new dating techniques that  measure an isotope of beryllium (10-Be).  Dates determined using  this method should allow identification of a maximum surface  exposure age for each sample, thereby enabling examination of the  properties and evolutionary histories of these deposits and  relative soils in a more quantitative frame of reference.       This project will advance knowledge about geomorphological  and pedological change in the Blue Ridge province in the southern  Appalachians, providing a much firmer chronological context  within which to examine processes of landscape and soil  evolution.  In addition, it will explore the utility of 10-Be  dating procedures.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement award,  this award also will provide support to enable a promising  student to establish a strong independent research career.",
