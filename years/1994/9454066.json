 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop graduate training of doctoral-level students  in specific areas of Geosciences and Environmental Physical  Sciences through the NSF Graduate Research Traineeship Program.   These Traineeships will be implemented through the joint  arrangement that exist between the Earth System Science Program and  the Department of Chemistry.  In particular, we propose to pursue  graduate research training in five area: 1) coastal oceanography,  2) ocean-atmosphere interactions, 3)hydrology, 4) development of  state-of-the-art instrumental techniques, and 5) modeling of  atmospheric chemistry using high-performance computing methods.    Innovative aspects of the Program include 1) recruitment of  underrepresented graduate students using a variety of activities  including the pipeline established at UCI through the CAMP  (California Alliance for Minority Participation) Program, 2)  participation of trainees in a monthly research seminar series, 3)  participation of trainees in field studies during their first two  years in graduate school, 4) completion by trainees of a teaching  assistant training program, 5) establishment of a Traineeship  Oversight Committee who will be responsible for choosing the GRTs,  and for appointment of a specialized committee to advise each  trainee.  Graduate Research Traineeships will substantially  increase the resources needed to help achieve our goal of graduate  education and research in the fields within Geosciences.",
