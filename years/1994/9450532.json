These students will explore in a multi-modal fashion  abstract concepts which derive from the very basic notions of  polygons and polyhedra(geometry), permutation groups(algebra), path  in a graph (topology), counting and estimation (combinatorics), and  motion and forces(Mechanics).  In this pilot project virtual  reality technology is investigated as a tool in developing multi-  modal (visual, tactile, and auditory) learning experiences for  primarily low-verbal learners.  Two starter VR environments will be  developed and tested over the next year.  The goal of the project  is to begin to understand the non-verbal acquisition and use of  abstract mathematical, physical, and algorithmic concepts as  demonstrated through motoric responses.",
