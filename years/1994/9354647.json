 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354647  Zumoff   This project is broadening and disseminating the concept of  Earth Algebra. Earth Algebra is an entry level college algebra  course which incorporates the spirit of the NCTM Curriculum and  Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics at the college  level. The context of the course places mathematics in the  center of one of the major current concerns of the world, i.e.,  environmental issues and global warming. In this project  mathematicians at Kennesaw are developing and testing materials  (EarthMath Studies) designed in the spirit of Earth Algebra  which can be used in a wider range of courses. Specifically,  the Earth Algebra concept is being expanded into two areas:  precalculus, both algebra and trigonometry, and mathematics  education courses as a tool for training preservice teachers.  The EarthMath Studies are in  the form of studies of  environmental issues which involve modeling and analysis of  real data, use of technology, group work, written and oral  reports and student research. In addition to Kennesaw State  College, seven institutions are testing and piloting the  materials. The goals of the use of EarthMath materials are to  improve students problem solving and decision making ability,  to offer insight and increase interest in and appreciation of  the role of mathematics in society, enhance the learning of the  mathematical skills and concepts prerequisite to calculus, and  to provide preservice teachers with a model of how the  Standards can be implemented.",
