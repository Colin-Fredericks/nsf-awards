 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tran            Density and regression under dependence have recently  received increasing attention.  This research covers two broad  but related areas, nonparametric density estimation and  nonparametric regression.  The dependence dealt with is of serial  or spatial type.  Optimality results on nonparametric functional  estimation for serially dependent random variables have been  mostly of the asymptotic type.  The practical question as to what  to do in the small sample case is of great concern and still  poses basic challenges.  The purpose of this research is to  extend existing theory toward the needs of practitioners.  The  objective is the development of a finite sample theory for  nonparametric density and regression estimators.  Another major  feature of the current proposal is the extension of certain  results on nonparametric density and regression known for time  series to random fields.  Different density estimators and both  fixed and random regression designs are to be investigated.            In contrast to traditional statistical theory,  nonparametric estimation gives a flexible approach to data  analysis without requiring detailed knowledge or assumptions  about the process under investigation.  The goal of the research  is to develop nonparametric statistical theory to better serve  practitioners.  The applicability of the investigation will be  demonstrated by concrete and real-life examples.  The long-range  goal is to develop nonparametric techniques for digital image  processing, and even for the analysis of data which are both  space and time varying, such as data obtained from a series of  digitized photographs taken at different times.  The proposed  research also has potential application to the analysis of data  collected irregularly at different space and time points. The  resulting methodology may prove important for processing  environmental data and data from geology, soil science and  meteorology. ***",
