Hurder's research program seeks to gain a deeper understanding of  geometric and dynamical phenomenon on open manifolds by exploring  the \"structures at infinity\" and asymptotic symmetries of spaces.   His investigation combines techniques from coarse cohomology,  cyclic cohomology, buildings, dynamics and spectral theory of  Dirac-type operators.  The structure theory for the asymptotic  behavior of actions has become much more sophisticated in recent  years, and is an emerging technology of choice for addressing  some well-known problems regarding the classification of open  manifolds and the symmetry groups on these spaces.       The problems addressed in this work are also closely tied to  mathematical physics and explaining natural phenomenon,  especially the work relating asymptotic structures on open spaces  to the spectral theory of geometric operators.  Other aspects of  the project are currently being applied to the analysis of  computer simulations of tiling maps and random dynamics of  motions in two and three space, with eventual applications to  explaining the behavior of gases (the higher dimensional billiard  problem).  ***",
