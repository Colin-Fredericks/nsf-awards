 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412284  Li    This grant supports a US-Bulgaria Joint Cooperative Research  Project on \"Analytical and Computational Studies of Oscillations  in Age-Structured Population Models\" between Dr. Jia Li and Dr.  Mark J. Friedman of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of  the University of Alabama Huntsville, and Dr. Tanya Kostova of  the Laboratory of Numerical Methods of the Institute of  Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.  The  topics of research will include analytical and computational  studies of oscillations in age-structured population models.  The  results of the study are expected to have an impact in both  mathematical and biological sciences, as the main goal is to  disclose the underlying mechanisms of the possible (and often  observed in nature) oscillatory behavior of the size of a single  population.  Understanding such mechanisms is one of the most  important questions in the theory of population dynamics.  The  collaboration will benefit both sides as the participating  researchers have close but different and complementary experience  in treating such models.  The research will focus on the spectral  analysis of the linearization of the age-structured model, which  is a nonlinear partial differential-integral equation, on its  simplifications in various forms, such as systems of ordinary  differential equations and equations with delay, and finally on  its general setting.  An important part of the project will be  numerical simulations and numerical tracing of bifurcating  periodic solutions.  All results will be given a suitable  interpretation for the natural sciences.    This project in mathematics fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  Bulgaria and the United States to combine complementary talents  and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  ***",
