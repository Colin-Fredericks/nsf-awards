 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321692 Mendelssohn Global sea level rise is expected to result in severe impacts to coastal ecosystems. However, mechanisms affecting regeneration of vegetation following disturbances in low salinity marshes most susceptible to impacts are poorly understood. Disturbances that kill plants may result in different patterns of regeneration than non-killing disturbances, leading to differences in community structure. The objectives of this dissertation research are to: (1) examine the ability of vegetation to resist invasion by other species when affected by killing or non-killing disturbances, (2) investigate the role of salinity and disturbance in species dominance patterns in salt marsh vegetation. A series of field and greenhouse experiments will be employed.  %%% Detailed knowledge of mechanisms affecting regeneration of vegetation is crucial to out ability to predict the responses of plant communities in coastal marshes to global sea level rise. This research will contribute significantly to the growing body of knowledge regarding the effects of sea level rise on coastal wetlands, as well as further understanding of the role of changing environmental conditions in plant community dynamics. ***",
