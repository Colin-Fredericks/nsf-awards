In the alloys  the lifetime of a photogenerated electron-hole pair, or exciton,  near the mobility edge is directly correlated to its localization  length.  Thus the exciton system in these materials represents a  model system for studying quantum localization.  The dynamics of  exciton localization will be probed by time resolved  photoluminescence spectroscopy.  The exciton localization length,  mobility edge, and the critical exponent of the localization length  will be measured under different conditions including temperature  and the degree of alloy disorder.  The universality of the critical  exponent and the fundamental differences between charge carrier  localization and exciton localization will be investigated.  These  studies can provide new insight into the physics quantum  localization.    Non-technical abstract:  Disorder in solids can cause a remarkable  effect that is the spatial localization of electronic charge, which  is called Anderson localization.  Since dome degree of disorder is  a nearly universal feature of real materials, the Anderson  localization is likewise a ubiquitous ingredient in determining  electrical, optical, and other physical properties of condensed  matter.  Therefore, Anderson localization is recognized as one of  the most important subjects in condensed matter physics.  This  proposed research is to study the properties of Anderson  localization in certain semiconductor alloys (containing elements  from groups II and VI of the periodic table) which have important  applications in optoelectronic devices.  ***",
