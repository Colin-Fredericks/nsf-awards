 "awd_abstract_narration": "WAKEHAM/FREEMAN  9401765/9412739        The relationship between  CO2(aq)  and the fractionation of carbon  isotopes during carbon fixation in the ocean plays a major role in  preserving climatically-drive isotopic signatures in sediments. It  is known that the fractionation of carbon isotopes during  photosynthesis is dependent on a number of factors, including   CO2(aq) , nutrient concentrations, temperature, rate of primary  production, and species composition.  Sedimentation of partculate  matter in the ocean then transfers part of this isotopic signal to  the sediments, where the isotopic signal may be used as a proxy for  inferring past environmental conditions.  Factors which determine  the photosynthetic isotope fractionation (ep) will be examined in  the context of the hypothesis that there is no generally applicable  relationship between  CO2(aq)  and ep. Rather, regional  environmental conditions are critical control and different  molecular biomarkers may record a variety of ep -  CO2(aq)   relationships.  Three markedly different environments will be used  in the study 1) the North Atlantic between the Gulf of Maine and  the Sargasso Sea; 2) the equatorial Pacific between 12 degree N and  12 degress S at 140 degree W; and 3) the Peru upwelling area.  Isotopic compositions of selected biomarkers will be interpreted  using synoptic measurements of temperature,  CO2(aq) , segma13C  DIC, nutrients and photoplankton species composition. The  information will make it possible to reconstruct the  paleoenvironmental record in marine sediments and will provide a  basis for future assessments of ocean-climate relationships using  combined biomarker and isotope techniques.",
