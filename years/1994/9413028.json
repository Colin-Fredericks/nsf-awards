 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413028  Dillehay    Under the direction of Dr. Tom Dillehay, Mr. David Pollack will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will focus on a  series of sites which are located in the Lower Ohio River valley  and which date from approximately 1400-1700 AD. Solid  archaeological evidence indicates that immediately prior to this  time, inhabitants or the region were organized into a \"chiefdom.\"  Political centralization is demonstrated not only by population  density, but also by the construction of large and impressive  earthworks. 1400 AD marks the decline of this polity. What makes  this particular archaeological case interesting however is that  population appears not to decline. Rather it is maintained at a  high level. Secondly, trade with surrounding areas, as  demonstrated by the importation of exotic goods, actually  increases. As centralized polities disintegrate, the opposite is  normally the case. Mr. Pollack will examine the nature and extent  of trade over the 1400-1700 AD period. He will expand the data  base he has already emceed and collect material from the surface  of known archaeological sites. He will also examine museum  collections. Because origins of distinct ceramic styles are  relatively well known, they provide insight into the intensity  and direction of trade.    This research is important for several reasons. It examines an  instance of what, based on standard archaeological criteria, is  viewed as cultural \"devolution.\" It will provide an opportunity  to evaluate these criteria themselves and also afford insight  into how cultures change over time. The data will be of interest  to many archaeologists. The project will also assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
