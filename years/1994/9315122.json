The  seminar is co-organized by Professor Catherine  French, Department of Civil and Mineral  Engineering, University of Minnesota, and  Professor Fumio Watanabe, Department of  Architectural Engineering, Kyoto University.  In  addition to the U.S. and Japanese participants,  scientists from Australia, Canada, and New  Zealand, are expected to attend.    A large quantity and variety of test data on  high-strength reinforced concrete has become  available through recent test programs conducted  in the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand,  and Norway.  These data include information on  material development, structural performance, and  construction procedures.  The seminar will focus  on the design and performance of high-strength  reinforced concrete structures located in seismic  regions.  Participants will exchange recently  acquired data, evaluate the data, and develop  rational design recommendations.  In the process,  deficiencies in the database and future research  needs may be identified.",
