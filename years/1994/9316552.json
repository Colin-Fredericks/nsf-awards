 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Keller  9316552  To identify the DNA sequences that coordinate flagellar gene  expression, the genes for @ 1 tubulin and RSP 3, another flagellar  protein, have been modified for identification, deleted to retain  varying lengths of 5' and 3' flanking regions and intervening  sequences, and introduced into Chlamydomonas cells.  Expression of  the modified genes is being analyzed in control and stimulated  cells.  An element regulating expression of the @ 1 tubulin gene  has been located by correlating loss of inducibility with specific  deletions, and the function of this and other putative regulatory  elements will be correlated with specific responses to stimulation.   This characterization of possibly multiple DNA control elements  regulating Chlamydomonas flagellar gene expression will add to our  general understanding of coordinate gene expression and organelle  biogenesis.  ***  In eukaryotes, mechanisms that coordinately regulate expression of  functionally related but structurally distinct genes are largely  unknown.  The Chlamydomonas flagellar regeneration system is ideal  for studying coordinate gene induction.  Stimulation of cells  causes detachment of Chlamydomonas flagella, and rapidly and  transiently induces transcription of tubulin and other flagellar  genes 10-20 fold above basal levels of expression.  Our previous  work suggests that flagellar gene expression is regulated by Ca2+   -controlled events associated with flagellar regeneration -  cellular stimulation, flagellar excision, and flagellar regrowth.   To determine if the flagellar genes are coordinately induced by  each of these events, we will measure mRNA abundance changes of an  expanded set of flagellar genes after stimulation in conditions  that uncouple the normal program of events.  Results of these  studies will indicate whether the flagellar genes are coordinately  induced through similar or distinct control mechanisms.  %%%",
