 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406902  Hester    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Thomas Hester and  his colleagues will continue archaeological excavation at the  site of Cobweb Swamp, Belize. In 1987, during the course of  survey and test pitting in the area surrounding the known Mayan  site of Colha, Dr. Hester discovered highly patinated stone  artifacts which stratigraphically underlay Mayan artifacts.  Additional excavation in 1991 and 1993 yielded materials  radiocarbon dated to 2500 to 1400 BC. This predates the earliest  known Mayan presence in the region. Dr. Hester and colleagues  will now return to the site and excavate a board area to  determine the extent and nature of the occupation. He hopes to  recover abundant lithics as well as floral and faunal remains and  on this basis both describe this pre-Mayan culture and determine  its relationship to later Mayan occupation of the region. He will  also obtain material for additional radiocarbon dating, collect  pollen to reconstruct environment, and attempt to determine how  this changed over time.    The origins of the Mayan peoples who inhabited lowland Middle  America are not known. In Belize the earliest Mayan site dates to  about 1200 BC and by that time the roots of Mayan civilization  has been established. Archaeological data from earlier periods  exists, but it is minimal and does not come from  stratigraphically secure, well dated contexts. Cobweb Swamp  however is different and is important for this reason. It is  unclear whether Mayan culture emerged from this earlier pre-  ceramic context or if Mayan peoples entered the region from  elsewhere. The question is important because it bears on our  understanding of how complex culture developed in heavily  forested tropical environments.    This research is significant for several reasons. It will  increase our understanding of how complex societies arise and  will provide data of interest to many archaeologists.",
