 "awd_abstract_narration": "Caffarelli  9401168       This project continues mathematical research on several  broad areas involving nonlinear partial differential equations.   Of the two central themes, one concerns Lagrangian coordinates  and allocation problems.  In its physical interpretation, the  work is concerned with the deformation or evolution of a material  body.  In particular, efforts will be made to understand how  compression and rotation control the deformation.  For instance,  if the infinitesimal compression is controlled, what other  quantity of the rotation must be controlled to assure that  the deformation be smooth?  This question, a Lagrangian version  of the Helmholtz divergence-curl decomposition for a velocity  or instantaneous deformation field, has arisen naturally in  several areas where one must compute large deviations  (computational plasticity, models for front formation in  meteorological sciences, discretization of incompressible flows)  as well as problems of allocation, where one tries to allocate  resources into a new distribution which minimizes the allocation  costs.  A second theme concerns free boundaries and their  singular perturbations.  These arise in continuum mechanics when  a rapid transition takes place in which the model assumes the  presence of a sharp interphase (the burning of a flame, the  solidification of a liquid, etc.).  Studies of how well the sharp  transition approximates the continuous phenomena will be carried  out.  For instance, the geometric properties of the sharp  transition versus a narrow band of continuous transition, or when  the limit of the continuous phenomena is actually the expected  sharp transition will be analyzed.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and gr owth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.   ***",
