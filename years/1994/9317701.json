In the first, we will look at the  intragenic regulation of the Drosophila decapentaplegic (dpp) gene,  as we try to explain how its complex network of imaginal disk-  specific enhancers search out their correct promoters.  These  experiments will test our view that this occurs through a mechanism  of promoter competition.  Our second line of experimentation will  investigate the nature of the regulatory autonomy of adjacent  genes.  Even though the dpp enhancers can activate their own  promoters up to 60 kb away, they are indifferent to the promoter of  the adjacent tnd (transcript near dpp) gene which is located just  a few kb away.  Two models, one involving chromatin domains and the  other promoter specificity, are commonly invoked to describe how  genes can remain autonomous and we are in an excellent position to  decide which of these, if either, is at work in the dpp/tnd system.   Through our proposed experiments:  1) we will examine the promoter  preferences of different disk-specific enhancers and determine  whether these choices are established through a mechanism of  promoter competition.  Much of this work will involve transfection  assays in tissue culture cells but these results will also be  confirmed by in vivo and analysis.  2) we will characterize the  regulatory sequences required for tnd transcription.  We will use  reporter gene constructs and interspecies sequence comparisons to  identify the functionally important elements comprising the  promoter and enhancer regions of tnd.  3) we will establish the  mechanism by which tnd and dpp remain autonomous.  We will use  \"promoter swap\" experiments to decide whether the regulatory  independence is mediated via chromatin domains or promoter  specificity.  For these experiments, we will use in vivo site-  directed mutagenesis to completely replace the tnd promoter with  another.  4) we will determine precisely w hich chromosomal  sequences are responsible for this regulatory isolation.  We will  use molecular, molecular genetic, and biochemical techniques to  identify the elements involved.  %%%  How genes are regulated in eukaryotic systems is not yet clearly  understood. Sequences known as enhancers interact with specific  promoter sequences to induce the expression of the gene controlled  by the promoter but since the enhancer can be at a distance and in  either orientation, how the specific sequences interact is not yet  understood. Because of the novel features of this system, coupled  with the powerful molecular genetic techniques available for  Drosophila, the results of this work should provide one of the  clearest understandings of how enhancers discriminate between  alternative promoters.  ***",
