 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451509  Jones  The Departments of Geology and Chemistry propose to introduce  modern methods of X-ray diffraction into undergraduate laboratory  courses, and to increase the use of diffractometry in student  research. In order to accomplish these goals, funds are sought to  upgrade and computer-interface an X-ray diffractometer. Hands-on  use of the diffractometer will be introduced in the Geology  curriculum with the Mineralogy course. In Lithology,  Sedimentology, Geomorphology, and Glacial Geology, students will  use the diffractometer to solve specific problems. X-ray  Mineralogy students will learn to operate the equipment  independently and use the full range of software to solve a  variety of problems. In the Chemistry curriculum, hands-on use of  the diffractometer will be introduced in Physical Chemistry. In  Instrumental Analysis, students will conduct experiments designed  to illustrate how X-ray diffraction is used for quality control.  Inorganic Chemistry students will make extensive use of  diffractometry in order to characterize solid state compounds.  Geology and chemistry students will be able to do independent  research projects that previously would have been impossible. The  project will have significant impact because about 220 students  per year (compared to about 25 at present) will be introduced to  computer-interfaced X-ray diffractometry and its many practical  uses.",
