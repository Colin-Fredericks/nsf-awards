Many predict a new emerging, gigantic market where millions of mobile users will carry small, battery powered palmtop based terminals with wireless connections. Mobile users will be in constant need of information for traffic directions, local directory, weather, shopping.  The wireless medium will be used as the \"first mile\" of the information highway which will disseminate massive amounts of information across the country.  Before this vision can be realized a number of challenging research problems ranging from telecommunications to data management and distributed systems have to be solved.     This award provides equipment to gain implementation experience in deploying Wireless Information Systems dealing with location aware or/and location transparent access to information resources.  Wireless infrastructure support is needed to understand the effects of three new aspects of wireless information access: (1) mobility of information consumers (and perhaps producers.)  (2) wireless bandwidth and (3) battery power limitations.  Methods of  supporting wireless services as broadcasting, triggering, ad hoc queries, and network-oriented services (such as ftp, telnet, X window, etc.) for mobile clients will be evaluated and these services over wide areas and regardless of client mobility and disconnection will be supported.      This equipment will help to  set up a wireless laboratory.  With the infrastructure in place, experiments can be conducted to determine the suitability and performance of the proposed  concepts, algorithms, and prot ocols and report on the experience of supporting network-oriented information services in a wireless environment.  ***                  RVu    4  MS-DOS_5   (          kT        3COM                   t        WINA20  386            `     $  AUTOEXEC33            Xt    V   LM                     VW @$    CONFIG  BAK            V        CONFIG  OLD           nW        WIN31                  X        9320300  Kulikowski     Wireless technology is gaining in popularity very rapidly.
