The Indian chairman is P. Pai  Chaudhuri, of the Department of Computer Science  and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology,  Kharagpur.  The conference is a forum for  researchers and designers to present and discuss  various aspects of this emerging field.  Topics  of interest include: analog devices, application  specific devices, CAE/CAD systems, DSP  applications, design for testability, economic  issues, fault modeling and simulation, fault  tolerant computing, high level synthesis, logic  and circuit simulation, logic synthesis,  microarchitecture, mixed A/D VLSI, multi-chip  modules, placement and routing, regional/global  perspectives, technology CAD, test generation,  timing verification, VLSI architectures and  algorithms, and VLSI neural networks.    Scope:  This is the seventh such conference held  in India starting with 1985 in Madras, and then  in Bangalore, New Delhi and Bombay.  These  meetings were open to scientists from the  developing countries, and were also well  attended by scientists from Europe, Japan, and  North America.  It is expected that the 1994  conference also will be well attended.  The U.S.  Principal Investigator, Dr. Donald Bouldin will  prepare a summary report on the highlights of  the conference, to be published in the IEEE  Circuits & Devices Magazine.  ***",
