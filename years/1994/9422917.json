Several agencies will be contributing toward this  Forum that is scheduled for November 21-22, 1994.    The Committee on Health, Safety, and Food will host a forum  as part of the effort to develop implementation plans for FY  1996 Research and Development policies, including goals and  priorities, developed through the National Science and  Technological Council (NSTC).  The aim of the forum is to  obtain expert advice from academia, industry and others in  the private sector.  It is planned to invite 200-300 guests  to participate in the two-day discussion to be held at the  headquarters of the National Academy of  Sciences.    A series of papers will be prepared for discussion by forum  participants.  Six of the Subcommittees working under the  aegis of the Committee on Health, Safety and Food are  developing white papers.  Participants will be sent a list  of topics and as a condition of participation will be  required to submit a 2-page paper on any one of the  subjects.",
