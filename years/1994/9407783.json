The project will examine documents in the  city archives to trace the social history of the water system in  this developing city, which is the state capital of the state of  Oaxaca, a relatively poor, backwards state in southern Mexico.  The project will document the historical development of the water  system, focusing on the political and economic aspects of the  decisions to construct the first modern water plant in the 1930s,  and trace the demographic processes that have led to the current  situation of water crisis in terms of quality (prior studies have  shown that the \"best\" water delivered for potable uses by the  current municipal system would be too polluted to be used in  swimming pools in developed countries) and quantity (the annual  dry seasons bring shortages and service interruptions each year).        This project is important because understanding the patterns  of development of the basic municipal service of potable water in  depth, in one place, is valuable to understand patterns of grown  in municipal services in the developing world in general.  In  addition this project involves international collaboration  between US and Mexican scholars which will strengthen ties  between the two countries.",
