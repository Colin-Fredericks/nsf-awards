The equipment will be used for several research projects, including the development of a comprehensive parallelization system for MIMD multiprocessors, design and performance evaluation of mechanisms for parallel discrete event simulation, and development of parallel algorithms for simulation of two-dimensional radio frequency glow discharge.     Research on graph-based parallelizing compiler technology at Auburn University has already produced tools to perform dependence analysis and SSA-PDG transformations, along with graph partitioning and task scheduling.  The next step for the project is the analysis of the parallel code produced by the tools, and this step requires a dedicated multiprocessor.     At Auburn University, research on parallel and distributed discrete event simulation includes the study of benchmarks  for conservative and optimistic simulation mechanisms, the analysis of optimistic (Time Warp) mechanisms under realistic conditions, and the investigation of new hybrid mechanisms.  All of these research directions require the availability of a distributed-memory multiprocessor.     The use of simulation to study radio-frequency glow discharges is computationally intensive.  Most previous work in this area is limited to one-dimensional simulations, which do not provide sufficient realistic details.  The availability of a distributed-memory multiprocessor will make it possible to perform two-dimensional simu lations with reasonable turnaround time.  ***                            X        SYSTEM                 X        SETUP   EXE           @ j    p  SETUP   HLP           @ j       SETUP   TXT           @ j       WIN     INI           arj R _#  WINHELP EXE           @ j =     SYSTEM  INI           <o\\  #    CONTROL HLP           @ j N H   WIN     COM           :X  T     BOOTLOG TXT           EX  k     9320225  Seidman     This instrumentation award supports the purchase of a distributed-memory multiprocessor to support research        '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    $         $         $         $              G                                                             '                    Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                      e   e                        7    Seidman/Auburn    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
