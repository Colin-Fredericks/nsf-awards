A formal three year  curriculum in manufacturing technology has been developed.    This project will over the next four years develop an integrated  manufacturing instructional model for thirty (30) women and  minority teachers grades 6-12.  Participants will be introduced to  the project via 3 seminars held in the spring.  The seminars will  be on equity issues, manufacturing technology and each summer over  the life of the project the participants will receive an intensive  three (3) week workshop on current trends and practices in  manufacturing.  Topics include automation, electronics, mechanics  and bio manufacturing.  Emphasis will be placed upon integrating  mathematics and science, the importance of communication and human  relations, technology skills related to manufacturing, career  awareness, hands-on activities appropriate for junior and senior  high student.  Each academic year the original thirty teachers will  acquire more complex integrated math/science and technology skills  coupled with specific workshops on women and minority issues as  they begin to develop integrated projects suited to their teaching  environment.  The project emphasizes a realistic view of science  and technology as problem solving activities which require skill in  collaboration, experimentation, writing, computing and the pursuit  of exploration.  The amount requested is $361,116 for 54 months  with cost share of $815,179.",
