 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400263  Wigen    Technical abstract:  Chaos is a complicated and often undesirable  behavior.  The ability to control chaotic behavior is a special  attribute that may be beneficial to many applications.  The chaotic  attractor includes an infinite number of unstable orbits.  By  applying a well defined perturbation to a system variable it is  possible to control the behavior of a chaotic system by stabilizing  one of these unstable orbits.  By modifying the perturbation the  selected orbit may be varied permitting a variety of orbits that  are not readily available in a conventional linear system.  It is  proposed to utilize perturbation of the magnetic field to control  the chaotic behavior observed in the ferromagnetic resonance  signal.    Non-technical abstract:  The complex behavior of a chaotic system  is commonly known and widely recognized in many systems from  bridges and the weather to heart fibrillation and brain signals.   In many systems significant effort is made to eliminate the  conditions that lead to this chaotic behavior.  However, with the  recent evolution of \"controlling chaos\" it is possible to put the  system into one of a number of unstable behavioral patterns that  are present in a chaotic system.  By applying an appropriate  control signal it is possible to stabilize these desired patterns.   This behavior leads to an increased flexibility in many systems  giving rise to new applications and environments.  ***",
