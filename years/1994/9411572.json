The equipment is planned for  use in optimizing design of filters for removing air pollutants,  formulating a filtration model for prediction of filter  efficiency, identification of conditions for minimizing the  production of bioaerosols and validation of the signature lipid  biomarker method of bioaerosol air sampling.    A result of this award is expected to provide the investigators  with a biocontaminant indoor air quality laboratory that can be  used in conducting research as noted above.  In addition, the  investigators plan on conducting research on indoor air quality  in residential and commercial buildings and in facilities used  for transportation of people.  The proposal leading to this award  was submitted in response to NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant  Program.  ***",
