 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year theoretical research project  is jointly supported by the   NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials   Theory Program.  Theoretical models will be studied for the study of: (1)   low temperature thermal and optical properties of glasses, and (2)   optical and electronic properties and electronic and vibrational states   of molecular aggregates.  Topic (1) involves computer simulations to   generate a large sample of glass structures using an empirical force   field model.  Each generated structure is searched for pairs of   neighboring local minima on the potential energy surface with associated   double well potentials (DWP).  Tunneling contributions to low temperature   specific heat, thermal conductivity and phonon-chromophore interactions   will be computed using the statistical distribution of DWP parameters.    Topic (2) is a quantum and statistical mechanical analysis of   electronic-vibrational (phonon) coupling in molecular aggregates, chains,   and polyatomic molecules. Theory will be compared with results of optical   dephasing experiments on low temperature glasses.    The overall goal of this research is to understand, and eventually to   predict, optical and thermal properties of glasses and other disordered   materials in terms of their atomic structure.  At the atomic level, a   glass lacks the regular periodicity of a perfect single crystal.  This   disorder requires that one take proper account of the statistical   distribution of relevant structural features.  In particular, there exist   pairs of structures of nearly the same energy which can be converted one   into the other by a concerted motion of just a few atoms with small   adjustments by the many surrounding atoms.  The double well potential is   a mathematical representation of the change of the potential energy of   the glass during this conversion process.  The energy barrier is very   small for some pairs of structures, and for these, interconversion   motions persist ev en when the glass is cooled to liquid helium   temperatures, where other atomic motions have been frozen out.   Thus low   temperature experiments allow one to study the effects of the tunneling   motion free from complications due to other types of motion.  Various   measurable optical and thermal properties of the glass will then be   computed from the computed distribution to test the theory.",
