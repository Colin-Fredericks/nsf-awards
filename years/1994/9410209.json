 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410209  Cezeaux  This Research Initiation Award proposes the study of the  effects of mechanical stretch and the renin-angiotensin-  aldosterone system on cardiac myocytes and non-myocytes in  ventricular wall remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy.  Of  particular interest is the hyperplasia response of non-  myocytes in response to angiotensin II produced locally by  non-myocytes and by myocytes.  A component of nonmyocytes  hyperplasia can be increased collagen synthesis which may be  modulated by aldosterone.  It is hypothesized that stretch  induces an increase in production of angiotensin II in both  myocytes and non-myocytes and that angiotensin II causes  nonmyocyte hyperplasia by paracrine and autocrine pathways.  Using a mechanical stretching device to apply uniaxial  stretch to cultured cardiac cells to simulate ventricular  pressure overload, cells will be stretched at 10% and 20%  for 24 hours.  Modulation of renin and angiotensin II levels  in response to stretch will be determined by measuring renin  mRNA by RT-PCR and angiotensin II productions by  radioimmunoassay.    It is expected that this study will advance the knowledge of  the response of cardiac cells to various stimuli, an  important factor in tissue engineering in the cardiovascular  system.  ***",
