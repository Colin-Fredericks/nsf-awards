The research involves  high precision measurements of the magnetic moment of the helium in  the A and B phases, as well as determination of the contribution of  the dipole-dipole coupling energies to the superfluid free energy.   The novel dilute mixtures of 4He in 4He, found only in constrained  geometries of aerogels will also be investigated to characterize  the miscibility gap in these systems and to investigate diffusion  and relaxation phenomena in these new materials.  The NMR studies  of molecular organic solids will focus on fundamental questions  concerning the origin of the metallic state in these quasi-one-  dimensional solids.  The experiments will involve ultralow  temperatures and high magnetic fields.    Non-technical abstract:  The research project employs low  temperature nuclear magnetic resonance to study the behavior of  superfluid phases of 3He.  These systems display unusual quantum  effects at very low temperatures.  The information obtained in  these superfluid systems is of fundamental interest, and also is of  interest in connection with other Fermi liquid systems, such as the  high temperature superconductors.  Another part of the project  involves studies of thin films of dilute 4He in 3He constrained in  the diaphanous, ultrahigh surface area aerogel materials.  The  research will provide information about surface interactions in  these materials, as well as providing fundamental information about  phase behavior such as miscibility of the two isotopes of helium.   Finally, the project includes NMR studies of high purity molecular  organic solids which display metallic character with the  conductivity having a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy.  Here the  focus is on fundamental aspects of the phase transition from an  insulating to conducting state.  ***",
