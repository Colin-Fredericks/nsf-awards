The objective of the conference  is to stimulate the interest of underrepresented minority high  school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, post-  doctoral fellows seeking science and engineering careers; and to  attract faculty, research scientists and university and government  representatives interested in sharing their experiences and eager  to learn and demonstrate how one can succeed in a science and  engineering career.    The conference will conduct symposia on recent Native American and  Hispanic advances and accomplishments in Science, Engineering, and  Mathematics fields.  The conference will also have a series of  workshops and information on career opportunities in the science  and engineering fields.  In addition, graduate students will  conduct oral research presentations and undergraduate students will  conduct poster presentations.  The conference will provide a forum  where peers and potential mentors or role models can meet, network,  advise and encourage students to be competitive and fulfill  research careers.  This conference will conduct a special workshop  on developing grant writing skills and science careers outside the  laboratory.",
