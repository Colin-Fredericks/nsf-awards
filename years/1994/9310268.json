 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310268  Wheelwright  The Bowdoin Scientific Station is a biological field station  located on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada.  The 80-ha island,  ringed by 7 km of sandy beaches and rocky intertidal, has a  diversity of habitats, including boreal forest, old fields, and  marsh, and has easy access to other islands in the Bay of Fundy.   Owned and operated since 1935 by Bowdoin College in Brunswick,  Maine, the field station has promoted biological research by  faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates from numerous U.S.  colleges and universities.  BSS is unusual among North American  field stations in offering both terrestrial and marine boreal  habitats, and having long-term databases on local climate and  vertebrate populations.  Working closely with senior researchers,  hundreds of undergraduates have been trained at BSS, and many  have gone on to prominent careers in science.      The field station has recently modernized its research facilities  and scientific equipment, and expanded the research program.  Of  the 109 scientific papers based on research at BSS since 1935, 24  have been published in the last six years.  The field station's  location makes it ideal for research in marine biology and island  biogeography.  However, many on-going projects are limited (and  new projects prevented) by the lack of facilities for marine  research.  Most importantly, the station currently lacks an  adequate boat for safe transportation in the Bay of Fundy.  As  long-term databases at BSS have grown, new computer equipment is  required for database management.  The field station's  photovoltaic system needs to be expanded to meet the energy  demands imposed by increasing use of laboratory equipment and  computers.  This project will address those needs.  ***",
