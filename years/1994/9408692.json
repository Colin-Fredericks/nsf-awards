The workshop is one of a series of workshops and symposia organized by the Global Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems program of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program. This workshop will bring together leading researchers on the effects of global change on populations and communities. The workshop will include both experimentalists and modelers. This is an area of research that has not been emphasized previously, but the scientific community is now poised to greatly expand research efforts in this direction. The workshop aims to review and analyze the state of knowledge, and identify critical questions and future directions. The results will be published in a book edited by the organizers.   %%%  This conference is the first to focus directly on how global change will affect population and community level phenomena. The conference includes some of the world's leading experts on these topics. The proceedings from this workshop should provide a clear focus for future global change research.",
