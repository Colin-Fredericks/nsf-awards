 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320589  Shemansky  In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the energy budget is  controlled by both particle collision processes and direct  interaction of solar radiation.  In response to the need for  accurate atomic and molecular properties in order to understand the  processes, the University of Southern California (USC) and the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the Calfiornia Institute of  Technology have established a program which combines laboratory  measurements and non-linear modeling of excitation reactions.  The  present award will continue in the examination of species critical  to the understanding of the observed phenomena.  Crossed beam  excitation and photoabsorption measurements will be used to define  accurate excitation cross sections and other basic atomic and  molecular properties such as predissociation fractions required for  atmospheric models.  Calculations of the combined detailed  collisional and radiative non-linear volumetric processes will be  produced for utilization by the larger atmospheric models that  other researchers have established.  In this three-year renewal  task plan USC-JPL will concentrate on the species: N2, O2, NO, N, O,  H, and their ions the most abundant atomic and molecular species in  the upper atmosphere and the species ubiquitously observed by earth  orbiting satellites (RAIDS, DMSP, Polar Bear, HUP, SMEX, Aura)  equipped with UV sensors.  In addition for UV calibration purposes  in laboratory and spaceflight instrumentation the target gas H2 will  be reexamined to resolve cross section discrepancies.  To carry out  the measurements JPL will utilize three fully operational UV  spectrometers, including the highest resolution single scattering  UV instrument in the U.S., a new 3m high resolution spectrometer (         = 67000) with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and vacuum  ultraviolet (FUV) array detectors.  ***",
