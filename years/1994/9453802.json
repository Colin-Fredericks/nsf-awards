This \"real world\" approach can motivate children to learn science and mathematics concepts and to develop problem-solving skills in the process of tackling everyday consumer problems.  The approach is particularly effective with youth who are not print-oriented, who watch a lot of television, and who may find \"formal\" science and mathematics inaccessible.  Outreach materials for viewers and for use in formal classes will extent the impact of the project.    The PI and Project Director will be Joyce Newman, Director of Consumer Reports TV.  Susan Markowitz, who produced the successful pilot program will be Producer and Edward Groth, a biologist who serves as Consumers Union Associate Technical Director for Public Service Projects, will be the Senior Science Advisor.  Susan Isenberg will be a major science education advisor.  Ms. Isenberg is an IBM Education Fellow and consultant to a number of New York and New Jersey school districts.  She has a B.S. in Science Education, an M.S. in Education, and has been a teacher for 25 years.  This core group will work closely with in-house scientists and education experts as well as with an advisory committee established for the project.",
