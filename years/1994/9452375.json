 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452375  Rose  A modern, computer automated system for atomic absorption  spectrometry has been purchased. The project is to enhance the  education and research capabilities of undergraduate students who  are preparing to enter the fields of environmental geology and  geochemistry by giving sophisticated \"hands-on\" assignments in  water analyses. The project emphasizes an integrated approach that  includes project conception, planning of the sampling strategy,  carrying out the sampling, carrying out the water analyses, data  reduction and presentation, report writing, and ethical  considerations regarding the use and abuse of scientific data. The  proposed project represents an upgrading of a prototype project  completed successfully in Spring, 1993, which involved  determinations of Pb in campus drinking fountains. A small subset  of students in Environmental Geology assessed the Pb concentrations  of drinking water in light of the EPA action level of 2O ppb Pb.  The students used an old, manual, and relatively inaccurate  graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. The proposed new  automated instrument enables this and similar assignments to be  carried out with superior results by all of the Environmental  Geology students, resulting in a better educated and better  prepared graduating class of scientists headed for professional  careers in environmental geology and geochemistry.",
