The major impact on the  undergraduates will be in the Intermediate and Advanced integrated  laboratory courses directed by the Chemistry department. These  upper level courses are designed to present laboratory techniques  and methods as applied to realistic questions and applications. As  well, we plan to initiate exposure to the technique and the  instrument in at least one introductory (general) chemistry  laboratory for science and non-science majors. These underclassmen  will be introduced to chromatographic principles in lecture as well  as lab. Juniors and Seniors will be involved in using the system in  mini-research projects at the end of the Integrated and Advanced  laboratory series and will also have the opportunity to use the  system in faculty directed undergraduate research programs.  Applications involve organic and biochemical systems as well as  fundamental analytical chemistry and techniques.",
