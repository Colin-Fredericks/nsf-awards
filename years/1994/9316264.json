 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316264  Finnemore      This award will support the travel of Dr. Douglas Finnemore  and an advanced graduate student from the Department of Physics  and Astronomy at Iowa State University to conduct cooperative  research on microstructures, critical current density and flux  pinning in high temperature superconductors with Prof. S. X. Dou  at the University of New South Wales, School of Materials Science  and Engineering. Over a two-year period, a visit will be made  each year by Dr. Finnemore while his graduate student spends  up to three months each year collaborating with researchers in  Dr. Dou's laboratory.    The primary focus of this research is on gaining an understanding  of the kinetics of synthesis of high temperature bismuth-based  oxide superconductors and the relationship of microstructure to  fundamental transport properties. This project brings together  the expertise of the U.S. researchers and their x-ray technology  for studying melting and freezing of high temperature  superconductors with the Australian group's expertise in  preparing new materials and uncovering new processing procedures.  Prof. Dou  will make exchange visits to Iowa State University  through the support of the Australian Department of Industry,  Technology and Regional Development.",
