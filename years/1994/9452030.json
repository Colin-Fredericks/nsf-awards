 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a first-year introductory electronics  course for science and pre-engineering students. The course will  concentrate on analog techniques, with a slant towards practical  electronics for the sciences. We will use computer-automated data  acquisition and control systems as instructional tools. Each lab  station will include a protoboard interfaced through an I/O board  and a GPIB DMM to a computer workstation running instructional  software that we have written in LabVIEW. The students will build  the circuits and use LabVIEW software to explore, test and control  them. Computer-based data acquisition and control are used as tools  to teach electronics, not as the focus of the course itself.  Through the use of computer-based instruction, the students will be  freed of much of the tedium associated with traditional electronics  courses and will be able to focus on the material. In addition, we  find that by integrating LabVIEW into this electronics course, we  are opening up new approaches to teaching the material.  This  pre-calculus electronics course is offered it at a level that makes  it available to most incoming students.  This approach provides  students with a positive laboratory experience and one-on-one  contact with regular faculty members early in their career. This  will get them started towards early research experience and better  prepare them for industrial internships.",
