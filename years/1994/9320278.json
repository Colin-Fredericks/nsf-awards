 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320278  Star  Scientific communities (and indeed the very ideal of a scientific  community) are undergoing significant changes as a result of  rapidly changing electronic infrastructures.  These include  specialized electronic support for scientific collaboration, the  explosive growth of the Internet, very large databases, and  increasingly common long-distance collaborations using such tools.   There are serious difficulties for STS researchers in understanding  practice and social change in these geographically dispersed  workplaces and professional communities.  It is impossible to gain  access to the work using traditional ethnographic or survey tools.   In part this is due to the need to acquire significant information  systems/advanced user skills, something which can be difficult to  do in a social science department.  It is also due to conceptual  and methodological challenges as the very nature of work shifts.    In order to address these problems, Dr. Star is undertaking  professional development training in order to increase her skills  in information systems and electronic network usage while  conducting research on two scientific communities.  The purpose of  the training is severalfold:  to deepen ongoing collaborations with  information and computer scientists; to help better understand the  activities of her respondent scientists who use these systems' and  to hep develop methods for studying large electronic systems such  as Internet.  The research will develop tools and concepts for  understanding the impact and nature of electronically-supported  scientific work.    Dr. Star will be based at the Community Systems Laboratory and the  National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  There she  will continue research on a community of biologists who are  sequencing the genetic structure of the nematode worm.  This  community has developed a large digital library (WCS).  Dr. Star  has been collaborating with this team since 1991 as an ethnographer  in aid of system devel opment.  She is also working with a second  community of scientists developing a large database describing the  results of autopsies of patients with severe dementia.  She will  also acquire skills in Unix programming, Internet use, information  retrieval and database programming through taking classes and on-  the-job training as a team member of the Software Development Group  at NCSA.    Her research focus extends and makes more rigorous three concepts  she has developed:  boundary objects, invisible work and  distributed problem solving.  Using these concepts, she is  analyzing how scientific work is being conducted electronically (as  well as off-line), in the two communities.  At a higher level, she  is interested in how these large-scale infrastructural changes  occurring in science are impacting both the structure and processes  of scientific communities.  ***",
