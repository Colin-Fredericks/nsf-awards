The  program will immerse 10 undergraduate students in an active  research environment spanning the areas of behavioral and cognitive  neuroscience, psychophysiology and the experimental study of  decision, choice and self-control.  The goal is to introduce  students who are not currently involved in a laboratory research  program to state-of-the art psychological research in some of the  most interesting areas of experimental psychology.  Recruitment of  students will focus on schools with large minority populations and  institutions which do not have the resources to provide their  students with research experiences.  Students will conduct  independent research projects in one of eleven active research  laboratories.  To supplement the laboratory experience, a variety  of group activities such as visits to other labs, laboratory  meetings, seminars, and symposia are planned.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
