 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401936  DITTEL    A fundamental, yet unresolved, question in Biological Oceanography  concerns the feeding habits and trophic dynamics of zooplankton. In  addition, the importance of understanding the ecological role of  meroplankton in marine ecosystems has generated considerable  interest in larval nutrition. Most studies concerning feeding  behavior of larval forms have dealt with crustaceans, particularly  decapod larvae. It is well known that larvae require animal food to  complete development, but there is some indication that  phytoplankton is also utilized. However, most studies have been  based on laboratory experiments using prey such as Artemia salina  nauplii and rotifers. The most common method used to assess the  natural diet of marine organisms has been gut content analyses.  However, this method has several drawbacks. For example, gut  content analysis is of limited use, particularly in crustaceans,  due to the difficulty of identifying crushed prey items. This  project will use a new method, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR),  to study the feeding habits of crab larvae under natural  conditions. This project will examine whether PCR can be used  successfully to assess the diet of crab larvae. If successful  further research concerning food preferences using potential prey  items from the natural environment will also be examined.  ***",
