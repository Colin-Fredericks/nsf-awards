 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320483  Featherman      This workshop, organized by the Social Science Research  Council, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and  the African Academy of Sciences, brings together African and  U.S. scientists from a range of disciplines to examine the  question: how has human occupancy of African landscapes  affected the biodiversity found within those landscapes?  Active researchers from the biological sciences, social  sciences, and humanities will consider the relevance of this  question and the feasibility of pursuing research  initiatives to answer it.   The specific research interests  of the participants include agriculture and drought,  forestry, agroforestry, and rangelands management.  The  African participants come from 7 different countries,  representing a broad cross-section of the continent  (Nigeria, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon,  Kenya).    The role of humans in managing and perhaps creating  biodiversity has been neglected so far, and Africa, as the  place where humans originated, and where the dynamic effects  of those interactions are currently highly visible, is the  logical place to begin examining the question.  The workshop  on this novel, important, and timely theme will strengthen  collaboration  internationally  (between US and African  scientists), regionally (among scientists in different parts  of Africa), and across disciplinary boundaries.  ***",
