 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to examine a series of disjoint biradicals   by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Molecular orbital calculations   have predicted that disjoint biradicals will possess a singlet ground   state. Previous work from this laboratory has resulted in finding a   triplet ground state disjoint biradical. This contradiction of theory   will be pursued further with new examples which have rigidly defined   structures for comparison to theoretical calculations. Non-alternant   biradicals will be explored, which contain in some fashion,   cyclopentadiene rings. The interplay between structure and multiplicity   of these biradicals will be explored, where lower membered systems are   expected to be singlets and higher membered systems triplets.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work   of Professor Paul Dowd at the University of Pittsburgh. The chemical and   spectroscopic properties of a novel series of reactive intermediates   known as biradicals will be examined. Biradicals are molecules where   there are an odd number of electron at two sites. For example, in a   hydrocarbon biradical, two carbon atoms will each be bonded to three   other carbon atoms and have one unbonded electron.  The two odd electrons   may have spins paired (a singlet) or unpaired (a triplet). The lowest   energy states (singlet or triplet) of the biradicals will be determined   experimentally as a function of structure. These results will be compared   to theoretical calculations.",
