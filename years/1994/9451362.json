 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451362  Lerman  Columbia College is equipping a laboratory with computer animation  and video editing equipment necessary to train students in the  interdisciplinary field between science, visualization, and  communication. These students obtain a strong background in  science, computer animation and video production, enabling them to  create and capture a visual perspective of science, and to create  video models showing scientific processes such as chemical  reactions, heat transfer, digestion, fission and fusion. These  broadcast quality videos are ideally suited for dissemination among  science teachers at all levels.  The Institute for Science  Education and Science Communication has been working for three  years in collaboration with Columbia College's Academic Computing,  Television, and Film/Video departments on the development of a  program in Science Visualization and Communication.  Students  concentrate in this area under other majors.  The development of  this laboratory is a crucial step in Columbia's development of this  degree program.   The program addresses the problem stated by Nobel  Laureate Roald Hoffmann on the difficulties in producing good video  programs in science because of the lack of a common language  between scientists and communicators.",
