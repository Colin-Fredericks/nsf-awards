Patterns in the embryology or development of organisms can reveal information important to understanding the relationships among members of groups of organisms.  The speakers, who include several leaders in this field, will address important questions about the independence vs integration or interdependence of developmental data (from molecular to morphological) and how to incorporate such data in phylogenetic analyses or the study of relationships among species.  Proceedings of the symposium will be published so that this information is disseminated to a wider audience that just those individuals able to attend and hear the presentations.  %%%   The talks given at this meeting will address means of incorporating embryological or developmental information into analysis of the relationships among living things.  Sometimes, developmental information can shed important new light on relationships.  The best and most complete knowledge of the relationships among members of different groups of living things is very important for predicting things about the biology of related species, including the possible occurrence or production or useful natural products such new drugs to combat human or animal diseases.  ***",
