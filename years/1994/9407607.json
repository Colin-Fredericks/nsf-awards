 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407607  Abstract  The project will be a study of a key protein required for a site-  specific recombination reaction in yeast, Flp.  The mechanism of  the reaction has been studied and a number of mutants isolated that  block the reaction at different stages.  The work will involve  characterization of the mutants to identify protein domains  involved in specific sub-reactions.  Of special interest is the  substrate recognition domain which determines which DNA sequences  will be recombined.  Site-specific recombination systems are  extremely useful tools for genetic engineering of complex genomes  including potential uses with plants and humans.  ***  In some organisms, two different DNA molecules can be joined to one  another at very well defined sites, that is specific base  sequences, which exist in the two molecules.  This is an important  reaction for cells in many different ways.  Expression of some  genes is regulated by this mechanism, viruses are able to maintain  long-term infections of host cells via the process, and generation  of antibody molecules and related proteins depend heavily on site-  specific recombination.  The Flp system from yeast is a model  system for studying this process using both biochemical and genetic  approaches.  In this project, mutants in the Flp recombinase will  be characterized to understand how the sequences of DNA are  selected for recombination and also how different domains of the  protein affect different aspects of the process.  %%%",
