 "awd_abstract_narration": "The normal functioning of the brain depends upon the ability  of nerve cells to rapidly transmit chemical signals to each  other.  This chemical transmission is accomplished through  cell contacts called synapses.  Synapses form mainly during  embryonic and fetal life, and childhood, though they may  form in adult life as well.  One nerve cell may make as many  as 50,000 synapses, and as there are over a billion nerve  cells in the brain there would be over a trillion synapses  in the brain.  The synapse is a relatively stable contact,  tightly binding together the nerve cells involved.  This  tight contact provides both the stability and closeness  necessary for chemical signals to be predictably and rapidly  transferred between neurons.  Recent research has provided  considerable insight into the mechanisms involved in  chemical neurotransmission.  However, very little is known  about the molecules involved in generating the adhesiveness  or mechanical stability in the zone of synaptic contact.  About a half-dozen proteins have been identified recently  which reside almost exclusively in the cell membranes in the  zone of synaptic contact in developing and adult brains of  mammals (and probably other vertebrates as well).  Based  upon their preliminary characterization these proteins  appear to be good candidates to be at least some of the  molecules involved in synaptic adhesion.  This proposal  outlines experiments which would investigate further the  ability of these proteins to function as adhesion molecules.  A number of approaches will be taken.  These molecules will  be isolated from synaptic junctions of rats and examined for  their ability to bind each other or to other synaptic  molecules.  For example, the proteins will be linked to tiny  beads alone or in different combinations to see if they can  promote the aggregation of the beads (as has been seen for  other kinds of adhesion molecules).  In a second approach,  the isolated proteins will be coated on the surface of  tissue cult ure dishes or inert beads to see if they have any  ability to act as a favorable substrate for the formation of  synaptic contacts by cultured nerve cells.  In a third  approach, rabbit antibodies will be generated to these  proteins to see if they can either disrupt the stability of  the synaptic contact or prevent synapses from forming.  If  one or more of these proteins appears to have the properties  of an adhesion molecule then a new grant proposal will be  developed to further study their molecular organization and  the regulation of their synthesis and turnover.",
