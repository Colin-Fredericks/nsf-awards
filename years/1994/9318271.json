 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318271  Bultman     This project investigates the interactions between ovipositing Phorbia flies and the ascomycete fungal host on which their larvae feed.  Preliminary data suggest that the fly provides spore dispersal service to the fungus and that the relationship between the two organisms is mutualistic and possibly coevolved.  The project investigates the similarities between this system and tightly coevolved plant-pollinator mutualisms.    %%%  There is general agreement among ecologists that mutualisms are very important in ecosystem function, but that they are understudied and poorly understood relative to other biotic interactions.  This research is important in that it will describe a potentially new and widespread mutualistic relationship, and give us better insight into the conditions that lead to the origins of mutualisms.  The results of this research may be of application in studies of the health and function of ecosystems.   ***",
