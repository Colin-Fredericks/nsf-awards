 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314537  Tublitz    Neuropeptides, small proteinaceous molecules released from nerve  cells, have profound effects both on the brain and peripheral  tissues.  They have been implicated in a variety of neural  functions, ranging from controlling movements to transmitting  sensory information such as pain.  These chemicals are also  involved in more long-term behavioral changes such as learning and  memory, arousal and various emotional states.  Despite their   critical importance, little is known about the cellular and  molecular mechanisms underlying peptide action.  Dr. Tublitz's  research is directed towards finding these answers.  He is  concentrating on a family of neuropeptides, the Cardioacceleratory  Peptides (CAPs), that modulate several different tissues, including  the heart, gut and brain.  In his previous NSF research, Dr.  Tublitz demonstrated that these neuropeptides modulate four  different, developmentally-specific behaviors, each having a  distinctive set of characteristics resulting in very different  physiological and/or behavioral consequences.  Moreover, he  identified the cells that produce the CAPs and their targets.  Dr.  Tublitz will now determine how these neuropeptides affect their  targets at the molecular level as well as to identify the genes  that code producing the peptide regulate its levels.  The results  from this basic research will lead to a better understanding of how  neurochemicals function to modulate nerve cell activity and  subsequently, behavior.  ***",
