 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuously tunable and very compact mid-infrared (9-12 um)  CO2 sideband laser spectrometer was developed under prior a NSF  grant (ATM-9011067).  This instrument has been used to obtain  accurate data on absorption line positions, line strengths, line  width and frequency shift of NH3 molecules.  The application of this  laser for remote sensing of stratospheric ozone (O3) and HNO3 will  be investigated in this project.  Development of the technique will  also be extended to other stratospheric molecules such as CF2Cl2  (Frcon-12).       This two year year research program will obtain quantitative  vertical concentration profiles of these species by conducting the  field measurements using a heterodyne radiometer with the tunable  sideband CO2 laser as a local oscillator.  The field measurements  will be analyzed by using existing models and comparing them with  existing vertical profiles.  A parallel study will be performed to  measure the critical line shape parameters for O2 under controlled  laboratory conditions.  In this effort, the tunable sideband laser  spectrometer will provide direct absorption measurements under  simulated stratospheric conditions with sufficient resolution to  obtain the desired spectroscopic line parameters.       In the first year, a heterodyne radiometer system consisting  of a solar- tracker, optical combiner, a local oscillator, a  photomixer, RF filter band and signal processor will be designed,  assembled and calibrated.  In particular, noise characteristics of  the sideband laser will be studied by heterodyining with blackbody  radiation and potential methods to reduce the amplitude and phase  noise will be explored.  The goal is to approach short-noise-  limited performance and thereby achieve maximum signal to noise  ratio for the heterodyne system.  In parallel, a system for  delivering and analyzing gas mixtures will be constructed and  calibrated.  During the second year, laboratory absorption  measurements of O2, HNO3 and CF2Cl2 will be perfo rmed with extremely  high resolution (+0.00001 cm-) under stratospheric conditions to  obtain accurate correlations between line shape parameters and  analyte concentrations.  Field measurements will be conducted and  analyzed simultaneously utilizing the newly acquired line shape  parameters.  A model which yields an accurate vertical ozone  concentration profile between 15 to 50 km will be developed.  The  ultimate application for the model lies in the interpretation of  the dynamics and chemistry related to the stratospheric ozone  layer.",
