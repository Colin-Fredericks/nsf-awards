 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dickinson College, located in Carlisle, PA, is the recipient of ARI funds to  underwrite part of a renovation project for the Althouse Science Building,  constructed in 1957.  In order to improve upon a research oriented  curriculum in chemistry, existing laboratory space will be upgraded and  relocated to support research and research training in organic synthesis.   Phase I of the renovation project will relocated a faculty research laboratory in  proximity to a research laboratory for advanced students, and primary  teaching laboratories for the faculty member.  Space will be reconfigured to  provide modern research facilities for work in applications of organoiron  systems to organic synthesis.  Phase II of the renovation will upgrade research  training space and infrastructural utilities used for advanced synthesis  studies.  The student research laboratory will become the model for the  development of future research space for advanced chemistry students.  The  impact of the improved research environment will allow the Chemistry  Department to implement key aspects of a curriculum that encourages  students to deduce principles from research experience, and support the  investigative activities of faculty engaged in synthesis research.",
