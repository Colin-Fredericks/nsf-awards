 "awd_abstract_narration": "As functional MRI provides a new way to study human brain  functions, it becomes increasingly important to improve the  temporal resolution of the experiments so that rapid transient  neuronal events can be captured.  In conventional Fourier  transform-based imaging methods, each of the dynamic images is  acquired independently so that the temporal resolution possible is  limited by the number of data points collected in Fourier space to  achieve a certain level of spatial resolution.  This research seeks  to overcome this problem by incorporating a priori information into  the imaging process.  Specifically, new optimal methods for data  acquisition and image reconstruction are being developed that  exploit both the underlying model for the signal as well as the  available a priori information about both the object being imaged  and the dynamic changes.  These methods promise to give more that  an order of magnitude of improvement in imaging efficiency over the  traditional Fourier imaging methods, and should find application in  a variety of dynamic imaging problems, particularly in real-time  imaging of functional brain activities.",
