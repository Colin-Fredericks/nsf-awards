 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Xu will work on the geometry and topology of Calabi-Yau  manifolds as well as higher dimensional projective varieties. In  particular, he wants to study rational curves on Calabi-Yau  threefolds. He also intends to work on adjoint linear series and  pluricanonical series on projective varieties of higher  dimension. Finally, he intends to work on higher dimensional  sphere-packing problems.  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
