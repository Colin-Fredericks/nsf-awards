 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keen  9408999  The three-dimensional structures of two pectate lyase (Pel)  proteins have been determined.  These proteins are highly stable  and are extracellularly secreted by the plant pathogenic bacterium,  Erwinia chrysanthemi, to function as key virulence factors.  The  Pel structures are revolutionary, best described as a 'corkscrew'  structure of parallel b strands, not previously observed or even  predicted.  The parallel b-strands are arranged in a helical  structure with ca.22 amino acids per helical turn.  The function s  of the proteins reside on loops which protrude from the central  helix.  Since computer algorithms suggest that the parallel b-helix  structure may be much more widespread in biology, further  characterization of the pectate lyases is lucrative.  Our immediate  objectives are to characterize the calcium and substrate binding  sites of the pectate lyases as well as to determine amino acid  residues important in their folding and secretion.  Considerable  preliminary work has been directed to the development of over-  expression systems for pel genes in E.coli and methods for  efficiently obtaining oligonucleotide site directed mutations  altering one or several specific amino acids.  With structural  refinement nearing completion for PelC and PelE as well as the  ongoing development of fluorescence assays to monitor calcium and  substrate binding, the investigators are in position to define  mechanisms underlying catalysis, secretion and folding.  The  results will, in turn, open exciting future avenues.  These include  critical study of the pectate lyases as pathogen virulence factors;  detailed work on their biological secretion; and use of the  parallel b-helix as a carrier scaffold for synthetic antigen and  catalytic peptide domains that may have utility in clinical  medicine.  %%%  Pectate lyases are important pathogenicity factors released by  several pathogens of plants.  These enzymatically active proteins  attack the integrity of the plant cell wall and per mit pathogen  spread in plant tissues and result in damage.  As such, these  enzymes are a major contributor to the large world-wide loss of  food and fiber to disease organisms.  Recently, it was shown that  a pectate lyases from the pathogenic bacterium, Erwinia  chrysanthemi, has a novel structure at the atomic level.  This  structure, called the parallel beta-helix, is unlike any previously  observed structural motif and has important implications on protein  structure.  The parallel beta-helix structure also has important  ramifications for the biological function of pectate lyase in the  degradation of plant cells.  The present proposal is to study  several aspects of the biology of pectate lyase by changing certain  amino acids.  These changes will be accomplished by techniques  involving recombinant DNA technology.  This will permit assessing  the impact of the changes on the biological properties of the  pectate lyase and should eventually allow understanding of the  precise interaction of the enzyme with plant tissues.   ***",
