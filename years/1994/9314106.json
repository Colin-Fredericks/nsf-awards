The meeting, which has been organized by the APS,  the Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica (SMF), and the Canadian Association  of Physicists (CAP), represents a major first step in a plan  designed to strengthen collaboration among all the physics  communities in the western hemisphere.    The conference is the first trilateral meeting of physics societies  and furnishes an opportunity to consolidate links with other  physics societies in the hemisphere, including the Federacion  Latinoamericana de Sociedades de Fisica (FELASOFI), an umbrella  organization for Latin American physics societies.  At the same  time it will help to advance current plans of the APS and the SMF  to develop an expanded directory of physics programs in the  hemisphere, to appoint representatives to subcommittees of the  sister society, and to develop closer collaboration in educational  programs.  Furthermore, by bringing together physicists from the  hemisphere and from Europe to participate and report on their work  in thirteen broad areas, the meeting will provide an opportunity  for the exchange of knowledge and the initiation of collaborative  projects.  The Physics Division and the Division of Materials  Research are cost sharing in this international award.  ***",
