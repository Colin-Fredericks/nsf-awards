 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408186  NEWTON    The project is about the interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidyl serine and diacylglycerol.  Results of studies with several  protein kinase C isozymes have already been published.  These studies will build on this information and use modeling based on crystal structures to predict sites of interaction for the lipids.  The critical experiments involve expressing mutated forms of protein kinase C in a bacculovirus system and using the proteins to measure affinities for the ligands.  The regulation of protein C isoforms is a very important mechanism for regulating signal transduction.  %%%  Cells are known to respond to a variety of extracellular signals by altering the activity of a key enzyme known as protein kinase C.  This enzyme is in turn regulated by interactions with lipids.  This is the first known link between lipids and intracellular regulation.  The ability of different forms of protein kinase C to interact with different lipids seems to be a key aspect of regulating how a cell responds to a particular stimulus.  This project will accomplish a detailed biochemical analysis of the strength of interaction between normal and mutant forms of the enzyme and various lipids.  The use of recombinant DNA to mutate and express the genes for protein kinase C is a key aspect of the project.  ***",
