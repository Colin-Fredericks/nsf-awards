 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321180  Kline  A common view of the impact of technology on society is one of  technological determinism: society must embrace new technologies as  they come along.  Historians of technology have long rejected this  simplistic view.  Societies not only accept or reject new  technologies, but may also radically change the technologies that  they are presented with in order to adapt them to their own  purposes.  Rural people, for example, not only used the Model T  Ford as urbanites did for transportation but also adapted it to  their own culture.  They converted it to use as produce trucks,  they used it to pull plows, and they even jacked up the rear wheel  to power washing machines (before electric washing machines became  readily available).       The transfer of several \"modern\" technologies to the countryside  enabled a sweeping transformation of American rural life in the  20th century.  Dr. Kline is studying the interactions between urban  \"agents of modernity\" and rural people in transferring a cluster of  four major technologies to the American farm from about 1900 to  1960:  the automobile, the telephone, the radio, and electric light  and power.    Of particular interest for Dr. Kline is the efforts of farm men and  women to resist, adapt , and construct their own version of these  artifacts and systems to meet rural ways of life, instead of  passively accepting the products of these supposedly \"modernizing\"  forces.  In this respect, this project is part of an emerging  research program in the history of technology that is shifting the  field's traditional focus from the \"producers\" of technology, such  as inventors, engineers, and managers, to the consumers and users  of technology.  Yet Dr. Kline is striking a balance in this project  between these two approaches by investigating both producers and  consumers--\"agents of modernity\" and rural people--in the hope of  creating a broadly based social history of technology that  addresses the themes of technology transfer, modernity and  gender.  ***",
