 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development of the nervous system, or neurogenesis, it is  possible to trace the lineage of cells leading to adult cell types.   For all cells that will become nerve cells, or neurons, a group of  genes has been identified that are characteristically activated to  express protein products .  Several of these \"neuronal precursor\"  genes are likely to have regulatory functions during neurogenesis.   This project uses the insect Drosophila as a model system with  well-known genetics to investigate one such gene.  The gene called  \"prospero\" or \"pros\" is believed to act as a regulatory gene by  expressing a protein that binds to specific regions of molecular  sequences in the nuclear DNA.  Molecular techniques are used to  assay the binding sites, the identification of potential target  genes, and the sequence elements required for gene regulation.   Clarifying how this key gene works to regulate neuronal lineage in  early development of Drosophila will be an important step toward  understanding the molecular processes underlying initiation and  execution of neurogenesis.  The results will be fundamental to  further work on regulation of neuronal differentiation and process  outgrowth, in the vertebrates as well as the invertebrates, and the  results will have an impact beyond neuroscience to developmental  biology and genetics.",
