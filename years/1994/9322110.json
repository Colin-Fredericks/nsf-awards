 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322110  Wells                        This award provides funds to support undergraduates involved in research projects  in molecular biosciences.  Ten University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates who are part  of the Undergraduate Biology Research Program (UBRP), a larger program for  undergraduates conducting biological research in UA faculty laboratories, will receive  support.  Students apply to the program and once selected by a faculty/student  committee, can choose to work with any of 185 faculty sponsors, 65 of whom conduct  research in molecular biosciences.  Students interview faculty sponsors to determine  where they will work.  This insures that students work on a problem that is of interest to  them and fosters a productive working relationship with the faculty sponsor and lab  group.  In addition to the students' research experience, lab meetings and seminars, the  program provides an orientation that includes radiation and laboratory safety, animal  care and use training, and information on careers, job search strategies and how to get  into graduate school.  A bimonthly seminar promotes discussion of biomedical, research  and environmental ethics.  The annual UBRP Conference enables students to present  their experimental results and those who have their work accepted for presentation at  scientific conferences receive funds to attend.           Five Native American students per year from other institutions, particularly at  community colleges, will be involved in summer research.  Relationships with faculty at  other institutions will help recruit students who would not be able to participate in  research on their home campuses.  They will become familiar with UA, where they could  transfer to complete bachelor's degrees.  ***",
