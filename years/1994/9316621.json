 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316621  Graham    This study will examine heart-chamber functions in elasmobranchs  (sharks and rays) and bony fishes.  In fishes the heart structure  consists of a single tube that is divided into four \"in-series\"  chambers, the sinus venosus, the atrium, the ventricle, and the  conus or bulbus arteriosus.  In sharks, all of these, including the  conus, are contractile whereas in most bony fishes, the bulbus is  elastic.  The cardiac chamber arrangement in fishes differs from  that of mammals, including man, where there are four chambers (two  atria, two ventricles) arranged in parallel.  This study will  examine atrial and ventricular interactions during the cardiac  cycle in both sharks (hornshark) and teleost (halibut) fishes.   Because of the parallel arrangement of chambers in mammals, study  of chamber interaction is complicated by the actions of the four  separate contractile elements that share a common central heart  wall.  Fishes thus offer the advantage of simpler, in-series  chamber dynamics and this allows quantification of  chamber-interaction effects on the volume and efficiency of the  cardiac pump.  Several other fish-heart features make it an  important model for the mammal heart function and will be  investigated in this study.  Fishes have a spongy inner myocardial  wall, as opposed to the smooth wall of mammals.  Also, sharks  differ from teleosts in having a contractile conus as opposed to an  elastic bulbus.  Finally, sharks lack a sympathetic cardiac  innervation which parallels the condition in cardiac transplant  patients.  ***",
