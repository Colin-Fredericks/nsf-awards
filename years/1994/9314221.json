 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314221  Vaishampayan       We address the issue of combined source and channel coding for  fading channels.  It is well-known that channel coding, together  with interleaving, can be used to achieve an improvement n  diversity order.  However, these codes have traditionally offered  uniform error protection for all bits transmitted.  In reality, for  many sources, some bits from the quantizer are more important than  others.  We show that unequal error protection schemes can offer  greatly improved performance on the fading channel given a fixed  diversity level in the system.  We also provide a method for  designing unequal error protection schemes in order to minimize a  distortion criterion, subject to an overall system diversity level.   Additionally, we note that the interleaving delay required in  interleaved systems is very large compared to the diversity orders  that the code provides.  In speech coding applications the entire  communications system must be designed to meet a delay budget.  The  interleaving delay thus restricts the delay that can be allocated  to the source coder/decoder.  We show that the construction of a  channel code with a constraint on the interleaving delay can be  treated as a problem of designing a code for a restricted number of  independently slow fading channels in which interleaving is not  allowed on any of the slow fading channels.  The diversity order  that the code can achieve is restricted to the number of  independent channels available.  However, the rate of the code is  then restricted to the reciprocal of the diversity order.  In order  to get around this constraint, we use the fact that for continuous  alphabet sources, not every transition probability for the  effective channel as seen by the source coder/decoder need exhibit  the maximum order of diversity.  This allows the rate to the code  to be increased.  We will examine structured techniques for  constructing combined source and channel codes for the Rayleigh  fading channel.  ***",
