The thermal stability of metal films  and small metal structures will also be investigated.  Variable  temperature (4.0-540K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) will be  used to study the evolution of structures on the surface of noble  metals.  These structures will include those that are naturally  occuring in polycrystalline films as well as lithographically  fabricated structures in single-crystal samples.  The effect of  growth conditions on the critical length csale at which the film  morphology changes from a compact island structure to percolation  will be probed using electron microscopy.  In a related study, a  novel submicron resistance probe, called electron beam resistance  imaging, will be used in combination with atomic force microscopy  (AFM) to identify and characterize the initiation sites of  electrical failure in submicron metal lines.    Non-technical abstract:  Any metal surface which is not flat is in  a non-equilibrium state and will attempt to relax toward flatness.   The mechanism of this relaxation is often surface diffusion of  atoms.  This process can affect the lifetime of computer chips or  any other lithographically fabricated metal structure.  Scanning  tunneling microscopy and scanning electron microscopy will be used  to study surface diffusion of atoms on metals and the consequent  evolution of the structure of metal films and small metal  structures.  Relevant questions to be asked in this context are:   How does a corrugated metal surface decay?  How does the decay time  depend on the size of the corrugations?  How thick should a metal  film be do that it has no holes?   Will holes develop in such a  film when it is heated?  ***",
