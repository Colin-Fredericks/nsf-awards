 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407735  Molian   The award is for research to a model for the reactive gas-assisted laser cutting of thick metals, which is based on solving the fundamental equations of mass, energy, and momentum, in both the molten film and gas regions.  Experiments are proposed for verification as well as reevaluation of the proposed model.  The erosion front is treated as a free surface and is allowed to assume its profile depending on the momentum transfer from the gas jet.  Combustion phenomena in the molten film are modeled using first order reaction kinetics.  The approach is expected to yield a satisfactory representation of the coupling between various physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and combustion.   The research is expected to result in improved understanding of the laser cutting process and development of more efficient cutting procedures.  Given the increasing availability of more powerful lasers for manufacturing applications, the improved understanding achieved here would enable better utilization of these advances in material processing capability.",
