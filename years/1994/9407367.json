This research seeks to understand  the relationship between muscle form and function and how  this can change with time. The PI will study a group of  muscles in the thigh of birds called the deep dorsal thigh  muscles. During embryonic development, a mass of cells  breaks up, or cleaves, to form the individual muscles  present in adults. Some birds, such as the chicken or  guineafowl, have four separate deep dorsal thigh muscles.  However, in other birds, the deep dorsal  muscle mass may  not cleave completely, yielding less than four adult  muscles. For example, the pigeon and the duck only have  three deep dorsals, while a roadrunner has only two. The PI  is interested in knowing what effect this variation in  number and position has on the function of these muscles.  Using fine wires as electrodes, the PI will record  electrical changes that reveal when a muscle is contracting.  Previous studies have shown that as a guineafowl walks or  runs, deep dorsal thigh muscles are active at different  times in the stride. When will the deep dorsals be active in  birds with fewer than four muscles? Do new muscles evolve to  perform new functions or movements? How does the nervous  system change when muscle anatomy changes? Through questions  such as these, the PI hopes to gain a better understanding  of animal design and the evolution of vertebrate diversity.  ***",
