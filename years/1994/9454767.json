 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454767  Sadler    We are proposing to network together several remote telescopes and  to test the feasibility of their use by students from grades 4-12.   We will design and test specialized software that will allow  students to work with each other and to collaborate with  astronomers on research projects.  Remote control of telescopes has  the potential to transform conventional science classes and to  serve students with physical disabilities.  Such a network will  allow students, even in communities that are resource poor, access to  powerful tools that will increase their educational opportunities.   This project will examine the problems inherent in using remote  instruments and test solutions which will improve ease-of-use and  accessibility to a wide audience.    This project will provide a model to be followed in placing other  remote scientific instruments on the Internet for educational  purposes.  It could prove a catalyst in encouraging the  collaboration of scientists and pre-college students in research  projects.  It could also result in the discovery of new asteroids,  comets, and variable stars by our nation's youth.",
