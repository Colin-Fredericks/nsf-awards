His Indian collaborator is  Dr. Priya Davidar of Pondicherry University.  A  graduate student from U.C.S.D., Mr. Madhusudan  Katti, will assist in the field work.  The  research aim is the study of the factors that  limit population sizes of migratory bird  species.  Conditions during the breeding season  and during the non-breeding season have been  implicated.  The planned field work is to study  the wintering warblers in south India, with  special focus on a single group of warblers  (genus Phylloscopus), which are abundant and  easy to study in winter, and which form a  single tightly knit ecological guild.  The  research will include identification of birds  returning, and the territories they return to,  the strategies of feeding and the territorial  behavior of both sexes in different  psychological conditions including the effect  of the breeding season.  It is expected that  this work would help develop a broader picture  of wintering populations in Asia, and allow  comparisons with studies on other continents.   The study will help fill a gap in what is known  about the morphology-ecology associations in  warblers in the non-breeding season.    Scope:  The project provides support to do  field research for a U.S. scientist, working  with a graduate student, and in collaboration  with an Indian scientist.  India has unique  resources and facilities in the project area,  of biodiversity.  The project fits well with  INT's objectives.   ***",
