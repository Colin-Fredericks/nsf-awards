Escobar, Direccion General  de Aguas, Chile.  The goal of the research is to understand  the linkages between the processes controlling snow  accumulation and melt in alpine catchments of the Chilean  Andes.  This understanding is critical to developing a  predictive ability to describe the response of a basin to  inputs of water and energy, and to changes in this input.   A spatially distributed energy-`alance model of snowmelt  runoff will be developed and will be evaluated for its  forecasting capabilities and its sensitivity to parameters  and data errors.        Seasonally snow-covered areas of the Earth's mountain  ranges are important components of the global hydrologic  cycle and are sensitive indicators of climatic change.   Snowmelt runoff in these areas accounts for the major  source of the runoff for stream flow and ground-water  recharge over wide areas of the mid-latitudes.  It is  therefore important to understand the processes  controlling this runoff in order to model stream flow for  water supply and flood prediction purposes.  A long-term  result of this project will be the firm establishment of  cooperation between the two research teams and the  incorporation of Andean basins to system of study sites  located around the globe.    ***",
