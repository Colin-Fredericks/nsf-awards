 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354742  Pifer  One of the most critical shortfalls nationwide in science  education today is our failure to impart scientific literacy to  the non-science student.  Watered-down survey courses may teach  some basic scientific facts and jargon, but they rarely give  students the critical skills necessary to function effectively  in a technological society.  We propose to develop an  interdisciplinary course that studies a complex, multifaceted  problem, the Greenhouse Effect, from many points of view--  scientific, economic, political--as a way of building  scientific literacy in these students.  The course will treat  the scientific background of the Greenhouse Effect, its impact  on the earth and human society, and ways to minimize the impact  with an emphasis on alternative energy sources including a  detailed case study of nuclear energy.  Formal lectures will be  avoided.  Students will be given short lecture presentations,  but for the most part will be engaged in discourse among  themselves in which they will ask questions of the instructors  and with faculty experts on the meaning and implications of the  presentations and of readings.  A series of laboratory  exercises is designed to illustrate the physical principles  involved in the Greenhouse Effect.  The course will culminate  with written reports and oral group presentations on case  studies carried out by the groups on non-nuclear alternative  fuels from a scientifically informed point of view.",
