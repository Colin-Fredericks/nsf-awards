Although allorecognition was once thought to be the hallmark  of the vertebrate immune system, it is now clear that  virtually all encrusting clonal organisms possess  allorecognition systems whose specificity rivals that of the  vertebrate immune system.  A growing body of evidence  supports the conclusion that allorecognition specificity in  clonal organisms is genetically based, and that relatively  few loci control the expression of this specificity.  Consequently, the loci that confer allorecognition  specificity must carry levels of genetic variation that  greatly exceed levels characteristic of other polymorphic  loci.  The major goal of this proposal is to analyze -- from  both a genetical and ecological  perspective --  how such  extraordinarily high levels of genetic variation are  evolutionarily maintained.         Three types of hyporthesis have been advanced to  explain the evolution of allorecognition specificity.  The  first, that the genetic variation is functionally  unimportant, is not a viable explanation, given what is  known about mutation rates, population sizes, and patterns  of nucleotide substitution at allorecognition loci.  The  second two hypotheses invoke natural selection; they differ  with respect to whether selection acts directly to regulate  the outcomes of tissue interactions,  or whether selection  acts indirectly via a correlated effect of allorecognition,  such as the control of mating preferences.  In contrast to  vertebrates, in which sustained tissue interactions are  rare,  such encounters occur frequently among clonial  invertebrates as they compete with conspecies for habitable  space.  Allorecognition systems mediate the nature and  outcomes of such interactions by dictating whether they will  lead to intergenotypic fusion, rejection, or aggression.         Quantitative models confirm that allorecognition  specificity can  evolve, through its effects on the outcomes  of competitive interactions.  The key determinants of how  strongly selection promotes the accumulation of specificity  include the costs and benefits of fusion, rejections, and  rejection,and the frequencies with which compatible (i.e.  fusible) and incompatible (i.e. rejecting or aggressive)  genotypes interact.  This project will evaluate how  allorecognition specificity evolves by estimating these  costs, benefits, and  interaction frequencies in two species  of  encrusting, clonal invertebrate.  In one species the  colonial sea squirt Botryllus schlosseri, allorecognition  systems control whether conspecific encounters lead to  fusion or rejection.  In the other species, the cnidarian  Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, the alternative outcomes of  conspecific encounters are fusion versus aggression.  It  will also evaluate the merits of one widely invoked  pleiotropic mechanism by which allorecognition specificity  could also be maintained, namely the control of gametic  interations.  By comparing how allotypic diversity evolves  in both species, this research will build a foundation for  understanding how and why individuals of nearly every  species can distinguish self from nonself.",
