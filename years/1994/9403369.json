 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403369  Bolden      This award is under the International Junior Investigator  and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Daphne A. Bolden to work with Dr. Marina  Bentivoglio at the University of Verona's Institutes of  Human Anatomy and Histology.    This research proposes to test the hypothesis that an  interaction exists between the sympathetic and sensory  division of the peripheral nervous systems.  An  understanding of such an interaction would provide insights  into disorders of the autonomic nervous system in which  degeneration is specific to one population of neurons, yet  consequences are seen in both divisions.  The proposed  studies are designed to examine this interaction by  employing a model of sympathetic neuronal degeneration.  ***",
