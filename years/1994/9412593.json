 "awd_abstract_narration": "Retinal ganglion cells connect the nerve cells that process  information in the eye with the visual centers of the brain.  In  the vertebrate retina, most retinal ganglion cells respond to light  with either an increase in activity (ON-cells) or a decrease in  activity (OFF-cells).  In the mature retina, two features  characterize the organization of the ON and OFF ganglion cells.   First, the processes of ON and OFF cells ramify at different levels  in the retina, and second, ON and OFF cells are distributed across  the retina in regular mosaic patterns.  The studies performed in  this research program are directed at understanding the events  underlying the formation of ON and OFF retinal pathways.  Neuronal  activity is known to play a role in the establishment and  refinement of neural connections in a number of systems.  In these  investigations a series of experiments will be undertaken that are  designed to assess the contribution of afferent input to  stratification of dendritic arbors in the inner plexiform layer of  the retina, and the role that axonal interactions at target nuclei  play in programmed cell death and in defining dendritic territories  in the retina.  Precise and appropriate patterns of connections are  necessary for the normal function of the nervous system.  These  studies will contribute in a fundamental way to our understanding  of the strategies used in the development of these connections.",
