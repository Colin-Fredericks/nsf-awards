 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310561  Rynasiewicz  Recent work in the philosophy of space and time has increasingly  focused on the comparison of physical theories in coordinate-free  formulations.  Such formulations have been given for a variety of  non-relativistic theories as well as for the usual array of  relativistic theories.  Nonetheless, certain doubts have been  expressed that there is a consistent coordinate-free formulation of  non-relativistic electrodynamics in which absolute space plays a  coherent and indispensable role.  The absence of such a formulation  is a significant lacuna since, historically, electrodynamics  precipitated the transition to relativity physics.  Dr.  Rynasiewicz' goal in this research is to fill this lacuna by  providing a coordinate-free formulation of the Maxwell-Lorentz  theory in Newtonian spacetime.   In doing this, he will provide  researchers with a new vantage point from which to address a number  of issues in the history and philosophy of physics.  One of these  is a rigorous assessment of the similarities and differences  between the theoretical strategies of Einstein and his predecessors  and contemporaries with respect to the optics and electrodynamics  of moving bodies.  Another is the significance of the absolute-  relational controversy concerning the nature of space and time in  this critical episode in the history of physics.  These results are  of interest to philosophers, historians and physicists alike.  ***",
