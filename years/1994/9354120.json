SUBR's quantified objectives include (a) the yearly production of  400 and 640, natural science, mathematics, and engineering (NSEM)  and SEM graduates respectively, by 1998; (b) a measurable  enhancement of the quality of SEM programs, infrastructure, and  specially of SEM graduates; and (c) the guiding of at least 200  of its SEM graduates to the successful pursuit of SEM graduate  degrees, with emphasis on the Ph.D. These outcome-objectives will  be attained through process-objectives consisting of involving  and getting input and support from partners that include the  National Science Foundation, State and federal governments,  private industry, and the precollege and Ph.D. program  communities. These objectives are direct corollaries of the  mission of Southern University and A&M College. This mission  comprises quality instruction, research and development, and  public and professional service.    The development of the detailed strategic plan will address the  following: (1) reassertion of the objectives; (2) the development  of premises to include the reassessment of internal and external  factors and trends; (3) the decisions or the selection of  strategies; (4) the details of the implementation, with time  table and measures of success; and (5) the monitoring,  evaluation, and related adjustments and updating. Existing plans,  reports, and the content of the literature will constitute key  instruments.",
