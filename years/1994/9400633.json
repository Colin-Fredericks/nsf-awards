 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400633  Reinhold  This  program will address the growing interest in carbohydrate function into one administrative  mechanism to address the needs of structure.  The collaborating groups have defined functional roles  for carbohydrate samples that fall into four research areas: (1) plant oligosaccharides involved in  nitrogen fixation and signal transduction; (2 microbial cell attachment and/or cell activation: (3)  carbohydrate and protein anchors: glycolipids and GPI-anchors; and, (4) N-and O-linked  glycoproteins.  This Group project consolidates cross-disciplinary problems in carbohydrate structure  and involves personnel with analytical expertise and dedicated instrumentation for a comprehensive  approach to function.   %%%  Contemporary biology is placing greater attention on factors that relate to the interplay of cells with  their environment.  Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, plant defense mechanisms, immune surveillance,  angiogenesis, cellular differentiation and adhesion are events associated with multi-cellular systems.  Here, cell-cell interactions, the integrated development and differentiation so characteristic of living  tissues, is manifested within an extracellular matrix which depends  on membranes, tissue surfaces and  the ordered transport of signals by and through these barriers.  Close examination of this complex  cellular milieu reveals that they are resplendent with a vast array of glycosylated molecules.  The need  to know the detailed structural features of these molecules is compelling.  An  understanding of  compound class or component composition has little meaning when one is trying to unravel the  biochemistry of cellular events or to mimic, stimulate or retard these processes.  This glycosylation is  fundamental to the proper function of multi-cellular organisms and consistent with physiological  demands for greater biological specificity. This Group consolidates cross disciplinary problems in  carbohydrate structure and involves personnel with analytical expertise  and dedicated instrumentation  for a comprehensive approach to function.  ***",
