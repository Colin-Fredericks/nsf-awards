 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mary Lee Ledbetter's previous work has used simple assays to  measure the ability of cultured fibroblastic or epithelial cells to  share small cytoplasmic molecules through gap junctions.  This  cooperation can be inhibited by treatment of the cells with the  sodium-pump inhibitor ouabain.  When kidney-derived epithelial  cells are treated with the steroid hormone aldosterone, their  ouabain inhibition is reduced.  Recent work has suggested that  calcium changes mediate the effects of ouabain and that  aldosterone's action may involve an unusual mechanism independent  of the cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor.    Tests will be carried out to determine whether ouabain and  aldosterone also modify the expression an/or distribution of  connexins, the gap junction protein, in cooperating cells.   Experimental approaches include:  connexin protein localization by  immunofluorescent staining in intact cells; expression of connexin  - specific RNA and protein and protein electrophoretic mobility in  cell extracts; and rapid changes in functional communication,  measured by dye injection.  These studies will not only provide a  more complete basis for understanding the interaction between  ouabain, aldosterone and cell communication, they will also provide  improved tools to study structure-function relationships in gap  junction communication for future work.    Interactive activities include participation in the core course for  first-year graduate students at The Scripps Research Institute.   This involves leading discussion sections, designing and  implementing laboratory experiences, and offering occasional  lectures in the course.",
