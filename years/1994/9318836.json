 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powell  9318836       Flies of the genus Drosophila play a crucial role in all  biological research from the most basic molecular biology through  to ecology.  On the order of 2400 species of this genus are known.   While Drosophila have been intensively studied for all kinds of  biological processes such as genetics, development and some aspects  of evolution, little attention has been paid to the phylogenetic  relationships of the many species.  A good reason for this is that  these small flies have relatively few good characters with which  such a large group could easily be placed into phylogenies using  traditional methods.  Recent advances in molecular biology now make  it reasonably routine to collect DNA sequence data on many species  of Drosophila.  The present proposal is to gather DNA sequence data  for a number of the most studied species of the genus in order to  clarify their phylogenetic relationships.  Once phylogenies are  available, one can map onto them various characters, e.g.  behaviors, morphologies, etc, to gain an insight into the evolution  of these characters.  But to do so, one needs reliable  relationships determined by an independent data set, i.e. DNA  sequences.  In addition, because Drosophila is so well studied from  so many viewpoints, these studies will contribute to our  understanding of basic molecular evolution mechanisms such as the  relative rates of change of different types of DNA, the pattern of  change in repeated DNA's compared to unique sequences, etc.  So in  addition to shedding light on the phylogenetic relationships in the  genus, we will gain insight into basic processes.",
