 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout the United States, non-point sources of water pollution  are responsible for contamination of more miles of stream than any  other source, and also contribute substantially to groundwater  degradation.  Non-point sources of water pollution include  municipalities, industries, agriculture, mine drainage, energy  production and recreation.    This training program, which is supported by a strong and  successful interdisciplinary research team, combines water quantity  and water quality analysis with control and remediation of non-  point source water pollution.  Emphasis will be on expanding basic  scientific knowledge with applications to identification and  quantification of non-point sources of water pollution and  selection of the most suitable alternative for mitigation of a  particular problem.  There is capacity for the program, which is   expected to expand.    Innovative structural components in the training program include:         1.  A consortial arrangement between Colorado State University            and the University of Wyoming (EPSCoR University).         2.  An interdisciplinary effort between Watershed Sciences,            Civil Engineering, Range Science, and Agronomy (water            chemistry).         3.  An active recruiting program for women, minorities            including Native Americans, and those with disabilities.         4.  Implementation of a \"project management\" approach to            improve communications among participants and improve            trainee retention.",
