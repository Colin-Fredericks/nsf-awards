 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322797  Grosholz  Introduced or exotic species represent a serious threat to the integrity and sustainability of natural ecosystems.  The rate and extent of species introductions in natural habitats has been increasing over time, with the potential to profoundly change community structure on a large scale.  Our knowledge of the impact of introduced species in marine ecosystems is particularly poor, and thus our ability to predict the affects and assess the risks are extremely limited.  Our goal is this project is to investigate the introduction of the predatory green crab, Carcinus maenas, into embayments along the coast of California.  Within the last year, C. maenas has been observed for the first time on the reserve of the University of California Bodega Marine Laboratory, where extensive data have been collected for ten years prior to the introduction on the population dynamics of many species of invertebrates, and the shorebirds which feed on them.  We plan to use these data collected before the introduction to quantify whether this predator can significantly reduce the abundance of its invertebrate prey, and whether its impact could have a cascading effect on the large wintering shorebird populations that depends on these invertebrates for food.  Our data from previous natural perturbation of this system provides evidence that reductions in invertebrate abundance manifest themselves as reductions at this higher tropic level.  In this proposal, we will rigorously monitor changes in the abundance of targeted taxa, and simultaneously conduct a series of experiments to elucidate the mechanisms by which predatory crabs might impact the native fauna.  These experiments will involve short and long term manipulations to document both the immediate response of the benthic invertebrate communities to green crab predation, as well longer-term response to this perturbation.  These data will allow us to assess the broad consequences o a novel alien predator in a nearshore marine habitat, and allow us  to more accurately predict  the potential impact of future introductions.  This will be important in determining not only the risk posed by future introductions, but how much of  our resources should be devoted to reducing the rate at which new introductions occur.",
