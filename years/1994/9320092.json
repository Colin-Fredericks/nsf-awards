 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320092  Welch  This is an award to support research on the role of invertebrates  in controlling the proliferation of filamentous nuisance algae in  rubble-bed, natural streams that receive nutrients from point and  nonpoint sources.  Experimental work is planned using laboratory  channels and at three sites in nutrient-enriched, natural  streams.  The laboratory channels will be used to determine the  effectiveness of grazing over a range in grazer sizes and their  abundance and the extent to which enrichment level affects grazer  effectiveness.  Grazing rates will be used to modify an existing  model that can be used to predict the expected maximum periphyton  biomass concentration as a function of reactive phosphorus  concentration using assumptions of available light, temperature  and current velocity in the receiving stream.    The results of this project are expected to provide knowledge  that can be applied in determination of the extent to which  nutrient removal is necessary to meet acceptable conditions for  discharge of effluents from domestic and industrial wastewater  treatment plants into flowing streams and addressing the  development of nuisance conditions in streams resulting from  nonpoint sources of nutrients.  The results of this research may  be applied in location of treatment plants, approaches to dealing  with nonpoint sources of nutrients and in the engineering design  of systems for dealing with the flow of nutrients into natural  streams.  ***",
