 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403454  Sumners         The investigator and colleagues develop topological methods  to describe  and compute the spatial configuration of macromolecules, and  changes in  configuration due to chemical and biological agents.  These  issues arise in  the analysis of experimental data in molecular biology and  synthetic  polymer chemistry.  The applications include model building and  theoretical  proofs of the structure and mechanism of enzymes that act on DNA,  the  quantization of topological entanglement of molecules in random  polymer  systems, the development of algorithms for the numerical  computation and  simulation of macromolecular structure, and the implementation of  these  algorithms to create mathematical data that one can compare with  experimental data.  In the topological approach to enzymology,  enzymes  vital in cellular metabolism are reacted with circular DNA  substrate.  A  topological enzyme signature is observed in the family of DNA  knots and  links produced by the reaction.  One long-range goal of this  research is  the development of a complete set of experimentally observable  topological  parameters with which to describe and compute enzyme mechanism  and the  structure of the active enzyme-DNA synaptic intermediate,  allowing  mathematical proof of 3-dimensional enzyme-DNA structure, and the  ability  to predict results of future experiments.  Many recent advances  in  3-dimensional geometry and topology (such as the Cyclic Surgery  Theorem)  are useful in the analysis of data from these topological  enzymology  experiments.       The results of this basic research project have potential  utility in  biotechnology, rational drug design and the design and  manufacture of  synthetic polymers.  Before one can harness the manufacturing  power of  bacterial cells, one must first understand what these cells are  capable of,  and then how to control these processes.  In order to combat  viruses in  human disease, and to exploit the ability of viruses to control  cellular   processes, one must understand at a fundamental level what  viruses are  doing.  An integral part of this understanding process is the  study of the  spatial configuration of large flexible molecules.  For example,  the  3-dimensional shape of cellular DNA, RNA and proteins is  crucially  important to their biological function.  Cellular DNA is highly  twisted and  convoluted, and for information retrieval and cell viability,  some  geometric and topological features must be introduced, and others  quickly  removed.  Some enzymes maintain the proper geometry and topology  of DNA in  the cell by passing one strand of DNA through another via an  enzyme-bridged  transient break in the DNA; this enzyme action plays a crucial  role in cell  metabolism, including segregation of daughter chromosomes at the  termination of replication.  Other enzymes break the DNA apart  and  recombine the ends by exchanging them.  These enzymes regulate  the  expression of specific genes, mediate viral integration into and  excision  from the host genome, mediate transposition and repair of DNA,  and  generate antibody and genetic diversity.  These enzymes perform  incredible  feats of topology at the molecular level; the description and  quantization  of such enzyme action absolutely requires the language and  computational  machinery of topology.",
