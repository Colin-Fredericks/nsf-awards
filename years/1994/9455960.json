Building on modern research on student learning, opportunities created by  our university's reform of its liberal education curriculum, and a new determination to reach out  to other disciplines, the university proposes to create nine cross-disciplinary teams. Each will  be charged with developing and team teaching an undergraduate mathematics course, or  modifying an existing course by the creation of modules or special units. These courses would  develop a mathematical theme through problems from the discipline of the \"outside\" members  of the team, from the other sciences, engineering, economics or business. Curricula and teaching  styles in these courses will be influenced by exposure of the teams to \"hands-on\" experiences,  the use of small group work, and problem oriented learning.",
