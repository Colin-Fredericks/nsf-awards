 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451870  Cartwright  The use of modeling for the description of physical, natural and  societal systems is already well established. The increasing power  of computers has allowed the \"sophistication\" of these models to  change such that students can now perform calculations on models of  a complexity not possible for students of a generation ago. These  changes have made it increasingly important that students learn to  assess the assumptions, validity and value of the models they use  and it is important that the content and approach to current  teaching reflects these changes. Furthermore the confidence to  challenge and examine modeling assumptions and an awareness of the  relationship between the model and the real system needs to be  developed during the student's formative years at university. A new  course \"Exploring Engineering (EG100)\", given to all freshman  engineers in their first semester, and which is open to students in  the college of Arts and Sciences, provides a unique opportunity to  do this for large number of students. This can be further developed  in the second semester in \"Engineering Mechanics I (EG220)\". To do  this effectively with freshman level students requires a different  approach to that used in the traditional laboratory or classroom  situation. The advent of fast accurate personal computers  supporting engineering analysis software enables this different  approach. This project will develop an Integrated, Interactive  Learning Laboratory (IILL) using a Macintosh platform running the  LabView and Working Model software. This combination will be  central to the IILL and will provide for a simple, adaptable and  self-paced approach suited to a variety of learning styles.  Integration of the model system and the real system will be  achieved by having students use either LabView or Working Model to  carry out \"what if\" experiments on the model, to gain understanding  of, and assess, modeling assumptions, and then have them make  experimental measurements for immed iate comparison with the model.  The purpose of this will be to provide students with the  opportunity to examine, simultaneously, the important connections  and differences between real systems and the models that are made  of these systems.",
