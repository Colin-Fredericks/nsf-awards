 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last five years, an increasing number of  botanical collections have begun to develop specimen  databases within their institutions.  This activity was  fostered by a workshop held at the National Science  Foundation in 1989 to discuss trends and priorities in the  construction of botanical specimen databases.    In 1993, the MITRE Consortium released its report on the  information management needs of free-standing museums of  natural history museums and botanical gardens.  Also in  1993, the Department of Energy held a workshop to discuss  the development of community databases within the molecular  biological community and botanists representing various  institutions that wished to serve as regional centers for a  national botanical specimen database for North America  discussed a framework for such a project.    With these and many other projects planned or partly  underway, it is important that these projects are designed  to enhance interoperability in a distributed networked  environment.  This proposal requests funds to bring 30  botanist, other biologists, and information technologist to  discuss issues affecting the design of an interoperable  federation of botanical specimen databases.    The result of the workshop will be a report for general  distribution over the network as well as to the National  Science Foundation that will outline the infrastructure and  database design considerations that will guide development  projects in the selection or design of systems that enhance  interoperability.",
