 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406220  Coffey  The problem of efficient real-time retrieval of information from  large-scale databases is emerging as an important current  application.  This research will use a wide range of techniques  derived from information theory to explore  the fundamental limits  of such retrieval systems.  Many existing information theory  research topics are directly related to the database problem, and  the application in turn generates many novel fundamental problems  in information theory.  The basic underlying problem of  context-dependent requests for information -- from a database whose  physical structure does not match the user-perceived structure of  the data -- is modeled as a novel type of random walk problem, in  which one random walk (by the user over the data) drives a designed  random walk by the system through the database.  Results are  derived which demonstrate that access time can be greatly improved  in straightforward ways by adding redundancy.  Potential extensions  to systems in which highly compressible data is stored in databases  with arbitrary structure, with more general forms of redundancy,  are discussed.  The theoretical results developed in this research  will provide insight into the design of information retrieval  systems appropriate for a variety of scientific applications.    These theoretical results , however, can only provide first-order  guidance in system design.  Further guidance can be found by  comparisons between the results derived from somewhat abstract  models and those arrived at through more detailed simulation of  systems.  This research will investigate the applicability and  robustness of the results of this researah and those of others to  system design through system simulation.  Actual datasets and  realistic workloads can be used to validate the models and assess  the applicability of the results to actual systems.  ***",
