Use of an expert system  enables the students to conduct more of  their own troubleshooting. Students do not have to wait for  assistance. They are able to query the expert system and receive  guidance as the need arises, even during non-laboratory hours. The  result is an increased opportunity for student/faculty discussions  of more advanced concepts and methods of system design and  development.  Usually, the laboratory instructor  spends most of  the laboratory period with just one or two of the lab groups  assisting them with troubleshooting tasks. The expert system   allows the professor to service more of the students during the lab  period because it  copes with the routine tasks. The expert system   continues to \"learn\" symptoms and solutions, always providing  complete \"recall\" of troubleshooting suggestions, even for new  faculty and laboratory teaching assistants who  teach the course  for the first time.  Innovative use is made of computers and an  expert system to assist electrical and computer engineering faculty  by providing certain of the routine functions encountered in the  microprocessor-based systems design laboratory. This application of  expert systems to engineering education will be carefully evaluated  to confirm its value as a \"teaching assistant\".",
