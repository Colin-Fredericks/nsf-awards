 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is in the general area of bioanalytical chemistry.  The activity, which   has as its primary thrust infrastructure development, provides support   for four faculty from undergraduate institutions to enable their   participation in research activities at the University of Kansas during   ten-week summer periods.  In addition, three faculty who have been   supported during previous summers will return to Kansas for two weeks to   update their research.   It is designed as an aggregated NSF Research   Opportunity Award (ROA) and has become known in the chemistry community   as a Macro-ROA.  By providing faculty from regional undergraduate   institutions with such research opportunities, this program serves not   only to maintain or rejuvenate their interest in research pursuits, but   also to update them regarding modern bioanalytical chemistry in a   collegial setting.    The focus of this project is the support of seven faculty from   undergraduate institutions for research and training in bioanalytical   chemistry.  Experiences garnered by participants in this program are   passed on to their students in their respective institutions.  This   infrastructure investment serves to maintain topical currency on the part   of the participants and to indirectly promote the development of their   student's interest in careers in chemistry.",
