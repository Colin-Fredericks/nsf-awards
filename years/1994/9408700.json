 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  Three-dimensional data taken from complex scenes place  strong demands on the robustness and generality of visible  surface reconstruction techniques.  In this research a complete  reconstruction algorithm will be developed that distinguishes  between surfaces, space curves, and clouds of points based on  asymmetries in point distributions in expanding three-dimensional  image neighborhoods.  The properties of this algorithm will be  studied analytically and confirmed experimentally on both  synthetic data and range data acquired from a variety of sensors.   The software will be made available to other researchers for  further testing.  The goal is to understand fully both the  strengths and weaknesses of the technique.  This will provide a  solid basis for future research and will make it easy to evaluate  the technique's usefulness for specific applications.  Potential  applications range from robotic navigation to reverse  engineering.",
