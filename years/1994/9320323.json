The network consists of two SUN workstations, three 486 PC's, and one Macintosh microcomputer, each relevant to some aspect of the existing research projects, and each running appropriate software.    (1) Applications of Fuzzy Logic Control and Neural Networks to Intelligent Manufacturing Processes: The aim of this project is to find possible applications of fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms into the area of manufacturing engineering.  The project focuses on the intelligent control system of screen printers in surface mount technology (SMT).    (2) Possibilistic Transformation of Probability: Uncertainty invariant transformations between probability and possibility are a topic which opens up a new research area in uncertainty-based information theory.  Much of this research is being conducted in the form of building mathematical computer models which calculate the relative information content of transformation from probabilities to possibilities and vice versa.    (3) Chaotic Systems: This research is motivated by current developments in the area of chaotic dynamical systems.  Several unsolved problems stem from a consideration of two aspects of chaotic systems: how can chaotic systems be defined in abstract, topological or measure spaces and what is the relationship of those generalized to \"conventional\" approaches?  These can be explored using the computational resources acquired by this award.    (4) Symbolic Mathematics: The research here is t o apply the current trends in symbolic and computational mathematics to complex engineering problems.  Specifically, the following three problem areas will be investigated: rational approximations using Fourier Series partial sums, a multiple scales approach to sound generation by vibrating bodies, and analysis of various new perturbation techniques.    (5) Bibliographic Database Management System: This is a project to compile and manage a very large research database of bibliographic materials used in approximate reasoning research.  With the help of this equipment, it is possible to support and expedite the research and publishing activities.  ***                       @ j   i   SSMARQUESCR           @ j    B  SSMYST  SCR           @ j    L  SSSTARS SCR           @ j    D  TADA    WAV           @ j &  l  TARTAN  BMP           @ j 4 v   TERMINALEXE           @ j E  B  TERMINALHLP           @ j       9320323  Klir     This grant provides support for the establishment of a small, research-dedicated computer network serving seve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        T   V                   P   R   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $         $         $              G                                                                                  Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                   d  ed  e                        =    Klir/SUNY Binghamton    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
