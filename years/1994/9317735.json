 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peterson  9317735      Vent communities are populated largely by endemic species  that are restricted to an ephemeral environment where  life-  sustaining vent fluids may persist for periods as short as  decades.  It is known that physiological adaptations of some  vent species play a role in dictating their distributions,  but the roles that recruitment, competition and  predation/biological  disturbance play during vent  colonization remain largely explored.  This study will  conduct a set of in  situ manipulative experiments  to  test  the roles of these processes in creating patterns of  distribution of vents invertebrates.  Basaltic settlement  plates will be exposed in regions that differ in intensity  of vent fluid flux to manipulate the intensity of  physiological stress and nutrient availability, and  colonization will be followed.  These  studies  will address  fundamental ecological processes in vent communities and  provide a key link between studies of larva dispersal and  population genetics.    ***",
