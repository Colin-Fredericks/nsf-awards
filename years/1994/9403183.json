 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403183  Shimomura    The photoprotein aequorin first isolated by the P.I. in 1962, has  been widely used as an indicator for cellular calcium for more than  25 years.  In the last several years, three improved forms of  aequorin were made available: 1) various iso-forms of aequorin  isolated from natural aequorin, with properties considerably  different from each other; 2) recombinant aequorin prepared from  the apoaequorin genetically produced in E. coli, which can be mass  produced, and 3) more than 30 kinds of semi-synthetic aequorin have  been obtained by replacing the coelenterazine moiety of aequorin  with various synthetic analogues of coelenterazine.  Semi-synthetic  aequorins showed various properties that are highly advantageous in  measuring calcium, including the widely different ranges of  sensitivity to calcium.  Recently, a new trend in the use of  aequorin began.  In the new method, apoaequorin is genetically  produced in cells utilizing aequorin cDNA, then the apoaequorin is  intracellularly regenerated into aequorin by the addition of  coelenterazine and finally the recombinant aequorin produced is  used to study calcium in the cells.  The next objectives of this  research are:  1) Further improvement of semi-synthetic aequorin,  based on the data of various semi-synthetic aequorins that contain  various coelenterazine analogues modified at position 2 of the  imidazopyrazine ring.  2) In the new method that involves the  production of semi-synthetic aequorins in cells, the regeneration  of aequorins from apoaequorin and coelenterazine analogues is a  crucial step that is strongly influenced by the characteristics of  the analogue used.  Thus, the characteristics of all coelenterazine  analogues will be investigated, and the analogues that are suitable  for intracellular aequorin regeneration will be identified.  3)   Various preparations of aequorin, including isoaequorins and semi  synthetic aequorins, will be produced for the purpose of  distribution to cell biologists and p hysiologists for their use in  research.  In addition, coelenterazine analogues suitable for the  intracellular regeneration of aequorins will also be supplied.  4)   On the basis of the recent discovery that some of the  coelenterazine analogues are extremely sensitive and highly  specific to superoxide anion, the measurement and monitoring of  superoxide anion in biological systems with those analogues will be  explored.  %%%  One of the most important components of cellular signal  transduction is the calcium ion.  Levels of intracellular calcium  are closely regulated and changes of calcium are commonly involved  as steps in the cascade of responses to extracellular signals.  The  mechanisms by which cells control internal calcium and how calcium  changes are involved in cellular signaling are major current themes  in cell research.  Much current research in this field has been  made possible by the availability of indicators that measure  intracellular free calcium and determine its location within cells  over the time course of a physiological response.  The subject of  this research is aequorin, a naturally occurring complex of a  protein (apoaequorin) with an associated smaller organic molecule  (coelenterazine).  When one aequorin molecule binds a calcium ion  it gives off a pulse of light.  Aequorin is thus an invaluable tool  for measuring and localizing intracellular calcium.  This  laboratory first isolated aequorin from a marine jellyfish in 1962  and has since, primarily with NSF support, developed a wide range  of important variants of the aequorin molecules for various  applications in cell biology research.  The next goals of this  project are to produce further specialized calcium indicators and,  if possible to develop variants to extend the use of the components  of aequorin to measure another class of important cellular signal  molecules, superoxide anion.  These indicators will be made  available for use in research on a wide range of problems in  biology.  ***",
