 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research in design, analysis,   implementation of efficient algorithms for several basic   computer  algebra  problems.  The parallel time complexity of solving linear    systems with a  minimum number of processors is further investigated.  New   sequential and  parallel randomized algorithms  for sparse linear systems are   explored, and  polynomial-time  algorithms that make irreducible polynomials   factorizable via  substitution of the variables by monomials are sought.      Another research  direction is how to handle  imprecise data in the course of  symbolic computation.  The  allowance of floating point   coefficients in a  symbolic (i.e.,  parameterized model) is considered crucial   for a symbolic  approach to real-world problem solving.  In particular, the    question of  computing in polynomial-time the nearest singular  Toeplitz   matrix for a given  Toeplitz matrix, and the nearest pair  of polynomials with a   common divisor for  a given pair of  relatively prime polynomials, is a starting   point for the  theory of precision-tolerant symbolic computation.    Ultimately,  the problem of  factoring over the complex numbers a minimally  perturbed   version of an  absolutely irreducible curve is  attacked.    Algorithm   implementation is  done using the DSC system for distributing a symbolic    computation over a   network of workstations.",
