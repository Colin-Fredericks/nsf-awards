The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint research, and the use of unique or complementary  facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Leslie L. Hartzell to work with Prof.  Jim Allen, Drs. Richard Cosgrove and Nicola Stern at La  Trobe University in Bundoora, Australia.    This research will examine the long-term record of  Pleistocene Human foraging patterns through the  chronostratigraphic analyses of archaeofaunal remains  excavated from three Pleistocene cave sites in southwest  Tasmania, occupied ca. 30,000-14,000 years ago.  Data on non  cultural and cultural site formation processes affecting  each cave, its geochronologies and patterns of association  between the faunal remains and other categories of  archaeological data will be used to investigate the  structure and time resolution of these assemblages.  Sites  will be compared at similar temporal scales on the basis of  the analyses of their site formation processes, radiocarbon  chronologies and faunal assemblages.    This research has  particular consequences for discussions of Australian  archaeology where the rapidly expanding Pleistocene record  across the continent is forcing researchers to rethink views  of the past as representing a continuity with the  ethnographic present and to direct attention to the more  difficult task of exploring spatio-temporal cultural  variability within long-term archaeological records.  Collaboration with preeminent Australian archaeologists  exploring questions related to the construction of time  scales and explanations of change in the  Pleistocene/Holocene archaeological record will enhance the  interpretive strategies presently being b rought to bear on  the North American record. ***",
