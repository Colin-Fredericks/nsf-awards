 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312467  Ashour-Abdalla  The proposed theoretical investigation is to calculate electron  distributions in the geomagnetic tail to the Earth's magnetosphere  and to evaluate the local and global problem of charge neutrality  between electrons and ions.  Although the dynamics of ions in the  magnetotail has been the subject of extensive theoretical  investigations using single particle orbit calculations, hybrid  simulations, and magnetohydrodynamic fluid simulations, electron  dynamics have been virtually ignored.  Yet, the most fundamental  aspect of a plasma - the establishment and maintenance of charge  neutrality - depends on electron behavior.  Some electrons move at  high speeds and rapidly traverse large volumes of space; the  establishment of local charge neutrality depends on both the global  sources and sinks of electrons and the large scale structure of the  electric and magnetic fields in the tail.  Until now, no scientific  methodology has existed capable of addressing global transport and  calculating the local distributions of electrons in the tail.  In  the proposed large scale kinetics approach, starting from various  source regions, electrons will be allowed to propagate throughout  the entire volume of the magnetotail along trajectories which are  determined using model electromagnetic fields to represent the tail  configuration.  The local electron distribution function will be  calculated by summing the contributions of each trajectory passing  through the local spatial region, and the electron density will be  compared to the local ion density (which is similarly calculated by  the large scale kinetics technique) to determine the extent of  charge neutrality violation.  Parallel electric fields will be  added to the electromagnetic field model, and will be adjusted to  obtain the closet reasonable balance between electron and ion  charge densities.  The potential significance of this proposed is  profound in that, with its success we could for the first time  directly asses s the problem of charge neutrality in a space plasma,  determine the large scale potential electric fields required to  maintain charge neutrality, and establish the extent to which  charge neutrality demands the exchange of electrons between the  tail plasma and the ionosphere.    ***",
