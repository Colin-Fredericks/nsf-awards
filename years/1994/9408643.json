 "awd_abstract_narration": "Klippel    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Walter Klippel and  his colleagues will work to improve the curation of the  zooarchaeological collection at the University of Tennessee.  These materials were acquired over a two decade span and the  collection continues to grow. The 8,000+ skeletons include fish,  reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals. The 1,148 species  represented are weighted heavily towards taxa native to eastern  North America with an emphasis on species most frequently  recovered in regional archaeological sites. Ten represented  species, obtained in the early years of collection development,  have been placed on the Federal Endangered or Threatened Species  lists. While the collection is widely used by archaeologists  curatorial problems both threaten the materials themselves and  impede efficient use. With NSF support, Dr. Klippel and  colleagues will implement a fumigation program to control pest  infestation. Materials will be re-  boxed and stored in new  cabinets. Catalogue information will be entered into a computer  system.    Faunal remains are frequently recovered in archaeological sites  and are extremely important to scientists for a number of  reasons. They permit the reconstruction of past environments and  provide insight into diet. They often allow archaeologists to  reconstruct other aspects of social behavior such as exchange and  population movement. Key to faunal analysis are collections of  known species which serve as standards of comparison. The large  and carefully documented Tennessee collection is widely used for  this purpose and constitutes a valuable archaeological resource.  With NSF support, its utility will increase significantly.",
