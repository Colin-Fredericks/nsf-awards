 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317900  Sharkey  Isoprene is emitted from plants and animals in significant  quantities.  Many plants emit 2% of the carbon fixed in  photosynthesis as isoprene making it a major metabolic pathway in  these plants.  Isoprene emitted from plants substantially affects  atmospheric chemistry.  The metabolic control of isoprene emission  and the advantage to plants and animals which emit isoprene are  unknown.  The regulation of synthesis of many isoprenoids is  affected by hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and it is  speculated that most HMGR activity of isoprene emitting plants is  required for isoprene synthesis.  This project deals with the  regulation of isoprene synthesis, focusing on HMGR and the recently  discovered isoprene synthase.  The location of the HMGR needed for  isoprene synthesis will be determined by chloroplast isolation and  by nonaqueous fractionation of leaf material.  The research will  exploit recent discovery that a wound-induced signal in one leaf  can travel to a second leaf and reduce the rate of isoprene  emission by as much as 80% within 3 minutes.  The activity of HMGR  and isoprene synthase before and after the arrival of this wound  signal will be measured to determine how isoprene synthesis is  regulated.  The research will also exploit the discovery that kudzu  (Pueraria lobata (Willd) Ohwi.) leaves do not emit isoprene when  grown at 20 degree centigrade but can be induced to emit isoprene  by a 6 hour treatment of 30 degree centigrade.  The physiological  role of isoprene emission will be investigated by exploring the  recent evidence of thermal protection for the photosynthetic  apparatus provided by isoprene.  The proposed research is needed to  determine whether it will be possible or desirable to modify  isoprene emission from plants.  Isoprene is an important raw  material for synthetic rubber synthesis.  The current market is one  billion dollars per year.  Because of carcinogenicity of the common  substitute for isoprene, batadiene,  an inexpensive biogenic source  of isoprene could have a large impact on the rubber industry.   Finally, the synthesis of free isoprene is a major metabolic  pathway in plants and animals which has been largely overlooked  until now.  Understanding the physiological relevance of isoprene  emission may lead to important and useful insights which cannot yet  be predicted.  ***",
