 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Research Series, begun by AGU in 1963 with the  aid of a grant from the National Science Foundation,  publishes the results of all aspects of Antarctic research.  Volumes have provided extensive and authoritative reports of  research results in marine and terrestrial biology, marine  geology and geophysics, solid Earth geophysics,  geochemistry, oceanic and atmospheric studies, glaciology,  and geology and paleontology.  These volumes are designed to  serve working scientists, students, and laymen interested in  biological or physical research endeavors in Antarctica and  on the occasion, the lay public interest in the Antarctic  environment.  The primary purpose is to provide an effective  and authoritative outlet for research conducted in  Antarctica.  Much of the research is conducted under the  U.S. Antarctic Program.  Thematic volumes are devoted to a  single topic or occasionally a particular geographic area.  In soliciting, reviewing, and selecting papers for  publication, particular attention is paid to ensuring the  quality of the series.  To date, over 15,000 pages have been  published in 62 volumes and a special collection of papers  in Reviews of Geophysics.  An additional ~ 1000 pages are in  press.  The series is recognized the scientific and library  communities, who look to it to provide continuing access to  south polar results.  The AGU Board of Associates Editors  for the Antarctic Research Series has expanded the modes of  publication and continues to monitor the needs of the  research community.  The Board also recognizes NSF's growing  desire to disseminate results from Antarctic research to the  educated public and has agreed to investigate the  possibility of publishing a volume that describes the  Antarctic environment, integrates the various dynamic  systems, and assesses interactions and influences on the  global environment.",
