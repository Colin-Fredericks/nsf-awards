 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404265  Ablowitz      This project involves the study of solutions to a class of  physically significant nonlinear wave equations. New reductions  of the self dual Yang-Mills system will be considered. The self  dual equations have been shown to be a master integrable system  from which virtually all known soliton equations are contained as  special cases. Novel classes of solutions will be studied  including those recently found which can be expressed in terms of  classical automorphic functions whose solution structure possess  complex singularities which are natural boundaries in the complex  plane. Nonlinear integrable systems will be used in computational  simulations in order to establish the existence of and to  analytically understand the phenomena of numerical chaos. New  solutions to physically important forced nonlinear wave equations  will be developed.   Many of the nonlinear equations we are  studying are universally important asymptotic approximations in  physical phenomena. Applications include nonlinear optical wave  propagation, internal and surface waves in fluid dynamics,  lattice dynamics, and relativity. The use of solitons in the  technological application of long distance communication has been  widely noted. In this research project, multisoliton solutions  and their interaction properties will be analyzed in order to  significantly improve the effectiveness of soliton based  communication systems. This is usually referred to as wave length  division multiplexing (WDM) in optical communications. One of the  forced nonlinear wave systems which will be studied involves  moving pressure distributions in surface waves, such as ships  moving at critical speeds.",
