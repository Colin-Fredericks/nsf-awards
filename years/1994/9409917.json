 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to empirically analyze the  effects of incomplete information concerning people's HIV status  on their sexual behavior and the spread of the AIDS.  The study  will utilize data from the San Francisco Home Health Study and  will obtain three sets of estimates to address three different  objectives.  First, the fraction of individuals engaging in  potentially disease transmitting circumstances will be assessed.   Second, estimates will be obtained of both the extent to which  incomplete information is present during the transmissive  activity and the effect it has on such activity.  Third, the  study will be determined how the prevalence of AIDS might  stabilize itself over time.  This research is important because  public health interventions aimed at controlling the epidemic are  almost exclusively information based and because this project has  important implications for the effects of such measures.",
