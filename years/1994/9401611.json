 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401611  Harer       This proposal concerns research on three related topics.   The first is a continuation of the principal investigator's work  on the computation of the homology of the moduli space of curves.   New techniques are proposed which involve the interplay between  the known triangulations of moduli spaces and the Arbarello flag.   The second topic is the generalization of the results on moduli  space to its level-n covers and to Torelli space.  The third is  joint work with David Epstein and Steve Kerckhoff in which they  are looking for automatic structures for the outer automorphism  group of a free group.       This research is part of an ongoing attempt by a number of  mathematicians and physicists to understand the mathematics which  underlies certain recent developments in theoretical physics.  In  particular, gravity is the only one of the four fundamental  forces of nature for which there is no reasonable quantum theory  (quantum theories describe the behavior of matter in the small,  while ordinary theories describe behavior in the large).  An  approach to quantum gravity was suggested by the physicists  (primarily Witten), but the mathematics necessary to understand  it involves the moduli space of curves and is not yet understood  sufficiently.  ***",
