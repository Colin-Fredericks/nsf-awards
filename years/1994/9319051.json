 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319051  de la Mora    It is proposed to investigate the physics of the formation of  ultrafine aerosol particles from electrosprays, and ion emission  from droplets.  The experimental and theoretical study on particle  formation is well documented, and has relevance in an area of focus  of the Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems programs related to  advanced materials research.  The second part on ion emission seems  difficult to be performed as described.  The P.I. has a good track  record in his previous grant.    Four referees have rated this proposal with 3 Very Good and 1 Good.   The P.I. is a creative researcher, who has the expertise as well as  most of the experimental facilities to conduct the research.  The  first topic of the project, on the generation of monodispered  submicron and nanometer particles, is highly recommended for  funding.  Several comments were made on improving the experimental  approach (control of the residence time of the fluid in the Taylor  cone during measurements) and a suggestion was made on using  numerical simulations for data interpretation.  It is expected that  the P.I. will address a range of fundamental issues, with a  reasonable chance of success.  The second topic of the project has  a lower chance of generating new, significant results as compared  on the first topic, and has lowered the overall rating of this  proposal.  That area should be de-emphasized in the project.  By  considering the goal and quality of this proposal relevant to  ultrafine particle synthesis and the unique theoretical-  experimental background of the P.I., a standard three-year award of  $225,000 with starting  date on March 1, 1994, is recommended, with  the following suggestions:         (i)  The main focus of the project will be on ultrafine                  particle production       (ii) Numerical modeling of droplet formation should be            investigated in order to better understand the mechanisms             and to generalized the results.  ***",
