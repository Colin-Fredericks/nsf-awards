 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational   chemisty program.  Improved computational techniques will be implemented   in the General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS)   program.  This includes the development and implementation of methods for   performing electronic structure computations for large molecules using   massively parallel computers, and computational methods for treating   solvent effects.   Electronic structure theory is combined with dynamics   to obtain a qualitative and quantitative understanding of both   thermodynamic and kinetic properties.  The theory is applied to: (a) the   elucidation of single and multiple bonds between main group and   transition metals, (b) theoretical analysis of strained rings and   hypervalent bonding, and (c) the computation of potential energy surfaces   for and the prediction of reaction mechanisms of main group   organometallic reactions.  Specific reactions include: (a) hydrosilation   and coupling reactions, (b) unimolecular decompositions and isomerations,   and (c) reactions of multiply bonded compounds.    Electronic structure theory treats a molecule, or a molecular assembly,   as a mechanical system of strongly interacting electrons and nuclei.  In   principle, all chemical behavior can be understood by solving the quantum   mechanical equations of motion of this many-particle system, but   experience shows that very heavy computations are required to achieve the   accuracy required to make reliable predictions of the chemical properties   of  moderately large molecules.  With the advent of modern   supercomputers, particularly, of massively parallel computers, this has   become an active field of theoretical chemical research.  This project is   an example of such research.  It emphasizes the application of the theory   to compounds of Carbon, Silicon, and Titanium and the bonding of these   elements to organic molecules containing transition-metal atoms such as    iron.  Of particular i nterest are moderately small molecules with unusual   chemical bond structures such as strained rings or double bonds such as   C=Si or Si=Si.  Detailed study of the geometries and energetics of such   unusual molecules contributes to our ability to design much larger   molecules which possess these same bonding features or perhaps are formed   by chemical reactions involving transient species which possess them.",
