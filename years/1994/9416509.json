 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416509  Synolakis  The objective of this project is to model the response of the Los  Angeles dam during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.  This dam is  located about 6 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, and  is inside the Van Norman complex of the Department of Water and  Power (DWP).  Lateral spreading, liquefaction and permanent  ground settlement were observed in the entire area of the Van  Norman complex.  The focus of this study is the impulsive motion  of the water surface in response to the earthquake-induced ground  motion, and the investigation of any seiche which may have been  produced.  The sloshing of the water surface following the  earthquake produced 10 foot vertical runup distances measured  around the south-east side of the reservoir by the principal  investigator.  This observation implies that the measured runup  was about 12% of the depth: this is the primary motivation for  this study.    This project has three specific objectives:  1. To use the estimated ground motions under the dam to determine  if overtopping occurred during the earthquake.  2. To determine the profile of the tsunami wave or seiche which  can be produced in reservoirs with ground motions having  significant vertical accelerations.  3. If time permits, to use the measured runup heights and the  hydrodynamic model to infer the low-frequency content of the  earthquake spectra at this site (data which is not readily  available from measured strong-motion records), and to provide  another method for estimating the rotation and shift component of  the ground motion.  ***",
