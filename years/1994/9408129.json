 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the development of a state-of-art scanning  near-field infrared microscope that involves the use of highly  collimated, tunable infrared sources such as free electron  lasers. This instrument is expected to have many applications in  both materials science and biological systems, because it  combines the exquisite spectral resolution of infrared  spectroscopy with high-resolution imaging down to 0.05 micrometers without  compromising on the frequency resolution of conventional IR  spectroscopy. Furthermore, the intrinsically large characteristic  absorption coefficients in the infrared mean that it is possible  to obtain images with contrast as large as 1 part in 105 without  resorting to any staining procedures. The proposed microscope  should satisfy a long-felt need for an imaging technique that is  capable of non-destructive identification of the chemical  composition of surfaces.   %%%  It has long been appreciated that the combination of infrared  spectroscopy with imaging would provide a valuable technique for  examining surfaces non-destructively. However, the promise of  this technique was limited by the poor spatial resolution set by  the long wavelengths of the infrared radiation when used with  conventional imaging techniques. In this work, the recent  breakthroughs in optical near-field scanning probe microscopy,  and the availability of highly collimated, tunable infrared  sources such as free electron lasers, are used to construct an  infrared near-field microspectroscope that can achieve a spatial  resolution of 0.05 micrometers. This novel instrument has the potential  for revolutionizing the characterization of materials.",
