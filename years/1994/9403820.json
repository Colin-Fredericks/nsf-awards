 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is divided into two parts.  The first part considers problems from the theory of large deviations.  This theory seeks to estimate and characterize rare events in stochastic systems.  The focus of the work is on extending some recently developed methods.  In this new approach the large deviation problem is recast in terms of the limiting behavior of a sequence of stochastic variational problems.  A problem of particular interest is the analysis of large deviation properties of queuing systems.  The second part of the proposal discusses the development of stochastic process models for what are called \"interacting users of a resource system.\"  These models describe situations in which there are a large number of users of a finite set of resources.  Examples occur in economics, finance and transportation.  The goals of the work are development of the models, limit theorems, and model simplification.      This research is divided into two parts.  The first part considers problems from the theory of large deviations.  This theory seeks to estimate and characterize rare events in stochastic systems.  Such rare events can play a critical role in determining the performance of many systems modeled by stochastic processes.  A problem of compelling interest is the analysis of large deviation properties of queuing systems, and in particular those that arise in communication systems.  At the same time, large deviation theory is thought to have great potential in the analysis and design of high speed networks (including ATM networks).  The focus of the work is on extending some recently developed methods that can handle this difficult class of problems.  The second part of the research involves the development of stochastic process models for what we call \"interacting users of a resource system.\"  These models describe situations in which there are a large number of users of a finite set of resources.  Examples occur in economics, finance and transportation.  Such dynamical models are needed t o predict how the population of users would adapt to changes in the environment. The main goal of this part of the proposal is the development of the models and model simplification.",
