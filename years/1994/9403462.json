 "awd_abstract_narration": "The very first question concerning stochastic dynamics is the  rate of relaxation to the equilibrium. One can roughly divide  these rates into two categories: the exponential relaxation and  the power law relaxation. The main objective of this research is  to study dynamics with the power law decay. The first goal is to  derive the macroscopic scaling limiting equations rigorously and  then to study various corrections to these equations. In the past  few years, several methods have been developed for these  problems. One of the major restrictions to these methods is a  technical condition called the gradient condition. The  investigator will study several nongradient models, in  particular, the hydrodynamical limit and the rate of relaxation  to equilibrium of lattice gas at finite temperature. A related  problem for lattice gas with random field will also be  considered. Finally, the investigator will study problems related  to a time scale longer than the hydrodynamical scale. These are  particularly important because the incompressible Navier-Stokes  equation is believed to be the long time (diffusive) scaling  limit of Hamiltonian systems.       A basic problem concerning dynamical system is to determine  the rate of approach to the equilibrium. In this research the  investigator will study dynamics with slow relaxation to  equilibrium, which most natural processes follow. Major goals are  to determine the precise rate of relaxation to the equilibrium of  these processes and to derive macroscopic equations governing the  macroscopic behavior of relaxations and then to study various  corrections to these equations. In the past few years, several  methods  have been developed for these problems for several types  of models. But some major restrictions of these methods prohibit  the study of more realistic models. The investigator will study  several models to extend the current technology and to address  some key technical difficulties. Models of interest include: the  lattice gases at finite  temperature, the effect of random  impurities in a lattice gas, and the discrete velocity model  which simulates the  incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.",
