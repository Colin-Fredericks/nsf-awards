 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354637  Joesten  The laboratory of introductory college science courses provides an  excellent opportunity to improve both the attitudes and scientific  literacy of liberal arts students and prospective teachers.  This  project is developing six ten-minute videodisc programs with  associated HyperCard stacks that add a \"real-life\" component to the  laboratory experience in an introductory chemistry course for  nonscience majors.  Since elementary school teachers will play a  key role in increasing scientific literacy and in changing public  attitudes toward science, the six videodisc programs include  elementary classroom scenes where elementary students are doing  exploratory activities based on the experiment the college student  has just completed.  This provides both prospective teachers and  other liberal arts students an opportunity to look for  misconceptions and science content errors.  Students view the  appropriate videodisc program at the end of the laboratory period,  and their responses to the questions raised in the program are an  integral part of the experimental writeup.  After class testing,  the videodisc programs with accompanying HyperCard stacks will be  transferred to CD ROM discs to allow for individual viewing by  students when they are preparing laboratory reports.  The  interactive videodisc and CD ROM programs will provide an effective  way to add a component missing from all introductory college  chemistry laboratory courses - an immediate illustration of  applying the chemical principles of a specific experiment to a  real-life situation.",
