 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this research is to assess the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) and to test the roles of the active fractions of SOM in CO2 and CH4 production in the arctic ecosystem.  The first phase of this project involves the sampling and full characterization of soils on the flux study sites which were jointly selected by all PIs involved in this collaborative proposal.  The soil characterization will provide database for extrapolating the results of gas flux studies over a geographic base.  The second phase involves the isolation and characterization of the inactive and active organic fractions in soils and soil solutions; then identification of the microbial active fractions using respiration experiments under controlled conditions and the active components as substrates for gas flux (both CO2 and CH4) using carbon labelling experiments.  It is hypothesized that the major sources of CO2 and CH4 production are the active fractions in SOM.  The composition, quantity of active and inactive organic carbon fraction and their turnover rate are expected to closely relate to gas flux on different arctic ecosystems.  This project is part of the larger integrated Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII) Flux study of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.",
