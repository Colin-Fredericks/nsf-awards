Strauss, Ph.D., Principal Investigator   \"Project PRIMES:  Promoting & Retaining In Math, Engineering &  Science\"                                 ABSTRACT    This Experimental Project is designed to address the  underrepresentation of persons with disabilities in science,  engineering and mathematics (SEM) careers and those actively  pursuing degrees in these fields.  Project PRIMES has two main  goals:  (1) increasing the enrollment and retention of students  with disabilities in SEM at the high school and college levels, and  2) increasing the understanding of the factors which contribute to  this inequity.    The goal of increasing the enrollment and retention of students  with disabilities in SEM in high school and college levels are to  be addressed through three tasks.    (a) Workshops will be conducted for high school math and science  teachers and guidance counselors, high school students with  disabilities and their families, and state vocational  rehabilitation counselors.  The workshops will discuss methods to  overcome handicapping conditions in an academic pursuit of SEM.   Topics covered include:  state and federal regulations governing  educational access; funding availability at the local, state and  federal levels; availability of technology to increase access to  laboratories and computers; availability of referral and human  resources to identify and assist in reducing or eliminating  handicapping situations; teaching the necessary preparation for  successful transition from high school to college.  The high school  students with disabilities participating in these workshops will be  targeted for direct recruitment by SEM college departments.   Internet and e-mail access will be provided for the high school via  the University of Illinois Computer Service in order to facilitate  peer-to-peer support between students in different high schools and  mentoring support provided by college students with disabilities  w ho are enrolled in SEM.  Mini-grants will be awarded to math and  science teachers to provide necessary access technology and to  develop either new teaching/laboratory modules or to modify  existing ones to increase the integration of students with  disabilities.    (b) The SEM department faculty at the University of Illinois will  be provided educational workshops on how to teach for students with  disabilities.  Many of the issues addressed in the workshops will  be discussed.  Similar mini-grants to college professors will be  offered to improve the quality of the educational experience for  students with disabilities enrolled in SEM.  One professor in each  SEM department will function as a mentor and advocate for the  students with disabilities in the department.    (c) A region-wide awareness program is planned.  A professionally  developed poster illustrating persons with disabilities  successfully engaging in SEM fields at the high school, college and  post-graduation levels will be sent to high school math and science  departments and guidance counselor offices in Illinois and to  children's and science museums in a five state region.    The second goal related to increasing understanding of the factors  that contribute to the underrepresentation of people with  disabilities in SEM will be addressed by collecting and analyzing  data from anonymous pre- and post- surveys completed by workshop  participants.  The surveys will ask participants to express their  experiences, views and attitudes about people with disabilities in  SEM careers.  The most important and impeding issues will be  integrated into future workshops and disseminated through national  publications and presentations.      The knowledge gained in this project should act as a model for  other high schools and colleges to follow to increase the  enrollment and retention of students with disabilities in SEM.",
