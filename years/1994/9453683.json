 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453683  Onaral    Under the leadership of the Women in Engineering Committee and the Women in Engineering  Program, the College of Engineering at Drexel University proposes to launch an outreach effort  to motivate larger numbers of girls to consider engineering as a viable career option.  The  outreach effort will be in the form of an engineering education workshop called GOES (Girls  Opportunities in Engineering and Science) for middle and junior high schools that are more than  one hour away from Drexel University.  Eight trips are scheduled during the one-year funding  period.  The effort builds upon Drexel's successful on-campus engineering career days where  girls are given an opportunity to participate in hands-on engineering experiments while  informally interacting with engineering college faculty and students, as well as practicing female  engineers.  GOES will take the \"career day\" to middle schools.  Teacher and parent participation  will be encouraged.  This intervention program is for pre-high school students in grades 6 to 9,  to help make them aware of opportunities offered by the engineering profession, and to  encourage them to take college-track math and science courses which would prepare them for  possible careers in science and engineering.  The purpose of the hands-on laboratories is to  convey the excitement and fun of engineering through practical experience.    The project will be \"fine-tuned\" with input from a systematic evaluation procedure.  Results of  the project will be widely shared regionally and nationally, according to a comprehensive  dissemination plan.  After the project funding period, GOES will be institutionalized as part of  the outreach effort of the College of Engineering.  University resources will be used to maintain  a minimum of 10 trips per year.  If additional funds are available, the program will be  diversified to reach out to populations of younger learners, and organizations for girls.  ***",
