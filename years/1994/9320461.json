 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is focused on infrastructure development in analytical chemistry.  This   activity  provides support for four faculty from undergraduate   institutions to enable their participation in research activities at the   University of Tennessee during the summer months.  Both new participants,   and visitors who have been involved previously will be accommodated in   this program.   It is designed as an aggregated NSF Research Opportunity   Award (ROA) and has become known in the chemistry community as a   Macro-ROA.  By providing faculty from regional undergraduate institutions   with such research opportunities, this program serves not only to   maintain or rejuvenate their interest in research pursuits, but also to   update them regarding modern analytical chemistry in a collegial setting.    The focus of this project is the support of faculty from undergraduate   institutions for research and training in analytical chemistry.    Experiences garnered by participants in this program are passed on to   their students in their respective institutions.  This infrastructure   investment serves to maintain topical currency on the part of the   participants and to indirectly promote the development of their student's   interest in careers in analytical chemistry.",
