 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321163  ROBERTS       Feminist geography grew out of the women's movement and  other liberatory struggles of the 1960's. Since that time,  and especially since the mid-1980's, feminist geographers  have focussed on the relationship between feminist  geographic research and social change. As a result of an  explosion of recent research, feminist geography has tackled  important and difficult questions concerning the  relationship between gender, space, and power, and how  social constructions of gender and gender relations vary  across space and time. Furthermore, it has begun to  formulate new ways of equitably negotiating and representing  difference in pedalogical, theoretical, and methodological  terms. Given the volume and pace of this recent research, it  is timely to take stock of progress, to identify new  horizons, and to chart new directions for feminist  geography. This conference aims to achieve these ends  through a focus on three of the most recurrent and important  themes arising out of new feminist research: diversity and  difference, methological frontiers, and new forms of  representation. Results of the conference will be published  in book form.       Feminist geography has already had a major impact on  the nature of human geography studies. This conference will  provide a timely and intensive opportunity for leading and  emerging scholars in the field of feminist geography to  reflect on past accomplishments and to structure future  research.  Thus this conference will provide new visions of  this important field of study that will not only inspire  those scientists actively involved in its study, but will  also further the impact of feminist geography on the rest of  human geography.",
