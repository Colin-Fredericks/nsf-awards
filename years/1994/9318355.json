 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318355  Stiassny    African and U.S. scientists will attend a  workshop called PARADI (Poissons Africains:   Role et Applications del la Diversity  Biologique), to be held in Dakar, Senegal,  November 15-20 1993, on African fresh and  brackish water fishes.  The workshop is  sponsored by a coalition of five organizations,  in Senegal, South Africa, and Europe (France  and Belgium), with an international scientific  board which includes participants, such as the  U.S. P.I., Dr. Melanie Stiassny of the American  Museum of Natural History, from a wide range of  institutions, disciplines, and countries.  The  purpose of the workshop is to convene active  researchers from a wide interdisciplinary  range, to identify common scientific and  conservation themes for African fisheries  biology.  The Workshop will review available  data from a biological diversity perspective on  a continent-wide basis and map directions for  programs and international research  collaborations and education.  In all, some 24  African countries are expected to be  represented.  NSF funding will support the  participation of African scientists from  Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and  Madagascar, and US researchers from a number of  institutions throughout the country, including  graduate students and junior faculty members.    This workshop will stimulate interchange to  establish needed baseline data on freshwater  fauna of Africa, an area which has been  relatively understudied, aside from the rift  valley lakes.  In addition to its contribution  to biodiversity, such research is vital to  sustainable development in many countries of  Africa for maintenance of their fisheries.   This project is likely  to serve as a catalyst  for the establishment of research networks  among African and US researchers, including  some men and women how at early stages in their  careers, who may pursue collaborative efforts  for decades to come.  ***",
