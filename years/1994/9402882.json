 "awd_abstract_narration": "A class of cells found in the nervous system, though not nerve  cells themselves is called glia, from their early presumed adhesive  glue-like role to hold cells together.  These glial  cells are now  known  to be important for many aspects of normal function in the  brain.  Glial cells and their associated products participate in  fundamental interactions which underline the development and  organization of the nervous system.  Insects are widely used as  model system for development, and in insects the first antigen  associated with glial cells was a glycoprotein compound called  glionexin or GX, identified in the cricket.  Features of its  distribution, spatial and temporal expression, and preliminary  functional tests suggested GX is involved in neural development as  an adhesion/recognition molecule.  This work uses antibody probes  and microsequence analysis to screen genetic cDNA libraries from  embryonic crickets and adult Drosophila flies, where we have a lot  of genetic information, to isolate and sequence the gene encoding  GX.  Identification of the gene will allow new tests for function  of this compound, which in turn will be important for understanding  the complex interactions that guide nerve cell outgrowth during  development and regeneration.  The work may lead to better  understanding of the evolution of cell adhesion macromolecules, and  will have impact on developmental biology as well as neuroscience.",
