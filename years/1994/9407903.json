The overall goal  of the proposed research is to pursue realistic molecular  modeling studies relating to protein stability, structure,  and folding.  Specifically, mixed solvent systems will be  developed to better mimic experimental conditions in  molecular dynamics and simulations.  With these more  accurate solvent representations, current studies in the  area of protein folding will be extended by simulating the  unfolding of ubiquitin in denaturant.  The molten globule  state of ubiquitin has been characterized in 60% aqueous  methanol solution at low pH independently by three research  groups.  The results are in opposition, with one study  suggesting that the molten globule conformation is almost  completely native-like (by hydrogen exchange), while the  others identify native-like and random coil regions of the  protein (by 2- and 3-dimensional NMR).  In this project,  simulations under these conditions will be performed to  model the molecular details of the molten globule state of  this protein.  These simulations should shed light on the  experimental discrepancies.  In addition, by comparing the  detailed solvent-protein interactions occurring in pure  water versus an aqueous methanol solution, it should be  possible to address how the solvent affects the stability of  proteins in various conformations (e.g., native, partially  unfolded and fully unfolded).  Furthermore, the question of  how the unfolding pathway differs as a function of  temperature, pH and solvent conditions will be investigated.  %%%  A knowledge of the structural and mobility properties of  proteins is essential to understanding their properties and  functions.  For globular proteins, internal motion is  important to stability, catalysis, ligand binding,  macromolecular recognition and protein folding.  The solvent  environment necessarily plays a critical role in these  processes.  Computer-assisted simulations can provide  detailed information in th ese areas that often cannot be  obtained experimentally, especialy in the case of protein  folding where it has proved difficult to characterize  proteins during the folding process.  Protein folding is one  of the fundamental unsolved problems in molecular biology  and can no longer be considered an esoteric scientific  topic.  To quote Science magazine on the subject, \"Why are  the stakes so high?  One reason is that the payoff isn't  merely theoretical ... The right answer is going to make a  difference not only to protein chemists but also to all of  biotechnology.\" (Hoffman, 1991).  Protein folding is an area  where experiment actually needs theory, as it is unlikely  that experimental studies will ever be able to provide  structural information about protein folding in comparable  detail to that available for native proteins.  Computer  power has now reached the stage where protein unfolding can  be simulated in water with all atoms present.  The next  logical step is to perform simulations with more accurate  representations of the environment, focusing on proteins for  which structural experimental data of folding intermediates  are now available.  ***",
