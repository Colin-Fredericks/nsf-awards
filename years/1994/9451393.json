The freshman laboratory will serve as a  foundation in a sequence of three laboratory courses bridging  molecular & cellular biology, organismal biology (a merger of our  present offerings in botany & zoology), and ecology & evolution  (course already in place). The laboratory accompanying the first of  these three courses will focus not only on introducing molecular  genetics and attendant recombinant DNA techniques to freshman, but  also on integrating this knowledge with biochemistry and cell  biology to provide a solid foundation for the many diverse  processes studied in subsequent courses.  The equipment will enable  introductory experiments in quantitative analysis, tissue culture  & microbiology, cell architecture, protein biochemistry and  enzymology, DNA structure, gene mapping, DNA sequencing,  recombinant DNA techniques, transformation & phenotypic analysis.  In addition to providing students with a solid grounding in  molecular and cellular biology, the laboratory experiences will  also enhance students' abilities and opportunities for advanced  study in these areas.",
