 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411016  Stoltman    Under the direction of Dr. James Stoltman, Mr. Patrick Lubinski  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The work  consists of two phases. In December 1991 a herd of 150 Wyoming  proghorn antelope fell over a cliff on a foggy day and were  killed. The skeletal remains have been collected and through  analysis of dental remains it is possible to reconstruct the age  profile of the group and to improve criteria for aging skeletal  remains of this species. In the first part of his research, Mr.  Lubinski will study these materials. On this basis he will then  examine a series of proghorn skeletal remains collected from many  sites and time periods in the Great Basin region. Prehistoric  peoples hunted this species widely and Mr. Lubinski's goal is to  reconstruct changing utilization patterns over time.    This work is important for several reasons. Archaeological  evidence suggests that over time intensified resource use  occurred in the Great Basin and that human groups tended to  specialize and focus on limited types of food. While this process  is well documented in other parts of the world and led to the  domestication of plants and animals, it would be surprising and  unusual if such a process took place in a desertic Great Basin  environment. Mr. Lubinski will examine this phenomenon. Secondly,  the research will contribute basic biological data which will be  useful to archaeologists who study and attempt to interpret  faunal remains. Finally, this project will contribute to the  training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
