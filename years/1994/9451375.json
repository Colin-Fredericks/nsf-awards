 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, software engineers have produced software products  and then passed them on to technical writers and other support  staff who worked on the information necessary to familiarize the  end users with the software. Now, however, market pressures have  forced software developers to tailor their products to a specific  and well-defined niche market, deliver them in far less time, and  with far fewer defects than before. In such a market, neither  technical writers nor software engineers can afford the  traditional, serial development process. A team of planners,  developers, testers, writers, and marketing specialists must  cooperate and collaborate in parallel in order to meet these  stringent market demands. To succeed, technical writers must follow  the lead of their counterparts in companies like IBM and Microsoft  and contribute to the development team before the system is  delivered.  The Information Management in Software Engineering  course seeks to enable students to become information managers who  not only contribute to the final product by shaping the way it  communicates with its audience but also who develop, manage, and  disseminate information the team needs to move forward in its  process of creating high-quality software.  A key element in moving  technical writing from the serial-development paradigm to the  parallel- cooperative-collaborative paradigm is the equipment we  request which allows writers to manage the large volume of  information generated by a software team, transform that  information into resources for the development team and  instructional material for the end user, and to deliver that  information far faster than the traditional print technology will  allow.",
