Philadelphia, PA  Smith, Lynnette    \"Central East Regional Science Camp\"    For four weeks during the summers of 1994, 1995, and 1996, the  School District of Philadelphia will conduct the \"Central East  Regional Science Camp (CERSC)\" at Edison High School for fifty  minority middle school students. CERSC, which will pool students  from nine middle schools in the Central East Region of the School  District, is designed to encourage minority students who may have  questioned their ability to \"do\" science, or questioned the  relevance of science in their daily lives, to understand how  science does relate to them, that careers in science are open to  them, and that staying in school and continuing their science  education is the best path to these careers.  Participants, who  will begin the project as upcoming seventh grade students, will  work with their peers and the project staff each summer to develop  science fair projects about the environment.  Project staff will  conduct activities in four major areas--research, laboratory work,  problem-solving, and computer skills--to help students with the  development of their projects, and will also take students on field  trips to environmental sites in the Philadelphia area.    During the school year, students will continue to develop their  science fair projects, meeting monthly with their \"mentors,\"  science teachers at their home-based schools, to get feedback on  their projects.  In March of every year of the project, the  participants will enter their science fair projects in the George  Washington Carver Science Fair.  Students will also participate  with their parents in the school-year Super Science Saturday  Academy programs held by the National Organization for the  Professional advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers  to learn about careers in science, mathematics, and engineering and  to participate in problem-solving, hands-on activities in science.",
