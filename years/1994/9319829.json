 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319829  Petropulu  It has been shown, through theory and observations, that  conditions at the site of a constructed facility can amplify  the seismic ground motions significantly, as compared to  those recorded on bedrock.  This amplification increases the  potential damage and collapse of engineered structures.    The objective of this research is to examine the feasibility  of applying a blind deconvolution algorithm to site response  analysis; and to investigate whether the approach can lead  to a better understanding of the complex phenomena  underlying this problem.  The approach utilizes the blind  deconvolution algorithm and the recordings of ground motions  at two stations on a sediment site in order to reconstruct  the seismic input at the bedrock-layer interface and to  recover the characteristics of the site through impulse  responses (reflectivities) between the input location and  the recording stations.  The site characteristics are  estimated by combining higher-order statistics of the  seismograms and the theory of signal reconstruction from  higher-order spectral phase only.    Potential advantages of this approach over existing  techniques are that (i) it does not require recordings at  nearby rock sites or downhole recordings for the site-  specific analysis, but reconstructs the seismic input motion  at the base of the sediments from two surface records; (ii)  it identifies the reflectivities between the bedrock-layer  interface and each recording station rather than one one-  dimensional site response function from the downhole (or  nearby rock) station and one station on the surface of the  sediment site; and (iii) it remains robust even in the  presence of additive white Gaussian noise in the  observations and in the input seismic motion at the base of  the sediments.    This exploratory study concentrates on well documented  earthquakes recorded by the SMART-1 accelerograph array in  Taiwan.  ***",
