 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360457  Weres  The objective of this project is to evaluate  an electrochemical  process for destroying organic compounds  dissolved in water  utilizing electrodes which generate hydroxyl  free radicals.  The  fundamental chemistry resembles processes  powered by ionizing  radiation.  Hydroxyl attacks most organic  compounds in a  nonspecific manner.  Olefinic and aromatic  compounds, including  highly chlorinated compounds and phenols,  react particularly  well.  Most contaminated groundwaters have  sufficient electrical  conductivity to carry the small currents  needed to remove the low  TOC levels typical of these waters.  The  process appears  particularly attractive in application to  brackish groundwaters  typical of coastal areas, and to industrial  process waters.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal  submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  During Phase I, destruction of  several organic  solvents dissolved in water will be  demonstrated, and two cell  configurations will be tested and compared.   The results of Phase  I will be extrapolated and used to design a  large water treatment  system.  The proposes process is expected to  find many commercial  applications where organic compounds need to  be removed from  water, including contaminated groundwater,  and process water in  oil refineries.  Projected operating costs  are expected to  compare favorably with the nearest competing  process.",
