Students will be exposed to many areas of the biological  sciences in an appropriate learning context predicated on an  understanding of Hawaiian culture and will be offered hands-on  experience in hydroponic experimentation.  From the beginning of  the project, they will be able to participate in and contribute to  scientific research that involves actual commercialization.    Native Hawaiian students will be shown how their indigenous  technology combines with scientific principles to produce  ecologically sound and environmentally benign outcomes, and they  will be stimulated to be creative--to expand the concept of a  closed hydroponic system to other plants and beyond.  The major  educational product of this project will be the cultivation of  human resources.  ***",
