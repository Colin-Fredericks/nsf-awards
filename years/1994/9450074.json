However, teachers in regular science and math classes are not trained to include students with special needs in already overcrowded classrooms.  These teachers are not prepared to handle the problems of children with special needs.  Teaming of SEM teachers with individuals trained in meeting accessibility needs should reduce existing problems leading to full inclusion and participation of students with disabilities.  New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) proposes a project to meet the goal of strengthening science and math literacy and career opportunities of all students, including those with disabilities from racial minorities.  NJIT plans to establish a comprehensive, long-term, training and assistance program in SEM curricula for pre-college teachers and counselors, their students with disabilities, and their parents.  The project will demonstrate how science and math curricula can be adapted to meet the needs of these students.  The project will work on team building and collaborative efforts among 60 counselors, 30 science and math teachers at the secondary level and 60 special education teachers at the elementary level.  Four hundred and eighty special needs students will receive follow- up academic support in the classroom provided by specially trained NJIT graduate assistants.  In addition, summ er SEM experiences will be offered to 36 minority disabled students.  The goals of the program are to develop a program model that will:  (a) promote positive and permanent changes in the academic climate to ensure full participation and inclusion in SEM subjects of elementary children with disabilities; (b) provide disabled elementary students access to SEM instructional materials, educational technologies and hands-on experiences; (c) encourage children with differing abilities, especially minorities, to pursue SEM careers by providing opportunities for interaction with practicing disabled SEM professionals; (d) encourage and facilitate smooth transition from one educational level to the next for students with disabilities; (e) stimulate interest in SEM subjects of fourth through sixth grade elementary minority children with differing abilities; and (f) inspire parents of minority disabled youngsters so that they may enable their children to undertake SEM courses and pursue appropriate careers.  Eight areas of activity are planned for the three-year project.  Faculty and students who participate in Year 1 will continue to      h)          0*0*0*         participate in subsequent years, and in years 2 and 3 additional cohorts of faculty and students will begin their participation.  The eight areas of project activity are the following:  (1) provide teams of secondary science and math teachers and elementary special education teachers three weeks of intensive classroom experience; (2) provide counselors in-service training on bridging mechanisms that facilitate educational transition in SEM courses, parental empowerment, and cooperative hands-on science and math instruction; (3) provide elementary minority disabled students with four weeks of intensive classroom experience in science, math, computer science and communication skills; (4) provide parents/guardians of disabled youngsters and counselors with workshops to disseminate information on existing services and programs available from federa l, state, local and community agencies, SEM course preparation and SEM careers; (5) provide academic classroom support for implementation of SEM instruction into special education classrooms; (6) provide elementary minority disabled students counseling seminars including interaction with practicing disabled SEM professionals; (7) provide faculty and graduate assistants with classroom training in cooperative teaching and learning methods, classroom climate and sensitivity issues; and (8) provide elementary disabled school children with information on existing precollege initiatives at NJIT and other colleges and universities. ***",
