 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321505  Slaughter  This research project will examine and monitor the ways that  currently developing science and technology policy shapes  academic science.  For the past fifty years, defense and related  agencies and independent agencies concerned with basic research  have accounted for a large portion of budgets for academic  science.  If the current Administration pursues a civilian  technology policy, these funding arrangements will change.  The  objectives of this project are to measure and attempt to explain  change with regard to:  ideologies of science, budgets and types  of science projects, sites for academic science, alliances and  coalitions that support academic science.  The project will focus  on the following three questions:  Whose voices and interests  will be present and represented in debates surrounding federal  science and technology policy?  What impact will changes in  science policy at the national level --specifically enactment of  a technology policy that reshapes the defense conversion and  biotechnology agendas -- have on channels (agencies and processes  by which money is distributed), levels (international, national,  state, local), sectors (industry, university, federal labs), and  sites (concrete geographical locations) where science is done?   Do discourse and spatial analyses suggest that an institutional  class embracing private and public sectors and Democratic and  Republican parties has emerged and developed a coherent science  and technology policy?  The project will monitor documents  produced by forum groups concerned with science policy in the  defense conversion and biotechnology areas, congressional  committee hearings, and legislation, as well as materials from  the executive branch, DOD, NIH, and NSF, and perform discourse  analysis to understand what new narratives and ideologies of  science are emerging.  It will track organizational changes in  science agencies, budget changes and award allocations to  universities, university-industry partners hips, and corporations,  and perform time-series data analysis of changes to see who  benefits from change, should change occur.  The project will  gather data about linkages between organizational and  institutional actors who share similar science policy ideologies  to see if a new science policy coalition or class-wide consensus  on defense conversion and biotechnology is developing, and how it  intersects with policy agendas related to civilian technology  policy.  ***",
