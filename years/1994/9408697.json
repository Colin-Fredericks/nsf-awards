 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408697  Nitsche    The goal of the present project is to perform numerical  investigations to develop a better understanding of vortex ring  dynamics.  The case is considered in which a vortex ring is  formed by ejecting an amount of fluid from an opening.  In the  first part of the project, the focus will be on the initial  formation process of axisymmetric rings.  Viscous effects  dominate the flow in an initial time interval and affect the  vortex trajectory and total shed circulation.  The effects of  viscosity by adapting a successful 2-dimensional Navier Stokes  solver for high Reynolds number flow to the axisymmetric case  will be investigated.  Inviscid effects of the flow using a  vortex sheet model will also be studied in order to determine  whether present similarity theory predictions can be adjusted to  better predict the initial flow.  The second part of the project  concerns 3-dimensional dynamics of vortex rings formed at an  opening.  The development of a numerical method to compute  3-dimensional vortex sheet separation at an edge will enable the  study of the stability of these flows, as well as the effects of  nonaxisymmetric openings and nonaxisymmetric forcing.  For this  purpose, a 3-dimensional vortex filament method will be developed  which incorporates vortex separation at a sharp edge and  implements a fast summation algorithm to enable high resolution  calculations.    Understanding the dynamics of vortex rings is essential to  understand more complicated flows such as those that occur in  combustion processes, or in the airborne vortex structures  presenting a hazard to aircraft.  An inviscid numerical model has  been developed for axisymmetric vortex rings generated at a  circular opening.  This model was proven by comparison with  experiment to recover detailed information about the real flow.   In the present work, this model will be extended to 3-dimensional  flows, and will be used to study the stability of the flows, the  effects of non-axisymmetric openings a nd nonaxisymmetric forcing,  as well as the potential applicability of present theoretical  results to predict the flow.  Several of these aspects of the  flow are difficult to understand experimentally or analytically,  and the computations promise to give a deeper insight into the  flow dynamics. In order to perform this work, current numerical  tools available for 2-dimensional flows will be expanded to  3-dimensions.",
