The objective of this  proposal is to provide laboratory equipment for our developing  image-sequence processing and image-sequence synthesis courses.  These courses are closely aligned to the needs of industry and  address recent results as well as topics of current research. This  department believes that a knowledge of image-sequence processing  and image-sequence synthesis technologies provides a competitive  edge to students and industry.  The image-sequence processing and  image-sequence synthesis topics are dealt with in several  experiments, structured around the material presented in our  developing computer graphics and image processing courses.  These  experiments will give vital experience to our students, so that  they may have a significant societal impact by transferring these  technologies to industry in this and the next millennium.",
