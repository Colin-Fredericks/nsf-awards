 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404517  Bell         The investigator and his colleagues undertake research to  establish a quantitative understanding of mechanotransduction in  the mammalian tactile system through modeling a skin receptor  (Pacinian corpuscle_PC) and the skin.  They develop the  mathematical approach for determining the transmission of strain  through the PC's capsule, its mechanical filter, and develop  strain-sensitive ionic channel models for the PC's nerve fiber.  They extend previous work to allow full three-dimensional  deformation of the PC and to include inner capsule structure.   This  will help further understand sources of distinctive neural tuning  and directional sensitivity characteristic of the PC.  The  investigators also develop a continuum skin model to understand  the filtering contributions made by the skin.  This includes  incorporating the biphasic (fluid-solid) character of the skin.  Cooperation from an experimental group complements the  theoretical  efforts.       The investigators study, through theoretical models (but in  cooperation with an experimental group), how mechanical stimuli  at  the skin surface are transformed through skin and by a skin  receptor into electrical signals.  This mechanical-to-electrical  process (mechanotrans- duction) gives output that is processed in  the central nervous system and ultimately as associated with our  perception of touch.  Mechanotransduction in general is a  fundamental physiological process that is central to such diverse  functions as hearing, digestion, balance, as well as touch.  Through quantitative modeling of skin receptors (specifically,  Pacinian corpuscles) they developin an understanding of the  contribution of the mechanical vs the neural part of these  receptors (which is presently very difficult to accomplish  experimentally); hence, they are able to interpret changes due to  aging and abnormalities.  The approach they take to modeling the  skin as a biphasic (fluid-solid) material is expected to be  valuable in studying t he mechanics of other biphasic materials  not  necessarily associated with biological tissues.",
