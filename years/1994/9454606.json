 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two high-priority national issues that will require a combination  of new technological and educational solutions are improving  national competitiveness and productivity and dealing with an aging  infrastructure. A key element in addressing both issues is a  well-developed continuum of educational and training opportunities  that foster collaboration, interaction, and transfer of ideas and  technology among all sectors of education, industry, and  government. A regional center to improve technological education  and to foster improved relationships, communication, cooperation,  and interaction among the various sectors of nondestructive  evaluation/nondestructive testing (NDE/NDT) education and  technology and their constituencies in the north central United  States is being planned. An informal consortium of Iowa State  University (Ames), Hutchinson Technical College (Hutchinson,  Minnesota), Moraine Valley Community College (Palos Hills,  Illinois), Northeast Iowa Community College (Peosta), and Southeast  Community College (Milford, Nebraska) in collaboration with  industry, government, professional society, and regional high  school partners is involved in this planning initiative. To provide  a model for a well-articulated continuum of educational  opportunities in areas of emerging technological importance, the  proposed center is designed to build upon the established research  accomplishments of the mature Center for NDE and College of  Engineering at Iowa State University, some of the leading technical  and community college programs in NDT/NDE in the United States, and  selected existing educational development and technology transfer  efforts. Programs that will provide motivational materials,  instructional modules, curriculum materials, workshops, and shared  learning environments among students and faculty at all levels from  junior high school through undergraduate engineering programs are  being planned.",
