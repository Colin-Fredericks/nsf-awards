 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312260  Cohen   This project involves the dissertation research of a student in  cultural anthropology from Columbia University.  The student is  studying how Chinese peasants communicate values about gender  relations through their linguistic forms of proverbs and folk  sayings.  The sayings are thought of as representing traditional  wisdom and shared folk experience, and are used to sanction  behavior.  Using household surveys, personal interviews,  elicitation of life histories and participant observation as well  as archival research, the project will describe how rural Chinese  women are changing gender relations in the face of tradition.     This research is important because it sheds light on the changing  roles of women and men in traditional societies.  With changes in  employment opportunities, traditional gender roles change all  over the world, and this one case study of how the changes are  instituted in a traditional society will provide valuable  comparative material to understand similar processes in different  places.  In addition dissertation research increases the  scientific capacity of the nation.  ***",
