 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404086  Childress       This research will be concerned with structure of the  vorticity and magnetic fields in complex flows, in the limit of  vanishing dissipation. The work is an outgrowth of kinematic  studies of fast dynamos, or dynamos which operate in the limit of  infinite magnetic Reynolds number. We propose further work on  this problem, involving models and asymptotic techniques  developed in the previous studies, which link the dynamo action  to a combination of stretching and folding of field lines. We  shall also extend the scope of our work to include dynamical  self-consistency of motions producing a fast dynamo. In an new  direction, we shall apply the Lagrangian techniques of kinematic  fast dynamo theory to the structure of vorticity in  fully-developed turbulence. The new feature here is the use of  pulsed Lagrangian maps of the vorticity field which conserved  energy locally. We shall study a class of ``eddy structure''  models to understand how the Kolmogorov cascade responds to  various boundary conditions and driving mechanisms. These models  may provide a useful tool for pin-pointing the form of eddy  structure in the inertial range.       The primary motivation of this work is an understanding of  astrophysical turbulence and the associated magnetic fields of  the cosmos. Dissipation, such as is introduced in ordinary fluids  by viscosity, for example, is essentially absent in these  enormous systems. The convection zone of the Sun is a nearby  system of this kind, where turbulence and magnetic fields  commingle. Our aim is to understand the connection between the  fluid flow, the turbulence itself, and certain fields, magnetic  and vortical, embedded in it. These two fields are quite  different in their dynamics, but they share certain geometrical  features which emerge in the analysis of models. We intend to  exploit these connections and bring to bear mathematical tools  developed for the simpler magnetic problem, in the hope of  understanding uncovering important f eatures of the physical  structure of vorticity in fully developed turbulence.  ***",
