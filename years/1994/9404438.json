 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this work is on strictly unidimensional latent  variable models, which may be thought of as mixture models which  induce conditional association (Rosenbaum, 1984; Holland and  Rosenbaum, 1986) in the marginal distribution of the data, or as  a special case of Stout's (1987, 1990) essentially unidimensional  models. I propose to extend my past efforts to use these ideas  together with notions from the literature on positive and  negative dependence (e.g. Joag-Dev, 1983; Joag-Dev and Proschan,  1982; Newman and Wright, 1981; or more recently the collection  edited by Block, Sampson and Savits, 1990) to characterize  strictly unidimensional models. My recent explorations of this  problem suggest a reasonably straightforward approach that, as a  side benefit, generalizes de Finetti's characterization of  exchangeability, without the need to specify sufficient  statistics as in, for example, Diaconis and Freedman (1984). A  second line of work in this proposal is the exploration, using  asymptotic methods along the lines of Kass, Tierney and Kadane  (1990), and Clarke and Barron (1990), of inferences about the  latent trait under a strictly unidimensional model, which asserts  conditional independence given the latent trait, when in fact  some mild form of conditional dependence holds. In addition,  biases in the asymptotic standard error of an MLE-like estimator  can also be calculated and, in some cases, corrected using  nonparametric regression ideas due to Ramsay (Ramsay, 1991;  Ramsay and Winsburg, 1991). Finally, some problems in  applications and computing will be examined, including unifying  and extending nonparametric techniques for latent variables data  analysis (e.g. Molenaar, 1991; and Grayson, 1988); and developing  parametric statistical models and computational methods (e.g.  efficient estimation of a polytomous version of the model  specified by Lindsay, Clogg and Grego, 1991) that arise in the  analysis of data from small scale experiments in cognitive  science.   This  proposal concerns statistical and probabilistic features of  latent variable models for repeated measures data, which is of  interest to quantitative psychologists, psychometricians, and  cognitive scientists, as well as other social scientists. A  typical application for latent variable models is psychological  measurement, in which the latent variable is an unobservable  variable that indicates the level of a psychological feature of a  person---such as depression, mathematical aptitude, job  satisfaction, or working memory capacity---that we observe only  indirectly through the person's responses to a series of tasks,  questionnaire items, etc. Data of this type might be obtained  from psychiatric rating forms, standardized academic achievement  or aptitude tests like the SAT and GRE, standardized  questionnaires in sociology, or coded responses to a set of tasks  in experiments in cognitive psychology. A primary outcome of this  research will be a deeper understanding of latent variable models  for measurement problems, at both the level of fundamental  statistical theory and the level of practical applications.  Practical tools arising from this research would include:  enhanced methods for deciding how well or poorly this class of  models matches particular situations or data sets; rules for  adjusting scientific inferences based on these models for the  inevitable mismatch, however small, between the model being used  and the mechanism that generated the data; and computational and  model-building methods that are adapted to small-scale  experimental data, such as might be found in cognitive  psychology, where these models are conceptually natural but  current methods tend to break down. Much of the work proposed  here is built around interdisciplinary collaboration, especially  with quantitative psychologists and educational measurement  specialists, with the goal of developing statistical theory that  will be of use in applications.",
