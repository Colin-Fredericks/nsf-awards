The U.S. investigators are Jerome V. Moloney and Ewan M. Wright,  of the University of Arizona and Alejandro B. Aceves of the  University of New Mexico.  The European team will be led by John  G. McInerney of University College, Cork, Ireland and includes  other researchers from Denmark, France, Germany and Italy.  The  project sets up a summer research institute in nonlinear optics  at University College in Cork where established experts,  postdoctoral fellows and students from both sides of the Atlantic  will meet annually for joint research, dissemination of results  and special courses. NSF funds will support primarily the travel  of U.S. postdoctoral fellows and graduates students. The European  participation is funded through the E.U.'s Human Capital and  Mobility Program.     An interdisciplinary approach to problems in nonlinear optics  involving the disciplines of physics and applied mathematics is  the focus of the research. The investigators will emphasize   control and manipulation of high intensity outputs of large  aperture semiconductor amplifiers, lasers and coupled fiber  arrays.  Semiconductor lasers and optical fibers underpin many  vital technologies in telecommunications and advanced  manufacturing.  The project will advance our understanding of the  interaction of light fields with nonlinear optical materials.   Results could be applied to new and more advanced systems. The  project is of significant benefit to the U.S. community.  It  provides access to a network of excellent European laboratories  on topics related to NSF's strategic research initiatives in high  performance computing and advanced manufacturing.  The effort  also focuses on future scientists.  The U.S. postdoctoral  researchers and graduate students, through sustained interaction  over three years with European counterparts, will establish  research connections t hat are likely to endure throughout their  careers.  ***",
