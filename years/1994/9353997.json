 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353997  Awad  The two week seminar, \"FIBER OPTICS FOR ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY\"  is designed to introduce 30 faculty members from community and  undergraduate colleges to the fundamental principles and  applications of optical fiber technology, especially as related  to engineering technology education at the two and four year  level.  The seminar/workshop is planned for June, 1994 with  follow-up activities throughout the following academic year and  beyond.  The program is a collaborative effort involving a four  year technical college and three community colleges in the  Boston area. Eighty hours of training will be offered, half of  which will be in the fiber optic laboratory, and the remainder  consisting of lectures, simulation and analysis using computers  as well as visits to local companies that use fiber optic  technology.  Substantial hands-on involvement by industry  representatives is integral to the program.  The laboratory  exercises are designed to allow participants to handle optical  fibers and several of the specialized instrumentation and test  equipment developed specifically for fiber optics.  Women,  minorities and faculty who intend to introduce/enhance fiber  optics at their home institutions will receive priority. No  prior knowledge of fiber optics or communications is required.   Follow-up outreach to regional community colleges is planned  for the summer of 1995.  ***",
