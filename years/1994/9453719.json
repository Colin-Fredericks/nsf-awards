The program is designed to bring together a synergistic network of adults and  children to increase the involvement of young girls in science and mathematics, while  heightening their levels of enjoyment and self-confidence in these area.  Ultimately, programs  such as this will serve a longer range goal to increase the number of women entering into  scientific and science-related fields.  The focus is to provide motivational, hands-on science  experiences, both inside and outside the classroom, to fourth and fifth grade girls, and to  establish the support necessary to maintain an interest in science.  A positive change in attitude  toward science can be achieved by providing the girls with exciting, hands-on materials,  opportunities to experience success in science, and support from teachers and parents.  Thus,  the project's overall goals are:  to create a supportive environment for young girls to pursue  science studies; to provide a model that can be replicated by schools, community groups and  parents; to foster, in young girls, a positive attitude toward science, technology and related  mathematics; to encourage participation in science and related math activities; to increase  teachers' and parents' awareness of social bias toward women in science.    Approaches will be employed to develop self-esteem and build confidence in the use of scientific  and technological equipment.  Participants will be directly involved in scientific investigation and  cooperative learning.  Components of this program include: specific training for parents and  teachers; hands-on science workshops for girls in grades 4 and 5;  classroom activities with  mixed-gender groups; and female role models in the sciences.  Training sessions for teachers  and parents will consist of attitude awareness exercises, teaching and patenting strategies, and  hands-on science instruction.  Parents w ill participate in an initial evening hands-on science  workshop with their daughters.  During the year there will be five additional, hands-on science  workshops at Talcott Mountain Science Center for the girls and their teachers.  Parents will be  encouraged to attend and to work with their daughters on science activities at home.  Following  each hands-on science workshop, the teachers will conduct hands-on science activities in the  regular classroom on related topics.  All participants and collaborators will be linked via an  established computer network through the Science Center.  Students will have the opportunity  to dialogue with local female role models at work and explore applications of science to potential  career choices.  Students also will have access to national role models through Project  PROMMISE, (Providing Role Model Minorities In Science Education).  Dissemination, with the  goal of replication by others, is an important aspect of this project.  Vehicles of dissemination  include a live interactive telecast, and newsletter, a handbook for developing a model program  and an accompanying training video tape.  ***",
