The latter will involve  geometrically exact formulations of nonlinearly elastic and  visco-elastic solids and structures. The proposed wrk has three  essential goals: (i) to obtain new qualitative results and detect  new phenomena; (ii) to obtain global continuation results for  problems of 2 and 3-dimensional elasticity; (iii) to further  pursue and exploit the connection between symmetry and nodal  properties in global bifurcation problems for elliptic equations.   This work has several potential applications to \"real-world\"  engineering problems. First, the occurence of symmetric  structures in engineering practice is ubiquitous - due in part to  esthetics, and in part to optimal load-carrying capacity  (typically based upon linear analyses). However, such structures  are also susceptible to symmetry-breaking instabilities. The  fruits of this research will help to provide a systematic  approach to the (necessarily nonlinear) analysis of such  instabilities. Second, a qualitative nonlinear analysis of a  concrete class of problems, parameterized by general constitutive  laws, often illuminates the specific roles of material behavior  inattaining thresholds of instability. In this way we are able to  classify material behavior with an eye toward engineering design  of structures.",
