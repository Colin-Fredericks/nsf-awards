 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will develop and evaluate variable  selection procedures for multiple regression and related  problems.  Both the Bayesian and the frequentist points of view  will be considered.  From the Bayesian perspective, the focus  will be on stochastic search variable selection methods which use  a hierarchical mixture model to guide variable selection.  These  methods will include a procedure for fast Bayes variable  selection to handle hundreds of variables at once, a procedure  for variable selection in generalized linear models, a procedure  for variable selection across exchangeable regressions, and a  procedure for performing simultaneous variable selection and  outlier removal.  From the frequentist perspective, the focus  will be on a new criterion for evaluating selection criteria  called risk inflation.  This research will entail the application  and generalization of risk inflation to a broad set of model  selection problems which includes generalized linear models,  order selection procedures for time series models, and  change-point selection for estimation in change-point problems.  Risk inflation will also be used to gauge the bias of using  variable selection procedures in conjunction with heuristic  search methods.  A new class of variable selection procedures  which use adaptive dimensionality penalties will also be  developed.     One of the main goals of modern statistical methods is to provide  statistical models which relate input variables to outputs of  interest.  For example, such models are used to predict and  explain annual crop production in agriculture, interest rates in  business and economics, cancer incidence in medicine, and crime  rates in sociology.  A key component in building such models is  the selection of input variables which contain strong predictive  and explanatory information.  This component is especially  important because of the recent proliferation of large databases  containing vast numbers of potential input variables.  The  propos ed research will provide powerful new methods for selecting  such input variables for a wide variety of model building  situations.",
