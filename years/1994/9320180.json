By reusing existing  software, time and effort are saved in the testing and  maintenance phases of a software product.  The goals of this  research involve the measurement of reusability of software  in the object oriented paradigm and the investigation how  the process of reuse fits into the overall software  development lifecycle.  The effects of reuse on software  development are also being accessed.  In particular, what  costs are involved in retraining programmers to think about  reuse, to learn the object oriented paradigm, and to know  what reusable routines are available and how to use them.  Specifically, the goals of this research are:  (1) to  quantitatively measure object oriented designs and relate  them to aspects of the final code (complexity, reusability,  readability); (2) to identify the measurable qualities of  reusable software (costs, benefits); (3) to correlate  various aspects of reusability with programmer  characteristics; (4) to measure the effects of reusing  software on the process of software development (design,  coding, integration, testing, maintenance).    These goals are sought through an empirical study conducted  in a controlled academic environment.  After analysis and  refinement of the new suite of metrics, final validation  would involve one or more software vendors in another study  usilg production software systems and maintenance data.  ***",
