 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453748  Bendet    School-based SMART is an institutionalized model program designed  to encourage and educate elementary school-age girls to understand  that mathematics and science are important and  relevant to them.  SMART provides girls with active instructional  and motivational support in pursuing education and employment  opportunities in these fields.  It enhances the existent math  and science curricula by providing hands-on activities in a  single-sex environment that encourages girls to take risks and  learn by doing.  Every 4th and 5th grade girl in selected  schools is involved in the program, thus eliminating the  self-selection factor inherent in other  after-school models.    School-based SMART proposes to give young female students positive  and empowering experiences with science and mathematics within the  school setting.  The SMART model and curriculum give girls the  confidence to assume positions of leadership in their  co-educational classes.  Additionally, heightened administrative  awareness of gender equity issues, in relation to science and  mathematics, will be achieved as a result of the integration of the  SMART model.  Teacher in-service training and family education are  significant components included in the project's design.  The  project includes an outside evaluation and plans for national  dissemination through Girls Incorporated affiliates.  ***",
