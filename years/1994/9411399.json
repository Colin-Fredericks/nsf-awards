The legacy comprises  first the idealization of Einstein's theory of Brownian motion.  Wiener's work in this context constitutes the foundation of the  stochastic integration, stochastic differential equations, and  integration on infinite-dimensional spaces.. These three major fields  in probability have significant applications to engineering, control  theory, finance, and quantum physics. The legacy also includes Wiener's  work on generalized harmonic analysis, which has had numerous  ramifications, the most recent being the theory of wavelets, which in  turn is being used in the statistical application for the storage of  data. In addition, the legacy comprises the notions of capacity and  generalized solution of the Dirichlet problem, which in the 1990's has  received a beautiful extension to nonlinear PDE's of order p > 1.  Probabilistic ideas of Norbert Wiener have led to the solu ions of  fundamental problems of Potential Theory and Harmonic Analysis.  These areas are being actively pursued today and the Congress will  strive to inspire young probabilists and analysts to continue Wiener's  work in his innovative way.",
