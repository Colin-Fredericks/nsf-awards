 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  a  project  to  study  how  individuals  and  households are adapting to the momentous changes underway in  rural  areas  of the former Soviet Union.  In  collaboration  with  researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences,  the  project  team  will carry out a three wave  panel  study  of  residents  in  two  villages in Russia.  The  questionnaires  will be designed to collect extensive information about  the  social networks in which inviduals and families are enmeshed  in  order  to understand the role of connections and  social  support in adapting to rapid social change.        Prior  to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  it  was  next  to impossible for Western researchers to  collect  objective survey data on social life in rural Russia.  Since  the   downfall  of  communism  in  that  state,  rapid   and  disruptive changes in social and economic life are  underway  which are poorly understood.  It is now possible for Western  researchers  to  collect systematic empirical  data  on  the  changes  underway,  and  there is some  urgency  to  collect  baseline  information before these changes  have  progressed  too  far.   By  carrying out three waves of surveys  in  two  contrasting  villages, this project will help us  understand  the  dramatic changes that are occurring in rural Russia and  what their likely outcomes are.",
