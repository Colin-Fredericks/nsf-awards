 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mellon  9319406    Of the five major senses, olfaction has the least understood  central integrative mechanisms for analyzing olfactory stimuli.   Recent advances in understanding peripheral olfactory coding have  come from crustaceans, where the antenna of lobsters, crayfish and  crabs have proven valuable simple preparations.  This project  examines central coding, using electrophysiological recording in  the crayfish olfactory system to determine the stimulus/response  characteristics of individual nerve cells.  Central cells called  interneurons will be studied in a part of the brain called the  protocerebrum, which shows a sophisticated anatomical structuring  very like that in part of the mammalian olfactory system.   Responses of these interneurons will be compared to responses from  the peripheral primary neurons that converge on the interneurons,  using stimuli of single amino acid compounds and of particular  mixtures with systematically quantified differences.  These studies  will give information on how coded olfactory information is  handled, and which stimulus features are attended to by neurons at  this higher level in the olfactory system.  The effects of temporal  changes in stimulus delivery will be looked at to determine what  role pulsatile stimuli and adaptation may play in reception.   Responses during the antennular flicking behavior, which may be  analogous to sniffing, will be quantified to see whether flicking  modifies the neuronal sensitivity.  Results from this work on this  model system will have an impact on chemosensory neuroscience in  general, will increase our understanding of neural coding in  sensory systems, and may also be important for understanding  chemically-cued feeding and mating behavior of marine and aquatic  crustaceans with potential commercial impact.  ***",
