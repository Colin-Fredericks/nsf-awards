 "awd_abstract_narration": "93200097  Woodward  Dr. Woodward is developing a treatment of explanation and causation  with applications in both the natural and social sciences.  A  guiding theme of his study is that explanatory information is  information that is potentially relevant to controlling or  manipulating nature.  Another closely related themes that the sorts  of relationships that can be used to provide explanations must  satisfy an invariance requirement--they must be relationships that  will remain stable under some class of changes or interventions,  for these will be exactly the relationships that will support  potential manipulations.  These two themes provide a central part  of what Dr. Woodward takes to be the picture of causation and  explanation implicit in the contemporary econometrics literature.   In this research, he is extending and generalizing this picture to  produce a general theory that will enable us to understand and  assess the structure of different forms of explanation in the  natural and social sciences and in more common sensical contexts.   The theory he is developing will have interesting and somewhat  novel consequences for how we should understand laws of nature and  their role in explanation, for the role of derivational structure  in explanations, for the possibility of explanations that do not  appeal to laws, for the relationships between laws and  counterfactuals, for the assessment of probabilistic theories of  causation, and for understanding the role of idealization in  scientific theorizing.  ***",
