 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407268  Ablon   This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist from   the   University of California studying people and families impacted by a disease called   Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also called \"brittle bone disease\".   This is a genetic   disease  which causes extremely fragile bones.  Treatment sometimes involves drilling   out the long bones and inserting rods to strengthen the limbs.  The researcher will   interview in depth a sample of individuals affected by the disease, about their life   histories, coping strategies, and self images.  The investigator will also observe   interactions at OI Foundation meetings.  The analysis will describe the existential issues   involved in growing up in a body so fragile that bones can be broken simply by swinging   one's leg; specifically how one develops a concept of intimacy when even slight physical   touching can break bones.  The nature of family adaptations to having a member with OI   will be described, as well as social stereotypes and psychological consequences of   childhood spent undergoing extensive often painful medical procedures.   This research is important because it will help us understand the nature of stigma,   physical disability, body self-images, chronic illness, and genetic diseases by providing   an extensive and careful case study of a population who can not take for granted the   physical protection of their own skeletal systems, and who must organize their daily lives   around physical fragility.  Knowing how sufferers from this extreme condition cope and   establish their lives will be useful to everyone who experiences  similar disabilities.",
