Two projects will be in the area of corporate law and  corporate bankruptcy, and two projects will be in the area of  litigation and settlement.  In the area of corporate law and  corporate bankruptcy, the Principal Investigator will first analyze  transactions in which controlling blocks in corporations are  purchased.  The second project will examine the consequences of  providing secured creditors with full priority in bankruptcy.  In  the litigation and settlement area, one project will consider suits  that are known to be made solely to extract a settlement offer.  In  the second project, the Principal Investigator will examine the  strategic effects that lawyer-client fee arrangements can have in  bargaining over settlement.    To analyze these issues, the Principal Investigator will develop  econometric models to test the formal assumptions underlying each  problem.",
