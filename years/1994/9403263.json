 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403263  Chu     Cardueline finch (subfamily Carduelinae, family Fringillidae)  species exhibit considerable interspecific differences in plumage  colors, and extent to which it varies with age.  Comparative  methods will be employed to test hypotheses about the evolution of  plumage coloration patterns among cardueline lineages: cladistic  analyses will be performed on morphological and behavioral  characters.  That framework will then serve to anchor further  research on the evolution of plumage characters (including their  variation with age) and the evolution of carotenoid - based color  displays.  %%%  More is known of control and function of plumage coloration in  cardueline finches than for any other group of passerine birds, but  investigation into even this group have been hampered by the lack  of a robust phylogeny.  Substantial progress with this taxon will  provide a procedural model for similar analyses of additional taxa  in the future, and as a demonstration of the puissance of rigorous  systematic methods in elaborating evolutionary \"adornment\" among  vertebrate fauna.  Systematics provides a fundamental \"guide\" for  study of other facets of any given taxon's biology, within the  context of the planet's overwhelming biodiversity.  ***",
