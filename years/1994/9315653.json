 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315653  Martindale    Ctenophores are the first extant phylum of metazoan  organisms whose body plan displays bilateral symmetry and  evolved prior to the divergence of the protostomes and  deuterostomes. Abundant evidence now exists which indicates  that the major pattern forming mechanisms were in place  prior to the protostome-deuterostome radiation. Ctenophores  undergo a highly stereotyped mode of development in which  the normal fate of individual blastomeres can be precisely  predicted. Adult structures derived from deleted blasotmeres  are not replaced by surviving blastomeres during subsequent  embryogenesis. Adult ctenophores on the other hand are  capable of regenerating vast regions of their body,  including all pattern elements and cell types. Dr.  Martindale's prior work has shown that ctenophore embryos  are not mosaics of individual parts but that they have  \"organizing centers\" analogous in their function to the  dorsal lip in vertebrate embryos and the D quadrant in  spiralian embryos. The deletion of this organizing center in  ctenophore embryos results in abnormal development of  several different structures to which these deleted cells  themselves make no direct contribution. This implies that,  as in adult regeneration, the embryo requires intercellular  signaling. The experiments proposed here will advance our  understanding of the mechanistic basis of  this pattern  regulation both in the ctenophore embryo and adult. The  specific aims are: 1) To generate an accurate fate map of  the ctenophore embryo to identify the origins of all known  cell types, with special reference to the origins of nerve  cells, mesenchymal cells, muscle cells, components of  tentacle sheathes, and the pluripotent stem cells involved  in adult regenerative ability, 2) to identify the spatial  and temporal characteristics of inductive interactions which  operate to establish global symmetry properties and cell  type determination in the ctenophore embryo, 3) To finish a  systematic study of the r ole of  individual cell types on  the ability of ctenophores to regenerate, and 4) To  determine the role of cell division in the ability to  regenerate adult pattern elements.  Additionally, tools will  be developed for the study of homeodomain transcription  factor genes expressed in ctenophore embryos.  ***",
