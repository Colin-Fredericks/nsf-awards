 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353760  Frank       The goal of the project is to increase the curricular  resources available for improving the science education of both  females and males.  These curricular resources will help middle  school life sciences students and high school biology students to:    o    view science as an exploratory activity, done by real people,       and involving hands-on, inquiry approaches; and    o    expand their image of scientists to include women from diverse       groups and time periods.    Specifically, this short-term, highly-focused project will develop,  review, and test a set of instructional and motivational drop-in  modules for middle school life science and introductory high school  biology classes which will allow teachers to easily integrate  information about female science role models into the curriculum  while increasing the hands-on, inquiry approaches used in class.   These materials will be coordinated with curricular goals for  introductory biology and with the goals and methods proposed by  national standards projects, including the National Research  Council's Science Education Standards Project, AAAS' Project 2061,  and NSTA's Scope, Sequence, and Coordination.       The modules will be evaluated in middle and high school  classrooms for their usefulness and student impact.  Teachers  participating in this in-class evaluation will include participants  in the American Physiological Society's (APS) Summer Research  Program for High School Teachers and in the Ohio State Systemic  Initiative - Project Discovery.  In addition, the modules will be  evaluated by participants in a series of workshops for high school  and middle school teachers at meetings of the National Association  of Biology Teachers, the National Science Teachers Association, the  American Association for the Advancement of Science, the  Association for Women in Science, and the American Physiological  Society.  Finally, the modules will be reviewed by the National  Association of Biology Teachers' Publica tions Review Team, the APS  Education Committee, and the APS Committee on Women in Physiology.       The materials will be disseminated widely through workshops  and notices from an alliance of professional associations,  including the APS, AAAS, AWIS, NABT, and NSTA.  In addition, the  APS will disseminate the materials via workshops with teachers at  each of its annual meetings in coming years.  ***",
