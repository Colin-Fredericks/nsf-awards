 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450690  Crouch     Curricular changes are proposed that will introduce chemical  principles in the context of relevant issues (the environment,  health care, utilization of energy, etc.).  Instead of teaching  chemical concepts in the conventional fashion (of  microscopic-to-  macroscopic), our approach will begin by  identifying the concepts associated with some chemical system;  thereafter, the system will be studied from the top down,  presenting and explaining chemical details on a \"need-to-know\"  basis.  These approaches will require using techniques that  significantly enhance the amount of active learning that will  take place in classrooms and laboratories, with a concomitant  emphasis on learning by doing rather than by listening.  There  will be extensive computer utilization for allowing interactive  independent study and self-testing, and for nomenclature,  chemical bonding, etc.  Appropriate uses of information  technologies will reduce dramatically the amount of time needed  for conventional classroom lecturing, and provide, instead,  time for identifying and understanding the unity, coherence,  and relevance of various chemical concepts.  Laboratory  settings will stress group-learning and team-oriented  experiments so that students may cooperate in solving  laboratory problems without merely following a cookbook, and in  some cases, without the costs of providing each student with a  full set of laboratory tools.  To plan a broad revision of the  curriculum, two types of workshops will be held.  Faculty from  small colleges, where innovative educational modes have already  been introduced, will be invited to the first workshop to  present ideas and discuss ways to implement such changes in the  environment of a large university.  A second  workshop will  invite participants form various Michigan State University  departments that require chemistry courses as part of their  curriculum.  This workshop will focus on planning actual course  outlines to better serve the needs of the  clients, while  maintaining the elements of the proposed curricular revisions.  ***y",
