 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a theoretical and modeling effort to determine the  effects of the Greenland ice sheet on the rotation and gravity field of  Earth.  To accomplish the goals, the secular and interannual changes in  the geopotential, the position in the Earth's rotation axis and certain  other parameters, such as center-of-mass motion and length of day will  be calculated from mass balance changes in ice.  The largest  gravitational effects of ice thickness change shown in simple models are  up to many times higher than the observed effects. This suggests that  the viscous response of the mantle to long term changes in ice loading  may be cancelling some of the elastic response.  Current changes in  gravity and crustal motion depend critically on the time lagged response  of the Earth's mantle to previous loading histories, lasting as long as  tens of thousands of years.  Spatial and temporal changes in mass  balance from late Pleistocene deglaciation and the subsequent  interglacial period will be combined with current mass balance estimates  to assemble time histories for ice thickness throughout the ice sheet.  From these histories, the elastic results for gravity, rotation and  deformation can be corrected by the use of glacial rebound models, such  as the visco-elastic spherical Earth model. The viscous correction to  the elastic loading for several cases of late Pleistocene deglaciation  and more recent thickness change will be calculated for various upper  and lower mantle viscosity profiles.  A 20 kilometer by 20 kilometer  grid will provide means of projecting the viscous rebound rates for the  point mass model into the non-pointlike structure of the Greenland ice  sheet.    In addition to gravity, the components of crustal deformation and tilt  are important in geodetic measurements from space.  This project will  also assess the impact that future observational improvements will have  on understanding the mass balance of Greenland.  The observational  improvements are anticipated fr om global positioning system (GPS)  studies and studies involving satellites that use laser ranging.    The use of existing gridded meteorological, accumulation, ablation, and  ice thickness data, along with ice flow models to predict future ice  thickness changes in Greenland is expected to greatly reduce the  difficulty in calculating gravity coefficients and crustal motion for  both the elastic and viscous cases. The effects of the possible changes  in the position of the upper boundary of appreciable summer snow melt  that roughly follows the periphery of the ice sheet  called the Benson  line  can be used to predict vertical motion near the ice sheet boundary  and the results may be checked against sea level records, where they  exist. Greenland strain and velocity data may be used to estimate  retention time of new accumulation and the rates of discharge at the  perimeter of the ice sheet.  The sensitivity of ice model contributions  to the total mass loss (or gain) to the oceans and to changes in other  ice systems will also be investigated.    Anticipated results include high resolution surface models of gravity,   deformation, and tilt for the Greenland Ice Sheet, based on refinements  of existing models of ice thickness change, and corrected for the  viscous response of the mantle.  Since these results are expected to  fall within the detectable range of GPS receivers and possibly absolute  gravity meters, they may be tested against space and ground based  geodetic observations.  This research will lead to a better  understanding of the dynamic relationship between ice sheets and Earth's  crust.",
