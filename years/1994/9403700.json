 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403700  Andrews    Under the direction of Dr. E. Wyllys Andrews, Ms. Cassandra Bill  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze  a large series of ceramics excavated from the site of Copan in  Honduras. Copan was a major Mayan center which supported a large  population and is marked by impressive stone temple mounds. Under  the direction of Dr. Andrews three seasons of excavation resulted  in the exposure of a royal compound consisting of residential  buildings as well as special purpose structures. The dates  indicate that two periods are represented. The first marks the  height of Copan's power while the second relates to the polity's  decline. Large stratigraphically secure samples of ceramics were  recovered which fall within each of these intervals. Ms. Bill  will analyze these materials from a number of perspectives. She  will carry out a standard stylistic analysis. In addition she  will attempt to determine the functional characteristics of  vessels, reconstruct the manufacturing process and conduct a  technological analysis of the clay fabric. On this basis she will  gain insight into how ceramic production and use changed over  time.    Because ceramics preserve well and are abundant in many  archaeological sites, they have traditionally provided a focus  for archaeological analysis. In recent years, researchers have  come to realize that such material can not only provide insight  into cultural affiliation and chronology, but also can be used to  gain understanding of economic and social organization. A group  of scholars, including Ms. Bill are developing new techniques to  further this end. The situation at Copan provides an excellent  context for such studies because the two ceramic collections are  not only large and well dated, but they represent a single  culture at very distinct stages of its development and decline.  Thus the secure archaeological framework provides an excellent  context to develop and test analytic techniques.    This research is impor tant for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many Middle Americanist archaeologists. It  will assist in the development of analytic techniques which may  be used in many archaeological situations. Finally it will assist  in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
