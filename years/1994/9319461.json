Columbia University  Title:    Three Dimensional Modeling of Dynamical Interactions with            Convective, Radiative and Surface Fluxes Over the            Tropical Pacific    This project will concern the interaction between the convective,  radiative and surface fluxes over the Pacific sector with an  emphasis on the west Pacific.  The PIs will use a newly developed,  efficient and accurate, global, linear primitive equation model  together with parameterizations of moist convection, radiative  transfer and boundary layer processes.  The ultimate goal of the  work is to improve model representation of these processes in order  to improve model simulations of the large scale variables  (especially near surface properties) necessary for continued  progress in simulation and prediction of climate variability on  time scales of months to decades.  Verification of model physics  will hence be based on observations of these processes within the  TOGA COARE domain and also on their effect on simulation of the  large scale circulation.  The PIs are especially interested in  being able to model the observed limited scale of convection and  convective anomalies, errors in which currently create large errors  in modelled surface winds.  This work will proceed through  experiments with observed SST forcing and through studies of the  role of the radiative, convection and surface fluxes in  determination of the character and organization of propagating  convective disturbances.  Another focus of the work will be on the  surface energy budget of the west Pacific.  The PIs will aim to  reconcile estimates of the flux, and its components, derived from  the atmospheric modeling work with other estimates derived from  ocean SST modeling and with the TOGA COARE data.  The various roles  of convection, radiation and boundary layer processes in  determining the surface flux will be analyzed.    This research is important because it seeks to clarify proces ses  important for understanding climate variability.  It is funded  under the TOGA COARE program.",
