 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traineeships will fund 5 graduate students at North Carolina State  University to pursue doctoral research in the interdisciplinary  area of high performance computing within the context of a specific  application.  Their training will equip them to perform research in  area of national need that specifically incorporate high  performance computing.  Trainees and the faculty directing their  research will be affiliated with the newly revitalized Center for  Research in Scientific Computation (CRSC).  Students' training will  utilize two recently developed curricula at NCSU:  the  Concentration in Computational mathematics (CMA), which is an  option for graduate students in applied mathematics, and the  Computational Engineering and Sciences (CES) program, an  interdisciplinary program in the colleges of Engineering and  Physical and Mathematical Sciences administered by one of the  Principal Investigators (PIs) of this proposal.  Trainees' academic  programs will include interdisciplinary research seminars focusing  on application of high performance computing; participation in  regional and national research conferences; opportunities to  collaborate with researchers in industrial and international  settings; and instruction in teaching.  In addition to the  technical PIs (Banks and Turinsky) and an administrative PI(King),  the Traineeship program will involve several highly active research  mathematician, scientist, and engineers.  Traineeships will  substantially boost our recent progress in designing programs for  outstanding students in scientific computation.",
