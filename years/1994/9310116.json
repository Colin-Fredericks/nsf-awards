Specifically, is  a traditional stratification model most appropriate or can a social  network analysis be used to account for individual variability, and  are there factors relevant to the determination of the network  score that may be unique to the American Deaf community? Videotaped  data will be collected in eight representative geographical  regions, in group sessions and in individual interviews. Informants  will include White and African_American native or near-native user  of ASL in three age groups controlled for socioeconomic status. The  data will be examined for phonological, lexical, and  morphosyntactic variables, and the internal and external  constraints on these variables will be described, using the Varbrul  program. Social network scores will be calculated for selected  informants and correlated for their linguistic behavior. The study  has both theoretical and practical importance: it will contribute  to our understanding of ASL as a human language at a time when the  instruction of ASL is rapidly expanding both for hearing adults and  children and for deaf children.   ***",
