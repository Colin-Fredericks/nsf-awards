 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318983  This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist  at a predominantly undergraduate institution, Cal State Long  Beach.  The researcher will study of immigrant Maya Indians from  Mexico have changed their conceptions and expectations of aged  people as a result of their experiences in the U.S.  Using  technical quantitative sorting analyses of terms denoting aging,  the anthropologist will describe the cognitive models of aging of  a sample of Mayans.  This analysis will then be combined with  more traditional interviewing and observational data to provide a  description and analysis of the condition of aging among this  immigrant community.     This research is important because as both the aged and  immigrants become a larger proportion of U.S. society, the need  becomes greater to increase understanding of their condition.  These understandings will be valuable to planners in any  community where immigrants form a distinct population.  ***",
