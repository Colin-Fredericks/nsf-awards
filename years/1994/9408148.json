 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being unrelated genetically, monogamous mates have some  interests in common, others at odds.  Where costly  biparental care is provided to nidicolous young, the sexual  partnership is likely to be a complex mixture of cooperation  and selfishness:  each individual may enhance its lifetime  reproductive success by getting its partner to supply the  greater investment.  Recent ESS models predict that such a  parent should compensate only partially for any shortfall by  its mate, yet should become more generous as its own future  (its residual reproductive value) diminishes.  Because many  factors influence life-history parameters asymmetrically  according to gender, the ESS approach leads to novel  predictions regarding the parental division of labor.  The  proposed field observations and experiments on house  sparrows will explore these dynamics.  Parental labor  required for provisioning the brood will be artificially  increased (by slightly encumbering one parent with small  lead fishing weights affixed temporarily to the rectrices)  and the food-delivery performances of both the taxed parent  and its mate will be recorded.  At the same time their daily  energy expenditures will be assessed via the doubly-labelled  water technique.  At other nests, the costs of parental care  will be artificially decreased (via food supplementations)  and the impact on both male and female parents will be  determined.  Because house sparrows are remarkably sedentary  and breed multiply within a season, it should be possible to  make robust assessments of how increased parental exertion  affects both future adult reproductive performance and  current-brood recruitment.  The overall goals of the initial  support period are:  (1)  to examine the separate costs of  male and female parental care at three levels (in terms of  behavior, energy expenditure, and future reproductive  success);  (2)  to measure the impact of variable levels of  parental provisioning on whole broods of offspring;  (3)  to   tailor ESS models of biparental care so as to account for  observed differences between males and females in this  particular system;  (4)  to test several key predictions  from current ESS models about how parental effort and sex  differences in effort should relate to its costs; and  (5)  to assess whether discontinuation of partnerships from one  nesting cycle to the next is contingent on disruptions of  the relative workloads of each parent.",
