Whitmire, Rice University, and Jean-Yves Saillard, University of  Rennes.  The objective of their research is to perform  experimental and theoretical studies on a class of large cobalt-  bismuth cluster compounds, an organometallic cluster recently  discovered by Dr. Whitmire's group.  Large cluster compounds are  important for studies on main-group and transition metals, and on  separating molecules and solids.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in  the synthesis and characterization of large bismuth cobalt  clusters and in experimental studies of main group elements and  transition metals. This is complemented by the French group's  expertise in small organometallic cluster molecules and extended  solid state structures, which are important to understanding  bonding of these molecules. They have worked on methods for   determining orbital structure for both organometallic cluster  complexes and extended solid state arrays.  This project will  advance understanding of the formation of complex molecules of  main group and transition metal atoms and their chemical  reactivity.  ***",
