The teachers  will be grouped with 30 elementary teachers the first year, 30  middle school teachers the second and 30 secondary school teachers.   Each of the three workshops will receive an intensive (seven hours  per day) six week content enrichment in geography, including map  skills and training in using GIS.  These same teachers will also  develop leadership skills and contribute to the development of an  in-service training manual to be used with teachers during the  academic year.  These seminars will be conducted by University  personnel and summer teacher participants.    The first cadre of teachers will begin their training during the  summer of 1994 with other sessions in 1995 and 1996.  The cost  share of this project is 36% of the face value of the Foundation  award.  ***",
