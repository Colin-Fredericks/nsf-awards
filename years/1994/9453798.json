 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453798  Dusenbery    The Space Science Institute of Boulder, Colorado in partnership  with the Franklin Institute Science Museum and the Electric  Producers Research Institute will develop a 3000 sq. ft. traveling  exhibit entitled Electric Space: Exploring Our Plasma Universe.   Visitors to the exhibit will be introduced to the physics of the  sun and the polar aurora.  They will learn about the effect solar  variability has on technology and humans working in space.  The  exhibit is divided into seven sections: Space is Not Empty;  SkyWatchers; Plasma: the Fourth State of Matter; The Dynamic Sun;  Planet Earth: a Great Magnet; Reaching Toward the Starts: the  Heliosphere; and The Cosmic Connection.  Its design is guided by  the desire to create a total immersion environment that will allow  visitors to explore the many realm of the plasma university from  Earth's upper atmosphere to distant galaxies.  It is the developers  intention to demystify science by concentrating on process rather  than facts, to create a stimulating informal learning environment,  to reach a diverse audience, to motivate young people to pursue  science as an interest and a career, and to have the exhibit serve  as an interface between the scientific community and the general  public.  In addition to the exhibit, supplemental curriculum  modules using an inquiry-based approach will be developed in  cooperation with the Science Discovery Project at the University of  Colorado.  These materials will provide teachers, students, and  parents the opportunity to explore the concepts presented in the  exhibit.  An extensive evaluation plan will be carried.  The  exhibit will open at the Maryland Science Center the summer of  1995.  It will then travel to nine major US cities reaching an  estimated two million adults and children who represent a great  diversity of ages and education an ethnic backgrounds.",
