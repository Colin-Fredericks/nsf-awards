 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-based training simulations can do more than teach facts and specialized skills, they can help students learn the high level skills involved in finding and evaluating information, solving problems, cooperating with colleagues, and resolving conflicts.  While the simulators used to train pilots or tank crews are very expensive, new generation of authoring tools will enable low-cost development of many broadly-used training and education simulations.  The new simulations will use personal computers and will build on evolving work on digital libraries and multimedia techniques.  The new authoring tools incorporate knowledge-based techniques for model-based simulation, automated planning, and concept-based information retrieval.  Military applications have demonstrated successful applications of these knowledge-based  techniques.  Authoring tools that package these techniques will allow trainers to develop simulations that adapt to varying learning levels and accommodate the opportunistic, exploratory behaviors of individual learners.  Reuse of the authoring tools, domain knowledge, digital libraries, help modules, and other software components will spread development costs over many simulations and make it cost effective to develop simulations that dramatically extend the effectiveness of training and education software.",
