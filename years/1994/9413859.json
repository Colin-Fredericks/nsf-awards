 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413859  Haroun, Medhat    This is an instrumentation award.  The instrumentation is for a  shake table capable of simulating earthquake motions on a 30,000  lb payload (up to 50,000 lbs) in both the horizontal and vertical  directions with strokes of + 10 and + 5 inches, respectively.  A  unique aspect of the earthquake engineering research thrust at  UCI is its emphasis on seismic safety engineering based on risk  and reliability considerations, and its innovative development in  control engineering for seismic protection of structures.  The  acquisition of the shake table would increase UCI's research and  teaching capabilities and aid in establishment of a unique large  testing facility in Southern California, an area prone to  earthquakes yet with no major facility of this size.  Such a  table is essential for experimental verification of new  theoretical results, as well as the development of innovative  control devices and of effective retrofit techniques.  The shake  table will enable researchers to study the collapse mechanisms of  structures such as bridges and highway systems, lifelines,  buildings, and secondary systems under combined horizontal and  vertical earthquake motions with large amplitude displacements  and to investigate the effectiveness of seismic protective  systems, including active, passive, and hybrid systems subjected  to both horizontal and vertical ground motions.  The shake table  will also enhance UCI's potential as an interactive/training  center from engineers from the Pacific rim countries.  UCI is in  an excellent position to collaborate with industry for testing  equipment, secondary systems and structural contents.  ***",
