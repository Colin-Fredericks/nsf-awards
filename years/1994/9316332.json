This meeting is  sponsored by the comparative physiology and biochemistry  sections of the American Physiological Society (primary  sponsor), the American Society of Zoologists, the Canadian  Society of Zoologists, the British Society for Experimental  Biology and the German Society of Zoologists.  The theme of  the meeting is \"Regulation, Integration, Adaptation:  A  Species Approach\".  The proposed symposium, which is the  first of its kind, will bring together an international  cadre of researchers using a variety of animal model systems  in which to study basic mechanisms of calcium regulation.  The symposium will use a multidisciplinary approach to  discuss calcium balance at levels ranging from whiole animal  processes down through epithelial/subcellular mechanisms and  ultimately to molecular control.  Model animal systems will  include crustaceans, fish, amphibians, birds, and reptiles.  This integrated approach will have applicability to a wide  range of physiological disciplines.  The symposium will be  published in the journal Physiological Zoology.  ***",
