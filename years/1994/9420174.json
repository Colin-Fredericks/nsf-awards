 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420174  Fasman  Membrane proteins, such as receptors, ion channels, transport  channels, hormone receptors, etc. represent an important class of  proteins.  Understanding their structure would reveal important  aspects of their functional role.  However, crystallization of  membrane proteins has proven to be difficult and this has raised  major stumbling blocks to obtaining their three-dimensional  structure.  To date, the structures of only a few membrane proteins  have been determined by X-ray diffraction studies or by electron  microscopy.  The proposed studies are to further develop a new  approach for the crystallization of membrane proteins by making  them water soluble by conjugation to methoxypolyethylene glycol  (mPEG), a water soluble polymer.  These conjugates have already  been formed with two membrane proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and porin  and have been found capable of refolding to their native  structures.  Preliminary experiments have shown that one of these  conjugates, mPEG porin, can be crystallized, but the crystals are  as yet too small for X-ray diffraction studies.  Research is  proposed to further develop the method to a point where useful  crystals can be obtained routinely and to carry out X-ray  diffraction studies with one or more of these protein conjugates.  ***",
