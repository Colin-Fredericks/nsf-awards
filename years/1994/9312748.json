 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312748  Whitley       A grammar tree encodes a cellular developmental process that  can develop whole families of Boolean neural networks.  The  development process resembles biological cell division.  A single  cell executes a program specified by a grammar tree and undergoes  cell division to develop a complete neural network capable of  computing specific target functions.  A genetic algorithm is used  to find a grammar tree that yields both architecture and weights  specifying a particular neural network for solving specific Boolean  functions, such as parity and symmetry problems.  Because cellular  encodings include recursive descriptions, the resulting \"genetic  code\" is much smaller than the neural networks that are developed  from these codes.  Preliminary research has also shown the  effectiveness of very simple Hebbian learning for speeding up the  evolution of grammar trees.  The proposed research will continue to  develop grammar trees that specify neural networks for a wider  variety of applications as well as to develop more sophisticated  learning models to use in combination with cellular development.   The specification of nonBoolean networks must be investigated so as  generalized the types of networks that can be generated by cellular  development.  Genetic algorithms are being used to evolve the  grammar tree for the cellular development process; as a result,  learning algorithms that have minimal computational requirements  will be investigated",
