 "awd_abstract_narration": "19316288  Georgakakos    One of the most important problems in hydroclimatology is to  understand the linkage between short period climate variability and  surface hydrologic variability on regional to continental scales.   We propose to study the relation between regional to continental  scales.  We propose to study the relation between regional-  continental scales hydrologic processes and monthly-decade  atmospheric variations using observed data, large-scale watershed  budgets and conceptual models to test hypothesized physical  mechanisms.  While data availability precludes a comprehensive  study over all of North America, the conterminous United States  domain includes a well-observed and important segment of the  spatial and temporal variability contained by the continent.  Fifty  years of daily outflows through  the boundaries of the continental  United States have been determined based on observations recorded  by U.S.G.S. stations.  By integrating over monthly, seasonal and  annual totals, effects of storage and diversion are minimized.   This newly created database will be used together with existing  climatic databases that span several decades.  Primary goals of the  study include: (a) determination of the spatio-temporal scales of  the continental-United States outflow:  (b) study sub-continental  and regional hydrologic budgets of the conterminous United States;  (c) identification of forcing/feedback mechanisms active on those  scales in the atmosphere-land system.  The proposed research is a  two year interdisciplinary effort involving the hydrology Research  group of the University of Iowa and the climate research group of  the Scripps Institutional of Oceanography.  The proposed research  is in line with the stated research areas of the NRC report on  Opportunities in the Hydrologic Sciences (NRC, 1991, see also  Georgakakos, 1992), as it tackles the issues of continental and  regional scale   hydrology and atmosphere/land surface interaction.   Also, the proposed study is hig hly relevant to the GEWEX  (Continental Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) Continental-Scale   International Project (GCIP).",
