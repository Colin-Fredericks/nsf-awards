 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the investigation, design and  implementation of high performance VLSI architectures for two  dimensional pattern matching and recognition.  Although several  hardware algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the  one-dimensional pattern (string) matching problem and its  variations, very little work has been done in the area of hardware  algorithms for matching and recognition of two-dimensional   patterns.  Most of the research has been aimed at efficient  software algorithms based on different features and matching  strategies.  Many pattern matching applications need real-time  response, perform number of repetitive computations on different  data sets, make use of regular and local operations, are modular,  and have a fair amount of inherent parallelism.  The design of  special purpose hardware for pattern matching could speed up the  task considerably, making it amenable for real-time applications.    Specifically, the main objectives of this research are    . Develop new and efficient hardware algorithms and VLSI chips for  a class of pattern matching problems such as scene matching,  approximate string matching, polygon matching and tree matching.    . Design and develop an application specific system architecture  for pattern matching and recognition through integration of the  above mentioned VLSI components at board level.",
