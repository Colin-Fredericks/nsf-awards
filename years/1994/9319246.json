 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319246  Haydock  This is a proposal based generically on the elctronic structure of  disordered materials; the disorder may be glassy, it may be in the  form of a disordered overlayer or it may simply be the presence of  a surface.  Tight binding techniques will be used to examine these  systems implemented primarily via the recursion method. ( 1) In  glassy systems like amorphous graphitic carbon, the validity of an  approximately conserved momentum-like quantum number, resulting  from the preservation of local real-space order, will be studied.  (2) The reason why metal atoms randomly distributed on a  semiconductor surface produce metallic contacts at low surface  coverage (and the degree of localization with coverage) will be  studied.  (3) The linear and non-linear collective response of  electrons to external fields (both above and below the plasmon  threshold) at metal surfaces will be studied to understand the  anisotropy of second harmonic generation.  %%%  This is a numerically intensive proposal to study several aspects  of disorder in solids.  The disorder may be at the level of glassy  3D structure; at the level of randomly placed atoms on an otherwise  ordered crystalline semiconductor substrate; or even at the level  of the presence of a surface in an crystal. In the first case, the  project looks for certain spectroscopic invariants due to the  glassy structure.  In the second case, the work involves explaining  why metal atoms deposited at low coverages on a semiconductor  surface give rise to conductivity.  And in the third case, the work  tries to understand why systems which we expect to be very  isotropic have a very anisotropic response when their surfaces  scatter externally impinging laser light.  ***",
