Fundamental to understanding the molecular  basis of pathogenicity is to determine how virulence factors are  modulated.  Furthermore, the organization and function of genes  required for biosynthesis of bacterial phytotoxins has not been  intensively studied.  A long-term goal of this research is to  elucidate mechanisms that regulate coronatine production in P.  syringae.  Coronatine has a unique structure derived from two  unrelated biosynthetic pathways:  coronafacic acid (CFA) is of  polyketide origin, whereas coronamic acid (CMA), is an  ethylcyclopropyl amino acid derived from isoleucine.  These two  components are substrate feeding studies and complementation  analyses have been used to identify regions of the coronatine  biosynthetic cluster required for CFA and CMA production and the  coupling (cpl) gene which catalyze amide bond formation.  In this  work, Northern blot analyses and transcriptional fusions will be  utilized to elucidate the transcriptional organization and  regulation of the coronatine biosynthetic cluster.  The nature of  the cpl promoter and factors which regulated the cpl transcript  will be identified using primer extension, deletion analysis and  gene fusions.  The protein product of cpl will be overproduced and  used to study its enzymatic activity in vitro.  The results will  significantly enhance our understanding of the regulatory controls  and biosynthetic mechanisms employed in phytotoxin production.   This work is part of an international collaborative effort to  understand the mode of action, biosynthesis, and regulation or  coronatine production in P. syringae.    %%%  This research will aid in our understanding of how some bacteria  are able to infect plants while others cannot.  ***",
