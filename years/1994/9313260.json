The investigator plans to address  these issues both theoretically and experimentally by developing  new experimental techniques for analyzing pore scale  infiltration, validation of existing the existing theory  regarding unsteady infiltration in heterogeneous soils, and  improvement of the models that result from additional theoretical  effort and experimental validation.    Results of this project are expected to be utilized in  engineering design of water and wastewater management systems  that involve seepage from surface locations through soil and into  groundwater aquifers.  The work is also expected to develop new  laboratory methods and techniques for study of fluid behavior in  heterogeneous porous media, thus assisting in applying resultant  models in the engineering design of fluid management systems such  as artificial wetlands for wastewater treatment and cutoff walls  for containment of water, wastewater or hazardous wastes.",
