Each class meets three hours per week in a classroom for  lecture, and two times per week in a networked computer laboratory  with Maple to investigate mathematical concepts. Most of the time  in the laboratory is spent working on short problems that can be  reasonably completed during one class period. Students are also  expected to complete four or five larger laboratory projects that  involve multistep investigation of a concept. They work on these  projects for a week or more in assigned groups. Use of Maple for  calculus relieves students of some frustration with computations,  and allows instructors to expect students to concentrate on more  conceptual questions. Less time is spent in traditional lectures,  and more time is spent graphing.  Performing algebraic  manipulations and computations is minimized.",
