 "awd_abstract_narration": "Holmes  9408813  This proposal describes one of the first extensive efforts to  understand how a specific RNA molecule is recognized by a protein  and modified at a specific position.  This protein, M1G  Methyltransferase which is encoded by the trmD gene, introduces a  methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine into the 1 position of  quanine at position 37 for a number of tRNA species.  Here we propose to first, determine what tRNA structures are  required enzyme recognition.  This will be accomplished by the  synthesis then in vitro expression of synthetic tRNA genes to  produce unmodified variant molecules.  Methylation of these  substrates should indicate which structures are essential for  maximum binding and/or catalytic activity. Binding will be assessed  by a zonal electrophoretic method.  A major question to be  addressed here will be whether specific base residues or general  tRNA structure be important for protein-RNA interaction.  We will explore the nature of complexes formed using chemical,  physical, and enzymatic methodologies which may determine the rough  conformation of RNA-protein complexes.  For example will protein  interact with a large or small portion of the tRNA molecules and  will enzyme interact with only one face of the tRNA?  We propose to determine if M1G Transferase can bind tRNA like  structures in mRNA encoding that enzyme.  It appears that enzyme  production in vivo is somehow limited suggesting an autoregulatory  mechanism.  In order to test this, synthetic transcripts from  various sites in the trmD operon will be prepared in vitro and  utilized as substrates for enzyme using radiolabeled AdoMet.  Finally, we will identify regions of M1G Transferase involved in  tRNA binding and recognition.  This will be accomplished by the  analysis of selected mutant enzymes which we believe cannot  interact properly with tRNA.  %%%  This research is aimed at determining how cellular enzymes very  specific RNA molecules in cells than introduce changes in the  structure of th ose molecules.  We have focused on one specific  system which involves the methylation of a specific tRNA molecules  found in the bacterium E. coli.  The enzyme (M1G Transferase)  places a methyl group at a very specific position on that tRNA  which is required for the correct function of that RNA molecules in  protein synthesis.  Most of the RNA molecules in all cells are  modified in various ways in order that they can function correctly  in normal cell growth. Ours is one of the first proposals of this  kind aimed at determining how RNA is modified and it is likely that  all cells will use mechanisms which may be elucidated in this  study.  In order to study this problem we must prepare synthetic tRNA which  can be acted upon by the enzyme.  This can be done in the test tube  using new technologies for the synthesis of totally synthetic RNA  molecules.  We can and will prepare modified forms of tRNA in order  to determine what structures in the RNA are important for how the  enzyme recognizes the tRNA molecule among many different kinds of  cellular tRNA.  In addition we will use chemical and enzymatic  methods to get an idea about what the complex between RNA and  protein may look like.  Such knowledge permits us to speculate  about the exact mechanisms required for recognition and may provide  information of great general value helping us to study how enzymes  from many other cells may carry out similar modifications.  Finally, we will begin making structural changes in the enzyme in  order to determine what protein structures are required for the  recognition and binding of RNA.  The proposal outlined here impinges on important questions of  biological specificity.  For example, how does RNA correctly  participate in accurate protein synthesis which is essential for  life in all cells?  We believe this work impinges on many broader  problems about RNA structure and function and will be useful in  understanding many cellular events involving RNA.  ***",
