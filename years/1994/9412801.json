 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT-9412801  Crawford  This project supports the continued participation of Dr. Tadesse  Mesfin of Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, in an ongoing study in  plant molecular phylogenetics, led by Dr. Daniel Crawford of Ohio  State University, (NSF Grant INT-9025030), of the systematics and  evolution of the genus Coreopsis (Asteraceae).  Both South America  and Eastern Africa represent centers of diversity for Coreopsis  that equal or surpass that found in North America.  The  collaborative component with the Ethiopian partner is  investigating the relationship of North American Coreopsis to  African plants that have been variously assigned to Bidens or  Coreopsis.    During this extension of his research cooperation at Ohio State,  the Ethiopian scientist will pursue the following goals:  (1) make  further morphological and anatomical studies on particularly South  American species of Coreopsis and selected North and South  American species of Bidens; (2) continue the search for diagnostic  features in Bidens and Coreopsis from particularly reproductive  features; (3) complete the description of the remaining species of  North American species of Coreopsis (27 of the 44 species have  been described and sketched so far); (4) produce a scheme that  reveals the relationships between Bidens and Coreopsis in the Old  versus the New World taxa. The visiting scientist is gaining  familiarity with additional techniques and methods, such as enzyme  electrophoresis, how to study DNA for systematic purposes, using  cladistics for generating phylogenies, etc.  When he returns to  Ethiopia, he will be able to instruct students in these aspects of  systematics. Improved understanding of this large, widespread  genus is consistent with the Africa program's emphasis on  biodiversity research cooperation, and promises benefits to both  partners and to their parent institutions.  Moreover, this project  will contribute to the establishment of a longterm research  network linking scientists on three continents, Af rica, North  America, and South America.  ***  ***",
