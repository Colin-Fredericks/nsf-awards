This three-  year project at $577,260 will recruit and serve 50 secondary mathematics teachers, 40 high  school and 10 middle school,  in the three-state area of Colorado, Wyoming, and New  Mexico.  The participants will receive enhancement in advanced mathematics that is  consistent with shifts in mathematics curriculum reform, use of appropriate instructional and  assessment strategies, and preparation in leadership and staff development.   Participants will  take two mathematics and two mathematics education courses along with  laboratory/colloquiums including leadership, staff development, and technology during an  eight-week summer session in each of three summers.  All participants and staff will be  connected through UNC s  e-mail system.  During the school year, participants will design  and conduct follow-up sessions of at least one-half day in conjunction with meetings in their  state or region with project staff coordination.  UNC plans to sustain an MA in Mathematics  for Teachers centered on the courses established in this project.  Cost-sharing from UNC and  school districts will cover approximately 20% of the total project.",
