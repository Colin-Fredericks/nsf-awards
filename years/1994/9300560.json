 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low dosage transmission medical imaging, emission medical imaging,  and nondestructive testing of materials are all examples of  tomographic reconstruction problems which can benefit greatly from  improved reconstruction techniques.  This research introduces a  strategy for the development of computationally efficient  reconstruction algorithms which directly search for the  statistically optimal fit to measured data.  This approach exploits  the wide availability of digital computation and storage to  substantially improve reconstruction in demanding applications.   The research has three essential components: 1) A general  measurement system model is being proposed which characterizes the  physical measurement apparatus for both the transmission and  emission problems, and can be extended to include nonlinear effects  such as scattering.  2) A new class of computationally tractable  image cross section models is being proposed which preserves image  detail while suppressing noise artifacts.  3) A fast numerical  algorithm, known as Gauss-Seidel, is proposed as a basis for  efficient and accurate multiscale reconstruction methods.    Algorithmic techniques are being evaluated using data collected  from the Nondestructive Evaluation Section at the Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratories.",
