 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322173  Fabes    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight  undergraduates to gain research experience in electron  microscopy and microanalysis of advanced ceramic materials.  Students will initially take a one week intensive course to  gain a basic knowledge in micro structural characterization  of materials in general and to understand the concepts,  instrumentation and applications of scanning electron  microscopy and x-ray analysis.  Following this, students  will be integrated into numerous on-going research projects,  including:  laser processing of sol-gel coatings, structure  of thin film ceramics, strengthening of glass by alkoxide  coatings, and processing of glass-ceramics from lunar  resources.  %%%  The goal of this program is to provide undergraduates with  an experience of the excitement as well as frustrations of  conducting research at the cutting edge of technology.  It  is expected this experience will serve to inspire and  motivate students, as well as to help make career decisions,  increase interactions between students and faculty, and  expand job and graduate school choices upon graduation.  Emphasis will be placed on participation of Hispanic, women,  and community college students.  Students will be recruited  at the freshman and sophomore levels, allowing the REU  experience to impact career decisions before they are set.",
