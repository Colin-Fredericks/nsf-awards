Geometric morphometrics is a relatively new approach that takes into account the geometrical relationships among the features (positions of the landmarks and shapes of outlines, etcetera) rather than just measured distances or angles.  The proposed research is concerned with the development, evaluation and application of new statistical and visualization methods for geometric morphometrics.   The methods used will be applied to several datasets.  these will include: two-dimensional data on the wings of mosquitoes, 3-dimensional data on yellow-bellied slider and painted turtles, and data from others.  A large number of artificial datasets will be generated for the simulations that will be used to test the robustness and stability of the methods.",
