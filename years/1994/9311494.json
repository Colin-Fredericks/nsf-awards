 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311494  Kellert  The field of nonlinear dynamics has enjoyed tremendous growth in  recent years.  Researchers in the physical, biological, and social  sciences have found the methods and techniques to be useful for  investigating linear models when they break down because of effects  such as friction or feedback that introduce strong nonlinear terms  into their idealized systems.  The study of strongly nonlinear  systems often reveals highly complex and unpredictable behavior  even in very simple mathematical models, and this phenomenon has  been called \"chaos.\"      The scientific investigation of chaotic behavior is popularly known  as \"chaos theory.\"  The popularization of chaos theory has also  invited some misunderstandings.  Here the philosophy of science can  be of some public and professional help in removing confusion and  critically evaluating the claims made.  Further, as a field of  investigation which is even now enjoying dramatic growth and  change, nonlinear dynamics provides an excellent situation for  philosophy of science to make contact with scientific knowledge in  the very process of its construction.  Under this grant, Dr.  Kellert is continuing his efforts to improve our understanding of  the structure of non-linear dynamics, the new techniques associated  with it, and the general impact it will have on our conception of  science.  In particular, he is applying an examination of the  modeling techniques used in the study of chaotic systems to the  questions of the structure of scientific theories and the nature of  the relationship between different sciences.  ***",
