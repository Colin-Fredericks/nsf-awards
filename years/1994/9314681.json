This project will examine how one important infaunal  activity, irrigation of burrows by polychaete worms, affects the  growth of co-occurring organisms. Polychaetes are a dominant taxon  in sedimentary assemblages. Evaluation of the importance of burrow  irrigation is made in light of species-specific traits and  community organization.  The specific questions to be addressed  include: (1) To what extent does burrow irrigation by co-occurring  organisms affect the growth of individual polychaetes?  Is the  benefit related to the density and distribution of irrigated  burrows, and the frequency of irrigation?; (2) To what extent is  the benefit of burrow irrigation experienced by an individual  dependent on the physiology or tube characteristics of the  individual?; (3) How are biological-chemical interactions among the  polychaetes affected by other biological processes, such as  competition or predation, in benthic communities?  These questions  will be evaluated using a combined approach that incorporates the  biology of organisms, and transport and reaction processes in  sediments.  This approach includes manipulative experimentation in  the laboratory and field, and diagenetic modelling of target  substances that affect, and/or are influenced by, infauna.    The research in the planning period will examine the feasibility of  using biochemical indices of growth or growth potential for the  polychaetes.  These indices include (1) analysis of lipid  composition and (2) RNA:DNA ratios.  These indices have proven  useful as tools for examining nutritional status and environmental  conditions for a number of marine invertebrate and vertebrate taxa,  including copepods, fish, echinoderms, bivalves, and crustaceans.   Development of these techniques for the polychaetes wo uld provide  an important alternative method for examining ecological and  environmental questions for a prominent taxon in benthic  assemblages.  The planning research is a necessary precursor  because commonly-used methods of assessing growth in polychaetes  are likely to be inadequate.    Taken together, the research in the planning period, and the future  to be developed research project, will provide a novel perspective  on the forces which drive the distributions of, and interactions  between benthic organisms.  Furthermore, they will have important  implications for understanding how different macrofaunal  assemblages affect solute transport in sediments, and evaluating  the nutritional status or growth potential of polychaetes in the  natural environment.  ***",
