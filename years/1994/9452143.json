 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452143  Mehta  This project focuses on two core areas common to all engineering  laboratories, instrumentation and communication. Resource modules  containing generic information on the above two areas will be  developed using hypermedia and other computer technologies. These  modules will be further used in the development of two laboratory  modules to provide one-on-one instruction, the latest technological  advances, and industrial applications related to the experiment.  A pilot study was conducted in the summer and fall 1993 to test the  above concept. The results of the study showed that student  comprehension of the experimental set-up and its operation had  increased and the written reports were of consistently high  quality. The pilot study also generated requests from other  department for using the report writing module in their  laboratories. The full scale project will directly affect three  required courses in the mechanical engineering department and  benefit 23O undergraduate students every year.  The resource  modules on instrumentation and communication, which will be put on  a CD-ROM, can be used as a handbook without any further development  effort or they can be used in developing individualized laboratory  modules with minimal effort. Faculty from four universities will be  using and evaluating these resource modules.  The proposed project  will provide undergraduate students with more relevant and current  information, improve their understanding, increase their interest  and curiosity, and improve their communication skills without  increasing the length of the curriculum.",
