The past decade  has witnessed a reemergence of real analysis as one of the  fundamental subdisciplines of mathematics.  Long taught as a core  course at the undergraduate and graduate levels, classical real  analysis is regaining its more traditional role at the  intellectual root of both modern applied and pure mathematics.   Another aim of the workshop is to provide the participants with  an opportunity to interact and gain a deeper understanding of the  ideas presented at the workshop and identify new areas for  further research in the field of real analysis.      This project in mathematics fulfills the program objectives of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities  in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of  equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  ***",
