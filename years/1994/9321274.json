 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321274  Hites  The objective of this award is to obtain more comprehensive  knowledge than is now available regarding the major sources of  chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin contaminants of air, water and soil.  The global deposition of these compounds that has been estimated  to date from analyses of air, sediment and soil is significantly  higher than has been determined to be possible by summation of  discharges from known sources.  The investigator plans on  resolving the disparity in this respect by global collection of  samples of soil and sediment, analysis of these samples and  determination of their significance in establishing a better mass  balance than is now known regarding the disparity between  deposition from known sources and the presence of these compounds  in soil and sediments.    Considerable effort is now being made to displace the use of many  useful chlorinated chemical compounds from use as a step toward  removing or reducing the presence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-  dioxins and dibenzofurans from lakes, soils and vegetation.  The  expected result of this project is better knowledge regarding the  presence, dispersion and flux of these compounds as a step toward  determining the extent to which additional control over their  sources is necessary.  This in turn is expected to provide the  basis for any improvements in processes for reducing or  eliminating the emission of these compounds into the atmosphere.  ***",
