 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use a variety of signals to communicate with each  other, and evolution has resulted in an enormous diversity  of species-specific recognition mechanisms.  Species  recognition is critical, especially in mating, because  mistakes can result in loss of reproductive effort, or (in  the case of predatory animals) even death.  This research  concerns the question of how animals recognize members of  their own species and discriminate them from other species  using visual signals during courtship and mating.  A newly  developed video imaging technique will be used to understand  how visual signals function in the mating process of wolf  spiders, and how differences between species evolve.  Because spiders are potentially cannibalistic, species  recognition mechanisms are critical to survival as well as  reproductive success.  As a consequence, recognition is  innate and based on simple behavioral cues.  In the planned  experiments, visual signals of courting males (body  ornaments and behaviors) will be altered using computer  digitization and video animation, then presented to female  spiders on microtelevision screens.  Responses of females to  video images of their own species and those of other  species, and combinations of video images with audio  recordings of spider courtship vibration \"songs\", will test  hypotheses about the cues involved in species recognition.  Results of this research will allow a better understanding  of the mechanisms involved in species recognition in  animals.  This research will also contribute to the growing  knowledge about spiders, an ecologically important group of  invertebrate predators whose basic biology is less known  than other taxa.  Additionally, this research involves the  continuing development of a computer-assisted technique for  studying behavior which may be applicable to other species  and research questions in animal behavior (mate choice,  agonistic behavior, visual perception, neuroethology) and  other fields (image recogn ition, artificial intelligence).",
