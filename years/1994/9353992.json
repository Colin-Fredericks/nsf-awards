 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353992  Ganesan  The objective of this workshop is to both present a course and  develop a problem workbook on air toxics and their control.  Offering such a course in this critical area for 20  undergraduate teaching faculty and involving them in developing  a workbook will significantly enhance their understanding of  the subject and also help them to develop new courses in this  area. It is also a very cost-effective way to disseminate  information and to transfer technology. The workbook, problems  and solutions will be generated by an interdisciplinary  environmental team of engineering and applied science faculty.  Topics include: regulatory issues related to air toxics;  measurement and estimation of toxic emissions; control systems  for toxic particulates and gaseous emissions; pollution  prevention; economic considerations; health risk assessment,  management and risk communication, control analysis for  specific industries; ethical considerations; and, health/safety  and accident/emergency management. The first draft of the  problem workbook will be prepared during a two week (July 94)  summer workshop session in 1994. The 1994-1995 academic year  will provide an opportunity to class-room test the  effectiveness of the problems in the workbook. A three day  follow-up summer session in late June of 1995 is scheduled at  Manhattan College in New York to provide an opportunity to  revise, update, and edit the workbook, and finalize production  and distribution plans for implementation in undergraduate  engineering and applied science curricula. This is a  collaborative effort between two four year undergraduate  colleges; Montana Tech in Butte, Montana, and Manhattan College  in Manhattan, New York.   ***",
