 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Zhang is supported by a Presidential Faculty Fellow Award from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop new   theoretical and computational methodologies from first principles that   will enable chemists to understand and predict complex chemical reactions   accurately and reliably.  The research will focus on two areas of   interest including gas-phase reaction dynamics and gas-surface reaction   processes.  The gas-phase work will seek to develop practical   computational methods for accurate and reliable quantum dynamics   calculations of polyatomic reactions with immediate applications to   diatom-diatom reactions of experiential interest.  The primary   methodology to be employed is the time dependent wave packet approach.    The gas-surface work will also use the time dependent wave packet   approach to explore reaction processes on rigid solid surfaces which   include corregation.     Although the physical laws that underlie chemistry have been elucidated   since the discovery of quantum mechanics over half a century ago,   practical and useful applications of these laws to solve real chemical   problems still remains a remote possibility due to the extreme difficulty   of solving the complex quantum mechanical equations.  Despite the   significant progress that has been made in electronic structure theory,   only the simplest chemical reaction systems are amenable to study by   first principle theoretical methods.  Zhang has developed a number of   computational approaches which provide fundamental theoretical insights   into the chemical dynamics of simple reacting systems, and he is applying   these techniques to simple chemical reactions for which reliable   experimental data exists.",
