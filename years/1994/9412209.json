Jain of the  Department of Computer Science at Michigan  State University, and Dr. M. Narasimha Murty of  the Department of Computer Science and  Automation at the Indian Institute of Science  in Bangalore, India.  The two scientists will  work jointly in the area of knowledge-based  clustering.   The main focus of the research  will be the following topics: incorporate  domain knowledge to obtain more meaningful  clusters; investigate grouping of labelled  objects for efficient representation and rule  generation; and develop tools to assist a  potential user in selecting an appropriate  clustering algorithm for a given problem.     Scope:  Cluster analysis attempts to assess the  interaction among patterns by organizing the  patterns into groups or clusters such that  patterns within a cluster are more similar to  each other than patterns belonging to different  clusters. The results can be used to initiate  hypotheses about the data.  The method is  popular in pattern recognition, computer  vision, machine learning, biology, psychiatry,  psychology, marketing, and information  retrieval.  The collaboration by these two  highly competent scientists should advance the  techniques used and lead to better utilization  of the method.  ***",
