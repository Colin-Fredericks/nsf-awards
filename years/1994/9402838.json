 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402838  Russell         This project involves analytical and computational studies of global (in the state  space) control and stabilization problems for the Korteweg - de Vries and related  partial differential equations. Both point (boundary) and distributed control modes will  be considered. Advanced computational and symbolic processing capabilities will be  employed in the investigation of conservation laws for closed loop processes in order  to obtain a priori bounds on solutions. This will permit a careful analysis of the  transients and asymptotic behavior of the controlled system.       Solutions of the Korteweg - de Vries, and other, related, nonlinear partial  differential equations characteristically include solitary waves, called solitons.  These  waves occur in numerous applications, including meteorology and oceanography,  fiber-optic signal transmission, chemical transport and diffusion processes, and many  others.  Questions of interest which will be addressed by the research to be  undertaken in this project include energy attenuation in solitary waves, stable creation  of solitary waves, and analysis of repeater type amplification of solitary waves. This  research will include both mathematical analyses of the processes under investigation  and computer based process simulation.",
