 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miller  9400533       This project continues a detailed mathematical study into  the relationship between symmetries of the various fundamental  partial differential and q-difference equations of mathematical  physics; the possible coordinate systems in which these equations  permit separation of variables and properties of the special  function solutions which so arise.  The work divides into several  parts.  The first concerns the problem of determining a practical  definition of variable separation that applies to all (systems  of) partial differential equations and the structure theory  of possible separation types.  Second is the problem of  intrinsic characterization of separable coordinates, i.e., a  coordinate- free characterization of coordinates.  For  Hamilton-Jacobi and Schrodinger equations this problem is  essentially solved, but for systems of equations such as the  Dirac and linear elasticity equations, it remains open, although  progress has been made.  Third, there is the problem of  determining the special functions that arise when variables are  separated in a particular equation  and establishing the  properties of these functions.  Finally, there are general  applications of these and related group theoretic methods to  problems that arise in other science and engineering areas, such  as quantum mechanics and radar/sonar.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  One  particularly important form of approximation is through the use  of special functions.  The study of special functions related to  solutions of partial differential equations lies at t he heart of  this research project.  ***",
