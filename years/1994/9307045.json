 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies fundamental network problems,  including  maximum,  minimum-cost, and multicommodity flow problems, shortest  paths problems,  minimum cut problems, and the assignment problem.  These are  classical  combinatorial optimization problems that have  numerous applications.  Designing efficient algorithms and  understanding combinatorial structure of  these problems is  important from a theoretical point of view because these  problems  are very basic to the field, and from a practical point of view  because instances of these problems need to be solved.  There is  interest in  extending the results of this work to related  problems, such as linear  programming.    The research has three interrelated components: (1) the first   involves a  better understanding of combinatorial structure of these problems;  (2) the second involves development of new  algorithms that improve currently known  bounds on  the problem  complexity; and (3) the third   involves experimental evaluation of the  currently existing and newly   developed algorithms.    The worst-case  theoretical efficiency does not always correspond  to practical  efficiency.  Experimental evaluation of existing and  newly developed  algorithms for some of  the problems is of  interest.  The experimental research also motivates  theoretical research by identifying subproblems and data  structures needed by  the implementations and by suggesting  variations of  algorithms which may be  more efficient than the  original variants originating  in theoretical research.",
