 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412316  HIRSCHI  This project uses a survey of adolescents to develop better  measures of self-control and to test control theories of  delinquency and crime.  These theories, which suggest that young  people commit delinquent acts because they do not consider the long  term or broader consequences of their acts, have received  significant scientific support.  They argue that child rearing  practices in the home and the school produce people with varying  degrees of concern for family, school, and peers, which translates  into a differential likelihood of committing delinquent or criminal  acts.  Major scientific issues remain, however, which center on the  generalizability of such patterns, on the circularity or  tautological nature of individual-level control theories, on the  relation between social and individual sources of control, and on  the relation between control theory and other forms of deterrence  (such as activities of the criminal justice system).      The research will (1) test the generalizability of earlier work to  samples differing in ethnicity, gender, urban location, and  historical period; (2) develop and validate measures of self-  control; (3) analyze the relationship between social-control and  self-control; and (4) explore the relationship between these forms  of control and other types of deterrence.  The study will produce  an empirically validated instrument for measuring self-control and  a large data set of high quality that will be of interest to many  researchers.  ***",
