The main objective of this project is to improve and augment the  materials laboratory equipment to provide hands-on experience in  the fields of design, processing and characterization of polymer-  matrix composites for the undergraduate students in the College of  Engineering and Technology.  This project will affect up to 9 courses including junior-level  materials courses in manufacturing and mechanical engineering, a  senior project and technical elective courses. A new laboratory  instruction manual will be developed over a two-year period during  the implementation of the project.  Outreach activities are under development to involve pre-service  teachers in the materaials science course which is being enhanced.   Additionally, the laboratory will be opened to regular visits by  high school students, including a substantial number from  underrepresented minorities, from the local area and region.",
