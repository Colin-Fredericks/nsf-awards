 "awd_abstract_narration": "HARRISON  9318472       National Populations (including human populations) often  contain large amounts variation at genes coding for soluble  enzymes.  The functional significance of this enzyme variation  remains a matter of considerable debate.  Do enzyme variants in  natural populations differ in their functional properties?  If so,  what forces maintain variation within populations.       This project focuses on using DNA sequencing of different  allelic forms of the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) to  determine what is acting to maintain enzyme variation within  species of insects.  PGI occupies a central position in  carbohydrate metabolism.  Catalyzing the interconversion of  glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.  The first goal of  this research is to characterize the structure of the Pgi gene in  two species of crickets, which are both variable for PGI and which  have the \"same\" array of allelic variants (allozymes).   Representatives of each of the allelic variants in the two species  will then be sequenced.  Of particular interest is whether some or  all of the amino acid differences that distinguish the allozyme  classes are identical in the two species and whether observed amino  acid differences are likely maintained in populations by balancing  selection.  The results will shed light on the general question of  the significance of genetic variation for soluble enzymes.   Resolution of this issue has implications for understanding the  significance of genetic variation in human populations and for  questions related to long-term conservation of genetic resources.",
