 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313158  Thorne  In the basically collisionless magnetospheric environment, wave-  particle interactions replace the role of particle-particle  collisions; they provide an important and often dominant mechanism  for pitch-angle scattering, energy diffusion and anomalous  crossfield transport.  The proposed study will consider such  processes and consequently make important contributions to our  understanding of the origin of waves and the source and loss  mechanisms for energetic particles in the radiation belts.  A principal objective of this proposed investigation is to  understand the origin of observed plasma waves and their dynamical  consequences on trapped particles in planetary magnetospheres.   Emphasis will be placed on terrestrial wave-particle interactions  but applications to related phenomena in other planetary  magnetospheres will also be considered.  A combination of  theoretical analyses and extensive numerical computation will be  employed to achieve these objectives.  The path-integrated growth  and ultimate damping mechanisms for plasma waves will be studied in  realistic model plasma environments using a unique hot ray tracing  code.  The mechanisms and conditions for significant wave gain will  be established and the effectiveness of energy transfer via the  waves to other components of the plasma will be determined.  Since  magnetospheric plasma usually contains a high energy tail that can  best be modeled with a Kappa rather than a Maxwellian distribution,  an investigation will be made of whether this feature significantly  modifies the growth or damping of waves and the stability  properties of the plasma.  The long term variability of inner zone  electrons will be investigated and theoretical models will be  developed for the rate of radial diffusion and scattering loss.   The effect of inner zone electron precipitation on the global scale  chemistry of the upper atmosphere will also be analyzed.  ***",
