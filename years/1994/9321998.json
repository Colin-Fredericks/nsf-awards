Undergraduate students, with the primary emphasis on women and minorities, will be given  the opportunity of an 11-week research experience (Summer Undergraduate Research  Experience) with faculty members in the Department of Biology of Wake Forest University.   The research interests of the students will be matched with those of participating faculty.  In  conjunction with the research experience, students will be exposed to a range of other  activities, including two overnight field trips and a weekly seminar program given by  departmental faculty members.  Special time will be set aside for instruction in elementary  biostatistics, experimental design, slide preparation, review of primary literature sources, etc.   The summer's research activities will culminate with an afternoon-long colloquium, at which  time the students will present the results of their work to faculty and other summer  participants.  Students will be quartered in one of the University's residential houses in order  to facilitate maximum student-student interaction.  Previous experience with this research  program format has shown it to be successful.  ***",
