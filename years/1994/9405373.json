 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405373  The broad long-term objective is to elucidate the mechanism and  significance of the epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting in  mammalian development. Genomic imprints effect differential expression of  certain genes according to parental origin, i.e., in the same cell, the  two alleles at one locus are expressed unequally. These genes are  important developmentally, as lethalities and developmental anomalies are  coincident with their abnormal expression. The specific aims are to (i)  develop a highly sensitive allele-specific expression assay for each of  the four known imprinted genes, (ii) utilize these assays to determine  the allele-specific expression pattern of imprinted genes throughout  pre-implantation and post-implantation development, and (iii) determine  the nature of the 'leaky' expression of imprinted alleles in ES cells;  such alleles have been shown to be completely silent in other situations.  The experimental design and methods to be employed, in accordance with  the specific aims, are: (i) Develop a Single Nucleotide Primer Extension,  SNuPE, assay for each of the four known imprinted genes so as to be able  to determine allele-specific expression of each. This assay is PCR-based,  and relies on a single known nucleotide difference in maternal versus  paternal transcripts. It can detect quantitatively the ratio of maternal  versus paternal RNA molecules to one part in a thousand in a small number  of cells. To find the necessary nucleotide differences, DNA from the  laboratory domesticus and feral castaneus subspecies will be sequenced  and compared. (ii) These two subspecies will be crossed to produce Fl  embryos, and the allele-specific SNuPE expression assays performed on  tissues microsurgically isolated from pre-implantation, early  post-implantation, and later stages of embryonic development. (iii) Fl ES  cell lines will be derived and differentiated in chimeras to determine if  the leaky expression is reversible in vivo. The degree of activity  of  specific alleles will be determined by the SNuPE assays.  %%%  Genes exist which display differential expression depending upon the  parental origin of the gene.  Such genes are identified as imprinted.   They are known to be important in organismal development in that  developmental anomalies and lethalities are coincident with their  abnormal expression but mechanisms for imprinting are not known.  This  work will expand our understanding of the significance and mechanism(s)  of the genetic phenomena of imprinting.  ***",
