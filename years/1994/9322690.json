 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the   Chemistry Division, Richard N. Zare will obtain quantum-state specific   information on the dynamics of elementary gas-phase chemical reactions   using molecular beam and laser spectroscopic methods.  The planned   experiments will provide the complete three-dimensional velocity   distribution of the reaction products as well as the state-to-state   differential reaction cross sections.  Reagents will be prepared in   individual rovibronic states using tunable infrared radiation or   stimulated Raman pumping.  Molecular and atomic products will be detected   in specific quantum states, enabling the observations to be compared with   calculations.   %%%  In order to obtain detailed information on chemical reactions, the   experiments in this project will use molecular beam techniques as a means   of isolating molecules and investigating reactive encounters one   collision at a time.  Laser techniques, on the other hand, permit the   reacting species to be prepared with very specific amounts of energy and   spatial orientation, and they also allow the products to be interrogated   for their energy content and orientation.  Such data enable chemists to   understand how reactions occur by relating the experimental observations   with precise calculations which describe the forces experienced by   reagents and products during a chemical transformation.  The interplay   between theory and experiment will eventually allow chemists to predict   the products of any chemical reaction as well as to understand how to   cause a reaction to be more efficient or yield different products.",
