At  the present time this is the only instrument on the Georgia  Tech Campus that is completely multinuclear and on which one  can reserve time for long term multidimensional NMR  experiments. A Varian Gemini 300, 300 MHz NMR spectrometer  located in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry is only  capable of running lH and 13C spectra and is used so  extensively that time can be reserved for only short  periods.  In addition it does not have the capabilities  necessary to carry out research in the area of structure and  dynamics of biologically important systems. The recent shift  in emphasis of several Georgia Tech departments to more  biomolecular related areas make it essential that we  increase the capabilities of our instrument to carry out the  most important multidimensional NMR experiments i.e. TOCSY  and NOESY in 90% H2O. The XL-400 NMR, for which we are  requesting an upgrade, serves the entire Georgia Tech  community, therefore, a description of all of the research  projects that will utilize the new upgrade would be too  extensive for this proposal. Some of the research projects  that will require the upgraded instrument include the  investigations of: protein structure and folding (Briggs),  structure and dynamics of G.G mismatch (Gelbaum), protease  and protease inhibitors (Powers), fundamental investigations  of xylanases (Ragauskas), NMR studies on mammalian cells  (Sambanis), complexes of intercalators with DNA lesions  (Williams) and isolation and synthesis of chemotherapeutic  agents (Zalkow).",
