 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410078  Deshmukh   This research addresses the problem of decision making difficulty or complexity in a manufacturing system characterized by the integration of several subsystems.  The underlying premise to the proposed study is that integration of multiple functions and elements in manufacturing increases a system's complexity or the difficulty of making decisions regarding the system.  Specifically, the research will define complexity, establish metrics for measuring complexity, study the relationship between design and control parameters and complexity, and suggest methods for controlling complexity.   The outcome of the research will improve the understanding of the effects of integration on decision making difficulty in manufacturing systems.  Furthermore, the quality of decisions made as the complexity of a system changes can be analyzed and perhaps, have confidence levels attached to them.  Improved understanding of the effect of integration on manufacturing complexity can lead to better modeling and analysis of manufacturing systems.",
