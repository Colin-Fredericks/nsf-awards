Nicholson of Mount Holyoke College and S. Jullian of the  University of Paris (Orsay) and others at CNRS laboratories in  Bordeaux, Caen and Strasbourg.   The U.S. group will join NEMO-3  (Neutrinoless Experiments with Molybdenum), a French, Russian and  Ukrainian ongoing collaboration in search of neutrinoless double  beta decay.  Neutrinos are considered a prime candidate for the  missing mass (dark matter) in the universe.  One way to probe  neutrinos is to search for double beta decay.  Using the next  generation of detectors in double beta decay, the U.S will  participate in the experiments in the Frejus tunnel under the  French Alps and in the data analysis in Paris.    The U.S. experimentalists have just completed an intensive search  for double beta decay in the isotope molybdenum.  In this  collaboration, they will develop methods to purify the molybdenum  samples and study problems of identifying radioactive impurities  in the double beta decay source materials. The French bring their  considerable expertise in low background engineering and  extensive measurements on natural radioactivity content of these  materials.  The Russian and Ukrainian contribution consists of  large quantities of molybdenum with very low radioactivity which  is critical for the double beta decay experiments.  ***",
