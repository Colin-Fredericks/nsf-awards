 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interagency agreement with the Region III U.S. Public  Health Service,  Division of Federal Occupational Health  (DFOH) is intended to provide the Safety and Health Office,  Office of Polar Programs (SHO/OPP) technical support  in a  variety of  occupational and environmental health  disciplines.   This Interagency Agreement  provides SHO/OPP  flexibility in obtaining technical expertise in a variety of  disciplines on short notice, without going through  protracted procurement efforts for individual tasks, since  the DFOH already has established similar contractual  arrangements with qualified contractors.  By utilizing  similar  contract mechanisms in other government agencies  charged with providing similar services,  OPP/NSF is able to  optimize the government's efficiency in obtaining contract  technical services while minimizing impacts on OPP and  Division of Contracts, Policy and Oversight (CPO) staff work  load.  Since it is impossible at this time to assign  all  specific task (because of the rapidly changing nature of  OPP's research programs),  it is essential that flexibility  in assigning new tasks is maintained as programmatic needs  change; the DFOH Interagency Agreement provides that  flexibility.    As the Interagency Agreement is established,  OPP/NSF funds  will  be committed and obligated to DFOH for the projected  total level of effort for the agreement.  Once those funds  are obligated, specific tasks can be submitted, with the  obligated account balance drawn down as each task is  completed.  In this way,  individual modifications to the  Interagency Agreement will not be necessary each time a new  task is assigned.     Specific tasks will be developed by the SHO/OPP and  forwarded to DFOH for the development of a project plan and  budget.  DFOH will provide that plan/budget for each task to  OPP and NSF/Division of Contract Policy and Oversight (CPO)  for review and concurrence.  When agreement is reached, a  notice to proceed will be given to DFOH.  Periodic billin g  summaries will be provided to OPP and CPO by DFOH.  The  SHO/OPP Technical Liaison is responsible for ensuring that  the total obligated amount  for the Interagency Agreement is  not exceeded as tasks are assigned.    The Region III Division of Federal Occupational Health  utilizes in-house staff and contract support to complete the  various tasks.  DFOH will oversee the work of their  contractors, coordinate those activities with the DFOH staff  assigned to the particular task, and be responsible for the  overall  technical product    Tasking will be developed by SHO/OPP and provided to DFOH  for  the development of a project plan, schedule, and  budget.  Tasking letters will typically include a clear  statement of the task required, sufficient background  information on the issue to be addressed,  a statement of  deliverables, and a proposed schedule.  An independent cost  estimate to complete each task will be developed by SHO but  not communicated to DFOH.  When the DFOH project plan and  proposed budget is submitted, it will be reviewed by SHO and  CPO, and when agreement is reached, CPO will notify DFOH to  proceed.  Any capital equipment purchased to complete an  assigned task (e.g., monitoring equipment specific to  contaminant sampling in remote sites) will remain the  property of OPP at the termination of the task.    The process described above was developed during discussions  involving Mr. Jay Terra (USPHS/DFOH),  Mr. Steve Strength  (NSF/DCPO), and Ms Gwen Adams (NSF/OPP) and myself.",
