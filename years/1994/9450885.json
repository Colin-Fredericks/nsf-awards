Several courses will be  affected by the proposed equipment.  This instrument is intended  to enhance the quality of instruction and to expose students to  both the theoretical background and the (experimental) operation  of modern computer-assisted equipment.  The AA will be  incorporated in the curriculum of General Chemistry, Instrumental  Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, Physical Chemistry,  Biochemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, and in undergraduate research  in Chemistry.  Students will be able to use a powerful analytical  technique to quantify a variety of elements such as lead in water  and waste water, calcium in solutions, zinc in hair, manganese  and iron in pet food, manganese in steel, and lead in food,  blood, serum,  and soft drinks.  In addition, students will  determine toxic metals such as Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Se, and Ag in  water and wastes.  Students will appreciate the utilization and  benefits of interfacing a computer with this instrument and the  effect it has on quantification.",
