 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451047  Moore  The objective of this proposal is to equip a teaching laboratory  for a state-of-the-art molecular genetics techniques course.  Molecular genetics is becoming an increasingly important tool in  most areas of biological research. It is critical that students  have access to knowledge of molecular genetics and practical  experience in molecular genetic techniques. This course is  designed to introduce the students to the theory and basic  biological principles underlying molecular genetic techniques.  Students will also be exposed to a variety of research programs  and job opportunities in areas utilizing molecular genetic  techniques. In addition, students will gain practical experience  in a variety of up-to-date molecular genetic techniques. The  laboratory component of the course will focus on a single  organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, in order to give the students  the opportunity to gain some in-depth knowledge about the  biological system on which the experiments are being carried out  and to analyze the data they collect in a meaningful way. In  addition to the laboratory experiments, the students will learn  how to access and use computer molecular genetics data bases.  Exposure to computers in the laboratory is essential as computers  become an integral part of biological research. In addition to  the material and techniques learned during the course, increased  exposure to molecular genetics and other laboratory techniques,  along with the availability of modern laboratory equipment, will  encourage students to participate in independent research either  with the faculty at Transylvania University or at other research  institutions. Major instruments requested include equipment  necessary for submarine agarose gel electrophoresis,  polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis, 2 DNA sequencing gel  electrophoresis systems, a thermocycler, and 4 microcomputers  with appropriate software and accessories.",
