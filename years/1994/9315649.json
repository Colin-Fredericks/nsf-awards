 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315649  Deierl    This award supports a two-year collaborative  research project between Gregory Deierlein,  Assistant Professor, School of Civil and  Environmental Engineering, Cornell University,  and two researchers in Japan: Dr. Ryoichi  Kanno, Steel Research Laboratories, Nippon  Steel Corporation, Tokyo and Dr. Isao  Nishiyama, Building Research Institute,  Ministry of Construction, Tsukuba.  During two  research visits to Japan, Dr. Deierlein will  collaborate with the Japanese researchers on  issues of seismic design and analysis of steel  and composite structures.  The project focuses  on the physical testing of building connections  and subassemblages, computational research  using nonlinear analysis of building systems,  and current design practice.      Japanese researchers have been devoting  considerable attention to the development of  new types of structural systems based on  composite and hybrid construction.  This work  suggests that many changes in construction  techniques may be possible to improve  reliability and economy.  In particular, Nippon  Steel is a world leader in the development of  improved steel materials and products for the  building construction industry and has state of  the art research laboratories and production  facilities.  ***",
