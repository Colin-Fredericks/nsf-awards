 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with three general statistical problems for  survival data which are either incomplete or subjected to  selection bias. For demonstration simplicity we focus on right  censored/left truncated data. Such incomplete data may arise in  follow-up studies with delayed entries. The first problem deals  with some basic properties like the strong law of large numbers  (SLLN) and the central limit theorem (CLT) for functionals of  product-limit estimates based on incomplete data or data with  selection bias. Except for censored data such fundamental results  are not available so far and will be investigated. Applications  of SLLN and CLT are plentiful in statistical inference and will  also be studied. The second problem deals wth M-estimators for  incomplete data. General approach to handle the limit theory of  M-estimators is not yet available for incomplete data even for  right censored data. We intent to develop general analytical  sufficient conditions for the strong consistency and asymptotic  normality of M-estimators based on incomplete data. Robustness  issues of M-estimators for incomplete data will also be explored.  The third problem deals with dimension reduction methods for  incomplete data. Such methods have not caught on in the  literature for incomplete data where the curse of dimensionality  is much more serious than the widely explored noncensored case.  We focus in particular on a recent promising method, sliced  inverse regression (SIR). Some issues on robustness of the  procedure and estimating statistical quantities of the response  variable for a given covariate, such as the regression function,  will be included. The project deals with general statistical  problems for lifetime data, for example, the life time of a  certain mechanical or electronical product or the incubation time  of a disease such as AIDS. One common feature of lifetime data is  the difficulties of observing some of the actual lifetimes and  those observations are thus termed \"incomplete\" sta tistically.  Incomplete data arise in various forms among which \"censoring\"  and \"truncation\" are the most common ones. Our study focus on,  but not limited to, those types of incomplete data. In the  idealistic situation where all data can be observed fully most  statistical quantity of interest, such as the survival  probability or risk of certain disease, can be estimated  empirically. Compared to such a situation the incompleteness of  the data poses very challenging statistical problems and many of  the basic properties or structures remain unsolved or unknown. In  this project, three specific open problems for incomplete data  will be investigated. The first one deals with the two most  fundamental probability properties, the strong law of large  numbers and central limit theorem for incomplete data. Such  properties play central role in probability theory and are  essential for statistical inferences. However, it is only until  very recently that researachers are able to put their hands on  some special type of incomplete data. Our goal is to establish  such fundamental results for other general type of incomplete  data. The findings in this part of the project will facilitate  the study of robust statistical procedures, such as M-estimators,  for incomplete data. The third problem to be explored in this  project deals with high dimensional data analytical methods when  the response variable are possibility incomplete. Even for  complete data, the handling of high dimensional data, via  dimensional reduction methods, requires special skills and is on  the cutting edge of statistical research. The proposed procedure  for handling incomplete data extends the scope and usefullness of  existing dimension reduction procedures.",
