In accomplishing this objective a number of specific \"strategic tasks\" have been identified.  These tasks include the acquisition of resources, attainment of specific levels of recognition, and reorganization of infrastructure.  While different in nature, all are considered vital to accomplish the primary goal. Specifically, the tasks are:      i)  effective allocation of new office space;      ii)  accreditation to the Computing Sciences     Accreditation Board (CSAB);           iii)  establishment of properly equipped core computer           science laboratories;      iv)  establishment of a Machine Learning and Cognition   Center     The II-MI award will be used to accommodate these plans as follows:     i) provision of two 30 workstation based laboratories   and coordination of this equipment with envisaged   Software Design and Computer Architecture     laboratory sequences:     ii) provision of additional computing resources for    the graduate research laboratory;     iii) provision of a communications infrastructure to    link the undergraduate laboratories, research    laboratories, faculty and staff; and     iv) provision of salary support for the first five    years of a full time network administrator     position.",
