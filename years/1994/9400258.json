The work concerns not  only what is meant by a solution but also understanding from a  physical point of view the very limits of validity of the  corresponding physical theories.  This research is directed at  specific goals in this regard - the development of relevant new  techniques such as global stability of the Minkowski  space-time and the analysis of the Einstein and other classical  field theories.  A primary goal is to study and lower, where  possible, the regularity requirements on the initial data sets  which assure that the initial value problem is well posed.   Examples from simpler field theories suggest that the question of  finding the optimal norm assuring well-posedness is intimately  connected to the issue of break-down and regularity of solutions.   A related direction this work will pursue concerns the question  of nonlinear stability of the Minkowski metric relative to  perturbations in the limited regularity class of the Einstein  vacuum equations.       The primary area of this project's research,  nonlinearpartial differential equations, is central to the  mostfundamental work currently under investigation within  mathematical analysis.  Solutions to nonlinear equations have  been shown to posses considerable regularity and the equations  themselves exhibit far more structure than was once thought  possible.  This project continues some of the most  promising avenues of investigation in the field.",
