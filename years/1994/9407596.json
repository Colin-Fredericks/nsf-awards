 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407596  Lovell     This project examines the community structure and environmental specificity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that occur across the gradient from highly productive, low intertidal marsh to stressed, low-productivity, high marsh.  This gradient in productivity is reflected in gradients in salinity, H2S concentration, pH, and redox potential, all of which have likely impact on the nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The bacteria in turn may generate a gradient in nitrogen availability, which may control plant productivity.  The project characterizes the bacterial communities along this gradient by PCR amplification of the bacterial DNA and DNA \"fingerprinting.\"  The resulting banding patterns provide a means of identifying key bacterial species and determining the composition of bacterial communites along the marsh gradient.  The physiological responses of key bacterial species to environmental stresses are being studied.  The investigator is also conducting reciprocal transplants of bacterial communities to examine bacterial and plant responses to the new environmental conditions.    This research improves our ability to determine the effect of non-point source pollution on salt-marsh microbial communities and the effects of changes in these communities on higher organisms in salt marshes.  The results of this research has application in pollution monitoring and environmental risk assessment.",
