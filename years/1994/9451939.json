 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451939  Juricic  This project will develop a national model for the lower-division  CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing) laboratories that  will replace present CADD (Computer-Aided Drafting) laboratories  for teaching Engineering Design Graphics (EDG) courses.  The  laboratory should provide a model means of attracting and retaining  engineering students.  The lab software and hardware, appropriate  for lower-division students, will be identified and integrated,  exercises will be developed and documented, and instructor's notes  and tutorials for lab development will be written. In addition to  the two PIs that will lead this project, six leading EDG educators  will form an Advisory Committee, and as many as 25 other EDG  educators will participate as consultants in evaluation and  classroom testing of instructional material developed. The EDG  educators represent a variety of institutions-- 2-year, 4-year, and  doctoral; additionally many of the participating institutions have  large minority populations.  A group of practicing engineers from  six industrial organizations will provide much needed input from  industry.  The CAD/CAM based Engineering Design Graphics  laboratories proposed herewith will impact on a large number of  students, perhaps up to 280,000 degreed engineers and nearly an  equal number of two-year college graduates during the expected 5-  year lifetime of the new laboratory.",
