Ten college undergraduates selected from a  nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be exposed to a research  atmosphere for 10 weeks in a summer career development program.   Participants will be selected by a committee of faculty from basic science  departments.  Students will be matched with faculty mentors and become  functioning members of their labs.  The unifying focus of the REU Site will  be cellular signal transduction.  The faculty of BCM have already gained  experience in designing undergraduate research projects and interacting with  college students through participation in a five-year program, two years as an  REU Site.  Students will be matched by interest and background to a project  that will promote learning new technical skills and development of an  understanding of how to approach and conduct research.  Students will use  advanced techniques, often in molecular biology, that may not be available on  their home campuses.  The laboratory oriented aspect of the program will be  supplemented by participation in research discussions, seminars, career  development activities and social/cultural activities sponsored by  the SMART Program.  NSF sponsored participants will have the benefit of  interacting with 100 undergraduates from throughout the nation and of  entering an established program that effectively promotes interest in science  and prepares undergraduates to enter research oriented careers.  ***",
