The co-  organizers are Professor Robert Granados, Boyce  Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell  University, and Professor Tsuguo Matsumoto,  Kyoto Institute of Technology.  The seminar  will focus on the genetic engineering of insect  pathogens used as biopesticides, development of  a greater understanding of the molecular  interactions between pathogenic microbes and  their insect hosts, and improvement of  biological control tactics for insect pests and  vectors using these new agents and knowledge.    The seminar will bring together leading  scientists from the two countries who  specialize in the area of biological control to  address novel molecular approaches for the  genetic manipulation of microorganisms for  insect control.  The seminar has a  multidisciplinary character of contemporary  research on insect pathogens and will impact  the areas of biological, environmental,  agricultural, and medical sciences.  In  particular, the exchange of information will  accelerate the development of new strategies  and tactics for controlling harmful insects  that account for agricultural, medical, and  veterinary problems.  ***",
