 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9407333  The adenovirus 21 kDa E1B protein has been reported to assist the  adenovirus E1A protein in cellular transformation, increase gene  expression, stabilize DNA, and abrogate apoptosis induced by E1A.   The mechanism whereby E1B functions in these phenomena is presently  unclear.  Our earlier findings showed that E1B protein led to  increased gene expression from another adenovirus gene that encodes  the capsid protein, polypeptide IX (pIX).  Our present  investigations of the pIX gene show that E1B protein does indeed  increase gene expression by offsetting transcriptional repression.   Recombination signal sequence binding protein, RBP, acts as a  transcriptional repressor of the pIX gene.  This repression does  not entail displacement of the activator SP1 or TATA binding  protein from their respective sites on the pIX promoter or by  competition with another activator. These findings represent the  first reported function of RBP, other than DNA binding.  This novel  function appears to pertain directly to at least one of the many  roles E1B exhibits in the cell.  We will now investigate the  molecular mechanism of RBP-mediated repression using the adenovirus  pIX gene.  The positioning of RBP at the pIX promoter will be  analyzed with respect to perturbations in assembly of the general  transcription factors and steric hindrance to activation. The RBP  functional domain(s) responsible for repression will be  investigated using analyses performed in vivo and in vitro.  Since  E1B protein offsets RBP repression, the mechanism of RBP repression  should bear on E1B activity, as well as contribute to understanding  gene regulation, in general.  We will also initiate studies on the  anti-RBP repressive affect of E1B protein.  E1B protein will be  tested for direct interaction with RBP and affects on complexes  containing RBP and the pIX promoter.  The ability of RBP to repress  activation of the viral pIX gene is crucial to its regulation.  The  participation of E1B in relieving th is repression may provide the  unifying property to this multi-functional protein.  %%%  The cellular protein RBP is present in many different cell lines.   Originally, RBP was thought to be a DNA recombinase.  However,  recent studies have shown that RBP is actually a repressor that  binds to DNA and inhibits transcription.  This newly discovered  activity associated with RBP will be explored during the time  period of this award.  Using an adenovirus gene, experiments will  be performed to understand how RBP silences gene expression.   Remarkably, recent studies have revealed that RBP repression is  absent when an oncoprotein is present.  Adenovirus produces an  oncoprotein during cellular infection and this function may be  important to the means by which the virus participates in loss  of cellular growth control.  The protein exhibits a number of  properties which currently appear to be unrelated: participation in  loss of cellular growth control, increased gene expression, and  stabilization of DNA. Thus far, the means by which this protein  elicits these effects is unknown. The protein provides an excellent  model for exploring cellular processes. The goal of this award is  to understand how RBP represses transcription to provide the basis  for understanding how the EBI protein offsets this repression.  ***",
