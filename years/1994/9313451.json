 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cassidy         During the past few years, research and research training activities have  increased markedly in the Biology and Chemistry Departments at Southwest Texas  State University. This growth has been hampered by several deficiencies in the  laboratory facilities available to faculty and students: inadequate electrical power,  limited gas lines, antiquated plumbing, and a lack of appropriate fume hoods and  ventilation. The university plans to renovate 8,200 square feet of laboratory space that  will provide a suitable environment for research and research training in polymer and  organometallic synthesis, environmental and industrial science, molecular biosciences,  and a fish genetic stock center.       This renovation will enhance the research and research training activity at  Southwest Texas State University in several significant ways. Faculty research  projects will have appropriate environments for new state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Collaborative student-faculty research projects will have adequate and appropriate  laboratory space. Specialized functions such as the fish genetic stock center will have  dedicated facilities with the necessary environmental quality and controls. New faculty  will be attracted to the university owing to the availability of high-quality research  facilities, and students will be drawn toward careers in the sciences.  ***",
