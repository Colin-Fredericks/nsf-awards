 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321393  Cruickshank    A Gordon Conference on the Chemistry of Electronic Materials  is  being held to address current topics in the chemistry of  synthesis, processing and use of semiconductors, dielectrics  and  metals in a wide variety of potential areas in the field of  electronics/photonics with a strong emphasis on fundamental  atomic level processes. Particular focus will be on critical  chemical issues in nanoscale technology.  Additionally there  will  be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties  between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is  expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and  that  the Conference will provide an effective forum to discuss  and  delineate the critical scientific issues in this research  area,  and to consider and define the approaches and techniques  needed  to address them. Understanding and controlling processes at  the  atomic level are becoming increasingly important for  electronic  and photonic materials.  %%%   An evaluation of the status of Chemistry of Electronic  Materials, and especially the critical chemical issues in  nanoscale technology, and recommendations by the Conference  participants for the emphasis of future work, and their  assessment of the most important contemporary research  issues  will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced  utilization of chemical methodology in the field of  microelectronics.  ***",
