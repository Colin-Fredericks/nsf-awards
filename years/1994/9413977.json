 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of scanning electron microscope for introductory/advanced       course work and faculty/undergraduate research: Biology,       Geological Sciences, Anthropology.    Instrumentation:    The scanning electron microscope (SEM) housed in the Department of  Biology has been in service for fifteen years. Recent breakdown  (cracked scanning/objective coils) and unavailability of replacement  parts or possibility of repair has made the microscope inoperable. The  major users in Biology and Geological Sciences propose to replace the  inoperable instrument and incorporate an Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX)  analysis system in a new instrument.    Research and Training    Geneseo is a primarily undergraduate institution with a strong  commitment to faculty and student research. The proposed SEM would be  utilized in several courses, as a primary instrument in directed  studies, undergraduate theses, and as a research instrument for faculty  and undergraduate research projects. Courses that utilize the SEM  included: General Biology Laboratory (Biol 118; laboratory  demonstration), Microscope Techniques (Biol 378), Biological  Techniques: Electron Microscopy (Biol 390), and Invertebrate  Paleontology (GSci 361). In these courses 25-75 students are introduced  annually and or trained in operation of the instrument. Directed  studies (Biol 382, 399, Gsci 399, Anth 399) and other student research  projects will comprise a significant portion of student use and  training. In these investigations students under an appropriate level  of supervision use the SEM to pursue individual or project research  goals. (In the last year since the SEM breakdown twelve students in  geology course or projects have had reason to use an SEM for  microfossil and sedimentary particle or fabric studies.)    Faculty research at Geneseo encompasses several fields that utilize  electron microscopy; procurement of a new instrument is required for  attainment of external funds and continued research. Faculty teaching  and rese arch include: Paleogene primate evolution (Anemone),  parasitology (Bandoni), Zebra mussel larva morphology (Bosch),  flagellar apparatus of green algae (Hoops), micropaleontology and black  shale studies (Over), plant-bacteria relations (Simon), and palynology  (Spear). An EDX system will be applied in research involving magnetic  sensing in birds (Beason), paleomagnetic fabric in sediments (Brennan),  bentonite and burrow lining characterization (Over), and bacterial  ecosystems (Simon). In addition the research potential of the SEM-EDX  will be increased to incorporate a broader range of studies.    Funding for a new SEM will lead to continued study of organisms and  environments where high resolution, high contrast microscopy is  essential. The instrument will be an integral part of student and  faculty research and serve as a tool for encouraging under-represented  groups to pursue careers in science and engineering. Six of the major  users currently have research funding, four projects are directly  related to studies that utilize the SEM; all major users have proposals  under review or in preparation that will utilize the SEM an/or EDX  system.",
