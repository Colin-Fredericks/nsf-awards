It combines the use of ultra high vacuum electron  spectroscopic methods with flow reactor studies of high surface  area molybdenum based catalysts.  Molybdenum carbide based  materials are the focus of the research, which has been  carefully designed to enable the participation of talented  undergraduates in the work.  This project is supported jointly  by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the  Chemistry Division, and the Chemical Reaction Processes Program  of the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.  The results  of this work will impact strongly on the rational design of  hydrodesulfurization catalysts.  %%%  A combination of ultra high vacuum and flow reactor methods  will be used in this project to probe the catalytic chemistry  of molybdenum carbide based catalytic materials.  This work  will provide the basic understanding needed for the rational  design and utilization of these complex catalytic systems.  ***",
