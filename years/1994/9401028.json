 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401028  Brydges       The proposal is to study problems in the following related  areas: (1)Models of polymers with attractive self interactions.  (2) Infrared behavior of weakly perturbed Gaussian measures  arising in statistical mechanics of systems that are near a  second order phase transition. (3) Epsilon expansions for models  with nearly Gaussian fixed points for the renormalization group.  (4) a perturbative study of the renormalization group evolution  of the extrinsic geometry of target manifolds in the nonlinear  sigma model. (5) Non-perturbative renormalization group for  strong coupling problems such as the non-linear sigma model. The  theory of elementary particles, the prediction of the size and  shape of long chain molecules in solution, and the study of phase  transitions are related problems from the view of mathematics;  they require a calculus for the approximate evaluation of  integrals over spaces of infinite dimension. In the 1970's the  Nobel Laureate K. Wilson, made fundamental progress in this  calculus, which is called the renormalization group. He  left mathematicians with the challenge of filling in his many  leaps of faith and creating a systematic theory. The first three  parts ofthis proposal hope to achieve this for a class of  integrals that are almost close to Gaussian integrals - a special  class that can be evaluated exactly. The last two parts are more  speculative attempts to create the same theory for integrals that  are much further from being equal to Gaussian integrals.  ***",
