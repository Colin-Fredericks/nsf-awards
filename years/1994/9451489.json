 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451489  Dietrich  This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement project involves  the revision of an undergraduate database course to include a  laboratory project that allows students to acquire practical  experience using a commercial database product.  A unique aspect of  the work is the way in which cooperative learning techniques are  used in administration of the group projects.  Each project is  divided into different phases corresponding to different functional  aspects of database development.  Those phases include requirements  analysis, conceptual modeling, relational database design and view  modeling, forms/report design, and application programming.  Students assume different roles during the course of the project,  such as phase leader for leading group activities, phase recorder  for organizing documentation activities, phase checker for  evaluating group members on the concepts that they have learned,  and phase technical advisor for leading the technical activities of  each phase. The advantage of this approach is that it not only  allows students to become more active participants in the learning  process but it also allows students to develop good leadership and  communication skills while learning the practical use of database  system software.  This project is therefore establishing a teaching  environment that provides a well-balanced mix of theory and  practice with emphasis on cooperative learning.",
