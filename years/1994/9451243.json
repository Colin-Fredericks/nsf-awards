Too many do not even make it through the course.  A  computer laboratory to accompany calculus courses addresses these  problems.  The project follows successful pilot projects that have  been run since the Fall of 1990.  The first project used Apple  IIe's in 12 of 77 calculus sections over a period of two years.   During the summer of 1993 these machines were replaced by 15 486  PC's with Maple V, to offer an optional lab in 7 of 40 sections in  the 1993-94 academic year.  Simple algorithms first, and then the  more sophisticated commands and graphics of Maple were employed  successfully to generate data that the students use to develop  intuitions about theoretical relations, to gain a deeper  understanding of the theory, and to make it credible through  verifying examples.  The addition of 30 Gateway 4DX2-66's builds  upon the successful pilot experiences by providing a sufficient  number of PC's to make these labs a required part of the calculus  sections.  The 30 new machines allow the expansion of the current  facility to 20 machines and establishment of a second, dedicated  computer lab of 25 PC's with Maple V, to handle classes of as many  as 45.  The project will result in a laboratory manual and the  requirement of a laboratory component for all calculus sections  which allows the experiences of the laboratory to be integrated in  the teaching of the calculus.  Future plans include using the  laboratory for pre-calculus as well as calculus.",
