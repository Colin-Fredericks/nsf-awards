 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354501  McDermott  We are developing a comprehensive, multi-faceted program to be  conducted by the Physics Education Group in the Physics Department  at the University of Washington. The program consists of a group of  interrelated projects that focus on undergraduate course  improvement, teacher preparation and enhancement, and university  faculty development.  The goals for the project are: (1) to expand  our knowledge of how students learn physics; (2) to increase  student learning in the introductory physics course; (3) to prepare  (K- 12) preservice and inservice teachers to teach science as a  process of inquiry; and (4) to improve the teaching effectiveness  of present and future college and university faculty.  The first  goal will be met by continuing our investigation of student  understanding in physics. We will work toward the second and third  goals by using results from this ongoing research as a guide in  developing instructional materials for introductory physics  students and for preservice and inservice teachers. We will  progress toward the fourth goal by conducting workshops for  undergraduate faculty, inviting faculty interns for short-term  visits to observe first-hand the activities of our group, and  producing a Faculty Development Handbook to help prepare teaching  assistants, postdoctoral research associates and junior faculty for  their role as physics instructors.",
