 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416248  Elgamal  Earthquake acceleration histories were recorded on and around  eight well instrumented earth dams within a 50 mile radius of the  1994 Northridge earthquake epicenter.  These dams were also  subjected to strong ground shaking during the 1971 San Fernando,  and the 1987 Whittier earthquakes.  A large data set of valuable  input and response acceleration histories is currently available  (Northridge, Whittier, and San Fernando earthquakes) for  calibration and verification of simplified as well as elaborate  computational analysis procedures.    Past analyses of the San Fernando and Whittier recorded  accelerations have significantly contributed to our understanding  of earth dam seismic response mechanisms; contributions which  were possible only through analyses of actual full-scale seismic  response.  The recently recovered Northridge acceleration  histories offer a unique opportunity to build on the results of  thorough studies conducted earlier for the Santa Felicia,  Puddingstone, Cogswell and Brea dams.    The objective of this project is to:  (i) conduct a predictive  (Class A/B) computational analysis for each dam using the dynamic  properties identified earlier from the San Fernando and/or  Whittier earthquakes, (ii) critically assess the previously  identified earth dam characteristics in view of the newly  acquired Northridge data set (of different shaking amplitudes and  frequency contents), (iii) define simplified analysis/design  procedures, and clearly identify any associated limitations  and/or strengths, and (iv) document the identified properties in  a database form that includes a large number of modern  earth/rockfill dams in Northern California (Lexington, Anderson  and Long Valley dams), Southern California (Santa Felicia,  Puddingstone, and Brea dams), and Mexico (La Vilita and El  Infiernillo dams).  ***",
