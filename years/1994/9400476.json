 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400476   Cohen        Inference in order restricted models and improved inferences  procedures will be pursued. A summary is as follows: We will  pursue the study of \"one sided\" confidence regions and  simultaneous confidence intervals for parameters that lie in a  subset of k dimensional space. This problem is meaningful to the  statistical practitioner. We will introduce and study the notion  of cone order association. Ordinary association is linked to the  cone which is the first quadrant of k dimensional space.  Important applications exist where ordinary association is not  good enough to obtain meaningful results but cone order  association would help. We study 2 and 3 dimensional contingency  tables and seek optimal tests for a wide variety of hypothesis  testing problems. A list of problems concerning a wide variety of  extensions of results in order restricted testing problems is  also discussed. Professor Strawderman will study problems related  to hierarchical Bayes models, adaptive minimax estimators,  estimators which improve on truncated estimators such as the  positive-part James-Stein estimator or the MLE of a positive  normal mean, and minimax estimation for spherically symmetric  distributions. He is also writing a monograph on multiparameter  estimation with James Berger.         This proposal is concerned with improved statistical  inference methodology. Statistical inference typically is  concerned with estimating unknown characteristics of populations  or testing hypotheses about these unknown characteristics.  Statistical methodology has progressed greatly over the past 60  years. Yet there is considerable room for improving procedures  that will be more efficient and provide substantial savings to  users of the improved procedures. This proposal is primarily  devoted to developing such new and better procedures.",
