 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403892  Ariyawansa  This project will develop and computationally test variants of  Davidon's collinear scaling algorithms that extend quasi-Newton  methods. These algorithms would be based on local approximations  that interpolate objective function values and gradients at  suitable iterates. They would be designed to have finite  termination on conic functions, and to be invariant under  collinear scalings.    The development of such algorithms would begin with the recent  new derivation of Davidon's collinear scaling algorithms by the  principal investigator.   The computational experiments would use  standard test problems as well as test instances derived from  suitable potential functions used in interior point methods.  The  proposed project would thus attempt to assess in an unbiased  manner whether algorithms that utilize the full potential offered  by Davidon's new scalings and approximations would have practical  performance improvements.    If the computational experiments indicate that algorithms with  Davidon's new scalings and approximationscan improve performance  in optimizing potential functions, then it would indicate a  hitherto unexplored way of developing better interior point  algorithms. Since interior point methods have wide applicability,  this work can reveal research opportunities that would make  significant advancements in optimization algorithms.  ***",
