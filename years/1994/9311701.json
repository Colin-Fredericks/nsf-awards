It offers biological resources and  scientific facilities in support of the work of marine scientists  from national and international institutions.  FHL is located in  the San Juan Islands in the State of Washington at the junction  between Puget Sound, Juan de Fuca Strait and Georgia Strait where  an unusual diversity and richness of marine life occurs.  Topics  of research range from cell biology to community ecology and  engage zoologists, fisheries biologists, Oceanographers,  botanists, paleobiolgists, and researchers from various  biomedical fields.  Some organisms are studied because of their  ecological importance, others because they are useful models for  the study of ecological, developmental, or physiological  processes.  At FHL, a high priority is placed upon providing a  suitable environment (instrumentation, field biological  resources, logistical support) for research that requires marine  organisms.  Although over 90% of the FHL operating budget comes  from State of Washington, over 65% of the scientific people whose  work is supported by FHL are from institutions outside the State  of Washington.    The University of Washington has recently completed an extensive  review of physical facilities, and academic programs of the FHL.   Recommendations include extensive replacement and modernization  of facilities over 10 years.  The University has committed  significant resources to the first component of this  modernization program.  This project will provide for replacement  of one microscope, as a part of that renewal.    ***",
