 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of downsizing in the Russian military, part of a larger comparative project to survey the social consequences of reduction in military manpower in both the United States and Russia.  An interview questionnaire will be administered to 1,800 officers in the Russian Army, 1,200 of whom are about to be separated from military service due to downsizing, and to their approximately 1,440 spouses.  The Russian officer sample will be drawn randomly from military populations at and around bases that are closing and bases that are remaining open.  Topics to be covered in the interview include prior work history, reemployment plans, financial hardships experienced, and such potential consequences of downsizing as depression, drinking problems, and family conflict.  The spouse survey will ask questions both about the spouse's own reactions to the transition and about how the solider is coping with the process.  %%%   This study takes advantage of an historic opportunity to study disruption in the life course of soldiers and their spouses whose livelihood and community status are threatened by loss of military employment.  Not only will the results contribute to several branches of the social and behavioral sciences, but the knowledge gained will be helpful to the governments of Russia and the United States as they attempt in partnership with each other to reduce the size of their military establishments and create a safer and more peaceful world.",
