 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353470  Bordeaux    Sinte Gleska University proposes to develop leadership teams and  educate teachers to improve mathematics and science education for  over 1000 American Indian elementary students.  The three year  project coordinates with the State SSI, the SKILL (Scientific  Knowledge for Indian Learning and Leadership), Dakota BBS a small  Indian owned business and several local school districts.  No less  than 94 teachers and 21-24 administrators from at least 8 target  schools will participate in the project during the three years.  32  teachers (16 from grades K-4, 16 from grades 4-8) will enter the  project at the beginning of the first Summer Institute.  This group  will participate fully in the project at least until the end of the  second Summer Institute.  Teachers may attend the entire three  years of the project but in the third year they would be expected  to act as mentors and facilitators.  Mathematics and science  education courses will be offered for 6 hours of graduate credit.   An additional 2 graduate credits will be earned each summer through  education practicum 1.  Class members will develop integrated  culturally-relevant learning units, learn and practice leadership  skills, interact in small learning groups and with administrators  and conduct individual or group learning projects.  The entire  program will support integrated mathematics and science for  elementary students and will focus on both content and pedagogy.    At least two administrators from each target school are expected to  attend at least one Summer Institute for one week and to fully  participate in mathematics and science education improvement in  their school.  American Indian families including both children and  adults will participate in Family Math in-service programs.   Follow-up activities include:         *    monthly Saturday Seminars beginning in November and            ending in May;         *    a project Bulletin Board System will provide peer support            for teachers, opportuni ties for collaborative            teacher/student project undertakings both among program            schools and nationally and world wide access to            information.         *    the Rural Development Telecommunications Network (RDTN),            a two way interactive TV network which links thirteen            strategic locations in the state via fiber-optic cable,            will be used to link project sites.  No less than four 2-            hour teleconferences will be held each year.    Cost share on the project is 13%",
