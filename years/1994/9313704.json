Hierarchy theory has  highlighted the need to evaluate the broader spatial scales  inherent in regional environmental histories as a context within  which ecological and genetic interactions occur at finer scales  of resolution.  In order to identify how regional processes of  disturbance and regeneration relate to spatial patterns, age  structures, and genetic composition of related species, this  project will examine two types of sand pine (Pinus clausa) in  Florida.  Ocala sand pine occurs in peninsular Florida, while  Choctawhatchee sand pine is present in the Florida panhandle.  Both species exist in both coastal and inland locations, where  they occupy similar environments, but their stands are separated  by more than 100 km.  The project will be conducted in two  phases.  The first will consist of collection of materials and  data on the diameter and tree-ring structure of sample trees as  well as soil, foliage, and other environmental data for 18  representative sites.  This information will be evaluated through  detailed allozyme analyses to determine genetic and ecological  variations between Ocala and Choctawhatchee sand pine.  During a  second phase of research, the demographic and genetic structure  of four or five representative stands will be mapped in detail.  This mapping will permit assessment of the ways that  environmental and disturbance histories have affected each kind  of sand pine.  Of particular concern to the experienced team of  geographers and population biologists undertaking this project is  degree to which the dispersion of different trees are related to  differences in the scales of disturbance (such as localized  canopy fires vs. wide-spread wind damage from hurricanes).  Attention also focuses on the extent to which these differences  are related to finer-scale variations in g enetic structures  within populations.       This focused case study of variations among two species of  Florida sand pine will provide valuable tests of hypotheses  related to a broader range of topics.  In addition to providing  new insights regarding the possible impacts of Quaternary sea-  level change on the isolation and genetic differentiation of  species, the results of this research will shed light on multi-  scale relationships among site characteristics, disturbance  ecology, and the genetic structure of vegetation.  ***",
