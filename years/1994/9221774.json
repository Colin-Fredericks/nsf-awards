The research theme, Semantics-Based Program  Manipulation, has a strong potential to put program development  on a more automated basis.  This area's active research  communities on each side of the Atlantic are sufficiently small  that nearly all have heard of each other's viewpoints.  Longer  and more direct contacts are useful and needed, to open new ways  of looking at old problems, and suggest new applications and  problems for study.    This award would support an international collaboration that  would strengthen already-existing research contacts, increase  exchange of ideas and personnel, and promote synergy among  university research groups with closely related research  interests at six European and eight American institutions. It  takes advantage of a diversity of technical expertise in a way  impossible without such an intense interaction.  It is expected  to result in wider accessibility of results initially through  wider use within the community.  More rapid development of  emerging technology is anticipated from the interaction of  researchers with diverse expertise and common goals.  ***",
