The  implementation of these ideas is through the development of a  series of laboratory modules which can be taught in conjunction  with any text.  The versions produced can be used with current  standard technologies including graphing calculators, Mathematica  and Maple. To support these modules, packages of high-level  functions are developed which promote visualization and simplify  numerical and symbolic computation. Interested faculty at other  institutions are able to easily incorporate these modules into  their college algebra courses.  A revised College Algebra  curriculum which exploits technology and laboratory experiences  addresses some critical concerns of national interest: developing  higher level thinking skills in students, increasing the  mathematical literacy of students and in particular non-science  majors, and incorporating teaching delivery styles which aid in the  recruitment and retention of minorities into the mathematical  sciences.   ***y",
