 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321767  Schilling       Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Edward Schilling at  the University of Tennessee, graduate student Robert Duff is  employing molecular and morphological analyses to study the North  American species of the primitive, spore-bearing plant Isoetes.   The so-called quillworts (from the quill-like resemblance of their  small leaves) grow in ponds, streams, or vernal pools, usually in  small and highly restricted populations, scattered across the  continent.  Currently about 25 species are recognized in North  America, and about 150 total in the world.  The fossil record of  quillworts shows the genus to be ancient; there is some evidence  that it is one of the three surviving genera of the most primitive  lineage of vascular land plants.  New molecular data from  chloroplast DNA restriction-enzyme mapping and from nucleotide  sequencing of nuclear ribosomal DNA will be compared to traditional  taxonomic information from morphology and chromosomes to develop a  robust hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of the North  American species, and then to explore patterns of character  evolution and geographical distribution.       The generation of new molecular evidence from DNA analyses and  the integration of that information with traditional morphological  characters are revitalizing the taxonomic study of plants.  Isoetes  will be better understood as a result of this investigation.",
