 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360931  Henderson       The potential to achieve high insulating value by the use of  evacuated glass microspheres has been know for some time.  The  purpose of the research is to solve the principal obstacle to their  use, which has been the development of a commercially viable  technique to produce evacuated microspheres.  If hollow glass  microspheres can be evacuated and coated cost effectively their  utility as insulation will extend to the consumer, engineering and  industrial markets with attendant large cost savings to these users  and major energy savings to the nation.  For example, using vacuum  microspheres having highly reflective metal coatings, systems can  be designed with R values greater than 800 have been achieved.       The objective of the research is to demonstrate a unique  manufacturing concept which does not require the use of vacuum  equipment or evacuated chambers.  A new, cost effective,  environmentally benign insulation has enormous commercial potential  by virtue of the improvement in a wide variety of products:  e.g.,  dewars, refrigerated trucks and rail cars, home appliances such as  ovens and refrigerators, foam insulation, pipe insulation,  vehicles, cryogenic fuel containers and packaging.",
