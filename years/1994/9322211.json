Ten undergraduate students, five from Bucknell and five recruited  from schools around the country will spend ten weeks doing research in cell and  molecular biology with various faculty at Bucknell.  Research projects include topics in  cancer research, plant molecular biology, Drosophila molecular genetics, immunology,  and cell biology of the testis.  In addition to the work on their individual projects, the  students will (1) participate in a regular journal club, (2) attend two  demonstrations/workshops (put on by participating faculty) devoted to modern molecular  techniques, (3) attend the Summer Symposium in Molecular Biology at Penn State  University, and (4) participate in a minisymposium at the end of the summer where they  will present and discuss their work.  It is hoped that the combination of the detailed  individual research work with the broader perspectives given by the journal club,  workshops, and Penn State Symposium, will give the students a thorough exposure to a  research environment.  ***",
