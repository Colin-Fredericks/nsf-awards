 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317397  Chuong    Pattern formation is a crucial event in embryonic  development. Identification of molecules and mechanisms  involved in pattern formation have been the central interest  of developmental biologists. Dr. Chuong is using feather  morphogenesis as a model to study pattern formation and has  focused on adhesion molecules and homeobox (Hox) genes. Dr.  Chuong has shown that there are two kinds of Hox gradients  in the integument: a \"macro gradient\" across the feather  tract and a \"micro gradient\" across a single feather bud.  The asynchronous alignment of different Hox macro gradient  leads to a unique repertoire of position specific Hox  expression patterns named Hox codes of skin appendages,  which he hypothesizes determine the phenotype of skin  appendages. Retinoic acid (RA) can transform feather  phenotypes and alter the anterior-posterior axis of skin  appendages, with concomitant changes in Hox expression.  Epithelial-mesenchymal  recombination revealed that the Hox  micro gradient may be regulated by a signal from the  epithelium. By the use of  RA responsive element-LacZ-  containing F9 cells it has been shown that a wave of  endogenous RA activity propagates bilaterally from the  midline. Dr. Chuong now suggests that 1) Hox codes of skin  appendages determine the phenotype of skin appendages while  the micro gradient determines the A-P axis of skin  appendages, 2) The two gradients are regulated  independently: the macro gradient may originate from the  mesoderm, but the micro gradient is determined later and may  be determined by the epithelium, and 3) RA is an endogenous  morphogen in skin morphogenesis, with a dynamic distribution  pattern during feather development similar to that of  morphogenetic furrow in Drosophila eye development. To test  these hypotheses, Dr. Chuong will ectopically express Hox  genes on skin appendages in ovo using retroviral gene  delivery. The ontogeny of Hox codes will be traced back to  dermatome stage using DiI tracing and somite transpos ition.  To search for the signals that regulate Hox gene expression,  a model using epithelial-mesenchymal rotation/recombination  of skin explants was developed in which the inducing signal  can be analyzed. To test whether endogenous RA is involved  in pattern formation, RARE-LacZ containing cell monolayers  will be used to detect the dynamic RA distribution in  developing skin. Aided by the distinct morphology of  feathers, these novel approaches will add new dimensions to  our understanding of pattern formation.  ***",
