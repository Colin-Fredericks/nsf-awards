 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kirkpatrick  9407969   This project will investigate the mechanisms for the diversification of mating displays and mating preferences between closely related species.  These traits are known to diversify at a very high rate and therefore represent a model system for studies of the factors responsible for behavioral differences both within and between the species.  The investigators will use mathematical models that describe genetic change in mating displays, mating preferences, and other traits that are genetically coupled to them.   Research will focus on three mechanisms: (1) direct survival effects of mating preferences (the \"direct selection\" hypothesis), (2) genetic coupling between traits that increase survival and mating preferences (the \"good genes\" hypothesis), and (3) mate choice copying.  Recent experimental data show that all three mechanisms influence preferences and displays, but have not evaluated their relative importance.  Mathematical models developed in this research program will use data to produce the first quantitative estimates of the relative impacts of these mechanisms.  Results will produce insights into the causes of behavioral variation and the processes of speciation.",
