 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) at the University of Chicago supports interactive  research in four major groups covering a broad area of  condensed matter and materials science.    Researchers in the group concerned with surface dynamics  seek to develop an improved molecular-level understanding of  interfacial phenomena over a range from relatively simple  atomic adsorbates to complex molecular systems.  Investigators in the group focused on disordered materials  attempt to elucidate the means by which macroscopic order  can emerge from microscopic disorder. The group  investigating mesoscale structure and response addresses a  broad class of technologically important materials whose  fundamental behavior is dominated by the physics and  chemistry of constituents at the mesoscopic length scale.  The group of researchers involved with the investigation of  the macroscopic dynamics of materials combines experiment,  theory and computer simulation to explore macroscopic motion  within materials and moving phase boundaries.  These  problems bear on such critical and diverse technological  issues as processing of powders, oil recovery,  electrodeposition procedures, and oxidation of alloys.    The MRSEC also supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research  and  fosters research participation by undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is associated with an educational outreach program  with special emphasis on attracting and keeping women and  underrepresented minorities in science.  The MRSEC has an  industrial visitors program and a newly formed industrial  liaison committee.   There is an active research  collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory.  The MRSEC  currently involves 25 senior personnel,  10 postdoctoral  research associates, 8 technical staff members, 21 graduate  students, and 10 undergraduates.   The Chicago MRSEC is  directed by Professor Leo Kad anoff.",
