 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410537  Bock    Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time Program  Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)  Coastal Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The NSF/CoOP Study  will augment and collaborate with the ONR-sponsored Marine Boundary  Layer (MBL) Advanced Research Initiative (ARI) project scheduled  for 1995 off the coast of Monterey, California.  The overall  scientific project is interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts  addressing chemical and biological parameters, while the ONR study  focuses on physical oceanographic and meteorological parameters.     This is a collaborative project between investigators from the  University of Rhode Island and from Scripps Institution of  Oceanography.  The research will improve our understanding of  air-sea gas transfer under different environmental conditions at  the air-sea interface.  A new in situ instrument will be developed  to measure the gas transfer velocity (k) on time scales of minutes  to hours that are much shorter than conventional tracer techniques  (days or longer).   The instrument will be integrated into a small  research catamaran called LADAS which is towed behind a research  vessel.  LADAS carries a scanning laser slope gauge, to measure the  three-dimensional capillary-gravity wave spectrum, meteorological  instruments, and a long-wave monitoring capability.  Additionally  a surface microlayer sampler will be installed on the catamaran to  enable coincident measurements of the gas transfer velocity, small  scale roughness, wind stress, and surface chemical parameters.   LADAS will be deployed in several field experiments to determine  air-sea gas transfer rates under realistic ocean conditions and  especially to relate these observations over different spatial and  temporal scales in coastal environments.  Such analyses will not  only provide a more accurate parameterization of gas transfer  velocity by avoiding biases caused by long time averaging, but will  also provide insights  as to the transient nature of gas flux.  The  correlation of surface roughness and gas flux will benefit future  global remote sensing of air-sea gas exchange since surface  roughness is one of sea surface parameters than can be remotely  measured from aircraft and satellites.",
