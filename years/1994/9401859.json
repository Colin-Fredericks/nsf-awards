 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401859  Ramanathan       This award supports a mathematical research program in a  range of related areas in harmonic analysis, concentrating on  time-frequency analysis and wavelet theory, with potential  applications to signal processing.  There are three main themes  of the program.  The first concerns the analysis and   reconstruction of signals from nonuniform samples of their Gabor  transforms.  The nonuniformity of the sampling set requires the  introduction of new techniques with results formulated in terms  of the properties of coherent states.  Questions such as whether  a given collection of time-frequency shifts of a fixed  windowfunction are complete, are minimal, form a frame or form a  Riesz basis will be taken up.  The second line of investigation  studies singular values of Weyl operators.  These operators are  closely related to Gabor transform with good localizing  properties, i.e. operators which concentrate the energy of a  function in a given region of space.  The localization properties  of these operators can be inferred from the behavior of their  singular values.  Studies of the asymptotic decay of these values  will be carried out.  Work on wavelets and dilation equations  continues earlier work which developed important applications of  an older notion of joint spectral radius to the existence and  smoothness characterizations of solutions to dilations equations.   In this work, properties of non-canonical solutions will be  studied. These include non-compactly supported or distributional  solutions.  Connections with random matrices will be considered.        Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These  components are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.   Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination of  the components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform  are examples of tools used in this context; o ne discrete , the  other representing a continuous decomposition. More recently  the wavelet theory added new dimensions to some of the more  classical approaches to harmonic analysis.  ***",
