 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317533  Lassar    The regulation of cell type determination is a crucial  aspect of early embryogenesis in all multicellular  organisms. A variety of approaches taken by several  laboratories has led to the identification of a family of  structurally related skeletal muscle transcriptional  regulators (the myogenic HLH proteins) which play a crucial  role in skeletal muscle determination and differentiation.  The myogenic HLH regulators can activate muscle gene  expression in various cellular contexts implying that no  tissue specific factors other than this family of regulatory  proteins are needed to initiate muscle differentiation in  the mesodermal and non-mesodermal cells tested. During  vertebrate development skeletal muscle precursors are first  observed in the somite, an axial structure which gives rise  to dermis, skeletal muscle, cartilage and bone. The earliest  expression of the myogenic bHLH regulators occurs in the  myotomal cells of the somite, which give rise to all  skeletal muscle in vertebrates. The expression of the  myogenic bHLH genes during cell type specification of  skeletal muscle suggests that activation of these regulators  may in fact commit cells to the skeletal muscle cell  lineage. There are a number of unanswered questions  regarding  specification of  somitic cells into the muscle  lineage: 1) When are the somitic cells giving rise to the  myogenic lineage first specified to this fate, 2) what  triggers the final commitment and 3) which signals are  involved in this process?  Experiments have demonstrated  that early somite cells of chicken or mouse, when explanted  in tissue culture, are not able to differentiate into muscle  unless they are co-cultured with either neural tube or  overlying  epithelial cells. Thus neural tube (and some  types of epithelia) are inducing the pluripotent early  somite cells to differentiate into muscle. Dr. Lassar has  recently demonstrated that neural tube dependent induction  of somitic skeletal muscle differentiation is ac companied by  activation of the myogenic HLH regulators. Thus a factor(s)  from the neural tube induces skeletal muscle differentiation  in somitic cells via activation of the myogenic HLH  regulatory family. By employing an in vitro induction assay,  he will attempt to characterize and molecularly clone the  neural factor(s) responsible for inducing chick and /or  mouse early somite cells to enter the skeletal muscle cell  lineage. The goal of this work is to understand both the  inductive events as well as eventually identify the  intracellular mediators necessary for activation of the  myogenic bHLH regulators.  ***",
