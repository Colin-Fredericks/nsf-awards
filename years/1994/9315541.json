 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315541  Hoss    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project between Dr. Donald Hoss, Chief  of the Coastal and Estuarine Ecology Division,  National Marine Fisheries Service, and Professor  Masaru Tanaka, Department of Fisheries, Kyoto  University, Kyoto, Japan.  The project combines  field observations and laboratory experiments on  paralicthid founders in Japan.  In addition to  Dr. Hoss, Dr. John Selden Burke, a fisheries  biologist at NMFS, will participate in the  research in Japan.     The project involves field sampling to determine  vertical distribution of flounder larvae  immigrating to nursery areas in Wakasa Bay, Japan  (Japan Sea) and Onslow Bay, North Carolina in  relation to tidal stage.  Benthic sampling will  be conducted to determine age and relative growth  rates (otolith analysis) of settled flounders  among shelf, beach, and estuarine nursery  habitats in the two study areas.  Laboratory  experiments will be conducted to compare (1)  activity patterns of larvae relative to tidal  stage, (2) developmental patterns of levels and  production activity of hormones associated with  migration and adaptation to low salinity  (thyroxine and prolactin), and (3) development  rates and size at metamorphosis.  Although the  study areas are similar in climate, they differ  in tidal range, coastal salinity, and  availability of estuarine habitat, allowing  comparison of paralichthids from different  physical environments.  Similarities and  differences between the species in relation to  physical factors should provide insight to  processes of recruitment to nurseries.  ***",
