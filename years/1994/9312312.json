 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational   chemistry program.  Rigorous quantum mechanical calculations will be   carried out to study the internal dynamics of weakly bound systems,   particularly, rare gas heteroclusters and hydrogen-bonded dimers.  The   project has three main components.  (1) Quantum Monte Carlo methods will   be applied to clusters consisting of a hydrogen halide molecule with   several argon atoms to study the effects of solvent-solute interaction on   energetics, structure, and the vibrational spectrum.  (2) Improved   computational methods will be developed for treating rovibrational states   of four-atom clusters with one covalent bond.  Large amplitude   distortions of all five weak bonds will be treated explicitly.  (3)   Accurate quantum calculations will be carried out for mode-specific   vibrational predissociation dynamics of hydrogen halide dimers to obtain   theoretical predictions of predissociation lifetimes and rotational state   distributions of the resulting monomer fragments.      Advances during the past decade in molecular beam technology and laser   spectroscopy have made it possible today to carry out detailed and highly   precise measurements of the relative energies of vibrational and   rotational states of very small molecular clusters in the gas phase.    These experiments are potential sources of important, highly accurate,   and detailed information about weak interatomic forces, but further   theoretical work is required to fully extract this information.   The   present project  is a theoretical study of three particular classes of   clusters ranging in size from 4 to 17 atoms.   The significant difference   between these clusters and typical stable molecules with the same number   of atoms are their extreme floppiness.    Well developed mathematicals   methods already exist for solving the quantum mechanical equations of   motion for the small amplitude vibrations of typical molecules.  The   theory of the more compli cated, large amplitude, motion in weakly bound   clusters is an active area of current research.   This work is motivated,   aside from inherent scientific curiosity, by the need for quantitative   information about weak intermolecular forces to be used in subsequent   computer simulations of molecular motion in large molecular systems, e.g.    molecules of biological interest and molecules in liquid solution.",
