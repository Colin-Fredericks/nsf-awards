 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360093  Peterson    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  will develop software that enables a researcher to develop and  document a social data set.  The software will ease development by  automating those tasks that can best be done by computer.  It will  improve instrumentation and documentation by providing a structure  and format that are complete and of high quality.  It will also  eliminate much of the post-data-collection effort of documenting a  data set for public use.  The proposed software program would be a  significant resource for social scientists.  It would provide a  tool to assist the researcher with several steps in the research  process, including data set development, documentation, cleaning,  and analysis file creation.  Furthermore, it would integrate all  these steps in one program and provide a link to the archiving task  for those data sets that are to be placed in the public domain.    Successful completion of this research will lay the groundwork for  highly useful computer software tools of value not only to social  scientists but also to market researchers, government statistical  agencies, and others in applied fields that employ social data.  ***",
