 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318709  Maine    The long range goal of this proposal is to elucidate the  molecular basis of regulatory cell signaling during  development of multicellular organisms. In particular this  proposal investigates the mechanisms underlying two such  regulatory interactions in the nematode, Caenorhabditis  elegans: induction of mitosis in the germ line and induction  of the anterior pharynx in the early embryo. Although these  two cell signaling processes occur in different tissues and  at different times in development, they share at least one  common component: the glp-1 gene.  Extensive genetic,  molecular, and immunocytochemical studies suggest that glp-1  acts as a signal receptor in each of these induced tissues.  Cell signaling pathways mediated by glp-1 related receptors  play a general role in metazoan development and growth  control: Drosophila and C. elegans homologs mediate  regulatory cell signaling during development and vertebrate  homologs are proto-oncogenes. Relatively little is known  about the intercellular signaling pathways mediated by glp-1  and related receptors. As a means of identifying other  components of the glp-1 mediated pathway, extragenic  suppressors and enhancers of glp-1 mutation were generated.  Suppressors and enhancers of glp-1 are likely to be  mutations in other genes in the intercellular signaling  pathway mediated by glp-1. This proposal focuses on two  genes identified as recessive suppressors, sog-1 and sog-10,  and on a set of recessive enhancer (ego) mutations.  Genetic  and molecular studies that analyze the roles of these  suppressor and enhancer genes in germline and embryonic cell-  cell interactions are proposed. 1)  sog-1  has been well  characterized genetically; it may be a member of a redundant  gene family. Here, a molecular analysis is outlined that  will describe the sog-1 product and its expression and  localization patterns during development. 2) A preliminary  genetic and phenotypic analysis of sog-10 has been  completed; here, a more det ailed genetic analysis is  proposed that will describe the general role of sog-10 in  development. A subsequent molecular analysis will describe  the gene product and its expression and localization  patterns during development. 3) A limited genetic analysis  of a set of ego mutations will be done to identify which ego  gene is most likely to encode a component of the glp-1  mediated intercellular signaling pathway. This particular  ego gene will be genetically analyzed to determine its role  in germline proliferation and other aspects of development.  ***",
