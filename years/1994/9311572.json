 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311572  McGuckin    This project greatly expands researchers' access to confidential  longitudinal microeconomic data.  Currently, these data are  available only to researchers working at Center for Economic  Studies (CES) offices at the headquarters of the U.S. Bureau of  the Census near Washington, D.C.  The project will establish a  pilot Research Data Center (RDC) at the Boston regional office of  the Census Bureau.  This pilot RDC will give researchers a second  location where they will be able to carry out research projects,  in a manner that serves the needs of the research community and  the security concerns of the Census Bureau.  The project will use  the experience gained at the Boston pilot RDC to develop plans  (including sources of funding) for establishing RDCs at other  secure locations, possibly including universities, and  preliminary evaluation methods to provide researchers with remote  access to the data.    This proposal includes four research projects to start the Boston  RDC, and provides for an early Request for Proposals, open to all  researchers, to obtain more projects.  Researchers will have  access to confidential micro-panel files built from data  collected under the Census Bureau's various economic censuses and  surveys, including data on business establishments ,e.g.,  manufacturing plants and firms, and including extended databases  on research and development expenditures, pollution abatement  cost expenditure data, and data on establishment emissions of  toxins, air pollution and water pollution. This project is  important for the global change initiative because it provides  researchers better access to the data needed to study a wide  range of issues related to industrial activity and the  environment.    An important objective of the RDCs, already a part of many CES  projects, is to combine publicly available and confidential data  sets from within and outside the Census Bureau to create new  databases and expand research opportunities.  In this way, the   RDCs will becomes secure repositories of a variety of datasets  for research purposes.",
