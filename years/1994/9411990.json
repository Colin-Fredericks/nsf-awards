The US side will be led by  Dr. Robert Abel of the New Jersey Marine Science Consortium at  Stevens Institute of Technology.  The workshop provides for an  exchange of technology information on techniques and  capabilities, and for the development and application of this  technology for specific projects of mutual interest in ocean  observations, measurements of environment change, and for  resource assessment and sustainable development.  The researchers  will focus on: (1) Advances in Ocean Survey Technology; (2)  Sensors/Instrumentation Systems; and (3) automated, unmanned,  untethered undersea vehicles and robotics capability.  The  workshop will increase the technical knowledge base and identify  areas for cooperative engineering research in advanced ocean  technology where, historically, a major portion was developed  under military auspices.         This project in biological and critical systems fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling  leading experts in Russia and the United States to combine  complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***",
