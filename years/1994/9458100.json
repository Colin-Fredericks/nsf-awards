 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458100  Bredt    Nitric oxide (NO) is a noxious free radical gas which,  remarkably, functions as an endogenous biological messenger  molecule.  Initially identified in mammalian macrophages and  endothelial cells, NO appears to have prominent influences  in diverse tissues throughout the animal kingdom.  NO  represents a major divergence from previously characterized  cellular signals.  While other transmitters reversibly  interact with high affinity receptors in a \"lock-and-key\"  manner, NO achieves signaling specificity not by its three  dimensional shape but rather by its radical chemical  reactivity.  Under ambient conditions NO is a lipophilic  gas; these properties allow it to rapidly diffuse into cells  without being restrained by cellular barriers.  The  discovery of NO as a messenger has prompted a search for  other small reactive biological mediators and already  several have been found in organisms ranging from bacteria  to primates.    This laboratory is using molecular and genetic approaches to  define the roles of NO in the functioning and development of  the nervous system.  Owing to its reactive free-radical  structure, experimentally adding NO to a biological system  may cause non-specific effects which are physiologically  unimportant.  Also, NO is technically difficult to deliver  in a manner which resembles endogenous synthesis.  To avoid  these problems these studies will make use of transgenic NOS  \"knockout\" mice generated by targeted disruption of the  endogenous gene.  These animals are viable and furtile and  should serve as an excellent model to study the neuronal  functions for NO.  The PI will also develop a \"dominant  negative\" genetic approach to delete NOS from specific cell  types and during selected stages of development.  These and  other future studies of NO may help serve as a model for  understanding signaling by other members of this new class  of biological messengers.",
