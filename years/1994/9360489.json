 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360489  Simpson  Fisheries have become an increasingly more significant food source.  Currently 30% of the protein consumed by Americans comes from the sea and this percentage is growing.  Over the past decade fisheries have experienced more regulation because of bycatch -- that portion of a fisherman's catch that is not the primary target.  Because of the increased regulation caused by bycatch, fisheries management has become increasingly more difficult.  Techniques that can automatically and non-intrusively detect, classify, and quantify fish populations are of intense interest to all levels of fisheries management.  Technologies are needed to improve the ability of fisheries management to monitor the fisheries.  One area that will immediately benefit the fisheries is a more efficient and effective technique automatically to detect and classify fish.  A sonar system with these capabilities does not currently exist.  The transition of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sonar signal classification technology to fisheries would be of great benefit to American Fishing fleets, American fisheries management groups, and to our dwindling American manufacturing base.  Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc. (SFS) is developing a fish detection and classification system that utilizes these defense technologies.",
