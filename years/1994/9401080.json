It is a study  of  some  of  the  social  bases for the acceptance or rejection of double standards  for   rewarding  performance  of  tasks.   A  series  of   social  psychological experiments will be carried out using undergraduate  students, with computers used to simulate partners cooperating in  performing an assigned task. Through manipulation of the relative  rewards given to subjects and partners and also the social status  characteristics  of  partners,  reactions  of  subjects  to   the  establishment of a differential reward structure will be studied.       Previous work in experimental social psychology has examined  either  how standards for evaluating others or individual  reward  expectations  are established, but this will be one  of  the  few  attempts  to  study both processes simultaneously.   Unlike  some  experiments,  the  results  of this project  should  have  direct  implications  for  important real-life situations  involving  the  acceptance  or  challenging  of  double  standards  for   judging  individual performance.  In addition to the scientific  gains  to  be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist  a  highly  promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus  it  contributes  to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next  generation of social scientists.  ***",
