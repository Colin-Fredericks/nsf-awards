 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311522  Price  There is non-linear response of the Earth's magnetospheric system  to the solar wind.  We propose to determine the degree of this non-  linearity as a function of the level of activity and to use the 11  station magnetometer records to quantify more completely the nature  of the solar wind driver and the nature of the magnetospheric  response.    The degree of non-linearity in the magnetospheric response to the  solar wind is controlled by the level of magnetospheric activity.   Our primary interest in predictability is for the identification of  deterministic non-linear response; our interest in predictability  qua prediction is secondary to that.  To continue our previous non-  linear analysis, we will analyse the response of the magnetosphere  (as given by the 11 auroral oval magnetometer station records) to  the solar wind input (given by the parameters v, n, B and  calculated from 1 minute resolution ISEE-3 data).  We should be  able to identify the solar wind parameters which have the most  effect on the magnetosphere and the prevailing pattern of response  of the magnetosphere, as observed by the ground station  magnetometers.  Physically, it is likely that the present auroral  electroject indices cannot reveal significant dynamical information  about electroject dynamics.  We will use the results of this non-  linear prediction study to propose a new index based on the data  from the 11 stations which more accurately represents the solar  wind driven activity in the Earth's magnetosphere.  we will  generate the basis function whose projection leads to the least  prediction error.  ***",
