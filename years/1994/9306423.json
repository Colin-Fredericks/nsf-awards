 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current projections indicate that the partial pressure of CO2 in                earth's atmosphere will be double the level of the preindustrial                era somewhere between the years 2036 and 2060 resulting in a 20C -              30C increase in global temperature.  There is a large uncertainty               concerning the quantitative ability of the oceans to absorb                     anthropogenic CO2 and the influence the uptake will have on global              climate.  A small, low power, low cost, analytical instrument is                proposed with the sensitivity, durability, and long term stability              to make continuous measurements of the CO2 concentration above and              below the oceanic surface for periods of one year or longer without             calibration or repair.                                                                                                                                          During Phase I, prototype CO2 sensors were fabricated and tested                with the capability of responding to 100 x 10-12g of CO2.  In                   laboratory tests, the prototype sensor was able to measure CO2                  levels to 100 ppm in the presence of oxygen and nitrogen gases.                 Power consumption was measured at 250 uW per sensor.                                                                                                            During Phase II, high performance sensors will be incorporated into             a prototype CO2 monitoring instrument system suitable for                       deployment                                                                      with existing ocean monitoring and telemetry systems.  Performance              of the prototype will be quantified in the laboratory and ocean                 environment.",
