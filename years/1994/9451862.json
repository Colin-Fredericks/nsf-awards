MPLC will also  be used in the general science laboratories for the separation of  \"real-life\" samples to make the course more realistic and exciting  to the students.  Liquid chromatography will be introduced  progressively in the four organic chemistry courses, so that  students will gain experience with a variety of chromatographic  techniques. Experiments will be developed that use MPLC, HPLC, and  flash chromatography within the context of organic chemistry where  few undergraduate experiments have been published that use MPLC,  HPLC, or flash chromatography.  The instructional experiments, many  of which will originate in the department, should be of interest to  others.",
