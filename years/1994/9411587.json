 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411587  Pinkston  Communication complexity and latency is a critical problem in  multiprocessor systems.  A major portion of communication latency  is associated with the interconnect network.  Optics has many  advantages for achieving low latency, scalable interprocessor  communication.  Recently, many optical interconnects have been  designed; however, little regard for system-level influences on the  interconnect architecture were taken into account in these designs.   The proposed research is to investigate an integrated design  solution for low latency multiprocessor communication.  Program  behavior, architecture, and optical technology considerations are  factored into the overall interconnect design.  This will lead to  a design capable of increased network throughput and optimal  processor-memory connectivity.     Engineering design principles will be developed for applying high  bandwidth, reconfigurable optical interconnects to electronic  digital multiprocessor systems.  An optical interconnect strategy  that incorporates latency reduction and hiding techniques will be  developed.  An interconnect simulator will be written to assist in  the design and performance evaluation efforts.  A small scale  optical interconnect demonstrator unit will be built to show  feasibility.  Hence, an outgrowth of this research is an optical  design framework (design methodology, simulation tools and  prototype) that will build infrastructure and allow for empirical  evaluation of a large design space.  ***",
