The task force is currently developing the technical specifications for  the metropolitan area network; undertaking a six-month demonstration project connecting a few  schools to the Internet; laying the legal and financial groundwork for a multiple school district,  multi-million dollar bond issue to fund school technology initiatives; and outlining the structure  of the governing authority required to institutionalize the collaborative project.    MTEN proposes to use a one-year NIE Planning Grant to prepare the groundwork for a strongly  competitive infrastructure proposal in the following year. The objectives of this planning exercise  also include:           The refinement of a metropolitan area network design.
