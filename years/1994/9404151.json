 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying theme of this research is the synthesis of recent  advances in nonparametric Bayesian methods, such as mixture  models and Dirichlet process models, and some important  statistical models and concepts, including nonlinear  autoregression, neural networks and wavelet representations. Key  elements in the proposed research are computational issues.  Specific problems include Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to  estimate mixture models which do not allow straightforward Gibbs  sampling implementation, estimation of variable architecture  neural networks, and estimation of the posterior distribution of  the coefficients of a wavelet representation of an appropriate  probability model. The neural network research will be based on  formulating the neural network approach as a hierarchical  nonlinear regression model with a mixture involving a random  number of terms and hierarchies. Work on the wavelet  representations will provide thresholding rules as maximum  posterior estimates in a hierarchical Bayes model.  This project brings together methodology from Bayesian function  estimation with problems arising in applied fields. In  particular, the research deals with neural network models,  wavelet representations, and nonlinear autoregression.  Applications of neural networks are found in biology, psychology,  physics, engineering, and computer science. Wavelet  representations have been found useful in cleaning noisy data.  Nonlinear autoregression is an extension of widely used methods  to study time series data.",
