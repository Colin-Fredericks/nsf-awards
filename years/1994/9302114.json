 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302114  Friedman  Contexts are a perfect means for expressing variable sharing  across multiple lexical scopes.  A context is a syntax tree with  nonterminal leaves, called holes, that are to be filled later  with terms (which are contexts as well).  Unlike substitution,  filling a context's hole with a term causes the term's free  variables to be captured by the context's bound variables.  First-  class contexts thus are a basis for incremental development of  information-sharing program pieces.    Giving contexts first-class status facilitates separate  compilation of contexts.  The target code can be reused on  different instantiations of the context's free variables or be  reused on resolving its different filling terms' free variables.  Contextual programming brings compilation, linking (context  filling), and evaluation under the user's control.  It is a  conceptually simple and yet very general programming paradigm.  In particular, modular and object-oriented programming are both  special cases of contextual programming.    This research has both formal and experimental components.  Formal reasoning systems furnish a platform for analyzing and  comparing contextual programming with other programming language  concepts and mechanisms.  Experiments are expected to generate  insightful information to evaluate design decisions, uncover  deficiencies, and develop a better understanding of contextual  programming.  ***",
