 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested by the Emory University Biology Department for the  purchase of a confocal microscope. The purchase will include a BioRad  MRC-1000 confocal laser scanning imaging system and a Nikon Optiphot-2  microscope component. This system is unsurpassed in terms of specimen  brightness, image resolution and ease of analysis. These capabilities  are required by Biology Department labs that need to perform state of  the art analyses of protein distribution in complex tissues.  Principally four NSF-funded labs will use the equipment for research  and training activities, although it is anticipated that wider  departmental use will occur periodically.    Three of the labs are investigating various aspects of insect  neurogenesis (Ellis, Siegler and Yedvobnick) while the fourth lab is  investigating sperm morphogenesis and migration in C. elegans  (L'Hernault). The Ellis lab will utilize confocal microscopy to  characterize the spatial distribution of the extramacrochaetae (emc)  protein during embryonic development. Originally characterized for its  role in achaete-scute regulation during sensory organ development, emc  is now known to function more widely during development. Preliminary  studies suggest that emc is expressed throughout the embryonic germ  layers. The precise relationship between emc expression and  achaete-scute expression will be characterized in the embryo. The  Siegler lab will use confocal microscopy in conjunction with  immunohistochemistry to identify neurons of known birthdate according  to type, and thus test hypotheses about birth order within identified  CNS lineages of the grasshopper. The Yedvobnick lab studies lateral  inhibition and associated signal transduction to the nucleus during  embryonic neurogenesis in Drosophila. They will utilize the equipment  to investigate cytoplasmic-nuclear partitioning of the product of the  neurogenic locus mastermind. They will also investigate potential  physical interactions between cytoplasmic mastermind protein and the   transmembranous Notch protein via colocalization assays. The L'Hernualt  lab studies sperm morphogenesis that initiates as a multicellular  syncitium. Confocal immunofluorescence will allow use of available  antibodies to localize Golgi-derived membrane proteins within this  complex three dimensional array. In addition, wild type and mutant  sperm motility within the hermaphrodite reproductive tract will be  examined by confocal microscopy, using already developed fluorescent  tagging techniques. It is clear that conventional fluorescent  microscopic techniques do not provide sufficient spatial detail to  study these C. elegans sperm phenomena.       The equipment will also be used extensively for the training of  undergraduate and graduate students. The Biology Department has a  sophisticated program for involving undergraduates in research. Beyond  independent research Emory undergraduates are offered advanced project  labs in Genetics, Neurobiology and Physiology; Development is planned  for next year. In addition to academic year projects, summer research  programs funded from NSF REU and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute  bring in students from Emory and many other institutions. Although  undergraduate use of the equipment will mostly be restricted to  research purposes we anticipate incorporation of confocal microscopy  demonstrations into the advanced project labs. Graduate students from  programs including Neuroscience, Cell and Developmental Biology, and  Genetics and Molecular Biology often rotate through Biology Department  labs and several have joined the NSF-funded labs described above. Their  utilization of the equipment should greatly enhance the quality of  research output from the Biology Department.",
