 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312249  Isayev       The main objective of the project is to develop basic   knowledge for a new science-based technology of continuous   devulcanization of vulcanized elastomers.  It is well known that   vulcanized elastomers having a three-dimensional network cannot   flow under the effect of heat and/or pressure.  It has been   discovered that through the application of certain levels of   ultrasolic amplitudes in special devices in the presence of   pressure and optionally heat, the three-dimensional network of   vulcanized elastomer can be broken down within a short period of   time on the order of one second or less.  As a most desirable   consequence, ultrasonically treated vulcanized rubber becomes soft,   thereby enabling this material to be reprocessed, shaped, and   revulcanized in a manner similar to that employed with unvulcanized   elastomer.  The study outlines series of experiments enabling us to   (i) identify an aptitude of polysulfidic, monosulfidic, and carbon-   carbon crosslinks to ultrasonic devulcanization; (ii) to establish   optimal conditions for the devulcanization process; (iii) to   evaluate the rheological properties of devulcanized rubbers; and   (iv) to measure the mechanical performance of revulcanized rubber   products made of devulcanized rubber.       The recycling of vulcanized elastomers (primarily used tires)   has become a major environmental and social issue.  The development   of a novel technique for the reclaiming of rubber will have a   significant impact on the further expansion of a recycling  technology  base through the optimization of the process and new  discoveries.",
