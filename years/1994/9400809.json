 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400809  Ainley  Seabird studies will be conducted in conjunction with a physical   oceanographic cruise that will take place in the Amundsen and  Bellingshausen seas during February and March 1994.  The  objectives of the oceanography and design of the cruise track  offers an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the region's  avifauna, which never before has been described, but more  importantly to use a new technique to resolve an apparent  inconsistency in the extent to which the pack-ice edge and the  Antarctic Slope Front affects pelagic densities of top trophic  predators in the Southern Ocean.  The cruise constitutes the  first modern oceanographic investigation of the Bellingshausen  and Amundsen seas, fully one-third of the circumference of  Antarctica.  Three hypotheses will be tested: (i) when a shelf-  break front is present, seabird biomass will be elevated above  that of adjacent waters; (ii) the elevated biomass of seabirds at  the ice edge is a function of an increase in abundance of the  bird's prey in response to increased phytoplankton concentration;  and/or (iii) the elevated biomass of seabirds at the ice edge is  an artifact of sampling dependent on ship speed and direction  relative to that of the birds.  Data would complement those taken  in the tropical and temperate Pacific, allowing for a better  understanding of the adaptations of birds to life in polar  regions.  Overall, our research results will increase our  understanding of how marine birds use wind as an energy source,  providing further insight into the environmental factors that  structure communities of these top-trophic predators.  ***",
