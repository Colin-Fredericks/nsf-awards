 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maley  9316321  Deoxycytidylate deaminase provides a product which is essential as  a substrate for thymidylate synthase and thus DNA synthesis.  Any  interference with the expression of either enzyme can result in a  severe imbalance (toxicity) of nucleotide synthesis in the cell.   An ultimate goal is to optimize toxicity in tumor cells and  minimize the effect on normal cells.  By understanding the  properties and structure of these critical enzymes it may be  possible to rationally design compounds which can achieve the above  stated goal.  Now, for the first time two sources (T4 and human) of  deoxycytidylate deaminase are available and have been expressed in  large enough quantities to begin x-ray crystallographic studies on  their structure.  Since deoxycytidylate deaminase is an allosteric  enzyme very finely regulated within the cell and in vitro by its  positive effector, dCTP, and its negative effector, dTTP, it  provides the opportunity to clarify the mechanism of allosteric  regulation.  From the crystallographic data it may be possible to  design better inhibitors of deoxcytidylate deaminase than those  already available such as tetrohydrodeoxyuridylate and pyrimidine-  2-one deoxyribosemonophosphate.  In any case better inhibitors  could complement or synergize the action of thymidylate synthase  inhibitors as well.  Deoxycytidylate deaminase is a metalloprotein  with 2 mols of zinc per subunit of the T4 enzyme and 1 mol of zinc  per subunit of the human enzyme.  Mutational studies will determine  the binding sites for zinc in the two enzymes as well as the ligand  binding sites.  The crystallographic data will also contribute to  location of the zinc atoms and different ligands within the  sequence of the protein.  An additional aspect of the current study  involves the possible role of deoxycytidylate deaminase in  stabilizing the T4 multienzyme aggregate, dNTP synthetase complex.  %%%  Deoxycytidylate diaminase catalyzes the conversion of dCMP to dUMP  and thus provides an esse ntial substrate for thymidylate synthetase  to produce dTMP.  Since dTMP is absolutely required for DNA  synthesis, its regulation is essential to cell growth and survival.   In diverse organisms, deoxycytidylate deaminase is allosterically  regulated by its end products, dCTP and dTTP, and plays a central  role in determining the cellular balance of the nucleotides.  ***",
