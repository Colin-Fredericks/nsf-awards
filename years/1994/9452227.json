The  physics department maintains an unusually large enrollment in  physics with more than 30% of the student body enrolled in a  physics course, due in large part to an aggressive laboratory  program at all levels.  This project will upgrade the laboratories  in four courses which follow the introductory course. The areas  selected are nuclear, low temperature, and X-ray fluorescence. The  use of the requested equipment in these four courses is expected to  increase our retention of majors among students coming out of the  introductory course. We also expect a measurable impact on the  number of majors coming out of these introductory courses: a goal  of 5% physics majors in a graduating class does not seem  unreasonable, given our present 3% ratio.   (At 5%, our major  productivity would be ten times the national average of one-half  percent.) The requested equipment will also be available to  students in our two local high schools and in the local community  college, on a late-afternoon basis.",
