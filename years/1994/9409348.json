 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409348  Leake       Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems reason from experience:   They solve new problems by retrieving relevant prior cases and  performing case adaptation knowledge is normally provided by the  system developer, hand-coded for a single task.  The difficulty of  encoding effective adaptation rules is widely recognized as a  serious impediment to the development of case-based reasoning  systems.  This research addresses that problem by developing a  model of automatic learning to improve case adaptation.  The model  learns memory search procedures to operationalize general  adaptation rules.  The model starts results in learning memory  search cases tracing the memory search processes used and their  results.  Those memory search cases reflect the applicability of  particular memory search strategies to particular adaption, learned  memory search cases are retrieved to provide specific guidance for  memory search.  The effects of the learning process on adaptation  performance are evaluated by a series of experiments including  \"ablation\" studies and direct assessment of the quality of the  adaptations by human subjects.",
