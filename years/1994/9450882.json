The number of students in the program has increased  dramatically in the last two years. One goal of the program is to  train students in environmental analysis. Ultraviolet-visible  spectrophotometry is widely used in analyzing inorganic substances  (e.g., phosphate, chromium) in environmental samples. We will  purchase a diode-array UV-visible spectrophotometer that can obtain  a spectrum in seconds, and automatically acquire kinetic data.    We propose to use the instrument in a number of classes in the  chemistry and biology curriculum. In instructional labs, we will  use the instrument largely for quantitative analysis of chemicals  of environmental interest and examining the spectra of biological  pigments, and we will also use it for kinetics. In students'  independent projects, we will use the instrument for evaluating the  effectiveness of certain enzymes in degrading pollutants by  examining the kinetics of reaction.  We believe that using environmental analysis in laboratory classes  is an effective way of increasing student interest in science, and  that the laboratory exercises that we are using can be adopted by  any science program whether or not they have course offerings in  environmental science or a major in environmental science.",
