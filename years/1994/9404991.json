 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, involves  the study of several aspects of platinum group chemistry as related to catalysis of organic  reactions.  Specific areas to be pursued include 1) further examination of the use of  parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) as an NMR probe of reaction mechanisms in  hydrogenation reactions, 2) activation of organic molecules by reaction with cationic and odd  electron rhodium and iridium species, and 3) reactions of rhodium and iridium complexes in  water and as part of dendrimeric structures; the former has implications for environmentally  friendly technologies whereas the latter may provide a means of substrate discrimination and  therefore selectivity.  For the aqueous solution work, the ligands to be used will impart water  solubility to the metal complexes.    The majority of industrial manufacturing processes use some type of catalyst, which serves to  increase reactions rates and, therefore, increase throughput with lower energy costs, and  frequently to alter product selectivity.  New catalysts and improved catalytic processes require  both exploratory studies of possible new catalysts and the better mechanistic understanding of  existing catalysts.  In addition, more environmentally acceptable processes may result if existing  catalytic systems that operate in organic solvents can be converted to aqueous solution processes.   This project has objectives in all three of these areas.",
