The longstanding view that creole  verb complexes are organized around three core categories -  Anterior (Tense), Irrealis (Mood) and Non-punctual (Aspect) - has  come under increasing challenge in recent years, as our knowledge  of these language has grown.  This research focusses on the  semantic and syntactic organization of the TMA systems of two  Caribbean creoles - Belizean and Sranan (Suriname).  The main  purpose of the investigation is to test the extent to which the  TMA systems of these creoles share a common organization and set  of categories, and in what ways they conform to the so-called  \"prototypical\" Creole TMA system which some scholars believe to  owe its origin primarily to the influence of language universals  in creole genesis and development.  This is related to the  broader hypothesis that creole grammar directly reflects  Universal Grammar.  The study will investigate the forms which  encode the TMA categories of each creole, their characteristic  distribution in various types of predicate structure, and their  combinatory possibilities.  The investigation will concentrate on  the most conservative or \"basilectal\" variety of each creole.   The data on which the analysis will be based will be collected  from a sample of subjects in at least one rural community in each  country using recordings of natural speech, and direct  elicitation techniques, including questionnaires.  The analysis  will then be used to test the validity of claims concerning the  uniformity of creole TMA systems and their implications for  creole genesis.",
