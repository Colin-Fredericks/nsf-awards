 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues NSF support for the core activities of the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT), a National Science Foundation standing committee at the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC).  CNSTAT was established in 1972 at the recommendation of the President's Commission on Federal Statistics to fill a major gap in a highly decentralized federal statistical system.  The Committee focuses on improving the statistical methods and information on which public policy decisions are based.  The Committee strengthens the development of data for social science research, makes such data more accessible for research, and furthers the development of measurement and analytic methods for analysis and research.  The Committee identifies problem areas in which statistical questions are important to public policy and carries out studies within these areas by itself or by convening panels of other experts.  Distinguished statisticians and other scientists, who volunteer their services, are selected and appointed to the Committee by the NAS-NRC.    The Committee directly benefits the social sciences by (1) improving national statistics and furthering the development and application of statistical methods for social science research, (2) linking the federal statistical system and the social science research community, (3) involving academic scientists in research to improve national statistics, (4) providing forums for the exchange of information and ideas, and (5) advancing the social and economic sciences within the NAS-NRC and through the Committee's relationship with the Congress, OMB, and many research and program agencies.    With support for core activities, the Committee identifies important problem areas and establishes priorities, develops panel or workshop studies, selects participants, reviews study activities and reports, disseminates widely study results, and serves as an integrative force for the highly decentralized federal statistical system.  The NSF suppor t allows the Committee to identify and develop scientific studies for which federal agencies do not provide the leadership.  In addition, the NSF investment supports a unique process of intellectual development that is critical in a decentralized statistical system.  The Committee provides leadership over interdisciplinary areas by bringing together methodologically oriented statisticians along with federal agency staff and quantitatively oriented social scientists to work on real problems.  The Committee's reputation, credibility, and influence are widely known throughout the federal government and are the reasons why Congress, OMB, NSF, and other federal agencies turn to the Committee for advice.",
