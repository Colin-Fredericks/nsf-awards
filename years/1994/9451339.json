 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educational programs in bioprocess engineering that emphasize  cross-disciplinary interactions between scientists and engineers  and a multidisciplinary team approach to problem-solving, are  urgently required. The implementation of these programs is  difficult, however, because few models exist on which to base the  development of such curricula.  This ILI-LLD project will create a  bioprocessing laboratory which addresses two key problems in the  current education of bioprocess engineers: the lack of interaction  between engineers and students in the life sciences and the lack of  hands-on laboratory experience with industrially-relevant  bioprocessing equipment.  This project will develop a  multidisciplinary bioprocessing laboratory that utilizes  interactive multimedia computer training modules and involves  industrial participation in the design, implementation and  valuation phases of the laboratory. Six laboratory experiments and  three multimedia modules will be developed.  The multidisciplinary  environment will require students to develop the ability to  communicate with colleagues from the biological sciences and will  be facilitated by interactive multimedia which will be used to help  bridge the information gap between engineering and the biological  sciences.  Finally, industrial participation will insure that the  laboratory trains undergraduates to meet the needs of the  bioprocessing industry.  Industrial representatives will attend end  of the quarter oral presentations by the laboratory groups, and  will review the final products of the LLD project: detailed  descriptions of the experiments and the multimedia modules.",
