 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9453903  Cal State University  Los Angeles, CA  Cobb, Jewel    \"Southern California Science and Engineering Access Center &  Network\"    The ACCESS Center has made significant progress since 1989 in  addressing the under-representation of minority students in the  Science, Engineering, Mathematics (SEM) Pipeline in the Greater Los  Angeles Basin.  To that end, ACCESS has provided programs that are  coordinated, providing continuity and smooth passage through the  pipeline using strategies centered on teacher enhancement and  direct student intervention.  This 6th year Continuation Grant,  continues the work of the ACCESS Center and especially examines the  programs and practices of the past five years to identify those  that were successful for future replication.    The major thrust of ACCESS during this 6th year will be to engage  in a three pronged approach that includes reflective evaluation,  direct student intervention and teacher enhancement.  ACCESS has  identified two primary goals:  1) To determine what works by  evaluating a sample of ACCESS sponsored programs;  2) To strengthen  programs at existing sites by focusing resources on our most  successful programs.    To accomplish this first goal, ACCESS will convene an outside  evaluation committee that will be responsible for providing a  \"snap-shot\" of model programs as they have evolved over time.  In  addition to general demographic data, questions relating to direct  student intervention and teacher enhancement will be included.  MOS  data, school records, test scores, interviews and other sources  will be utilized in the evaluation plan that will be developed by  the implementation evaluation team.    Direct student intervention will continue with the College Prep  program.  ACCESS will be working with three spin-off site  replicated from the Lincoln High School model program in years 4  and 5.  This program targets students entering high school who are  under-represented minorities and are \"B\" or \"C\" students.  This  program  is a classroom based direct intervention program that  focuses on rigorous academic work with tutoring support, enrichment  activities, and parental involvement.    The third major activity will be to continue our Teacher  Enhancement programs in math and science for middle school  teachers.  Teacher enhancement directly supports our direct student  intervention efforts.  Included in our Teacher Enhancement program  is the Robert Moses Algebra Project, that is evolving as a national  model for systemic reform as evidenced by the Chicago and  Mississippi Delta Projects.  Participating teachers will receive  training with specific curriculum along with follow-up support  during classroom implementation.  Additionally, middle school  teachers will receive training in hands-on science through our  joint venture with CalTech called the Teacher Summer Science   Academy which will be funded from external sources.    During Year 6, there will be increased interaction with the Long  Beach Unified School District, which has shown a high level of  interest in the Algebra Project as part of their systemic reform  efforts.  Additionally, ACCESS will be working with the Inglewood  School District and collaborating with the Urban Systemic  Initiative (USI) if funded in Los Angeles.  ***",
