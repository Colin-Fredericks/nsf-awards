 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412910  Schlosser  The proposed work is the collection and analysis of seawater  samples for tritium and helium on an oceanographic cruise of the  RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas in  early 1994.  This region has been sparsely sampled in the past, and  little is known about the regional oceanographic processes.    The specific objectives of this cruise are to investigate the  large-scale oceanographic features, study the evolution of the  surface mixed layer and pycnocline in relation to the sea ice cover  and the underlying intermediate and deep water masses, determine  the location of the Antarctic Slope Front, and to investigate the  impact of warm circumpolar water flowing onto the continental  shelf.  Tritium is particularly useful in determining the rate of  penetration of continental shelf waters into deep oceanic basins,  while helium, in combination with oxygen isotopes, is a unique  tracer for water derived from the basal melting of ice shelves.    The proposed work complements these objectives of the cruise, since  the physical and chemical characteristics of tritium and helium are  well known and well suited for the investigation of subsurface  water mass formation and water circulation.  Knowledge of the  distribution of trace elements in the ocean broadens the time and  space scales of the direct observations, and allows inferences  about oceanic processes that go beyond the immediate limits of the  cruise.  ***",
