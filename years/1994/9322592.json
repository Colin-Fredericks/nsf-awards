 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is providing a parameterization of the entire family  of multidimensional perfect reconstruction subband coding filter  banks.  The motivation for doing this lies in practical application  of efficient coding and compression of image (video) type signals.   The parametric description of the family of multidimensional filter  banks so obtained is being used to design perfect reconstruction  filter banks having desirable frequency separation properties.  The  entire family of nonseparable multidimensional smooth wavelets  resulting from iterations of these filter banks is also being  completely parameterized in this way.    The techniques being adopted essentially consist of those from  multidimensional system theory.  The biorthogonal problems are  being approached by formulating them as matrix extension or matrix  completion problems in the ring of multidimensional polynomials or  stable proper rational functions; and the paraunitary problems as  problems of describing, or equivalently, synthesizing  multidimensional lossless systems.  Similar strategies are being  used in the acausal formulation as well as in dealing with special  classes of solutions such as the linear phase solutions.",
