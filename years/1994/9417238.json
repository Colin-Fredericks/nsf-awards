More  precisely, in the evolution of combustion processes, solutions to  mathematical models only partially account for a description of  the temperature region after reaction begins. Such evolutionary  processes are typically initiated by boundary heat addition, by  localized volumetric heating, by passage of a dynamic wave or by  very fast compression.  Localized heating during the ignition  period creates regions in which the heat production rate  accelerates as the reactants are consumed.  These sharply focused  hot spots can create explosive bursts of power generation which  can trigger the propagation of reaction waves through the medium.   It is of both practical importance and theoretical interest to  understand how and why detonations might be produced in various  circumstances.  The goal of this exploratory, high risk project  is to attempt to analyze how precisely describable hot spot  profiles, known for realistic ignition models, initiate these  reaction waves and determine their evolution.  ***",
