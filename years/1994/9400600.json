This class of C*-algebras  includes many classical examples. The investigation is  particularly directed to the case where n is greater than 1. In  this case each algebra contains a chain of ideals that will be  analyzed carefully. These ideals will be used to compute K-  groups, which are important invariants for the classification of  C*-algebras. The k-groups will also be used to study the  invertibility of systems of Toeplitz operators. In this  connection an attempt will be made to determine the stable rank  of certain commutator ideals. An analysis will be made of certain  automorphisms of the Toeplitz algebra on the unit circle which  are induced by homeomorphisms of the circle.  This project investigates certain algebras generated by classical  operators that arise from the study of singular integral  equations. These equations can be traced back to applications in  engineering and manufacturing such as the equation of the airfoil  and the stamping of metal plates. The abstract problem here is  the classification of these algebras using invariants. The  contributions will be to many fields of pure mathematics  including ergodic theory, analysis and geometry.  ***",
