 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452057  Onasch  This project seeks to combine multimedia technology with  cooperative learning in the classroom.  This combination increases  subject matter appeal to the students, more clearly demonstrates  concepts, allows exploration of the subject matter beyond the time  limitations of laboratory/class sessions, and allows flexibility to  accommodate different students' different learning styles. The  project focuses on Chemistry and the Life Sciences.  For Chemistry,  the multimedia technology allows improved molecular modeling, the  ability to \"slow down\" chemical reactions, the simulation of  equipment and/or experiments that are impractical at the lab bench,  provides students a qualitative \"standard\" against which to compare  lab bench results, increases safety and facilitates group  discussion.  In the Life Sciences, the equipment is being used for  such varied purposes as demonstrating concepts/experiments such as  ameboid motion or bacterial motility, photosynthesis, dissections,  time lapsing experiments, simulation of lung function, heart  attacks, etc.  The equipment is mobile; enough equipment stations  have been provided so that students can be divided into small teams  to conduct experiments, participate in group discussions, etc.  The  mobility also allows the equipment (in a supervised setting) to be  available for student use after class hours.",
