This  innovative curriculum integrates electrical, electronic,  mechanical, and computational engineering by introducing the  innovative use of videos and computers into the classroom and  laboratory. Emphasized is the use of a variety of CAD tools in  engineering design and analysis. A realistic engineering problem  setting is provided in the laboratory to enable the students to  address design and experimental issues in engineering.  The  objectives are accomplished through an integrated curriculum,  cross-listing many relevant EE and ME courses, and a Motion Control  in Electro-Mechanical Systems Laboratory in which the students are  exposed to the electrical, electronic, mechanical, and  computational aspects of motion control and hybrid-electric  vehicles.  Students electing this curriculum receive a certificate  of study in Electro-Mechanical System Design and complete their  senior design projects using the facilities available in the Motion  Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems Laboratory. Through this  curriculum the undergraduate students identify creatively capstone  design projects in electro-mechanical systems. The design projects  are realized through the open use of the laboratory and with the  participation of industrial sponsors who assist in defining  projects.  ***y",
