 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315940  Chrispeels, Marten J.      The goal of the proposal is to understand how proteins  are targeted to and accumulated in vacuoles of plant cells.  Although plant vacuoles are related to yeast vacuoles and  lysosomes of mammalian cells, they contain a much greater  variety of proteins, including storage proteins, lectins,  enzyme inhibitors, defense enzymes, as well as many of the  acidic hydrolases commonly found in all vacuoles and  lysosomes.  Much progress has been made in the last years  in understanding the sorting  signals that occur on the  vacuolar proteins themselves, but there is at present no  information on the cellular machinery  that allows these  proteins  to be correctly targeted to their destination.  Correct vacuolar targeting  of Golgi-derived vesicles  involves proteins on the outside of the vesicles that  mediate vesicle budding, transport and fusion of the  vesicles  with the target membrane  in a highly specific  manner.   These processes are thought to require coating and  uncoating with proteins  that bind to the membranes  and can  be recruited from the cytosol. The identification of these  proteins is the major goal of this proposal.  The Pi will exploit the recent isolation of the gene that  encodes a phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase from Arabidopsis  and investigate whether it has a role in vacuolar protein  sorting.  The function of this protein will be examined in  stably transformed and transient systems, or protoplasts  treated with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides.  The Pi will transform a yeast vps34 mutant with the plant  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gene to find interacting  proteins, and then rescue this strain with a plant cDNA  library.  The two-hybrid method is also going to be used to  identify this gene.  The Pi will also continue  work on the targeting of  proteins to the vacuolar membrane or tonoplast.  He will  make constructs that involve a reporter protein against  which he has antiserum, and different membrane spanning  domains.  %%%  The  significance of this work lies in a better understanding  of vacuole biogenesis in plant cells.  The research proposed  here will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms  by which the vacuolar proteins reach their destinations.  As  with other aspects of the secretory system, some of the  findings will be applicable to all eukaryotic cells, while  others will be specific for plant cells.  ***",
