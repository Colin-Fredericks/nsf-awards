 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318035  Lehman  Lake Victoria, the second largest lake on earth, has experienced striking changes during recent decades. Water transparency, oxygen concentrations, nutrients, algae, and fish communities have all changed markedly from historical conditions. The lake now supports an introduced fish fauna of reduced species diversity than in its indigenous state, and the future yield of the fishery is in doubt. Three hypotheses have been advanced to account for these changes: (1) nutrient inputs have accelerated from atmospheric sources and regional land use, (2) changes in regional climate have altered physical mixing of the lake, permitting prolonged periods of stratification and deoxigenation, and (3) the introduction of piscivorous fish has disrupted food webs reducing total fish biomass. This research will test hypothesis (1) critically, and provide a basis for subsequently testing the others if this hypothesis proves false.   %%%  This research is part of the goals of IDEAL, the International Decade for East African Lakes. Discrimination of these hypotheses could prompt remedial action, permit prediction of future states of the lake and its potential to produce harvestable protein, and provide the data to evaluate and interpret paleostratigraphic records. The results from this research will be instrumental in a reconstruction of the changes in Lake Victoria during the past century, and in calibrating the responses of continental regions to global and regional climate change over much longer time periods.",
