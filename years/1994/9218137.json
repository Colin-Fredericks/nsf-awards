The project analyzes the production and representation of social and cultural distinctions in the interaction of backwards ethnic groups known as Bai in western Yunnan, China.  The student will conduct participant observation and study life histories in  rural communities, as well as study rural popular theater groups, regional festivals, and representations of the archaeological past in local museums, to understand how the local ethnic groups relate to the state.   The theoretical issues to be studied are how  local ethnic groups resist national-state domination at the same time that they use state institutions to protect their political and cultural rights.\r\n      At a time when the world seems to be erupting in ethnic violence vis-a-vis weakened national states (e.g., USSR, Yugoslavia) we need to understand how local groups accept and reject different forms of national hegemony.  This sort of case study will provide valuable comparative information towards this theoretical goal.    \r\n",
