In  particular, this research seeks to provide a theoretical and  phenomenological understanding of low-energy supersymmetry and  superstring theories.    Theoretical arguments suggest that nature may be supersymmetric.   If this is so, it must be described by a supergravity theory, and  supergravity must be embedded in a more fundamental theory such  as the heterotic string.  The collaborators will use this theory  to investigate several aspects of low energy supersymmetry  phenomenology.  The PI is respected as a leader in the field of  elementary particle physics whose work has had a major influence  on numerous subdisciplines including supersymmetry, supergravity,  and superstring theory.  His Korean collaborator also is an  active string theorist.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
