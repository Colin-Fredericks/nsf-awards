The research scientists who supervise the students in this program are  also faculty in the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the State University of New York at Albany's School  of Public Health.  The WCL&R is a unique laboratory with state-of-the-art facilities, in which basic research  programs have developed alongside mission-oriented public health laboratories.  The research interests of the  participating BMS faculty cover a broad range, with emphasis in molecular genetics, cell biology and structural  biology.  Eleven undergraduate students interested in research careers are recruited from colleges in the Northeast  and from historically Black colleges in the South.  Another 5 students participate in the program with stipend  support from the WCL&R.  Laboratory projects in basic biological research topics are chosen that are interesting,  likely to yield results within the time-frame of the program, and allow for some degree of student development  and independence.  Weekly group meetings are used to discuss science- and career-related issues and to monitor  student progress.  The students make short oral presentations of their work in a symposium in the last week of  the program, and also submit written reports before they leave, to stress the importance of communication skills  within science.  ***",
