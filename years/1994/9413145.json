 "awd_abstract_narration": "Success in science requires a solid background in a scientific  discipline in addition of extensive laboratory experience.   However, for scientists to develop into accomplished professionals,  a wide range of \"survival skills\" also are needed.  These skills  can be divided into three categories:  communications (e.g. the  ability to communicate both orally and in writing), economic issues  (e.g. securing employment), and personal development (e.g. managing  time and stress).  While higher education focuses almost  exclusively on the content of the scientific discipline and on  research methodology, little attention is paid to those skills that  can make the difference between technical and creative competence  and success.  This award is to enable (1) development of a  comprehensive series of workshops on survival skills; (2)  production of materials and relevant literature to assist  instructors in higher education to teach their students these  skills; and (3) support of workshops to disseminate this  information to faculty members from a wide range of institutions so  as to enable other educational programs to initiate similar  courses.  Evaluation will be carried out for the materials and  workshops to assess the success of these activities.  Special  emphasis is being placed to improve access for under-represented  groups.  Providing a solid foundation in career skills for women  and ethnic minorities may play a pivotal role for ensuring their  successful entry into the scientific profession.  An important  benefit of increasing the diversity of scientists while maintaining  their quality is the incorporation of a diversity of approaches to  scientific problems which can only serve to improve science.",
