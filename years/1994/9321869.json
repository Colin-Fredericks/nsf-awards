Professor Krishna  Shenai of the University of Wisconsin-Madison  is the principal US organizer for the  \"Conference on Emerging Optoelectronic  Technologies (CEOT)\" that will be held at the  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, July  18-22, 1994.  The first CEOT-91 was highly  successful and resulted in the publication of  four major archival works and the  identification of four optoelectronic thrust  areas for possible collaboration.  At CEOT-94,  US delegates will visit two of India's leading  industrial laboratories, the Bharat Electronics  Laboratories and Indian Telephone Industries,  in Bangalore.  Continued advances in  information processing can not be achieved  using electronics alone.  Optical computing,  optical communication, and optically triggered  microelectronics are expected to revolutionize  advanced systems.  Major innovations in  material technologies, micro-electronics,  interconnect technologies, and system  architecture will be required to achieve these  objectives.    Scope:  India is a leading developing country  that has  significant potential for the  implementation and manufacture of low-cost  technologies.  This is based on an enormous  pool of  engineering talent, low costs for  labor, and access to global markets.  Recent  technological and economic advances in India  affirm the expectation of continued growth.   Increased scientific exchange between India and  the US is important to intelligently tap the  resources available there and to maintain a  long term healthy relationship between the  countries.  Non-Resident Indian scientists are  a readily available resource in the US to  catalyze this activity and to provide the  synergism needed for establish-ing an active  interface for long term technical exchange.   ***",
