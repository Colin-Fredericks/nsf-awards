 "awd_abstract_narration": "A principal objective of  this mathematical sciences project  is  the  development  of  methods for the  systematic  design  of  feedback  laws  leading  to the ability to  shape,  or  at  least  influence,  the  steady  state  response  of  systems  exhibiting  complex  dynamical behavior. In particular, the research  program  focuses  on  feedback design methods for problems  of  asymptotic  tracking,  disturbance  rejection,  and  output  regulation   for  nonlinear distributed parameter systems.          A  primary objective of  this mathematical sciences project  is  the  development of a methodology to systematically   control  or  influence  nonlinear effects which  arise  in  a  variety  of  physical  phenomena.  This goal is motivated  in part by problems  in  combustion  control,  where nonlinear  effects  actually  can  improve  mixing and hence can , in principle, improve the  engine  performance of automobiles, for example. Another example of   the  potential impact of nonlinear control in flluid flow problems  is  in  the  control  of  instabilities in aerodynamic  applications,  which  have been experimentally shown to greatly influence  stall  and  lift  behavior of aircraft and which are known  to  lead  to  reduction   in   the  life  cycle  of  aircraft   parts.    Other  applications are to active noise control of various devises, such  as compressors.",
