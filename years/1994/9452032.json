This laboratory integrates physically-based  devices and components within a PC-based data acquisition and  control environment. The new design sections offer an integrated  systems approach for the rapid development and implementation of  both hardware and software in a complete engineering design.  The  educational goals of this laboratory are to teach the fundamentals  of electric machinery, power electronics and solid-state devices,  electric drives, motor control, and robotics, with reliability  techniques incorporated in the evaluation of alternative design  solutions. The experiments are systems-oriented and build on  concepts such as stability, feedback, and analog/digital controller  design for various plants. Microprocessor control and modern  instrumentation are emphasized throughout for the performance  evaluation of the designs in real-world environments subject to  modeling errors, disturbances, measurement noise, and sensor and  control system failures.  Four initial design sections  are built  around eight PC-based data acquisition and control (DAC)  workstations. Each DAC workstation consists of a 486/PC with  specialized hardware/software and dedicated test instruments  (digitizing scope, signal analyzer, etc.). Each system is equipped  with an embedded high-performance digital signal processor (DSP)  board interfaced with a physical plant (electric machine, inverted  pendulum, robotic arm, etc.) via sensor I/O signals (encoder,  Hall-effect device, etc.) A DAC programming environment is used for  the identification of the system plant and the rapid design and  implementation of prototype controllers, both classical and  advanced, in either a simulated or real-time fashion.",
