Specifically, the proposal seeks funding to upgrade the pumping system on our existing LPCVD system for silicon nitride and silicon dioxide in order to overcome serious problems with down-time that have been experienced over the last several years.  These problems have seriously impeded a number of important research programs.  In addition, the proposal seeks funding to install a new CVD system for the deposition of low-temperature oxide (LTO) and phosphosilicate glass (PSG).  While these processes are basic and standard throughout the microelectronics industry, they have never been available at Michigan, seriously limiting our research capabilities and the types of structures that can be addressed.  The lack of these films has been a major factor limiting our research on surface micromachined microstructures, which are useful in the development of a great many integrated sensors and microactuators.  Specific immediate uses of the LTO/PSG system include the conformal chip-level encapsulation of integrated sensors for use in chronically-implantable neural prostheses, the development of planarized feedthroughs for hermetically-sealed microsystems, and application in a number of microsensors and microactuators for use in transportation systems and automated semiconductor manufacturing.  The proposed equipment directly affects the programs of 26 faculty and nearly 50 graduate research students at the University of Michigan; in addition, it will permit an expanded range of projects in two laboratory courses at the University and will allow structures such as those produced by surface micromachining to be introduced into the courses in a practical way.
