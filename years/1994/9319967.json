In regions  that have undergone relatively recent glacial deposition, such as  large parts of the Midwestern states, analyses of soil morphology  are complicated by the need to differentiate between glacial  processes that deposited different types of materials and the  more localized processes that later altered the structure and  composition of materials.  A set of soils for which these roles  of these two general forces are poorly understood are bisequal  soils, having two sets of lower horizons.  This project will  examine two broadly distributed bisequal soils in Michigan,  evaluating how water flows through these soils and interacts with  parent materials.  Water flow within the upper two meters of  loamy and sandy materials in various parts of drumlins and  moraines will be measured and analyzed.  Soil properties like  lithology, mineralogy, and texture will be examined to determine  whether the two different sets of horizons are the product of the  same morphological processes operating of different parent  materials.       The results of this research project will provide valuable  new insights regarding the processes through which water and  other forces create and alter soils.  The types of soils to be  examined in this project are similar to bisequal soils that are  found in large parts of the Midwest and in other locales.  The  study also will contribute additional data on stratigraphy and  lithology of soils in lower Michigan, providing a foundation for  additional research on soil morphology in recently glaciated  regions.  ***",
