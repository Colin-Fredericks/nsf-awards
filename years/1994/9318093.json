 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318093  Guerinot  Iron is an essential nutrient for all higher plants, with iron-  containing compounds figuring prominently in the electron transport  systems of photosynthesis and respiration.  Although iron is  abundant in the soil, the acquisition of iron is problematic due to  its low solubility at biological pH under aerobic conditions.  Iron  uptake mechanisms are being studied in the model plant system,  Arabidopsis thaliana, using biochemical, genetic and molecular  genetic techniques.  The focus is on the reduction of ferric iron  which takes place at the root surface because ferric reduction is  probably the primary factor in making iron available for absorption  by plants.  The main objective is to identify genes which encode  components necessary for ferric reductase activity.  Three  strategies to identify such genes will be pursued simultaneously:  a) use of the FRE1 gene from yeast to identify an Arabidopsis  homolog; b) complementation of the fre1-1 yeast mutant to identify  an Arabidopsis homolog; and c) identification of Arabidopsis  mutants with altered ferric reductase activity and use of such  mutants to clone the gene(s) involved in ferric reduction.  A study  of iron uptake in Arabidopsis should have application to general  transmembrance permeation processes and their regulation and may  ultimately lead to the construction of iron efficient plant  varieties.  These studies should also shed light on root specific  gene expression and the regulation of gene expression by metals.  ***",
