 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Acquisition of an X-ray Area Detector  P.l. Robert J. Fletterick    An area sensitive X-ray detector system is requested for X-  ray crystallographic data collection for  high resolution structure analyses of proteins. The new  instrument is to augment the UCSF  structural capability which is currently vastly  oversubscribed. At present, persons typically wait in  turn for one month to six weeks for time on one of the two  existing area detectors. The new  instrument requested is to overcome this rate limiting step  in the structural science. The new  phosphor storage technology used in the proposed detector  system makes data collection more  efficient and accurate. As structural analysis moves us to  ask scientific questions using many  mutations, or using modified inhibitors aimed at designing  improved therapeutics, study of a single protein system can  occupy as much as 50% of the time on one data collection  instrument.  Understanding the properties of mutant proteins or altered  inhibitory compounds will require an  analysis of structure as thoroughly as for the native  proteins. The speed with which site-directed  mutagenesis is accomplished requires rapid structural  analysis for the scientist to remain close to the important  scientific questions.    In the following narrative, we list the projects of the  three principal investigators and demonstrate  the need for the new communal equipment. The laboratory to  house the new machines will be  renovated: a wall is to be added, plumbing changed,  electrical installation and a safety enclosure  will be built. The projects, most supported by NIH grants to  the three P.I.s, are briefly described  in narrative form, with references to published work where  possible, and followed by a table. This  lists the individual projects by title, the principal  scientists working on the project and the status of the  project. The status provides a brief summary of the current  needs for data collection.",
