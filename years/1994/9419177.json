 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419177  Haws  Experiments and computations  can generate vast quantities of  numerical data which are difficult to interpret.  Visualization  techniques are increasingly being applied by researchers to  assist in this; for example to assist the researcher to discover  basic phenomena normally masked within these large numerical data  sets.  While excellent visualization tools exist and are being  developed, there is little knowledge or use of these tools by  researchers in geotechnical earthquake engineering.    The objective of this project is to introduce researchers and  practitioners in earthquake engineering to the wide variety of  visualization tools available today.  Proper use of these tools  requires understanding simple concepts (such as the basic  principles of visual perception) as well as existing industry  standards (such as broadcast video formats for displaying  information).  This workshop will emphasize the use of  inexpensive (that is, microcomputer-based) computer platforms  with a \"hands-on\" approach, and will include appropriate  documentation and dissemination of the workshop materials to  those who are not able to attend.    It is expected that the use of these visualization tools will  lead to improved earthquake hazard mitigation techniques.  ***",
