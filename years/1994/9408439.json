 "awd_abstract_narration": "The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in  a large class of spacetimes, including the physically  relevant cases of the big bang and of the gravitational  collapse of a star to form a black hole.  However, these  theorems tell us very little about the nature of the  singularities.  For example, we would like to know the  entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature  behaves along their world lines and whether they can see the  singularity before they hit it.  Since we do not have the  general solution of Einstein's equation in closed form,  Prof. Garfinkle intends to use all the methods available for  the study of singularities: (i) to find exact solutions and  study their singularities; (ii) to prove theorems about the  behavior of singular spacetimes or (iii) to perform a  numerical study of spacetimes with singularities to address  these issues.  Numerical evolution of generic initial data for axisymmetric  cosmologies will be used to study the approach to the  singularity of spatially inhomogeneous models.  He will  examine nonsingular, stationary electrovac solutions in  general relativity and in string theory.  He will also  explore Choptuik's numerical discovery of scaling behavior  in the formation of a zero mass singularity from the  collapse of a spherically scalar field using a gauge  invariant null initial value formulation.  Perhaps the most important problem in the study of  singularities is cosmic censorship: the issue of whether  singularities are hidden behind event horizons.  Work by  Shapiro and Teukolsky suggests that highly prolate objects  can form naked singularities during gravitational collapse.  As an alternative, he will start a numerical investigation  of the collapse of highly prolate gravity waves to see  whether a naked singularity forms.",
