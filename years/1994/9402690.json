 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402690  Gaines    Although it is widely acknowledged that oceanographic  processes  influence benthic communities, little effort has focused on  this  issue in a synthetic way. Prior research by the PI's had  taken a  predictive and experimental approach to explaining spatial  and  temporal variation in the recruitment of the northern acorn  barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, in Narragansett Bay. About  80% of  the large interannual variation in barnacle recruitment in  the bay  over the last decade is explained by annual variation in bay  flushing times, which set the extent of retention and export  of  larvae from the bay.       This renewal project will test the generality and  consequences  of the previous findings in other estuaries and examine  additional  taxa. Only by undertaking studies across biogeographic areas  and a  wide range of taxa will the linkages between oceanographic  processes and the population and community dynamics of  benthic  assemblages be unraveled.       The project will use replicated bays in New England  with  differing flushing characteristics to examine the  relationship  between spatial and temporal variation in bay flushing time  and the  recruitment of common shoreline species. The generality of  mechanisms generating recruitment variation is an unresolved  issue,  yet it has important implications to the dynamics of marine  communities. With simultaneous studies on five important  space  occupiers of the NW Atlantic, this project will begin to  develop a  general understanding of linkages between hydrodynamic  processes  and the populations and community dynamics of benthic  assemblages.  ***",
