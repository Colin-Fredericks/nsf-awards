The operator approximation  property (OAP) is a matricial version (for operator spaces) of  the approximation property for Banach spaces. The investigator  has shown that a sigma-weakly closed subspace has the general  slice map property for sigma-weakly closed subspaces if and only  if it has the w*-OAP. The investigator and Uffe Haagerup have  defined a property for locally compact groups (called the AP)  which is weaker than amenability, and have shown that a discrete  group has the AP if and only if its group von Neumann algebra has  the w*-OAP (if and only if its reduced group C*-algebra has the  OAP). Specific problems that will be attacked under this project  include:(1) Does SL(3,Z) have the AP?(2)If A is a C*-algebra does  A have the OAP if and only if A** has the w*-OAP?(3)Does every  exact C*-algebra have the OAP?       Hilbert space operators can be considered as an infinite  dimensional analog of matrices. There is a natural addition and  multiplication defined on operators so that some collections of  operators can be considered as operator algebras. Usually  operator algebras come equipped with a topological structure.  Operator algebras themselves can be used to form product algebras  and investigations in this project center around a certain  product structure on operator algebras called the tensor product.  Operator approximation problems are related in a natural way to  questions about the tensor product of operator algebras. The  focus here is on these connections between approximation and  tensor products.",
