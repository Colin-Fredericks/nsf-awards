 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maui Community College purpose of this distance education  project is to establish and transport science, computer, and  electronics technology curricula to rural minority students through  interactive teleclass lectures and simulated multi-media laboratory  experiences. The first stage of the project encompasses the  development of multimedia instructional materials for a model  Certificate and Associate in Science Degree curriculum in  Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET). The program  is cooperatively designed to provide for technical certification  and/or transfer opportunities to baccalaureate degree programs at  the University of Hawai'i-Manoa or distance education offerings at  the Maui Research and Technology Center from the University of New  Mexico. The second stage focuses on developing multi-media  laboratory exercises for the ECET curriculum in a format  transportable to outreach by reducing dependence on costly  laboratory equipment and faculty travel. This innovative format  utilizes simulated lab experiments by developing, purchasing, and  integrating multi-media software for CAI workstations. The ECET  program is to be field-tested on the main campus and then extended  to the college outreach centers, and will formally recruit students  from MCC's densely-populated Pacific Island and Asian community.  The third stage is the extension of the simulated methodology to  other science and mathematics courses at the college. The final  stage involves teacher and faculty enhancement. Effectiveness of  this approach is to be demonstrated through scheduled workshops for  other college instructors state-wide and to secondary school  teachers; and the project results disseminated on a national level.",
