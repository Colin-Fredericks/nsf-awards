 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher plants, like their animal counterparts, follow a  specific developmental program that leads from a single cell  to a complex, functional multicellular organism composed of  a myriad of cell types, tissues, and organs.  In animals,  the interaction of the cytoskeleton-extracellular matrix  complex in development, cell morphogenesis and gene  expression is well documented, while in plants the exact  role comparable proteins (including those of the cell wall  and periplasm) play in development and cell morphogenesis  has yet to be elucidated.  It is likely that cytoskeleton-  extracellular matrix proteins in plants will also be found  to play a significant and dynamic role in development and  morphogenesis.  Recently, this investigator has shown that  petunia glycine-rich protein 1 (ptGRP1) can be isolated as a  member of a large protein complex that is located either in  the periplasmic space or just internal to the plasma  membrane.  Preliminary in vitro translation studies indicate  that ptGRP1 possesses a true signal sequence; therefore, it  is likely that the ptGRP1 complex is located in the  protoplasm.  The investigator hypothesizes that it may  function as an organizer of the periplasmic space or as a  cytoskeleton-cell wall connector.  Consistent with this  hypothesis, immunocytochemical studies show that the  expression of ptGRP1 correlates directly with expansive  growth and that this protein is most highly expressed within  the vascular system.  Moreover, the presence of ptGRP1  antisense RNA results in aberrant development of the plant.  Cytological studies show that all ptGRP1 antisense  morphological mutants have an inability to form a normal  coherent vascular system.  In addition, decreased expression  of ptGRP1 in these mutants correlates directly with the  severity of the mutation.  These experiments indicate that  normal GRP expression is necessary for correct formation of  the vascular system.",
