Coupled  models of differing complexity have been developed to understand,  simulate, and predict this phenomenon.  However, there are  increasing indications from both observational and modeling studies  that the annual cycle and interannual variability are intrinsically  related.  This project will use a series of intermediate and hybrid  coupled models, proven to be useful and economical in tropical  coupled modeling, to investigate annual and interannual variability  with an emphasis on the role played by the annual cycle in the  interannual tropical ocean-atmosphere interaction.  The goal of  this research is improved understanding of the annual and  interannual variabilities observed in the tropical ocean-atmosphere  system.      The intermediate coupled model, based on a simplified version of  the 1987 Zebiak & Cane model, has been developed and extensively  analyzed by Jin & Neelin.  This model incorporates asymmetric  components of sea surface temperature and ocean dynamics to give a  realistic simulation of the climatological annual cycle and will be  used to investigate the role of the annual cycle on the interannual  variability.  The mechanisms of frequency locking that give rise to  coupled annual and sub-harmonic oscillations will be investigated.   The regimes of coupled annual, quasi-biennial and low-frequency  modes will be explored in an extensive range of parameter space.   The intermediate coupled model will be improved with better  parameterization of the physics and used fo r further studies of the  coupled dynamics of the annual cycle and the interannual coupled  modes.    This investigation will be extended, based on the results from the  research with the intermediate coupled model, to studies with a  hybrid coupled model system which includes an ocean general  circulation model and a quasi-steady tropical atmosphere model.   The hybrid coupled model system permits a more sophisticated  examination of the interaction between annual and interannual nodes  and an exploration of the regime which supports the quasi-biennial  and low-frequency variability with a regime diagnostic tool based  on the intermediate model.",
