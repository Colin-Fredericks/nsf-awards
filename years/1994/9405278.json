 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405278  Ellis         The basic premise of plate tectonics that plates more as rigid  bodies with deformation occurring only at boundaries between plates  is violated locally within continents, as demonstrated by the  existence of broad zones of diffuse strain.  This study intra-plate  strain focuses on the northern Walker Lane in the Basin and Range  province of the Western United States.  Prior work has delineated  fault-bounded blocks, identified units that will yield useful  paleomagnetic results and documented the orientation and sense of  slip an major faults, some of which are nearly orthogonal to each  other.  This work will test for vertical-axis rotations of the  identified blocks and will develop a kinematic model of this  example of intra-plate strain including block rotations.  Results  will also provide insight into the relationship between  intracontinental strain nd plate-boundary interactions.",
