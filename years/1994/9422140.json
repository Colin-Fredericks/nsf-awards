 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the paleoclimate of the region that  extends from the Eastern Canadian  Arctic eastward to  Greenland and Iceland.  This is an area that is critical for  the integration of present and past records of climatic  change, especially within the context of the Arctic System  Science Program (ARCSS research agenda.  The main objectives  of the research will be to concentrate on the evaluation,  synthesis and interpetation of: i) instrumental records; ii)  historical data sources from Iceland; iii) the GISP2  isotopic time-series; iv) high-resolution marine series near  East Greenland; and v) annually laminated lake records from  Southeast Baffin Island and Iceland.  The project will  include an analysis of climate impact in Iceland in recent  centuries.  Thus, although focussing on paleoclimatic  reconstruction and interpretation, the research also has a  human dimensions perspective and links  directly with the  needs of the new ARCSS Paleo initiative (Archeology and  Ethnohistory) regarding the documentation and understanding  of the role of climatic variations in the Norse expansion  throughout the North Atlantic, and human responses to the so-  called \"Medieval Warm Period\" and Little Ice Age\".  In  conlcusion, the overall goal is directed towards improving  the understanding of annual to century timescale  fluctuations of climate in this region, as well as the  influences of such changes on Humankind.",
