The acquisition of the  following equipment allows the project to achieve this goal: the  Computerized Speech Lab allows analysis of the complex acoustic  information in speech, clarifying the speech production and  perception theories presented in lectures. The existing equipment  of linearized magnetometers provide the students with information  concerning the coordinated movements of the respiratory system. The  pneumotachograph setup allows measurements of airflow patterns  within the vocal tract, yielding valuable information about the  activity of the vocal folds during voicing. All of these  instruments will be used for instructor demonstrations and student  experiments during laboratory course sections accompanying each of  the undergraduate speech science lecture sections offered in the  department. By bringing students into a scientific environment  where they become active participants, this project opens the door  to a greater appreciation for the role of science in the service of  individuals with communicative disorders.",
