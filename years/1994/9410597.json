The linguistic exploration of signed languages has acquired  considerable interest in recent years. Yet it is uncommon to witness  large numbers of deaf linguists and deaf graduate students attending  or presenting at major linguistics conferences. The main reason for  this discrepancy is the extreme difficulty of accessing linguistic  material of almost any nature through signed language interpreters who  are unable to accurately render the conceptual content of the message.       The goal of the organizers of the Linguistic Society of America's  1995 Linguistic Institute is to ensure full accessibility to the  exchange of ideas and the linguistic \"cultural\" milieu-both inside and  outside of the classroom-which are a significant part of the  linguist's professional development. This project is intended to  provide linguistic training to seasoned American Sign Language  interpreters who will be employed during the Institute.            Two graduate linguistics students will work 10 months to prepare  a manual to be used for teaching purposes. A group of distinguished  deaf language consultants, hearing linguists, and expert interpreters  will gather for three days to prepare a structured lexicon of  introductory linguistic concepts and ASL usage related to linguistic  terminology. The manual will eventually be edited for the development  of a videotape to be produced by Sign Media, Inc. The dissemination of  this videotape will provide experienced interpreters, as well as  students in interpreter education programs across the nation, broader  access to accurate interpretations of a core lexicon for the complex  linguistic sciences.        The lexicon and the videotape will form the basis for training  interpreters from a cross the nation who will be employed to interpret  at the Institute, thus providing the national deaf clientele that the  Institute plans to attract with interpreters who possess broader  expertise than the typical local referral center may be able to  provide. An additional long term benefit will be the expansion of the  pool of interpreters competent to interpret linguistics lectures. The  provision of the resulting videotape will have significant impact on  the study of ASL by native users across the country. Ultimately, the  goal of this proposal is to set a precedent for other sciences to open  their doors to deaf scientists by providing adequately trained  interpreters.    ***",
