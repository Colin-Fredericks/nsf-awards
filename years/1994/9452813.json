The conference will focus  attention on the Foundation's role in the education of minorities  who are underrepresented in science, mathematics, engineering and  technology (SMET) fields.  Conference activities will include  research presentations by more than 300 student participants in  NSF-sponsored research projects, and the presentation and  discussion of the NSF Action Plan that outlines a national strategy  to assure a significant expansion of the nation's scientific and  technological workforce to include underrepresented minorities in  a variety of roles.  The university would prepare abstracts of  student presentations, and design and schedule activities to  encourage student interactions with role models and other minority  SMET students, leading to the formation of support group to  reinforce student selection of SMET majors and careers.  Grant  activities also would include working with EHR in scheduling  student travel and hotel accommodations, and arranging  transportation to the conference for local area precollege and  college students.",
