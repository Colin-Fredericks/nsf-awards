 "awd_abstract_narration": "A dilution refrigerator and a high field solenoid system are requested for  application of scanning probe microscopy techniques to the study and  manipulation of disorder in quantum transport at millikelvin temperatures. The  coherence of the electron wavefunction at very low temperatures can make the  transport properties of such systems uniquely sensitive to the exact  distribution of defects and scattering centers in the sample. Experiments which  involve the measurement of some bulk property (e.g., conductivity) as a  function of some external variable (e.g. magnetic field) can only reveal  information about the net contribution of all the defects in the system. In  contrast, scanned probe microscopies offer a unique opportunity to investigate  these systems at the single defect level. The ability to probe and manipulate  disorder in small scale systems, in combination with more standard probes of  transport should provide: 1) important tests of the theoretical understanding  of the role that disorder plays in these systems, and 2) signific  ant insight into such long standing problems as 1/f noise and electromigration  in small metal wires, and the nature of two level tunneling centers in  disordered materials. The extension of a variety of scanned probe techniques to  operation at very low temperatures will also allow the spatially resolved  investigation of such buried systems, as the 2-dimensional electron gas in  semiconductor heterostructures, and allow new insights into transport in the  integer and fractional quantum Hall effect regimes.   %%%  Over the past decade, there has been great deal of interest and activity in two  areas of condensed matter physics: electrical transport in nanometer scale  devices and systems, and the study of surfaces with the scanning tunneling  microscope and related microscopies. These new tools have found wide use in the  study of the structure, and defects, on  surfaces, study of complex molecules  and magnetic systems, and fabrication of very small st ructures through the  manipulation of single-atom-building blocks.  This research, for which a  dilution refrigerator and a high field solenoid system are requested, seeks to  apply scanning probe microscopy techniques to the study and manipulation of  disorder  in quantum transport at very low, millikelvin temperatures. The aim  is to probe the microscopic origins of the effects of disorder on the bulk  electronic properties of metals.",
