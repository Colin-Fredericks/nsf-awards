Unfortunately, they  typically do not have formal training in ethical reflection.   This project will teach basic methods and principles in applied  ethics to life science faculty at two land grant universities,  and equip them to lead discussions of ethical issues in their  classrooms and labs.  The project will also challenge them to  reflect on various moral facets of their research.  The training  will occur during week-long summer institutes, \"Ethics and  Agricultural Biotechnology.\"  A team of three philosophers,  including faculty at the institutions where the workshops will  occur, will lead the sessions.  Activities will consist of  lectures on moral theory, sessions on how to teach ethics to  science students, and debates on moral issues in science and  technology.  The institute will be held once a summer, for two  successive summers at two sites.  It will reach a total of 60  life scientists.  Most will be at the two host campuses:   University of Illinois at Urbana, and Michigan State University.   Several slots will be reserved for faculty at nearby  institutions, to promote broader outreach.  The project includes  preparatory activities and follow-up activities.  Faculty  participants will continue to meet twice a semester for three  years after the initial workshop, forming a critical mass of  scientists on each campus formally engaged in ongoing discussion  of ethical issues.  The newsletter \"Ag Bioethics Forum\" from Iowa  State University will devote an issue each year to the summer  programs.  ***",
