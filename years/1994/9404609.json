 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404609  Cook          This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the  University of Connecticut studying the social relations, and use  of capital in manufacturing enterprises in the small-scale  artisan brick industry of the Mexico-Texas border.  Using  techniques of in-depth interviews with owners, managers and brick  workers, the project will try to understand how the low-  technology Mexican industry survives and co-exists alongside the  heavily capitalized and more high technology US industry.  The  project will test alternative theoretical explanations for the  coexistence of these firms, analyzing theories drawn from  literature glossed as modernization, subsumption, flexible  accumulation, endo-accumulation, and technical/applied. Different  theoretical approaches predict different outcomes for the  interaction of the artisan-type brick works with industrial-type  works.      This research is important because the existence of NAFTA  will expand cross-border economic relations.  Our understanding  will be advanced by studying how the two economic styles relate  to each other, not from a simple perspective that the more  heavily capitalized North American side will dominate the  exchange, but from the perspective of seeing what has developed  in one industry over time as a case study.",
