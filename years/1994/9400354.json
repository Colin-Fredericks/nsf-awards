 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) known as the Center on Polymer Interfaces and  Macromolecular Assemblies (CPIMA) at Stanford University is  a partnership among research groups at Stanford University,  IBM-Almaden, and the University of California Davis.  The  center supports interactive research through three  interdisciplinary research groups.    The group investigating macromolecular design for enhanced  film properties aims to design and synthesize novel polymers  which have unique optical and electronic properties, and  then characterize their equilibrium and dynamical behavior  when they are constrained by interfaces.  Researchers in the  group focused on ultrathin films aim to design and  synthesize substrate-bound ultrathin organic films that  mediate the chemical and physical interactions between the  substrate and an adjacent overlayer.  Investigators in the  group investigating the dynamics of interfacial processing  seek to understand the interfacial transport processes that  occur during the fabrication of ultrathin films of polymers  and polymer-based nanoncomposite materials.    The center  also supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research.   It provides seed funding for exploratory  research, and  fosters research participation by  undergraduates.  The center has educational programs from  high school to the graduate level and carries out  collaborative research with industry.   The center currently  supports about 16 senior investigators, 12 postdoctoral  research associates, 2 technical staff members, 18 graduate  students, and 6 undergraduates.  This MRSEC is directed by  Professor Curtis W. Frank.",
