 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are planning a Workshop, entitled \"Identifying Features in Biological Sequences\", to  be held May 30 to June 19 at the Aspen Center for Physics (ACP).  The participants will  be from fields of math and statistics, computer science and molecular biology.  All will  be interested in problems of extracting bimlogical information from sequences, but with  diverse enough approaches that many of them would not otherwise interact with each  other.  The total number of participants will be about 25, with a mixture of senior and  junior researchers.  The format of the Workshop is specifically designed to foster  collaborations and other intensive interactions.  Tutorials will be given by experts in  particular fields to enlighten the others in the current ideas and methods in that field.   There will also be talks by participants about their current research and the questions  they are currently pursuing.  Most importantly for this Workshop, there will be ample  unscheduled time to foster individual and small group interactions.  This will be  facilitated by a small local area network of workstations, with access to the Internet  available.  This allows participants to obtain data and programs from their home (or  other) institutions and to compare methods on similar data, and on various different data  sets.  It allows the hands-on development of modified approaches and even entirely new  programs.  Several examples exist from previous meetings where new methods have been  explored directly due to the Workshop.",
