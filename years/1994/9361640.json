The Phase I studies will  utilize a microfabrication technique capable of making optical fiber based light sources and  sensors as small as 40 nm which will be applied to the demonstration of near-field optics (NFO)  in microscopy and chemical imaging. These sensors will be small enough to measure chemical  concentrations within a single cell in biological applications. Phase I objectives are to fabricate  and test a working pH sensor with millisecond response time and 0.01 pH unit sensitivity,  requiring only atto-liters of sample.  A similar sensor will be developed for monitoring oxygen  concentration.  These sensors will be much less invasive, and much more chemically selective  than existing sensors and will increase both the speed and reliability of microchemical  measurements.  %%%  Submicron fiber optic chemical sensors should find their way into scientific, environmental, and  medical testing laboratories and in the process and quality control aspects of the chemical,  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The small size of the sensors will result in cost  savings and increased safety and their fast response time will increase the speed and efficiency  with which chemical measurements can be made.  ***",
