 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320192  Neuts     This award is for the acquisition of two SparcStation 10 Model 30 workstations for the Laboratory of Algorithmic Research in the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona.  The workstations would significantly upgrade present equipment in the Laboratory.  The research involved deals with point processes, queues and other probability models primarily related to communications engineering.  It requires major implementations of numerical and symbolic algorithms as well as extensive computer experimentation.  Methods for the analysis of queueing models involve computer-intensive matrix-iterative methods.  One line of research is to develop methods suitable for large matrices.  Such investigation will require more advanced workstations than those presently in the Laboratory.  Another line of current work deals with data-analytic methods for very large sets of counting data.  In addition to processing speed and excellent graphics the investigation requires a workstation with a large memory.  Equipment in the Laboratory of Algorithmic Research is also used by others for research.  One group deals with modeling the spread of epidemics and with methodology for automated computer learning and optimization.  Another is for investigating Markov decision problems and a variety of their applications.  In addition, these researchers are developing mathematical software  for the solution of Markov decision problems.  The Laboratory also attracts many visiting researchers and postdoctoral fellows.  The equipment in the laboratory further supports the computational needs of these in dividuals.  ***  h                       X        ..
