This prevents undergraduate students in  other disciplines from receiving formal instruction in an area that  could prove to be very useful for solving complex problems in their  own fields.  An emphasis on interdisciplinary education and the  excellent undergraduate students at the Colorado School of Mines  provide an ideal environment for the development of a course that  attempts to rectify the above shortcoming.  This project is a new  course that is designed to teach parallel computing to  undergraduate scientists and engineers.  The students in the course  work in collaboration with research mentors to design and implement  parallel solutions to problems of their choice.  The course teaches  students key issues in parallel computing design and analysis of  parallel algorithms, hardware considerations, software  considerations, parallel programming, and visualization of results.   This project requires parallel hardware, a graphics workstation,  and software to enhance the hands-on learning experience of the  students taking this course.  It is expected that the knowledge of  parallel computing will make the students more valuable  contributors to industry and better researchers.  In addition, it  is expected that this course will prove to be a model that can be  used by other schools that are dedicated to enhancing undergraduate  education in science and engineering.",
