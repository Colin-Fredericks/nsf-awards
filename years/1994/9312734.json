 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312734  Bigzadeh       The main objective of the project is to obtain an effective  heat transfer coefficient on a metal strand in the secondary  cooling zone during the continuous casting process.  Previous  research indicates that many cooling processes in this zone have a  pronounced effect on the quality of the cast metal.  Two different  experimental setups will be designed and constructed to satisfy the  special requirements of the two phases of the experimental study.  During the experiment, spray water and spray (air and water)  velocities will be measured.  This will be achieved by the three-  dimensional Laser Doppler Anemometer and Particle Dynamic Analyzer  system (3-D LDA/PDA).  Thermocouples with an associated HP data  acquisition system will be applied to measure the temperature  distribution.  A high resolution photo camera will be used to  obtain information during the droplet impinging process.  X-ray  diffraction and Auger experiments will be used in order to  determine the composition and the structure of the surface scale.   A suitable method of curve fitting will be used to develop the  correlation equation for determining the heat transfer coefficient  for the metal strand in the secondary cooling zone during the  continuous casting process.       Improved understanding of the transfer of heat to the castings  may allow higher quality continuously cost metals to be produced,  reducing the cost and improving the performance of metal sheet  stock.",
