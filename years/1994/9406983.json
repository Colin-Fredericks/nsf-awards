 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406983  Engelman  We conceptualize membrane protein stability in terms of a two-stage  model:  many transbilayer helices can be regarded as independently  stable folding units which interact specifically in a side-to-side  fashion to generate tertiary and quaternary structures.  This  contention is supported by experiments and suggests that a detailed  understanding of membrane helix interactions will lead to greater  understanding of membrane protein structure and to more powerful  prediction methods.  During the past grant period, we established the independent  stability of many (but not all) of the helices of bacteriorhodopsin  (BR), evolved a model system permitting detailed computational and  experimental studies of the dimerization of glycophorin A (GpA)  transmembrane helices, studied the possible roles of polypeptide  links and retinal in bacteriorhodopsin stability, and discovered  that one bacteriorhodopsin helix is capable of reversible  spontaneous insertion across lipid bilayers.  These studies have  now permitted a more refined investigation to be designed:  1.  Spontaneous insertion will be studied using the reversible  transbilayer insertion of BR helix C as a starting point.  Which  sequence features permit or abolish such insertion?  Can a pH  difference translocate the peptide across a lipid bilayer?  Can an  experimental delta delta G be assigned to each amino acid?    2.  Folding intermediates and alternative domain structures will be  studied using BR as a model.  Is the helix F - helix G hairpin a  stable domain?  Do helices A or B interact separately with the rest  of the molecule?  3.  Structural studies exploiting NMR will be used to define the  detailed structure of the glycophorin dimer.  Is it as predicted  from mutagenesis and computation?  4.  Measurement of the energy of helix-helix interactions will be  made using sequence variation in the glycophorin helix.  These will  be used to test computational approaches and to seek chemical  principles in the interactio ns.  5.  Effects of the lipid environment on the stability of helix-  helix interactions will be studied.  Possible insights into the  relative contributions of lipid-lipid, lipid-helix and helix-helix   interactions will be elucidated.  %%%  Many important biological events happen within membranes.  The  responses of cells to their environment, the conversion of energy  from one form to another, the regulation of the living state of a  cell, and many other vital processes involve the interactions of  molecules inside the membrane structure.  Our work to this date and  our planned experiments are aimed at understanding how specific  interactions occur and describing these in chemical terms.  Since  so many important events happen in this environment, and since it  has been shown that the specificity of different binding events can  be very high, it may well be that new pharmacological agents can be  found that will act within membranes to modulate cell activity.   Indeed, it may prove to be the case that some drugs already  discovered act in this way, but we do not yet understand their mode  of action.  A higher level of understanding will permit the design  of search methods to find new drugs and, perhaps, the de novo  design or modification of drugs for specific effects.  ***",
