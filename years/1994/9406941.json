The meeting will have  a total of about 50 participants, and will be held on March 26-27,  in Minneapolis (MN).  Theoretical approaches, non-intrusive  measuring techniques and parallel computing developed in the last  years offer new tools for improved methods of investigations, which  would have been not possible only few years ago.  The purpose of  this interdisciplinary symposium is to provide a timely forum for  presenting the latest developments in multiphase flow and thin film  research, to highlight outstanding scientific results, set  directions for future research opportunities with the highest  return, and promote interactions among researchers in fluid  mechanics, particles technology, heat transfer, applied  mathematics, chemical and mechanical engineering.  Senior and young  researchers from several countries have been invited to this  symposium.  The University of Minnesota offers a stimulating  environment through its research groups and well established  laboratories in this field of research.  The presentations at the  workshop will be peer reviewed and published in a special issue of  the journal on \"Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics.\"  ***",
