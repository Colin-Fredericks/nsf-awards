 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women Reseach Planning Grant (ROW/RPG) in   the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the research   efforts of Professor Robin Helburn of Northern Arizona University which   are aimed at characterizing environmentally important humic materials.    The focus of this research is the characterization of the hydrophobic   binding properties of these dissolved and colloidal phase materials using   spectroscopic dyes.  A series of polarity-sensitive indicators will be   used to probe the relative lipophilicity of binding environments in   natural humic acids, and in lignin- and petroleum-based surfactants, all   of which have solute transport capabilities.  In a separate study, these   indicators will be used to monitor the formation of organic aggregates as   induced by divalent cations.    This project combines the PI's background in environmental analytical   chemistry and her expertise in chemometrics with her interest in these   complex heterogeneous substances.  In addition to initiating this female   scientist's research program in environmental chemistry, support of this   project will complement the established undergraduate research program at   Northern Arizona University.",
