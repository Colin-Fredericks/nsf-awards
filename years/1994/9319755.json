 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319755  Axelson    Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that function as a chemical messenger  in the brain.  It has been shown to be involved in regulating a  number of behaviors, including aggression, reproduction,  communication and learning and memory.  For example, social  recognition memory, or the ability to recognize familiar animals,  is thought to be mediated by vasopressin in the lateral septum  region of the limbic system.  Interestingly, social recognition  memory is sexually dimorphic.  Females can maintain the ability to  recognize familiar members of the species significantly longer than  males.  Moreover, the vasopressin system in the limbichypothalamic  system is also sexually dimorphic.  Dr. Axelson is interested in  this structure-function relationship.  He will tease apart this  association with the use of the gonadal steroids at different times  during perinatal development.  By combining biochemical,  neuroanatomical and behavioral techniques, Dr. Axelson and his  students will extend what is known about the role of androgen and  estrogen in determining the development of functional sex  differences by clarifying hormonal mechanisms underlying cellular  changes in vasopressin and correlating these changes with altered  expression of a sexually dimorphic vasopressin dependent behavior.   Moreover, this project will provide resources and research  opportunities for a number of excellent undergraduate students and  introduce them to the field of hormonal control and development and  possible influence their decision to become future researchers.  ***",
