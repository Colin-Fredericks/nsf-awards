 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request support to acquire equipment needed to enhance  our program of environmental research, which emphasizes  interactions of organisms and ecosystem function. The  equipment will significantly upgrade and expand two  interactive facilities used by the six PIs in our separate  and collaborative research: an environmental analytical  chemistry laboratory (the CERE EAL) and a controlled  environment facility (the CERE CEF). The capabilities of  these two facilities are intimately linked; the laboratory  components of most of our field-based studies require  controlled environment chambers, and both the field and  laboratory aspects require determinations of various  nutrients and ions.    Our group includes plant, animal, and microbial ecologists  with expertise in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, whose  work ranges from the level of organismal behavior and  physiology to community and ecosystem dynamics. Our group  is highly collaborative, and our individual and  collaborative research is relevant to many issues of  conservation and management importance in the Intermountain  West. We provide significant research training  opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, and  postdoctoral levels. Collectively, we are the major  advisors for 44 graduate students, 5 postdoctoral research  associates, and numerous undergraduate research assistants  or independent study students.    We will replace obsolete equipment and add new pieces of  state-of-the-art equipment with improved capabilities over  those we currently have. We request two major pieces of  equipment that will greatly improve the sample processing  capacity and data quality obtainable from our analytical  laboratory, an Alpkem FLOWSolution autoanalyzer (model  3590, base system A001280) and a Carlo Erba NA1500 CHNS  combustion analyzer. These models are necessary to increase  the sample number we can process and, also importantly, to  improve our abilities to accurately determine low  concentrations of nutrients and ions, especial ly nitrate,  ammonium, and total nitrogen.    We also request two walk-in, four reach-in, and four small  benchtop environmental chambers to replace obsolete  equipment and add additional controlled environment space.  These chambers will equip a controlled environment facility  that Idaho State University will build as part of a new  greenhouse complex, with construction scheduled to be  completed in January 1995. Although we understand that  building cannot contribute to the match for this proposal,  this greenhouse complex has a building cost of greater than  $300,000 and is being built largely to support the research  and research training of our group. The controlled  environment room was added to the building plans in direct  support of this proposal, at an estimated additional  floor-space cost of $19,200.    If this proposal is funded, we will be able to conduct our  research more effectively, to undertake more collaborative  research and more sophisticated research, to collect better  quality data in a shorter time, and to expand our research  programs. This will provide increased number and quality of  research training opportunities to postdoctoral associates,  graduate students and undergraduate students.",
