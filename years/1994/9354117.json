 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354117  Okereke    Central State University (CSU) intends to maintain excellence in  its educational mission and its successes in developing new and  innovative programs within the last decade in the Sciences,  Engineering and Mathematics. CSU will improve, strengthen and  expand these programs in science, engineering and mathematics, as  well as introduce other new and innovative programs. The  university intends to develop plans to further strengthen its  centers of excellence in manufacturing engineering, water  resources management and Center for Scientific Visualization and  the Center for Applied Mathematics, as well as the traditional  physical and natural science departments such as biology,  chemistry, mathematics and computer science, and physics.    One of the goals of the effort is to significantly increase the  number and quality of minorities that enroll in, and graduate  form, the science, engineering and mathematics programs at the  university. The other is to increase the number of these  graduates who go to graduate school to earn advanced degrees in  the physical and natural sciences. Ultimately, the achievement of  these goals will significantly expand the pool of minorities who  opt for careers in the physical and natural sciences.    CSU hopes to achieve these goals by evaluating the existing  programs that impact the enrollment, retention, and ultimately  the graduation of its students in the sciences. Activities such  as recruitment, advising, mentoring, tutorial assistance,  curriculum development, and the availability of scholarships and  financial aid will be reviewed. Other programs such as library  facilities, student living environments, laboratory facilities  and research participation by undergraduate students would also  be evaluated. The goal of this comprehensive evaluation is to  identify and reinforce program and institutional strengths and to  correct the underlying weaknesses.",
