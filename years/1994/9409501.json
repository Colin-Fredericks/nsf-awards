 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409501  Hansen    This project develops and implements econometric methods for  assessing dynamic economic models.  The research covers four  different areas.  First, the project works on specification and  estimation of continuous time stochastic process models.  Such  models occur frequently in economics, but there remains many open  questions about how to estimate and test them using discrete time  data.  The project examines alternative econometric methods that  could answer the most important of these questions.  Second, the  project develops methods for estimating linear and loglinear  rational expectations models.  The models for which these methods  will be applicable include both ones for which the allocations  are solutions to optimal resource allocation problems as well as  other ones for which there are market or tax distortions.  The  estimation methods studied include semiparametric procedures  whereby the exogenous forcing processes are modeled in a flexible  way.  Along a similar vein, the project reinvestigates the issue  of using filtering methods to eliminate low frequency components  of the data.  The motivation for such methods is that the dynamic  stochastic model under investigation abstracts from the low  frequency movements in the time series.  The aim of the proposed  research is to devise estimation methods that are on the one  hand, robust to this misspecification, but on the other hand,  have nice statistical properties and are computationally  tractable.  Third, the project continues work developing and  adapting risk-sensitive control theory to models of dynamic  economies.  This control theory permits risk-adjustments to be  incorporated into models in simple ways so that linear decision  rules are sensitive to the amount of uncertainty in the economy.   Hence they capture a precautionary savings motive.  In addition  to testing such models empirically, the project investigates the  ramifications of introducing heterogeneity among consumers in  their risk prefere nces.  Finally, the project studies a long  historical data set on British stock prices and dividends and  investigates the link between the British stock market and  macroeconomic events.",
