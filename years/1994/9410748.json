 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410748  Brenowitz  Photochemical techniques have been researched and tested enabling  time-resolved determinations of the structures of protein-DNA  complexes that allow the reaction intermediates to be examined.   This project will 1) Determine the mechanism and specificity of  cleavage of DNA by photolyzed cobalamins; 2) Develop a rapid  mixing-laser photolysis method to attain the goal of millisecond  time resolution for photochemical footprinting; and 3) Test the new  technology by examining the reaction mechanism of two sequence-  specific DNA binding proteins.  This new technique will be immensely valuable in bridging the gaps  in present thermodynamic and structural analysis of protein-DNA  interactions.  Since complex formation can be followed at single  basepair resolution, detailed structural information will be  available at time resolutions on the order of milliseconds to  microseconds.  The photochemical footprinting protocols will be  tested using the binding of the Eco RI restriction endonuclease to  its recognition sequence and the binding of the 'TATA' Binding  Protein (TBP) to a promoter.  Thus, it will be possible to study  for the first time the intermediate steps in the formation of the  protein-nucleic acid complex.  %%%  Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins recognize and bind  to specific DNA sequences is a key step towards understanding  cellular function and dysfunction.  Protein-DNA interactions play  important roles in cellular processes such as gene replication,  recombination and regulation.  The formation of protein DNA  complexes is a complex process involving multiple steps and many  different chemical interactions.  Significant insights have been  made into the mechanisms by which proteins bind to specific DNA  sequences using techniques that determine the three-dimensional  structure of the complexes, and independently by techniques that  probe the chemistry of the interactions.  However, a severe  limitation of such data is that they report only on  the endpoints  of the binding reaction.  Thus, the intermediate events in the  binding reaction, such as identification of initial recognition  sites and induction of changes in the conformation of the DNA have  not been observed or studied.  Techniques are under development that utilize visible light to  trigger chemical reactions that will enable the time dependence of  the reaction of proteins with specific DNA sequences to be  examined.  This approach will greatly advance our understanding of  the molecular mechanism by which proteins recognize and bind to  specific sequences of DNA.  ***",
