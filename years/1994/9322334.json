The Division supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School  of Arts and Sciences for students who are engaged in biological research in  laboratories on the Medical School campus. This 10 week summer research program  will support 10  undergraduate students each summer working in the fields of  microbial biochemistry and genetic regulation.  Students will be recruited from a  nation-wide pool, with a particular emphasis on recruiting qualified minority students  and women. They will have the opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories of  any of 16 Division faculty who are participating in this program. Special program  activities include:  weekly student-faculty research seminars to discuss the students'  projects, discussions of ethical issues related to the project content, and a career  development discussion series.  Division minority and majority faculty and graduate  students participate in the seminars and ethics discussions, and the program students  are provided with additional opportunities to meet other majority and minority research  faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings.  ***",
