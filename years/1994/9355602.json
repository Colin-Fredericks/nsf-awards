The series, \"The Kinetic City Super Crew,\" is  targeted at children 8-10 years old with an emphasis on urban  children, girls, minorities, and children with disabilities.  The  series of 92 programs also will be designed for family listening.   The programs revolve around a drama led by child actors and  include discussions with scientists and information for at-home  experiments.         The Co-Principal Investigators will be Jerry Bell and Gerald  Wheeler.  Bell is Program Director for Science, Mathematics, and  Technology Education at AAAS and will be responsible for overall  management of the project.  Wheeler is Program Director for the  Public Understanding of Science and Technology and will serve as  the Science Content Director for the programs.  There also will  be a Science Content Team (consisting of Bell, Shirley Malcom and  Andrew Ahlgren) that will work closely with Wheeler, the  production staff, and the advisors to review show themes,  scientists to be interviewed, overall content, and to serve as  arbiters for questions related to their respective fields.  Bob  Hirshon will serve as Executive Produce/Project Director and John  Keefe will be Senior Producer.",
