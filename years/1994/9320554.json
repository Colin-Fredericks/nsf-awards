 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320554  Wang    Early studies on arms transfers and African coups have not  considered the interaction between the two areas.  While arms  transfers have largely been treated as a matter of international  affairs, military intervention in Africa is usually seen as  resulting from domestic factors.  There exist, however, both  empirical evidence and theoretical justification for the  proposition that international arms shipments and African coups  d'etat are related.  This investigation assesses the political  effects of arms transfers on the occurrence of coups in Africa.   Utilizing theories of arms transfers and of the coup d'etat, a  causal model is constructed to evaluate the political  consequences of international arms shipments.  An event count  analysis in conjunction with conventional regression techniques  is employed for statistical estimation of the effects of arms  transfers on African coups.    The proposed research is significant in three aspects.  First, it  is significant in its theoretical contribution.  Since previous  studies have neglected exploring the linkages between African  coups and arms transfers, this investigation fills this  theoretical gap.  Second, this research is important in its  methodological contribution as an event count analysis will be  employed for statistical estimation.  This is an appropriate  techniques for coups analysis but has not been adopted by any  prior investigation.  Third, this investigation will expand the  existing data base on African coups, which, in itself, will be a  contribution to the discipline and invite replications of similar  research.  ***",
