This formation represents shallow marine conditions and it  contains one of the most diverse fossil echinoderm assemblages in  the world.  The Seymour Island echinoderm fauna has  characteristics more like Paleozoic echinoderm communities than  like the great majority of other Cenozoic shallow water  communities.  Current thinking suggests that morphologically  novel marine organisms originated primarily in near shore,  heterogeneous environments, and then expanded to offshore, more  homogeneous environments.  After the Paleozoic, this pattern of  near shore-offshore pattern is thought to have been driven  largely by predation pressure.  The La Meseta echinoderm  occurrences suggest that the community reorganization that began  in the Mesozoic may not have been completed until the early  Cenozoic.  This research will extend the taxonomic work on the  echinoderms from Seymour Island and it will evaluate the  significance of predation in stelleroid and crinoid populations.   This information will allow a comparison with other echinoderm  occurrences, both fossil and modern, and will provide a rare view  of echinoderm paleoecology.  Specifically, this research will  allow an important test of the hypothesis that predation pressure  in shallow-marine near-polar environments during the Eocene was  an important forcing mechanism for echinoderm communities.  ***",
