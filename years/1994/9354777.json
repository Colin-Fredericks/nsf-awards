 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354777  Alstad         I am the author of an instructional software package designed to  support university courses in ecology and evolutionary biology.  Development of my present version, Populus 3.0, was funded by  grants from IBM, the University of Minnesota, and the NSF. It has  proven to be an extremely successful pedagogical tool here at  Minnesota, and is currently in use at more than 350 institutions,  worldwide.  I request additional UCCD funding to pursue four major  objectives, including (1) improvement of the narrative text offered  to explain Populus models both on screen and in a companion book,  (2) expanded coverage with new models, (3) \"porting\" of the package  to a new operating system, and (4) an initiative to increase the  use of Populus in small colleges. In addition to these new efforts,  I will continue to debug and maintain the program, and curate the  free distribution that will maximize its use.  ***y",
