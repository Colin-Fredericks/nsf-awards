 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405102  Proakis     This research will investigate and demonstrate solutions to known problems in indoor wireless systems.  Solutions will be demonstrated analytically and experimentally, at a wireless multiple-access testbed under development at Northeastern University.  Both the baseband transmitter files and acquisition attributes for this testbed are fully programmable, and the researcher can demonstrate novel transmission and reception techniques on actual radio frequency data directly in the Matlab environment.  For the duration of this grant, the investigator will address low-cost antenna diversity techniques, low-complexity demodulation schemes for dynamic fading channels, the localization of transmitters within the antenna field, the prediction of deep fades via localization, and the prediction and cancellation of intrabuilding interference (from office equipment and other wireless transmitters).  During the 24-month period, the research associate will specify novel multiuser communication system architectures with application to hospital patient monitoring and to general indoor wireless networks.  Broader applications will also be devised, including the development and implementation of multiuser detection algorithms, wavelet-based signal design, and channel waveform design for asynchronous multiple-access systems.  ***",
