The series of  conferences has been held yearly since 1981, at a host university  in the geographical region.  These conference bring together  established and new researchers and advanced graduate students  for an exchange of ideas and discussions on the diverse aspects  of differential equations. The talks are built around addresses  of three principal speakers of outstanding scientific reputation,  selected by a steering committee from representative  universities.  This year the speakers will be Professors L.  Pamela Cook-Ioaniddis, University of Delaware, Frank W. J. Olver,  University of Maryland and James B. Serrin, University of  Minnesota.  The primary purpose of the conferences is to promote  research and education in the field of differential equations,  i.e., ordinary and partial differential equations and functional  differential equations, numerical techniques and their  applications to biology, engineering and physics.  Conferences  are scheduled to run for two days each fall.   ***",
