The Organizers of the Symposia  are Natasha Raikhel, Michigan State University, East  Lansing, and Chris Lamb, Salk Institute, La Jolla.  The  contributed talks and discussion sessions will highlight  recent progress in plant cell biology and will bring  together scientists studying plant cells from a different  perspective.  This is a rapidly developing area of plant  science and there is a lot of room for young people to learn  and contribute.  The specific section that the Symposia  addresses are: cell surface and the extracellular matrix,;  cell adhesion , cytoskeleton and the recognition process;  plasmodesmata and nuclear pores; cell division; membrane  signaling; tonoplast and plasma membrane; endoplasmic  reticulum; plastids; cytoplasmic regulatory mechanisms;  signaling to the nucleus; transport vesicles; heath shock  proteins and molecular chaperones.  To maximize the personal  interactions an attendance limit of 300 has been set.  %%%  The Keystone Symposia format will provide a unique forum for  sustained, focused, in depth discussion of emerging topics  that are critical to the understanding of the unique  properties of plant cells.  The symposium will bring  together in addition of established scientists, as many  young, talented scientists as possible.  The conference will  be distinctly different from other s in the field because it  focuses on functional plant cell biology.  The funds  requested are mainly to bring graduate students to the  Symposium.    ***",
