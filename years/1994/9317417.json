 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317417  Lee    This compact dilution refrigerator used in experiments probing  the electronic and electrodynamic response of advanced materials  and novel solid-state structures at very low temperatures at  University of Virginia.  These research projects focus on  electron tunneling, noise, and transport studies of the  fundamental ground-state and elementary excitation properties of  interacting electron systems.  Because full spin, Coulomb, and  quantum correlation effects often do not become manifest until  temperatures of ~ 0.1K, attainment of temperatures below those  achievable by pumped liquid 3H2(~0.3 K) will be required, making  necessary the use of a dilution refrigerator which can achieve a  base temperature of approximately 0.02K in a rapid and convenient  manner.    It is anticipated that normal use of the dilution refrigerator  will be divided among three principal investigators:  Prof. Mark  Lee, who will be the principal user responsible for the  maintenance of the facility, Prof. Joseph Poon, and Prof. Elias  Towe.  Dr. Lee seeks to elucidate aspects of the ground state in  variable range hopping (VRH) conductors such as Si:P and  PrBa2Cu3O7 in the strongly interacting regime around 0.1 K by  tunneling and noise experiments.  He will also use the dilution  refrigerator to investigate large scale quantum coherency at low-  temperature in high mobility superconductor-semiconductor  structures, and how the coupling between novel superconductors  and normal metals can shed insight into possibly unconventional  superconducting mechanisms.  Dr. Poon is interested in highly  ordered new materials, composed entirely of metal atoms, that  show semiconducting or insulating behavior at low temperature as  a result of unusual symmetries, as occurs in quasicrystals, or  low dimensionality.  For this work it is important to have the  ability to systematically measure resistivities down to ~ 0.03 K  in a convenient manner in order to confirm and study the  existence of non-metallic behavior.   Dr. Towe currently grows  high purity semiconductor heterostructures by molecular beam  epitaxy.  Quantitative characterization effective masses and  mobilities is typically done by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas  oscillations and of the Hall effect quantization at very low  temperatures.  Dr. Towe's investigation will include a study of  mobilities in heterostructures of varying crystallographic  orientation and development of nitride-based semiconductor  heterostructures.  This instrument is straightforward to maintain  and operate, has a relatively rapid cool-down and sample turn-  around time, and will thus serve as an excellent teaching tool  for graduate and undergraduate students in solid-state and low-  temperature experimental physics.  The dilution unit will be  housed in an existing 4He dewar equipped with a compensated 10 T  superconducting solenoid and will share pumping and gas support  facilities with an operational 4He variable temperature cryostat.    ***",
