 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404773  Chen  The primary objective of this proposal is to study certain  free boundary problems which describe geometric motions of  hypersurfaces, to analyze the asymptotic behavior of certain  evolution equations and systems describing interfacial  phenomena, to connect the solutions of the free boundary  problems with the asymptotic behaviors of evolution  equations or systems, and to develop numerical schemes  calculating the solutions to the free boundary problems. In  the study of free boundary problems, the research will place  particular emphasis on a Hele-Shaw free boundary problem ,  which is to find the motion of a hypersurface such that the  normal velocity of the motion is equal to the jump across  the hypersurface of the normal derivative of a function that  is harmonic in the domain complementary to the hypersurface  and whose boundary value on the hypersurface is equal to the  mean curvature of the hypersurface. In the study of the  asymptotic behavior, the research will aim at the Cahn-  Hilliard equation modeling the phase separation and phase  coarsening phenomena in a binary alloy, and at the phase-  field model describing the temperature and liquid-solid  phase changes in a solid/liquidation process.       This project deals with differential equations of applied  mathematics. Techniques of functional analysis and geometry  will be used to analyze these equations. Since the problems  studied here are very basic in mathematical and physical  sciences, the methods developed in this project can be  applied to many other currently active research areas and  consequently advance the knowledge of interfacial phenomena.  In particular, applications of this research can be made to  advanced materials research.  ***",
