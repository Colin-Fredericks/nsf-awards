The implementation plan will affect students in all introductory  chemistry and physics courses for both science majors and  nonscience majors. The integrated package of computer, menu driven  data collection interface, spreadsheet program, and graphing  program will allow students to design their own experiments rather  than following the often \"canned\" procedures of the past. The  emphasis will be placed on the experiment and the interpretation of  data rather than on tedious data collection and calculation  allowing students to discover for themselves what relationships  exist between variables. Over a five year period more than 500  students will pass through these courses gaining a better  understanding of the process of science and how scientists actually  work in modern laboratories. Having the same system for both  chemistry and physics will allow students to use the experience  gained in their first science experience in future courses. This  early experience with computerized data acquisition and analysis  will prepare students for the more computer intensive upper  division courses which use computer controlled UV-Vis, FTIR, and  GCMS instruments and a CAChe molecular modeling system.",
