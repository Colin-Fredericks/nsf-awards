 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317181  Harbor       Geomorphic response to extensional uplift is a matter of  concern to the geomorphologist, geophysicist, and sedimentologist,  but has received little quantitative study.  The area south of  Yellowstone in the transition between the Basin and Range and  Middle Rocky Mountains of Wyoming is dotted by extensional uplifts  that exhibit a varying degree of structural offset and erosional  dissection.  the types of geomorphic processes and rates of erosion  in several of these ranges will be studied in order to provide new  data on redistribution of mass in the presence of major tectonic  relief.  The field area will also be numerically described in terms  of relief and the dimensions/characteristics of drainage basins and  stream segments, in part from DEM models of topography.  Selected  areas within these mountainous uplifts will also be mapped  according to geomorphic process and studied in detail for rate of  erosion.  Using deposits that have accumulated on datable surfaces  and incision or aggradation of streams over the last 103 to 104  years, the rate of processes on \"competing\" geomorphic components  of mountain uplifts will be quantified.  Deposits slated for study  include pluvial lake deltas, debris fans, and valley fills behind  landslide dams and moraines.  All of these data will be used  together to discover, if possible, the important predictors of  denudation rate, such as relief or drainage area.  Conceptual  models of geomorphic processes will be evaluated against these data  and also against descriptions of processes.  Of particular interest  is the change in rate of drainage basin erosion with time and  increasing offset.",
