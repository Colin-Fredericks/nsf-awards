These vortices have been recently shown to exist well below the  superfluid transition, pinned to the substrate and stable against  moderate film flow.  Large amplitude third sound waves not only  provide film flow large enough to move the vortices, but are able  to create and destroy the vortices by the quantum-mechanical  analogy of swirling.  Small amplitude waves are used to probe the  vortex distribution.  This detailed study of vortex pinning and  creation will provide better understanding of the importance of  innate vortices at low temperatures and their properties.    Non-technical abstract:  This research will investigate the  properties of microscopic quantized circulation states in thin  films of superfluid helium.  These vortices have been shown to play  a role in the properties of films near the superfluid transition  temperature and will be studied directly for the first time at  lower temperatures by their interaction with sound waves.  Unlike  its counterpart superconductivity, there remain fundamental  problems in the microscopic description of the superfluid state and  clarifying the role of the vortices in films will contribute to the  general understanding of condensed matter physics.  ***",
