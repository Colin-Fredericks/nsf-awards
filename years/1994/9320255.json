The teachers will explore a variety  of contemporary issues confronting practicing scientists which  raise questions of ethics and values.  They will select issues  for development into lessons on the basis of their own interests  and experience.  Specific attention will be given to the  multitude of ethics issues related to the explosive developments  in biotechnology, and the teachers will also peform genetic  engineering experiments to illustrate the techniques and their  applications.  Follow-up sessions held during the fall and spring  will be used to encourage the teacher pairs to share and critique  the progress they have made in integrating ethics and values  issues into their own curricula.  The project instructors,  working with the teachers, will edit teaching materials that have  been developed and distribute them to all participants.  Both the  case studies and instructional materials for the institute, and  the teaching materials, will also be widely disseminated to other  interested teachers and administrators.  A broadbased advisory  committee will oversee and evaluate the project, as will a  project consultant and the participants themselves.  ***",
