 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362009  Murphy  Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs), subsea robots and other  instrumented and remotely operated systems for marine  applications require a power source which is as efficient as  possible to give long range or extended use times.  The obvious  choice is an electrochemical unit of fuel cell type.   Conventional fuel cells require hydrogen fuel, and they normally  use molecular oxygen as oxidant.  Aboard an AUV, for instance,  these materials would be expected to be carried as cryogenic  liquids, as in a space-craft.  This presents several practical  problems, among which are the difficulties of storage, safety and  handling, and buoyancy problems aboard the AUV as they are  consumed.  This program examines alternative fuel and oxidant  combinations for use in an electrochemical fuel cell power  system.  The objective is to explore the possibility of fuel-  oxidant combinations with a specific energy which is an  improvement on cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen, but also to  determine whether such combinations have advantages in regard to  their practical specific volume including any additional volume  on board which may be required for displacement corrections  during propellant depletion.",
