 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade the majority of employment opportunities for  geology graduates has shifted from the extractive component of  petroleum and mining industries to companies and government  agencies specializing in environmental concerns.  This represents  a fundamental, long term trend that will continue through the  remainder of this century.  Geologists employed in environmental  fields need a broad background in the geological sciences with  emphases in hydrogeology, surficial geology, natural resources,  geochemistry, and geophysics, and they should be familiar with  computer applications that focus on environmental analysis.  In keeping with our broad curriculum that allows us to focus on  training undergraduates in the environmental aspects of geology, we  are developing a computer laboratory consisting of advanced but  user friendly personal computers and software for the purpose of  enhancing courses in hydrogeology, surficial geology, geology of  natural resources, and geophysics. The facility is allowing us to  develop innovative laboratory exercises that use image processing,  geographic information systems, computer-aided drafting, modeling  techniques, and a variety of digital data sets, including satellite  images and a unique CUSMAP data set for the region where SIUC is  located.  Exercises are being designed to enhance scientific  understanding of geologic processes and relationships between  different elements of the earth system, as well as to emphasize  realistic problem-solving applications such as landfill siting,  ground water contamination, assessment of geological hazards, and  assessment of problems associated with resource exploitation.  Because of the visual and interactive nature of these exercises,  they enhance the communication of basic and advanced concepts,  stimulate critical thinking, and generate enthusiasm for  independent study. These attributes and the computer skills  acquired are making our undergraduates more competent and  competitive in the growin g environmental work force as well as  better prepared for graduate study.",
