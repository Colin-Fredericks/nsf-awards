Due to the structure of  the field situation, we expect this project to lead to the development  of a network of scholars working on both descriptive and historical  issues in MZ languages -- something that has been need for quite some  time. Most of the grant funds are in support of field work to recover  new information on the modern MZ languages. Some of the funding is  devoted to epi-Olmec decipherment research (in which the principal  investigators have made the major breakthroughs), since the  interpretation of two intact epi-Olmec texts is making significant  contributions to MZ comparative linguistics. The work is significant in  several areas. MZ languages have grammatical properties of interest to  current linguistic theory. It has the potential to make a major  contribution to early Mesoamerican cultural and linguistic history; MZ  languages were spoken by the Olmecs, and were influential at the Olmec  era and subsequently in affecting many other languages in the area. It  contributes to the ongoing decipherment of epi-Olmec writing; the  interpretation of its texts depends heavily upon MZ comparative studies,  which were crucial in the original decipherment. Finally, it includes a  major language salvage operation, helping to preserve an important part  of the linguistic heritage of the Americas.  ***",
