 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362151  Podany       A new high resolution paint spraying technology suitable for  industrial, robotic applications is to be investigated.  This  technology would facilitate the automated application of uniform  coatings for decorative and functional painting as well as  eliminate tedious manual mask and spray techniques currently used  in industry.  The project will investigate the use of an applicator  as a precision paint spraying or coating device for robotic  applications and will have as its objectives the development of a  model of the applicator suitable for computerized robot path  planning.  Specific objectives are the characterization of the  applicator's spray pattern, volumetric spray characteristics, spray  velocity, and resulting coating characteristics, i.e. thickness and  uniformity, as functions of atomization and fluid pressure, the  nozzle, electronic control of the coating feed, and geometric  parameters such as applicator distance, angle, and velocity.       This applicator would reduce industry costs and environmental  hazards while the precise, uniform application of functional and  decorative coatings would allow the automation of certain manual,  tedious coating tasks previously thought difficult, if not  impossible, to automate.",
