 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316986  Wasserman    Dr. Wasserman is studying a conserved signal transduction  pathway that regulates gene expression by controlling the  subcellular localization of a transcription factor.  Intracellular transduction of a signal received at the  surface of the Drosophila embryo promotes nuclear import of  the dorsal protein and thereby establishes the dorsoventral  body axis. In mammalian T cells, the homologous pathway  regulates transport of the transcription factor NF-kappaB  into nuclei in response to the cytokine interleukin-1. Dr.  Wasserman would like to understand where each of the known  proteins in the pathway resides and how these proteins  interact with one another to effect signal transduction. In  addition, he would like to isolate the genes for any  components in the pathway that have not been identified  previously. He will use antisera directed against pathway  proteins to determine their distribution in whole mount  embryo preparations and then examine whether that  distribution is affected by signal transduction or is  dependent on the presence of other proteins in the pathway.  He will also map the sequences responsible for localizing  each protein, so that he may assay the role of protein  localization in signaling. To investigate interactions among  components of the dorsoventral pathway, he will us the two-  hybrid screening system in S. cerevisiae. Pairs of  Drosophila proteins will be separately fused to either LexA  DNA binding domain or an acidic transcriptional activating  domain and assayed for their ability to promote  transcription downstream of LexA operator sites through  protein-protein interaction. He will also use the yeast  system to isolate mutations that prevent interaction between  the Drosophila proteins. Such mutations will then be  expressed in the context of the Drosophila embryo to assay  their effect on signal transduction. To identify additional  genes that might function in the dorsoventral signaling  pathway, he will screen for Drosophila prote ins that bind to  known pathway components. Using the yeast two-hybrid system,  he will investigate whether any of the five previously  identified proteins can interact specifically with other  proteins encoded by an embryonic cDNA library. Once he has  identified candidate clones in this screen, he will derive  data on sequence, map position, and, where possible, mutant  phenotype, to determine the likelihood that the encoded  proteins play a role in transducing the dorsoventral signal.  ***",
