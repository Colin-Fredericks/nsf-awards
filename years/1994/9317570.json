 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Thomas Flood, Chemistry Department,   University of Southern California, will undertake synthetic and   mechanistic studies of reactions between hydrocarbons and transition   metal complexes. The reaction types to be investigated are fundamental to   all of organometallic chemistry and transition metal-based catalysis with   the targeted systems providing well-defined examples in which   carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-oxygen bonds are formed and/or   cleaved. A variety of effects which may influence these reactions will be   evaluated, with particular attention being paid to a comparison between   amine and more conventional ligands. Mechanistic studies will be carried   out using physical and spectroscopic methods.    Carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and/or carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken   and/or formed in countless chemical reactions, including those involved   in many industrial processes. A large number of these reactions are   facilitated by metal containing catalysts. Consequently, an understanding   of how metals mediate such processes and how they interact with reacting   species is of profound importance. This research will both improve our   fundamental understanding of these important processes and provide the   information needed to design more efficient metal catalysts.",
