 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401594  Palmer       Holonomic fields are quantum field theories with an intimate  connection to elliptic operators with isolated singularities. The  correlation function or tau-function of such fields have appeared  in a wide variety of contexts including, the scaling limit of the  two dimensional Ising model, the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the  complex sphere, level spacing distributions for random matrices,  the KdV hierarchy and its relatives, the asymptotics of Toeplitz  determinants, and recently intersection theory on the moduli  space of Riemann surfaces. A reformulation of the original  Sato, Miwa and Jimbo theory that has been worked out by  Professor Palmer makes it possible to consider a variety  of generalizations. The proposal here is to complete the analysis  of the Dirac operators on the hyperbolic disk and to make the  field theory connection by developing an analytic version of the  theory of vertex operators. These vertex operators should also  prove useful in simplifying (and generalizing) some of the  algebraic analysis that goes into the theory of vertex operator  algebras. Quantum field theories are mathematical models for  quantum mechanics. In addition the use in mathematical physics in  these theories often represent the beginning of new developments  in mathematics. The proposal here involves explicit description  of invariants of earlier quantum field theories. These  descriptions lead to surprising connections with important recent  mathematical developments in algebra and geometry.  ***",
