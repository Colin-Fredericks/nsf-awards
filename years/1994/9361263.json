 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361263  Bowen  Several methods are currently being developed for the production of  surface-relief diffractive optics including photolithography,  single-point diamond turning, and single-point laserwriting.  All  of these methods are limited in either the achievable geometries or  minimum feature size.  In order to realize the full commercial  potential of diffractive optics and subwavelength structured  surfaces, it is necessary to create structures that consist of  smaller features.  We propose to investigate the use of near-field  scanning optical lithography (NSOL) for the fabrication of  diffractive structures that can be used at high numerical aperture  and short wavelengths.  Near-field scanning can create structures  well below that produced by conventional projection lithography.   In order to fabricate useful macroscopic optical devices, it is  necessary to increase throughput and extend the manufacturable  dimensions of NSOL.  This capability will serve to advance optical  technology in the areas of UV optical systems, optical data storage  and subwavelength structured optics.  The ability to fabricate  nanometer-sized structures will also be useful for applications in  X-ray instruments and micromachining.  We have identified  commercial applications in document security and polarization  components.    ***",
