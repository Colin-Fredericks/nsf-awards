 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320369  Goldberg  Ever since World War II, the United States has endeavored to find  a \"quick scientific fix\" for the problems confronting this nation.   Previously, it was the \"War on Cancer\" that would find a cure  within a relatively short period of time.  Currently, activists are  calling for a \"Manhattan Project\" for AIDS to find an immediate  cure for that dreaded disease.  When these projects fail, the  public which has been led to foot the massive costs of these  \"Manhattan-like\" projects rightly becomes skeptical of science--  even if it is the case that it was the politicians who cynically  made these promises.  Given these problems, it is critically  important for the public to understand why and how the Manhattan  Project succeeded and how current projects may or may not fit the  model that that war-time effort presents.  It is this task which  Dr. Goldberg is continuing with this grant.    Dr. Goldberg is completing his study of General Leslie R. Groves,  Commanding General of the Manhattan Engineer District.  Dr.  Goldberg aims to provide a context of understanding who General  Groves was, why he was picked to head the atomic bomb project, and  the characteristics that made his administration of the project so  effective.  He is also exploring the reasons why these very same  characteristics served him so poorly after the war.  Most  treatments of the Manhattan Project focus on the technical puzzles  which were solved in record time or on the impact of the  development of the bomb on end-of-the-war and post-war diplomatic  history.  By examining the Manhattan Project in the context of a  study of General Groves, one is immediately confronted with the  need to assess his philosophy of organization and the importance to  the success of the project of Groves' administrative style and the  administrative machinery he created.  ***",
