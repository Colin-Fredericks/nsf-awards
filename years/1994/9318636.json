 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318636  Ceyer  A knowledge of the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous reactions  will put our understanding of surface reaction chemistry on the  same footing as our detailed understanding of elementary gas  phase reaction processes.  This research project, supported in  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is designed to  obtain this sort of detailed information.  Surface processes  which are induced by the collision of gas phase species with  the surface are the focus of the work of this project.  Molecular beam methods will be used to investigate the reaction  of molecules with the surface and species adsorbed on the  surface, as a function of the translational energy of the  incident molecule.  The hydrogenation of ethylene on the nickel  surface and the packing of hydrogen atoms into the bulk of the  nickel sample are two processes which will be explored in  detail.  Electron energy loss spectroscopy will be used to  identify possible reaction products and surface intermediates  which may result from the collision induced surface chemistry.  %%%  The basic understanding of the dynamics of surface chemical  reactions is important for our developing understanding of many  technologically important surface processes such as  heterogeneous catalysis and electronic materials processing.  This basic understanding can best be obtained by exploring the  dynamics of elementary surface reaction processes using the  molecular dynamics methods developed to examine gas phase  reactions.  This project addresses the specific question of  collision activated surface chemistry, using variable energy  molecular beam studies to probe important model systems.  From  this detailed experimental information, a framework for  understanding surface chemical processes will develop.  ***",
