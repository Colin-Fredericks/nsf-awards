 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Caneba - 9404156      Understanding and control of commercial-scale polymerization reaction processes is important in the production of high-quality polymer products.  Free-radical polymerization processes sometimes have temperature and molecular weight control problems.  The PI is planning to study the physico-chemical and product material aspects of a free-radical precipitation polymerization reaction system wherein phase separation occurs as the temperature and molecular weight increase.  This is in contrast with conventional precipitation polymerization processes that involve phase separation as the temperature decreases.  The PI calls this new process \"free-radical retrograde precipitation polymerization (FRRPP).  This process has the potential to produce \"designer\" molecules with specific end groups and a narrow, tightly controlled molecular weight distribution as well as block copolymers, at lower pressures, which makes the process economically attractive.    In order to obtain a fundamental understanding of the FRRPP process, the PI plans to: (1) do gel effect modeling of the FRRPP system; (2) do in-situ pulsed NMR experiments during polymerization; (3) develop a ternary phase diagram of the polymer-monomer-solvent system through diode-array light scattering and pulsed NMR methods; and (4) determine the kinetic coefficients through batch polymerization  and ESR experiments.  These kinetic studies will be carried out through measurements of conversion, molecular weight distribution as well as radical concentrations versus reaction time.",
