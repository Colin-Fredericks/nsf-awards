Ancillary apparatus has been  acquired for on site image acquisition, preliminary data  processing, subsequent data reduction, storage, printing. Several  experiments are being developed for advanced students, as well as  CCD cluster investigations for the beginning level. In addition to  serving as basic training for future astronomers, the laboratory  also serves the large number of introductory students interested in  astronomy and their peers who are physics majors. A second major  item is a Proxima Desk Top Projector which facilitates planetarium  discussions of solar system configurations and planetary motions  that were not possible before with the simple Spitz planetarium.   It is also used in demonstrations in the lecture hall and for  travelling presentations in libraries and schools. Both major items  have the additional attraction that they are making astronomy at  the University of Connecticut accessible to handicapped students  for whom the planetarium and observatories were previously  user-unfriendly and inaccessible, respectively.",
