The traineeship program will consist of an  introductory overview summer prior to the first academic year  semester during which trainees will be introduced to the broad  range of oceanography and ocean engineering research.  The first  summer includes participation in a ten day cruise, and specific  seminars by faculty involved in interdisciplinary coastal ocean  research.  Trainees will enroll in the existing normal X of  graduate courses in oceanography or ocean engineering to gain a  broad education in oceanography or ocean engineering and an in-  depth education in their specialization.  An intensive graduate  level seminar offered each year between the fall and spring  semesters will provide a more detailed in-depth introduction (for  first year students) and progressively more intense involvement  (for second through fifth year students) in interdisciplinary  coastal ocean research.  Trainees will undertake  PhD thesis  research within an interdisciplinary context.  A Science-Policy-  Management Seminar for trainees who have advanced to PhD candidacy  will involve faculty of the Joint Program and external experts  active at the science-policy-management interfaces.",
