Using  univariate or multivariate time series produced by a  deterministic physical process, the phase space of the process  can be faithfully reconstructed.  Topological and diffeomorphic  embedding theorems guaranteeing this in various physically  verifiable contexts have been the results of previous and ongoing  research by the investigator and coworkers.  Among the many  applications of these mathematical foundations are computational  techniques for noise reduction (filtering) and time series  prediction, to enhance and/or replace conventional methods from  the fields of signal processing and time series analysis, which  are of limited applicability for data from chaotic processes.  A  related task that is targeted by this research is the development  of reliable diagnostics with which to distinguish linear and  nonlinear noise processes from nonlinear dynamics, on the basis  of data measured from experiment or the environment.  New  techniques for these applications are developed in this project,  involving methods from numerical analysis used in conjunction  with existing signal processing methods.  The study of the  validity of computer simulations of chaotic processes by means of  shadowing is also pursued in conjunction with collaborators.       The central goal of this research is to identify and analyze  nonlinear behaviors in systems, by measurement and analysis of  quantitative signals produced by that system.  New techniques  allow exploitable deterministic descriptions, using the paradigms  of deterministic chaos, for some systems written off earlier as  noise, or as too difficult to study.  Complex phenomena of this  type are being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and  biological/medical settings.  As an example, hippocampal slices  from mammals and other small neural systems are being studied by  the investigator, in conjunction with a g roup of medical  researchers headed by a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy,  with the purpose of detecting deterministic information  processing in the brain.  The first mathematical foundations of  the reconstruction techniques pursued in this proposal were  disseminated in 1980, which led almost immediately to intensive  research across several scientific disciplines, the impact of  which has not yet been fully felt.  The investigator has done  previous work on expanding these conceptual foundations and  developing related computational implementations, and under this  proposal will widen their areas of validity and increase their  power for the study of complex systems in natural, experimental,  and engineering-related contexts.",
