Long Beach, CA  Gilbert, Dean and Jacqueling Deamer    \"Project OCEANS (Opportunties To Challenge The Environment and The  Nature Of Science\"    Project OCEAN will serve 60 underrepresented-minority (Afro-  American, Hispanic, and Native American) middle school students  wach of the three summers of the project term.  Twenty students who  have hust completed the sixth, seventh, or eight grade will be  selected for each cohort; at least half will be young women.   Participation will be open to students from the Long Beach, Los  Angeles (Harbor and South Central areas), Lawndale, Compton,  Inglewood, Torrance, and PalosVerdes School Districts.  Interest in  science and Mathematics as demonstrated in students' application  essays and interviews, GPA, completion of challenging academic  programs as compared with others from their respective schools, and  satisfactory records of conduct and attendance will be criteria for  selection.  The summer science camp will structured as an  adaptation of the NTSA integrated science model.  Instruction will  be organized thematically, with applications of basic scientific  and mathematical concepts drawn from the disciplines of marine  biology, oceanography, coastal management, geology, and terrestrial  ecology.  The approach will be experiential and cross-curricular.    The summer component will be offered in three modules, hosted at  three different sites.  During the first two weeks of the six-week  session, students will attend a mini-institute in essential science  and mathematics skills, so as to foster a common knowledge base  among participants.  Students will them spenc two weeks at the  Southern California Marine Institute on Terminal Island (Los  Angeles Harbor); there they will begin to discover applications of  basic concepts withih a marine-science context through classroom  and laboratory experiences and field exercises on one of the five  research vessels at the disposal of the Institute.  The final  two  weeks will be residential at the Wrigley Marine Science Center on  Catalina Island, a period which will function as an extended  practicum, during which students will work on individual and small-  group research projects of their choosing.  Ten follow-up sessions  will also be scheduled during the subsequent academic year.  Part  of the follow-up program will be devoted to students' producing  \"mini-documentaries\" of their research experiences the previous  summer.  Project evaluation will examine changes in participants'  knowlege about and attitudes toward science/mathematics  engineering; subsequent enrollment in and sucdess with challenging  courses in these disciplines; growth in understanding of research  methodology; awareness of career opportunities in SEM fields; and  requirements for postsecondary training and career options in those  areas.  Data will be disaggregated by ethnicity, sex , grade level,  and multiple indicators of achievement to premit more penetrating  and useful analysis of outcomes.",
