 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402184  Drucker    Research will be carried out to develop a fundamental  understanding of  the processes associated with direct epitaxial  deposition to spontaneously form a collection of identical,  defect free nanostructures during Ge/Si(100) heteroepitaxy.  A  unique combination of both in situ (low energy electron  microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and ultrahigh vacuum  scanning transmission electron microscopy) and ex situ  (transmission electron microscopy) microscopy will be used to  asses the size, uniformity, areal density and spatial  distribution of these nanostructures.  Tuning the size of uniform  collections of dots will be investigated by varying the  concentration of mobile adatoms (supersaturation) on the growth  surface through changes in deposition parameters. The size of  these nanostructures will be tuned through the Bohr radius in Ge,  about 10 nm, to investigate the effects of quantum confinement.  Use of direct epitaxial deposition allows formation of the target  structures on a semiconductor surface, in situ and, most  importantly, in a single step.  %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a  fundamental-understanding of the epitaxial growth, processing,  and properties of Ge/Si quantum dots so that they can be  exploited in the realization of a variety of advanced electronic  and photonic devices.  An important feature of the program is the  training of graduate and undergraduate students in a  fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials  and processing research.  This research will contribute to  improving the general performance of advanced devices and  integrated circuits used in computing, information processing,  and telecommunications.  ***",
