WGBH, in association with eighteen museums in the Museum Film Network, will produce a 35 minute IMAX/OMNIMAX film showing the behind-the-scenes story of a group of filmmakers at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) as they create a special effects sequence in the IMAX/OMNIMAX format.  The film will illustrate how the eye and brain work together to process cinematic illusions.  The California Museum of Science and Industry (CMSI) will create a 6,000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will focus on the science and technical processes of special effect.  The exhibit will travel to fifteen other museums.  A smaller scale lobby exhibit also will be developed for display in the cueing areas of IMAX/OMNIMAX theaters that are showing the \"Special Effects\" film.  A collaborative educational outreach program will extend the reach of both the film and exhibit.      The project will be managed by the NOVA production unit at WGBH under the direction of Paula Apsell.  Ms. Apsell also will serve as Executive Producer for the IMAX/OMNIMAX film.  Diane Perlov, Curator of Exhibitions at CMSI, will supervise the exhibit portion of the project.  Kenneth Phillips, Curator of Aerospace Science at CMSI, will develop video interactives and oversee scientific content of the exhibit.  Carol Valenta, Director of Education for CMSI, and Beth Kirsh, Director of Educational Print and Outreach for WGBH, will be responsible for implementing the outreach plan.  Advisors for the project include David H. Hubel, neurobiologist, Harvard Medical School; Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, neurophysiologist, University of California, San Diego; Richard Gregory, perception psychologist, University of Bristol; Sally Duensing, Science and Museum Liaison, Exploratorium; Elizabeth Stage, Co-Director for Science, New Standards Project, National Center on Education and the Economy; and Robert Coutts, high school physics teacher, Los  Angeles, CA.",
