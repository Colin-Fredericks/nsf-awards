The goal of this  project is to involve undergraduate students in basic research in plant biology.  Students  often have an inherent bias towards research involving animals.  This program will try  and overcome this bias by presenting the students with the opportunity to participate in a  plant-focused program involving a variety of disciplines, approaches, and techniques.   Eleven plant scientists in three department have volunteered to serve as mentors.  They  included biochemists, cell biologists, developmental biologists, molecular biologists,  physiologists and systematists.  Opportunities exist for both field-oriented and laboratory-  oriented research.  Available research techniques include DNA sequencing, protein  electrophoresis and immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, light and electron  microscopy, in situ hybridation, analysis of genomes using PCR-based methods, isozyme  analysis, spectrophotometric analysis of enzyme activities, plant tissue culture, plant  transformations, and a variety of molecular biological methods.  Aspects of the program  that should enhance its potential for success include:  (1) a group orientation session in  which the students will learn basic laboratory skills, engage in radiation and chemical  safety training, and be introduced to using the library to find scientific literature; (2) an  effort to develop student camaraderie by presenting the students with the opportunity to  participate in group activities with the other plant biology students as well as a larger  group of biology undergraduate research students; and (3) the provision by a related  program of funds for quests speakers in the plant sciences, student travel funds to attend  meetings, and student research supply funds.  ***",
