 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314225  Franceschi      This award will provide travel support over the next three years  to enable Dr. Vincent Franceschi of Washington State University  to make yearly visits to conduct cooperative research with  Dr. John W. Patrick at the University of Newcastle in Australia.  The research will focus on the mechanism of sucrose unloading in   developing seeds. To understand how unloading is regulated, it is  necessary to analyze each step at the cellular and subcellular  level, and is best accomplished through a histochemical approach.    Specialized cells called transfer cells appear to contain the  biochemical mechanisms necessary for controlling sucrose  unloading. Antibody and cDNA probes will be used to further  characterize the transfer cells. This project will bring together  the physiological expertise of Dr. Patrick with the molecular  probes and techniques which have been developed by  Dr. Franceschi. Since crop yield is strongly affected by the rate  and pattern of import into storage regions of a plant, and  unloading is central to import, this research could have  significant practical importance in agriculture.",
