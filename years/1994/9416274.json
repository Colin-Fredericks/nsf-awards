 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416274  Sause  Many precast parking garages were heavily damaged in the  Northridge earthquake.  The gravity load system of many of  these structures consisted of double tee floor units  supported by inverted tee girders, spandrel girders, and  columns with corbels.  The lateral load system consisted of  a few shearwalls with diaphragms formed by the double tees  with reinforced topping slabs.  These two systems are  usually designed as separate systems.  If the diaphragm  develops cracks as a result of large in-plane forces and  bending moments, significant diaphragm deformation may  result and the rigid diaphragm assumption may be inadequate.  Yielding of diaphragm reinforcing steel would result in much  large diaphragm deformation.    The objectives of this project are to: (1) study the  influence of diaphragm behavior on the levels of drift  experienced by the gravity load systems of precast parking  structures during the Northridge earthquake, (2) evaluate  whether diaphragm failure contributed to the observed damage  in precast parking structures, and (3) propose capacity  design concepts for precast diaphragms, if appropriate.    A prototype parking structure based on the damaged parking  structures will be designed and detailed.  The seismic force-  deformation behavior of a typical diaphragm of the prototype  structure will be studied analytically, using a linear  model, and two nonlinear models of different levels of  detail and complexity.  Unidirectional and bidirectional  seismic loads will be considered.  The seismic force-  deformation behavior of a typical shearwall will also be  studied analytically.  The results of this analysis will be  used to assess the significance of the diaphragm  deformation.  If appropriate, capacity-based design concepts  for diaphragms will be developed using the results of  nonlinear dynamic analysis of the prototype structure.    The type of construction of precast parking structures  damaged in this earthquake is widely used across the  country, a nd thus a substantial hazard may exist.  The  research undertaken in this project will evaluate the role  of diaphragm behavior and new capacity-based design concepts  will be proposed to avoid inadequate diaphragm behavior in  new precast parking structures.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
