 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316875  Gonzalez    The eastern portion of Iowa and surrounding states, Minnesota,  Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri are characterized by the presence  of a well developed karst in which cave development is extensive.   We propose to study the stalagmite age and isotopic record in three  to four different \"basins\" in a region encompassing the karsted  southern edge of the Prairie Peninsula where the Holocene history  of the peninsula is virtually unknown.  This research compliments  current and proposed research by R. G. Baker and others that study  the palynological, plant macrofossil and soil record and attempts  to fill information gaps in the Holocene vegetation and climatic  history.  We propose to use the picomole to subpicomole resolution  of combined isotope dilution and mass spectrometry U-Th methods to  accurately date speleothems (stalagmites) and the carbon and oxygen  isotopic composition of calcite to extract a record reflecting  climatic change.  The goals of these research are; 1) Better define  the extent of the climate-induced vegetation change in the upper  Midwest utilizing delta 13C shifts and U-series dates; 2) Provide a  more precise and accurate timing of climate-induced vegetation  change in the region; 3) Attempt to generate a quantitative record  of temperature change at the decadal scale for the Midwest; 4)  Attempt to define rates of vegetation change and biomass turnover  over the cave areas using changes in the delta 13C; 5) Attempt to  resolve annual and possibly semi-annual changes in speleothem  calcite; 6) Provide a well dated history of changes in the southern  edge of the Prairie Peninsula; 7) Attempt to estimate precipitation  from growth rate changes.  Multiple speleothems will be analyzed  within individual basins and caves to replicate and validate timing  and magnitude of isotopic shifts, growth rate changes, or the  presence of basin wide desiccation events.  Careful attention will  be given to cave selection with special emphasis in the  identificati on of evidence of desiccation and flooding events which  will diminish and validity and utility of isotopic analysis for  climatic inferences.  Attempt will be made to find study sites in  close proximity to those being studies  by Baker and others so that  precise timing for vegetation changes can be provided.",
