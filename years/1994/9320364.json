In  adulthood, a peer--usually, the relationship partner--becomes the  primary source of security and support. Thus, in the normal  course of development, these basic social needs are transferred  from parents to partners. There has been much research on the  parent-child bond and, in recent years, an increasing amount of  research on adult-adult bonds. However, little is know about the  processes by which emotional attachments are transferred, nor  about how emotional bonds are formed between adults. It is a well  documented fact that relationship experiences in one's family of  origin influence the quality and course of subsequent  relationships. Previous research has established that problematic  parent-child relationships put individuals at increased risk for  a host of negative outcomes, including diminished productivity in  the work place, drug and alcohol abuse, and impaired  psychological and physical health. Understanding the  developmental transition whereby individuals establish emotional  attachments outside their families of origin has obvious  theoretical as well as practical importance. This project will  investigate the transition by studying an ethnically and  socioeconomically diverse cross-section of children, adolescents,  and adults for a period of 4 years. Previous work by the  investigator forms the basis of a model of this transition which  will be tested in this research. If this model proves to be  correct, the thoughts, feeling, and behaviors that eventually  lead to well- or poorly-functioning adult relationships may be  evident in early childhood. The results of the project promise to  contribute to our understanding of the developmental course,  underlying processes and mechanisms, and the timing of a critical  milestone in human life.",
