Over the next year, our consortium will work with outside experts  and enabling organizations to refine the scope and activities of  the National Center.  Center goals are: to establish a stronger  national presence for ATE in the region and nation; to develop  innovative ATE collaborations with business and industry in order  to respond more effectively to technological workplace needs; and  to take leadership in the development of ATE curricula, program  improvement, and model student support programs.  Our National  Center of Excellence will place special emphasis on responding to  the needs of minorities and women in urban ATE.  A planning grant  will help establish Center governance and management procedures and  to refine the Center's three-year implementation plan.  Our  proposed National Center would: (1) create an ATE National  Clearinghouse which will conduct research, sponsor conferences, and  develop regional/national telecommunications links among NSF ATE  Centers and the entire ATE educational community; (2) establish  criteria for the selection of exemplary ATE curricula to be  produced in multi-media formats and disseminated through the  National Center; (3) model ATE teacher and faculty enhancement  activities and devise non-traditional approaches to in-service  education; and (4) form a model business and industry collaborative  providing leadership at every level of Center activities.  Other  cooperating organizations are Education Development Center (EDC);  the National Center for Research in Vocational Education; IBM,  NYNEX; and the Institute for Education and the Economy.  ***",
