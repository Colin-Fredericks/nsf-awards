 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407984  Nickrent       A diverse group of flowering plants, through the course of  their evolution, has become parasitic on other plants.  These  include the familiar Christmas mistletoe and sandalwood as well as  less familiar plants such as Rafflesia, known for producing the  largest blossom among all flowering plants (one meter in diameter).   Some plant parasites (so-called holoparasites) have lost their  ability to make nutrients via photosynthesis and must rely entirely  upon their host for nutrition.  Loss of photosynthesis has occurred  because genes required for this process that reside on the  chloroplast have been mutated or lost.  One goal of the project is  to determine which such genes are present or absent on the  chloroplast of several holoparasites.  Although chloroplast genes  have proven especially useful in resolving phylogenetic  relationships among many flowering plants, such genes may not be  present in the holoparasites.  For this reason, alternate nuclear  ribosomal genes are being analyzed and sequenced.  Preliminary data  show high rates of mutational change in ribosomal genes of several  parasites, indicating that these sources will prove useful in  examining genus and family level relationships.       Because ribosomal DNA is essential for protein synthesis, high  levels of mutational change in holoparasitic plants should provide  insight to structural and functional constraints on protein-related  physiologies in these plants.  As well, the nuclear DNA characters,  and where available the chloroplast data, will help answer  questions about the genealogical affinities of various parasitic  plants with reduced morphologies.",
