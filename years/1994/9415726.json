 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415726  Wen  Building design procedures in this country have been aiming at life  safety under a design earthquake of a given return period.  It is  basically a single-level design.  A valuable lesson learned from  recent earthquakes, in particular the Northridge earthquake, is  that damage and economical loss may be just as an important issue  as life safety.  Design for more than one level of earthquake has  been used in other countries of high seismicity such as Japan and  New Zealand in which serviceability and ultimate limit states are  explicitly considered.  The extensive data collected from the  Northridge and other recent earthquakes in Southern California  provide and opportunity for us to take a critical look at the  safety and performance of the current procedures versus alternative  bi-level procedures.  The research projects is under taken here  with the following specific objectives: (1) To evaluate and compare  the performance and safety of buildings designed in accordance with  the current and alternative procedures.  (2) To evaluate the long-  term risk implications of the above design procedures and develop  strategy implication of the above design procedures and develop  strategy for formulating more rational, risk-consistent code  procedures.      To achieve the above objectives the following tasks are necessary;  (i) Analysis of Northridge data to update, the seismic risk and the  site specific ground motion models used in current reliability  evaluation of structural performance in which dependence on seismic  source, path, and site characteristics is considered.  (ii) Design  of low-rise (under 12 stories) steel and reinforce concrete  buildings according to the 1991 UBC and alternative bi-level  procedures at selected sites in the Los Angeles area.  (iii)  Perform dynamic response analyses of the building and compare  response behaviors and response statistics of these two designs.   (iv) Perform long-term risk analysis of designs according to the  two procedures us ing the updated seismic risk and ground motion  models and compare risk implications.  (v) Identify advantages and  shortcomings of alternative versus current design procedures and  suggest areas for improvement in future codes.     The research conducted will provide insight to this important  problem which has a profound implication in research as well as  practice in US and abroad.      This is a Northridge Earthquake Project.",
