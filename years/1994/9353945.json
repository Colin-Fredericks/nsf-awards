The purpose of the two-week workshop is (a) to  provide participants up-to-date learning in the science of  hydrology, (b) to make available learning materials such that  each participant leaves with a water science teaching kit which  emphasizes first-hand learning in hydrology, (c) to acquaint  participants with the instructional potential of materials and  information available from the USGS-WRD including the  AWRA/Department of Interior Water Education Initiative, and (d)  to promote learning by pre-service teachers through  participant-conducted Water Resources Education Agent (WREA)  Workshops during the following Academic Year, with the  objective that pre-service teachers will multiply the effort by  themselves acting as WREAs.  A one-week follow-up workshop will  focus on evaluation, revision and further implementation of  WREA activities.  Presentation of the WREA experience and  educational materials and additional follow-up will take place  as part of the Thirty-First AWRA Conference in Houston in Fall  1995.  ***",
