The  symposium-workshop will be preceded by a two  week training course for sixteen young  researchers in relevant molecular biological  techniques, and other methodologies and  concepts.  This will help them participate in  the discussions of the symposium workshop  sessions.  The basic science sessions will  include: recombination and restriction  modification, molecular basis of genetic  transformation in bacteria, repair of UV  irradiated DNA in procaryotes, characterization  of UV repair genes in M. Luteus.  Applications  sessions will include: plant molecular biology  (crop improvement strategies, transformation of  certain crops, control of plant insects losses)  and human genome, and challenges of  therapeutics and diagnostics.     Scope:  This project involves some of the most  well known leaders in molecular biology in the  U.S. and Europe in an undertaking to enhance  this very important field in one of the world's  most heavily populated regions. Participants  will include some hundred scientists from  Pakistan, and from neighboring countries.  The  initial two week training, followed by the one  week symposium workshop provide for the  exchange of information, based on solid  foundation of understanding of the subject  matter.  Past meetings have led to research  collaboration between the U.S. and foreign  participants.  The topics of this meeting are  quite relevant to the needs and to the  capabilities of the participating south Asian  countries, and are also important to the United  States.  The project fits well with the INT  objectives.  ***",
