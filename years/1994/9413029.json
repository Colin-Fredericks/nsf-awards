As the paradigm of an  extracellular adhesin, fibronectin interactions with a  transmembrane receptor have proven applicable to a number of  cellular adhesion systems.  Many other extracellular  glycoproteins have been described with biological properties  similar to fibronectin, most of which have been sequenced  and some of which have known three dimensional structures.  These molecules are involved in a wide variety of basic  cellular functions in metazoans, of significance to such  areas of study as embryogenesis, tissue organization,  hemostasis, wound healing, immune functions, and  pathological states.  Proteins of this type have also been  discovered in higher plants, and their functions in plants  remains to be understood.  The challenges to the field over  the next several years are to comprehend and organize the  large amount of new structural information and design  experiments based on it, learn the relative biological  importance of the several seemingly redundant adhesion  systems in animal tissues, and apply the new insights to  practical ends.  The 1995 Gordon Research Conference will  serve as a valuable forum to present and discuss new  information, identify problem areas, and plan new  approaches. This grant provides partial support for expenses  of conferees with limited travel funds who would otherwise  not be able to attend, as well as applicants whose research  involves plants.  ***",
