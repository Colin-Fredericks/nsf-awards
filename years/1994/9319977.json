Analysis of these distortions offers  an exciting and powerful tool for understanding the large scale  distribution of matter and its velocity in the Universe.  Dr.  Hamilton has recently been developing new methods of measuring  these subtle distortions, and with this award he will continue this  work and pursue its various ramifications.  He has introduced the  idea of measuring redshift distortions from the harmonics of the  correlation function, and has suggested improved techniques to  allow these harmonics and their uncertainties to be measured  reliably from observations.  The study of redshift distortions on  large scales should become an increasingly important tool as  redshift surveys increase in depth and reliability.",
