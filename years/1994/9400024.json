 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continues research involving limit theorems for real and  vector valued random variables.  Problems related to the central  limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm motivated by  trimming and self-normalizations will be studied.  Limit sets for  random samples of processes, as well as coverage problems will be  examined.  A primary focus will be to further examine the link  between the small ball problem for Gaussian measures and metric  entropy problems.  Empirical processes and precise large  deviation probabilities will also be considered.    A central theme in probability, and throughout its diverse  applications to problems in engineering, physics, and statistics,  is the study of limit theorems for partial sums of independent  random variables in both finite and infinite dimensional  settings.  This research place emphasis on the infinite  dimensional situation and involves a blend of functional analysis  and probability theory.  Current work has fallen into several  different areas, and includes small ball and large deviation  probabilities for Gaussian measures, limit sets for random  samples and related coverage problems, and Gaussian chaos  applications to multiple Wiener-Ito stochastic integrals.",
