The principal  investigators are:  Harley Johansen of the University of Idaho;  Folke Snickars of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology; and  Inna Shteinbuka of the Latvian Ministry of Finance.  The  investigators propose to explore business development by  Scandinavian firms in the Baltic States and Russian Federation.   They will investigate patterns associated with the movement of  western firms into the region and with regional development and  processes. The project will start with a case study of a Finnish  oil company and their Baltic strategy for locating petrol  stations.  This will be followed by studies on Swedish and  Norwegian firms.      The project takes advantage of Scandinavian experience and  longstanding ties to the region and access to data and  information.  The Swedish investigator heads an important program  in regional sciences and economics and brings to this  collaboration his expertise and ties to the Latvian Ministry of  Finance and University of Latvia.  Investment in private  enterprise, especially in the form of joint ventures between  western companies and local partners, is a priority for Latvia  and the other Baltic States and Russian Federation. The project  will form a foundation for understanding the process and  geographic patterns associated with movement of western firms.   Its results will be useful to Baltic economists; to development  of market companies in the region; and to western companies who  have an interest in investing in the former Soviet Union.  ***",
