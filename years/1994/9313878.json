The  meeting will be held near Jena, in the eastern part of Germany, in  order to facilitate the participation of scientists from Eastern  Europe.  The objective of the workshop is to promote the exchange of  information and the initiation of international cooperative research  within the general area of non-stoichiometry in semiconductor  heterostructures.  Specific topics to be covered in the workshop  discussions include imaging and characterization, surface induced  ordering and stabilization of growth processes, and electrical  methods for detecting deviations from stoichiometry at  heterojunctions.  In addition, the participants will examine the  relation of the properties of heterostructures to the composition,  structure and stoichiometry of their interfacial regions.        This area of materials research is of considerable current interest  and potential applications to electronic materials.  Innovative  research being carried out in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet  Union was not particularly well known in the West.  While this  situation is changing, the intentional east-west character of this  small meeting should considerably increase the exposure of that work  and greatly facilitate the development of new collaborative links  among U.S., German and Eastern European experts in this important  area.  ***",
