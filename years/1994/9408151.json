 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wheeler         The investigator and her colleagues study scalable parallel  algorithms for the solution of the hydrodynamic flow and transport  equations.  The mathematical model is based on the generalized  wave-continuity equation for wave height, the non-conservative  form of the momentum equations for velocity, and the  advection-diffusion equation for transport.  The numerical  solution techniques are based on mixed and Galerkin finite element  methods.  For advection processes they study both characteristic  and higher-order Godunov methods.  These algorithms are  implemented on parallel platforms, including clusters of  workstations and massively parallel systems.  Domain decomposition  techniques are used to achieve parallelism.  Once the codes are  developed and validated, they are applied to bay and estuarine  modeling and modeling of storm surges along the Gulf of Mexico.       The objective of this research is to formulate, analyze and  implement accurate and efficient parallel algorithms for modeling  flow and transport in surface water environments.  The impetus for  this research is the need for state and federal agencies and  private industry to understand the effects of tides on coastal  regions and offshore structures, and to study the effects of  industrial and municipal development on bays and estuaries.  More  specifically, this work has applications in several areas,  including 1) calculating tidal ranges and surges caused by extreme  storm events such as hurricanes in order to plan development in  coastal areas and predict potential hazards from flooding; 2)  modeling tidal fluctuations for those interested in capturing  tidal energy for commercial purposes; 3) estimating forces on  offshore structures; 4) predicting influence of dredging of  intercoastal waterways or constructing breakwaters; 5) studying  effects of pollution on bays and estuaries, including possible  remediation strategies; and 6) allocating allowable discharges for  municipalities in order to meet spec ific water quality objectives.  The algorithms developed under this grant improve upon existing  algorithms by effectively using massively parallel computers to  increase resolution and reduce the computational time for a  simulation.  The code to be developed serves as paradigm for a new  generation of software that takes advantage of the trend in  high-performance computing toward massively parallel  architectures.",
