 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354023  Uno  This project intends to help prepare new instructors to teach  undergraduate biology courses at junior colleges, community  colleges, or four-year colleges.  Because graduates of research  institutions usually receive little training in biology  education or experience in developing their own course,  first-year faculty members often face a task for which they are  poorly trained.  This proposal outlines a two-year project  including: (a) four workshops presented at annual meetings of  professional biologists; and (b) the production, review, and  distribution of a handbook (based on the workshops) for  inexperienced instructors on developing and teaching  undergraduate biology courses.  The workshops will be led by  faculty experienced in: (a) teaching biology using inquiry  (Gordon Uno, Univ of Oklahoma); (b) assessment, critical  thinking skills, and cooperative learning (Leona Truchan,  Alverno College); and (c) open-ended biological computer  simulations (John Jungck, BioQUEST and Beloit College).  Workshops will: (a) introduce participants to contemporary  pedagogical strategies and concerns; (b) have participants  develop a syllabus for their biology course(s); and (c)  determine the content of the proposed handbook. The handbook  also will be based on questionnaires and selected parts of  Developing Biological Literacy, a biology curriculum framework  developed by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS).   The handbook will be distributed at annual meetings of a  variety of professional biological organizations.  ***",
