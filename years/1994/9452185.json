This course brings  together students who are majoring in chemistry and in physics and  has them explore the science and technologies of materials. The  laboratory exercises are designed to bridge the gap between  chemistry and physics by bringing out aspects of both disciplines  and having students synthesize their experiences by sharing their  backgrounds in both chemistry and physics.  Three new experiments  will be performed with equipment provided for this project, which  include two ultra-high vacuum stations and a scanning tunneling  microscope system. The experiments to be performed include a study  of the effects of oxygen plasma on polymer surfaces, vapor  deposition of metallic films, and a scanning tunnelling microscope  study of metal and semiconductor surfaces. Students will be taught  vacuum techniques, contact angle measurements, reflectance and  transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, and  scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.  This project will  also have an impact on other courses in the Chemistry and Physics  Programs and on student-faculty research.",
