 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320173  Clarke  Ms. Monica Casper, under the direction of Dr. Adele Clarke, is  investigating the historical emergence of experimental fetal  surgery.  Fetal surgery was considered as early as 1960 following  several successful non-surgical fetal treatments.  Research in the  1960's in New Zealand and Puerto Rico, in which surgical procedures  were used to treat fetuses for Rh incompatibility, paved the way  for subsequent experimental and clinical practices.  Fetal surgery  experienced a renaissance in the early 1980's when surgeons at the  University of California, San Francisco, began surgically operating  on fetuses in utero.    There has been very little historical or social research on  experimental fetal surgery.  Ms. Casper is examining the  historical, social and cultural roots of this practice, beginning  with biomedical research in the 1960's.  She is addressing three  related sets of questions.  First, what relationships have existed  among basic physiological research, technological developments, and  the emergence of experimental fetal surgery in the clinical domain,  and how have these been shaped historically?  Second, how are human  and non-human fetuses conceptualized, used, and treated materially  in contemporary scientific and biomedical practices? Third, what  are the social, cultural, and institutional dimensions of  contemporary experimental fetal surgery practices?  Under this  grant, Ms. Casper is undertaking archival research and interviews  in New Zealand and Puerto Rico focused on the experimental work of  the 1960's.  ***",
