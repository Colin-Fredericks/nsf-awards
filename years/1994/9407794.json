The intent is to broaden the NSF supported activities at Long  Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites through an extended  international network with sites in Eastern Europe, beginning  with Hungary.  Dr. Diana W. Freckman of Colorado State University  will serve as the U.S. principal investigator.  Her Hungarian  counterpart will be Dr. Edit Kovacs-Lang at the Institute of  Ecology and Botany of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.    Together they will organize a series of interactive visits. The  first will bring LTER scientists to Hungary to examine sites  which possess extensive biological surveys and long-term data  sets of species assemblages.  U.S. and Hungarian researchers will  discuss methods for collecting and organizing this wealth of  biodiversity data.  A second visit will bring Hungarian  counterparts to LTER sites to discuss methods of managing such  vast sources of long-term ecological data.  The final visit will  bring the U.S. and Hungarian participants together for a workshop  in Hungary to formulate plans for collaborative, long-term  research in biodiversity that will draw upon the strengths of  both communities.  Results are expected to build considerable  impetus for integrating biodiversity research with ongoing  research at LTER sites and to lead to a strengthened capacity for  international comparisons for study of global problems.    These developmental ecological exchanges fulfill the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
