At Southwestern, we teach formal  derivation of programs from specifications (as developed and  practiced by Edsger W. Dijkstra, David Gries, and others) as the  central organizing topic of our first-year courses in computing.   Program derivation provides the foundation for most of the  student's subsequent study.  To support the creation and revision  of lengthy programs and derivations, we propose to use a \"proof  editor\" for which we need workstation computers.  The proof editor  program will facilitate communication among students and among  faculty at a number of schools developing courses in program  derivation.  Availability of advanced workstations will also  enhance student's practical experience in several other courses.",
