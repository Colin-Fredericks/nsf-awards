 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450371  Abramson    The Metropolitan Detroit Alliance for Minority Participation has been formed to address the  issue of minority underrepresentation in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering (SEM).  The  Alliance represents a consortium of six Detroit area universities:  Wayne State University (the  lead institution), Lawrence Technological University, Madonna University, Oakland University,  University of Detroit Mercy, and University of Michigan - Dearborn.  The objective of the  Alliance is to increase the number of minority SEM graduates from these institutions from the  current level of 180 to 720 by 1999.  In addition, the Alliance will aim to place 150 of these  graduates in graduate programs.  The consortium has made a substantial commitment of  matching funds to assist in bringing these goals to fruition.    To create a region-wide environment of moral and financial support for attainment of these  objectives, the Alliance will expand to include the area's public schools, community colleges,  and business community.  Major foundations will be approached to further undergird the  Alliance.    A number of projects aimed at facilitating student passage along the critical points in the SEM  career pathway have been designed.  Summer institutions and workshops, concentrating on  science topics and improving math and study skills, will bridge the transition from high school  and community college to the university.  A program for parents will stress their critical  supportive role in their child's education.    Retention in the university will be enhanced by emphasizing cooperative learning approaches to  mathematics and science instruction, using upper-level and graduate students, as well as  scientists and engineering from industry, as mentors or tutors.  Dedicated counselors, scholarship  programs, and electronic bulletin boards will provide additional support mechanisms.    The Alliance will sponsor seminar programs, affording students the opportunity to present their  research exp eriences and to hear guest speakers.  An annual day-long symposium focusing on  career opportunities in SEM fields will be held.    Region-wide distribution of promotional literature describing project goals will aim at attracting  students to the program.  The Alliance will publish a newsletter, disseminating information on  activities within the Alliance, as well as AMP program news.    Evaluation for the Alliance program will focus on both outcome and process.  Outcome  evaluation will document progress toward attainment of objectives.  Process evaluation will  document program implementation.    The success of this project is heavily dependent on obtaining wide community support for its  goals.  As those goals are realized, institutionalization of the most successful aspects of the  project is anticipated to occur.  Progress towards institutionalization will be followed by the  Alliance's governing board, composed of the presidents of the six consortium members.  ***",
