These  activities will be undertaken by a team composed of members of the  Philadelphia School District, led by the Superintendent, PSD, and  two PDs, working with key stakeholders in the community, and in  partnership with the Franklin Institute.  Completion of the self-  study and the implementation of the USI plan will be accomplished  through the use of several task forces composed of District staff  and representatives of key stakeholders charged with these tasks.",
