 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds toward the purchase of a JEOL model                           JEM-1210 Transmission  Electron Microscope (TEM) equipped with a high resolution video camera,  a digital image  archiving system, and image processing software. Equipment that will  directly support the  operation of this TEM is also requested. This instrument will replace  an aging Philips 201  microscope currently housed in the Biology Microscopy Facility at the  University of Utah.  Although the Philips 201 TEM was a capable microscope in its day, it is  now 16 years old and  suffers from continual mechanical and electrical breakdowns. Components  are no longer  manufactured to support this instrument making it a challenge to keep  the microscope  operational. It is likely that the Philips 201 microscope will fail  permanently in the near future.      The requested TEM will have a dramatic impact on the research  programs of many faculty at the University of Utah. A minimum of  thirteen faculty in the Department of Biology alone are pursuing  research programs that focus on structure/function relationships at the  cellular or subcellular level. For example, the microscope will be used  by researchers in the Biology neuroscience group to 1) analyze  connectivity changes in C. elegans mutants defective in neurite  outgrowth, synaptic specificity or synapse formation, and 2) to study  the cellular contacts among developing neurons in grasshoppers and  flies. Other research groups in Biology will use the microscope in  immunogold-labeling studies to examine the structure and localization  of molecules involved in cell adhesion, neuronal differentiation,  neurotransmission, cytoskeletal function, cell division, development of  cell polarity and bacterial flagellar motility. In addition, a number  of investigators use a genetic approach to study the early development  of multicellular plants and animals. These investigators need a  transmission electron microscope to perform morphological analyses on  mut ants arrested in specific developmental stages. Many of the projects  listed above will require specialized features that are only available  on a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscope like the JEOL  JEM-1210. The research needs of our existing faculty, staff, and  students simply cannot be met by the antique Philips 201 microscope  currently available in the Biology Microscope Facility.      The University of Utah has committed 50% in matching funds toward the  purchase of a transmission electron microscope. This commitment  indicates the high degree of institutional priority for our request. In  addition, the Biology Department has guaranteed 1) full salary support  for the facility manager, Dr. Edward King, 2) 50% support for a full  time microscopy technician for two years, and 3) funds for a four year  service contract. Together, these contributions represent an  institutional commitment of greater than 50%.      The JEOL JEM-1210 will be part of a core facility used by faculty,  staff, graduate and undergraduate students in the Biology Department  and by researchers from other departments and colleges on the  University of Utah campus. The Biology Microscopy Facility already  maintains a heavily used laser scanning confocal microscope and a  scanning electron microscope. The addition of a modern transmission  electron microscope to the facility will enhance campus wide research  efforts addressing a variety of basic biological questions.",
