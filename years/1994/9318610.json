 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318610  Bramble    The project will investigate the complex interactions  between forces that result from locomotor activity and the  mechanics of the respiratory system in mammals.  Traditionally, mammalian locomotion and respiratory  physiology have been studied as discretely different  phenomena, but recently acquired evidence supports the view  that the chest of mammals has evolved to integrate these  activities, both structurally and functionally, in a manner  that previously has not been understood.  Bramble and  Jenkins (Science, 262:235-240) demonstrated that inertial  displacements of the abdominal viscera in trotting dogs  passively drive the diaphragm independent of diaphragmatic  contractions, which primarily serve to modulate visceral  motion.  Visceral displacements and the loading of the  anterior chest walls by the forelimbs are among the factors  producing asynchronous ventilation of the lungs and the  recycling of air between their lobes.  The present project  is designed to further explore these complex interactions,  specifically by documenting (in several mammalian species  that exhibit different locomotor styles) the  interrelationships of visceral and diaphragmatic kinematics  induced by different gaits and speeds, the activity of the  primary respiratory muscles, and the ventilation patterns  within the lungs.  The resultant data still substantially  contribute to a better understanding of the functional  design of the mammalian respiratory system.  ***",
