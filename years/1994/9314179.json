 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314179  WELLS    The controversy surrounding iron limitation of phytoplankton in the  open ocean and its potential role in regulating global climate,  both in the present and past, has highlighted how little is known  about the speciation and biological availability of iron in  seawater.  Several new methodologies have been developed recently  that improve our ability to measure total iron concentrations in  \"dissolved\" and particulate fractions of seawater, however, none  address specifically the speciation of iron or its availability to  phytoplankton.  There is a tremendous need to gather together  chemists with theoretical and analytical expertise in iron  chemistry and biologists with expertise in the algal physiological  aspects of iron to: 1) establish the current level of understanding  of iron chemistry and the algal uptake of iron, 2) identify the  specific needs and research goals.  A small international workshop  comprised of both young and senior scientists to address this need  will be convened.  The objective of the workshop will be to foster  cross-disciplinary debate and studies towards developing the  analytical tools needed to better define the role of iron in marine  biogeochemical cycles and in the global system.",
