 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406576       Seaman       This proposal to the Career Advancement Program       represents a redirection in the PI's research toward       the application of isotopic and rare earth element       analyses to problems involving the origin of magmas.       In the past she has focused on interaction between       magmas within plutons and volcanic terranes, and has       used textural relationships to evaluate mixing an       mingling of magmas as processes to produce       compositional diversity.  The use of isotopic data will       allow her to focus on larger scale, more tectonic       problems of mechanisms of melt genesis in extensional       and compressional settings and the physical means of       producing a magma chamber.  She intends to use isotopic       and rare earth element analyses for modelling igneous       systems and studying tectonic problems through magma       genesis well into the future.  The proposed research is       on the timing of Acadian magmatism and on the origin of       bimodal volcanic rocks of the coastal volcanic belt of       Maine.   These rocks provide an ideal research problem       for age and source material determination, and for rare       earth element analysis.  This work will use U-Pb dating       of zircons to date four volcanic successions of the       coastal Maine volcanic province and use Nd and Pb       isotopic analyses and ICP-MS analyses to complement       existing field work, and  major and trace element       analyses to constrain the origin of the materials       involved in the genesis of the magmas represented in       these successions.",
