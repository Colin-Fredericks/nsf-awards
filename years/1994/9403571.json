 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403571  Kumar  Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process, involving  hundreds of steps of processing.  Wafer return several times to  many tools, leading to a highly re-entrant process flow.  This  proposal addresses the problems of efficient operation, analysis  and design of plants.  The goal is to advance the state-of-the  art on two important fronts: (1) Optimization of Cycle-Time  Performance, and (2) Performance Evaluation of Semiconductor  Manufacturing Plants.  This proposal pursues an approach of  studying the constraints on the mean value of certain random  variables.  It develops a programmatic procedure for obtaining  performance bounds, and illustrates its application to various  fab models and scheduling policies.  This approach can be used to  establish the stability, i.e. performance recurrence, and even  the boundedness of moments, of the Markov chain underlying the  system.  The research proposed in this proposal is application  driven, and uses a variety of tools ranging from simulations,  heuristics, and software development, to theory.  The goal is to  advance the state of the art in scheduling semiconductor fabs, as  well as the theoretical foundation of the proposed approach.  ***",
