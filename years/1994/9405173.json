 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405173  Rusmore       One of the most for reaching tectonic problems of Northwestern  US geology is the discrepancy between contrasting paleogeographic  models suggested by paleomagnetic data (far traveled terranes) and  much geologic findings (more autochthonous terranes).  Similarly,  there are several structural elements in the Coast Mountains orogen  of western British Columbia and SE Alaska whose tectonic  significance is unclear.  This RUI project will address many of  thee issues through field work along the Douglas Channel.  British  Columbia that provides a natural cross-strike set of exposures.   The work will be directed towards answering structural questions  about the history of the Coast shear zone, the tectonic affinity  and structural getting of metamorphic rocks thought to be Nisling  terrane rocks and the relation of these rocks to Stikinia.  Results  will clarify many of the presently poorly known structural elements  in this area and will lead to resolving the question of whether  outboard terranes moved northward by more than 2500 km or if they  essentially are near where they formed.",
