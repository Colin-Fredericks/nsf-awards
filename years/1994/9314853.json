 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314853  Housner    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project between Professor George  Housner, California Universities for Research  in Earthquake Engineering (CUREe), and  Professor Yutaka Inoue, Department of  Architectural Engineering, Osaka University.   The award supports the travel of U.S.  scientists on the U.S. Panel on Structural  Control Research to Japan to meet with the  counterpart Japanese panel to plan, coordinate,  promote, and conduct research in the field of  monitoring and control of civil infrastructure  systems.  The joint efforts will also provide a  detailed research agenda that will be the  foundation for future U.S.-Japan cooperative  research projects.    The active control of seismic response of  structures can be described as a system to  modify from one instant to the next the dynamic  responses in buildings or civil structures  induced by an unknown external seismic  disturbance.  This is accomplished by providing  control forces to counteract the seismic  motions, or by changing the dynamic properties  of the structure so as to reduce the effect of  the ground shaking.  To achieve the foregoing,  the theory and analytical methods that will  form the basis of seismic control must be  established, and a comprehensive step-by-step  research program is necessary to examine  various methods and systems regarding  performance and practical application to  structures.  Direction and coordination of  research in this field in a key requirement for  an effective R&D program.  U.S.-Japan  cooperation in a continuing exchange of  information will lead to new developments and  directions for research.  ***",
