 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458046 Ringel  Research will be directed toward an improved  understanding of the electronic properties of dislocations in  lattice mismatched semiconductor heterostructures, their  relationship with dislocation microstructure, and an exploration of  methods to electrically passivate the deleterious nature of  dislocations.  The effects of impurities and extrinsic processes  such as those encountered for specific device applications, will be  considered in detail.  The focus is on three technologically  important semiconductor systems, III-V/Silicon,  Germanium-Silicon/Silicon and nitride based wide bandgap III-V  materials.  The proposed research incorporates a unique array of  complementary electronic, microstructural, and atomic resolution  measurement techniques, in addition to epitaxial growth and  processing facilities to perform the proposed studies.  This  research will make fundamental contributions to the materials  science of dislocations in semiconductor heterostructures from an  electronic perspective which, coupled with an improved  understanding of dislocation control, will have significant impact  on integration of lattice mismatched electronic materials for  advanced device applications. %%%%%% This research is expected to  provide improved fundamental understanding of the electronic  properties of defects resulting from the monolithic integration of  dissimilar semiconducting materials, and to investigate methods to  control the undesirable properties of these defects.  The results  will be of importance to the development of multi-functional  devices and integrated optoelectronics that consist of different  classes of materials integrated onto a common substrate. An  important feature of this research project is the training of  graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area of materials and processing  research.  ***",
