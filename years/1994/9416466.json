 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416466  Stanton  A number of reinforced concrete structures collapsed, either  partially or totally, in the Northridge earthquake.  Some of  the collapses were attributed to the failure of columns  which were designed for gravity loads only.  Many engineers  perform the evaluation in terms of the moment strength of  the columns.  This is an inappropriate approach because the  real issue is rotation capacity and not moment capacity.    The research undertaken here will investigate two aspects of  the issue.  The first is to develop analytical tools with  which to predict the story drift that a column can undergo  without failure.  The approach to be used is to construct  interaction diagrams relating axial force to curvature  capacity, rather than the conventional axial load to moment  capacity.  Curvature is related to rotation which in turn  can be used to predict story drift capacity.  The vertical  accelerations and the shear strength will be taken into  consideration in the analysis.    Innovative column details will be developed that will permit  larger inelastic rotations before failure.  One approach is  to detail all columns using the full seismic ties required  in the lateral load resisting part of the frame.  Other  details will be developed that depend on either providing  local flexibility at the column ends or on providing  localized confinement to prevent bursting and/or shear  failure.  These column details which will be simple,  economical, and easy to inspect and build will be  recommended.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
