The basic idea is that many analysis and design problems arising in engineering can be expressed in terms of convex optimization problems, which are mathematical problems of a special form.  While these problems can appear very difficult, they can be solved very efficiently by computer, using recently developed methods that exploit convexity.  This idea has recently been applied successfully to several problems in the field of automatic control systems, resulting in new theoretical advances as well as the development of practically useful computer-aided design tools.   Of course, not all problems arising in engineering are convex, and some methods developed for more general numerical optimization problems can be used to solve convex problems.  But the extraordinary potential increase in efficiency of the new interior-point methods over more general methods makes the concentration on convex problems worthwhile.   The research component involves the development of new and improved algorithms for the solution of the convex optimization problems that arise in engineering.  The project concentrates on methods that can exploit the underlying engineering structure in the problem, and hence solve even large-scale problems efficiently.  The research will involve not only the development and analysis of algorithms but also extensive numerical experimentation on real problems.  Preliminary experiments suggest the possibility of solving problems involving thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints in minutes on a workstation.   The curriculum development component involves the creation of a complete set of teaching materials   a conventional textbook as well as HTML hypertext material available via World-Wide Web   for a new course on convex optimization with engineering applications.  The course is aimed at senior under graduates and first year graduate students from all fields of engineering, and will concentrate on developing the background, experience, and skills required to recognize and exploit convexity in engineering applications.  The goal is that the course should eventually be adopted at every university with an advanced engineering program.  The ultimate goal is that convex optimization and the recently developed interior-point techniques for solving convex problems should make their way into the mainstream of numerical mathematics, and our main point into engineering practice.   The practical significance of a convex optimization-based solution to an engineering problem is the possibility of developing powerful computer-aided design and analysis tools for the engineering problem.  The development of such CAD tools and the training of students to develop such CAD tools is an obvious and substantial contribution to overall U.S. economic competitiveness.  ***",
