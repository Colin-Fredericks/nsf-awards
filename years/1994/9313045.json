This series of international meetings is the major  venue for presentation and dissemination or research on  Bayesian statistical methodology.  The Bayesian approach to  statistics has experienced astonishing growth in recent  years, driven in large part by its ability to solve  difficult applied statistical problems in science and  society in general.  Participation in this meeting is  crucial for researchers, especially young researchers, as  the pace of developments in the area substantially outstrips  the pace of publications.  By attending the meeting,  researchers will be able to acquire the latest Bayesian  techniques, and will have ample opportunity to obtain  feedback on their own work.  A portion of the grant will go  towards expenses of graduate students, since attendance at  the conference will greatly augment their statistical  education.",
