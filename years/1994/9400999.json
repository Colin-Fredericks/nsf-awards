The work focuses on complex  functions of a complex variables and the domains on which these  functions are defined.  The first set of problems concerns sets  of rational functions and the semigroups they determine via  composition.  These semigroups are natural extensions dynamical  systems derived from iterations of a single function.  The theory  leads to a great many dynamical, combinatorial and  algebraic questions and exhibits a rich structure  involving properties and dynamical behavior of the set of  normality and the Julia set. another reason for studying these  semigroups is that certain polynomial semigroups are closely  connected to moduli spaces of discrete Mobius groups.  The  dynamical systems point of view offers a new tool for studying  and understanding such moduli spaces.  A second line of  investigation involves the question of characterizing a  convergence group on the circle in terms of fixed points, as well  as with the problem of determining under what circumstances a  convergence group in the plane is topologically conjugate to a  Mobius group.  In dimensions two and higher, there are a  considerable number of convergence groups, not all of which are  conjugate to Mobius groups.  It is important that efforts be made  to determine the constraints necessary to guarantee that a group  have the same topological properties as a Mobius group.       Classical function theory has introduced geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than  first imagined.  The subject exploits the interplay between  geometric interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to  yield some of the most complete mathematical results in the  field of analysis. In this project, variational techniques and  geometric reasoning are expected to lead to results of valuable  physical significance.   ***",
