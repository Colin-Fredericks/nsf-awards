 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400778  Finn       This award supports mathematical research on capillarity  theory and geometrical questions for liquid bridges, for  (asymmetric) pendent liquid drops and for slowly rotating fluid  masses.  Exotic behavior for surfaces of curvature type in wedges  and proboscis domains and a-priori curvature estimates for  H-graphs will also be studied.  Some of these investigations are  to be conducted in connection with space experiments, in  cooperation with NASA and with the European Space Agency.  Others  relate to the joint Stanford-Lockheed Gravity-B experiment to use  orbiting gyroscopes in a test of the general relativity theory  and a Stanford experiment of the equivalence principle between  gravitational and inertial mass.  These studies will include  reference calculations, but the underlying substance of the work  will be mathematical.         The formal theory is being developed from a completely  rigorous point of view involving analysis of solutions of partial  differential equations from a geometric perspective.  The  resulting experiments can be regarded as precise tests of the  underlying physical hypotheses on which the mathematical  formalism is based.  The physical problems continue, in turn, to  suggest new mathematical questions.   ***",
