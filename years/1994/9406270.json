Since 1980, over 50,000 households in Zimbabwe have  been resettled in formerly white-owned farms and ranches, mainly  in semi-arid to arid environments. As witnessed during the last  prolonged drought period, resettlement households are  particularly vulnerable to recurrent food shortages.  Food  shortage coping strategies, as part of food security, are  dependent upon the interplay of complex linkages between society  and environment. This analysis is based on a regional political  ecology framework that facilitates the linkage of human and  environmental variables and views the environment as a dynamic  and interactive component of rural societies.  This project will  involve research in two field sites and in Harare with  collaboration of faculty and students at the University of  Zimbabwe. Comparative field work will be conducted in two  resettlement areas in differing environments, and in adjacent non-  resettlement areas, which will serve as control groups.  A survey  questionnaire will assess the role of human-environment  relationships in food storage coping strategies.  Survey results  will be combined with qualitative information gathered during one  year of field residence.       This study will contribute important new insights into the  understanding of food shortage coping strategies in the context  of resettlement lands and it will assess the efficacy of regional  political ecology as a research framework.  As a doctoral  dissertation research improvement award, this project will also  provide support to enable a promising student to establish a  strong independent research career.  ***",
