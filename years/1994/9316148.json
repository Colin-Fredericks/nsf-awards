Ziegler of Boston University  will extend previous studies of ultrafast dynamics in isolated  molecules to the condensed phase and clusters, so as to study  the effects of the embedding bath on processes in the excited  electronic state of the molecule.  Spontaneous Raman and  fluorescence light scattering techniques will be used to 1)  probe the time scales, amplitudes and motional character of  solvent/bath descriptions and to determine microscopic details  of how these degrees of freedom couple to electronic excita-  tions, and 2) how the bath interactions affect the photo-  chemical dynamics of the quasi-bound excited state photodisso-  ciation of these chromophores.  Well characterized molecules  embedded in clusters, solutions, and high pressure gases will  be investigated.  Resonance lineshapes, depolarization ratios,  and quantum yields will be measured to determine the  vibrational and rotational level dependent dephasing and  relaxation rates.    Chemical reactions usually require the elevation of molecules  to excited states of energy.  Since the chemistry of molecules  under conditions of high pressure, in solution, or embedded in  a solid matrix or in a cluster is affected by their  environment, it is important to know and understand these  changes in order improve the technology based on chemical  reactions.  The research undertaken in this project will  provide a data base and theoretical model for the reaction  kinetics and dynamics of well characterized molecules which are  embedded in a condensed phase medium.  ***",
