The project represents a  collaboration between NJIT, other universities, industry,  governmental laboratories and professional societies as evidenced  by supporting letters.  It will be interdisciplinary effort  involving professors from Chemical Engineering, Mechanical  Engineering and Mathematics, undergraduate and graduate students,  as well as industrial and governmental experts in the field.   The courses in particulate flows can be adapted at other  universities.  Course notes, lab manuals, user-friendly  simulations, video tapes of experiments and computer animations  will be developed and disseminated.  The courses will incorporate  into the undergraduate engineering curriculum the current research  of the PI's and their colleagues.  It is estimated that 30  undergraduates yearly will complete at least one of the two course  sequence.  The incorporation of some of the experiments of the  laboratory course into the standard laboratory courses will impact  as many as 250 undergraduates at NJIT per year.",
