 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404440  Schmidt    Under the assumptions of the magnetohydrodynamic (or MHD)  approximation, the motion of a viscous, incompressible,  electrically conducting fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes  equations coupled to Maxwell's equations for the magnetic field.   The latter will in general transcend the region of conducting  fluid and, ideally, extend to all of space.  Typically, both the  interior and exterior magnetic fields must be determined and  suitably matched at the interface separating the fluid from the  solid material or vacuum outside.  Most prior mathematical work  has been concerned with special situations where boundary  conditions for the magnetic field (or related quantities) are  given on the surface of the fluid region and the exterior field  can be disregarded.  In the general case, little is known beyond  basic existence and uniqueness results.  Even if the problem can  be shown to be analytically well-posed, formidable difficulties  occur when trying to numerically approximate the solution.  Major  drawbacks include the unbounded support of the magnetic field and  the fact that it exhibits jump discontinuities across interfaces  separating media with different magnetic properties.  It is the  goal of the proposed research to develop general analytical and  numerical methods tailored for the rigorous treatment of  increasingly complex problems of this kind, in stationary as well  as time-dependent situations.  The numerical and computational  feasibility of the approach will be investigated and compared to  that of alternative procedures.  It will then be studied to what  extent the approach carries over to more complex situations  featuring many magnetically different media and nonsmooth  geometries.  At later stages, some extended models of MHD will be  considered, including non-Newtonian fluids, Hall current plasmas,  and thermally coupled flows.  Another long-term goal is the  analytical and numerical investigation of MHD problems involving  free boundaries.    Magnet ohydrodynamics (or MHD) is the theory of the macroscopic  interaction of electrically conducting fluids with a magnetic  field.  It is of importance in connection with many engineering  problems, such as sustained plasma confinement for controlled  thermonuclear fusion, liquid-metal cooling of nuclear reactors,  and electromagnetic casting of metals.  It also finds  applications in geophysics and astronomy, where prominent  examples are the so-called dynamo problem, that is, the question  of the origin of the Earth's magnetic field in its liquid metal  core, and the equilibrium and stability of magnetic stars in  their own gravitational fields.  The difficulties addressed by  this research are most pronounced in models describing typical  applications in engineering, such as the magnetic shaping of  liquid metals or induction manufacturing of specialized  materials, where one encounters fairly complicated geometries  with several conducting fluids and current-carrying solid  conductors interacting at a distance via the universal magnetic  field.",
