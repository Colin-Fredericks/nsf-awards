The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique  or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. Christopher M. Miller of Lehigh University to visit  Professor Robert G. Gilbert at the University of Sydney on  mechanisms controlling miniemulsion polymerization.    The project will apply the knowledge and experimental techniques  of the University of Sydney and Lehigh to understand the  fundamental science of processes governing polymer formation, and  properties of the resulting polymer in miniemulsion systems.  The  knowledge gained will open the way for design and innovation  using the process in the future.    The first part of the project will be to build into previously  existing models for miniemulsion kinetics the new discoveries  that were reported by the Sydney group.  Their theories concern  the mechanisms for radical entry into polymer particles, detailed  predictions of the fate of desorbed monomeric radicals, and a  description of the time evolution of particle growth during the  polymerization.  The outcome of these will will be computer codes  whose predictions should be consistent with the extensive data  for archetypical miniemulsion polymerizations compiled by the Dr.  Miller during the course of his doctoral studies.  On of the main  goals of this work is to understand the mechanisms governing  radical entry into monomer droplets and polymer particles, since  these have shown to be different.  The second part of the project  will be to use the Y radiolysis relaxation facilities available  to the Sydney group.      ***",
