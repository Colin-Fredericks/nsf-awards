 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411536  Jansen       The use of DNA data in studying the phylogenetic or  genealogical relationships among organisms has increased  dramatically over the last few years.  For most plant groups, the  focus, for several methodological reasons, has been upon organellar  DNA from the leaf chloroplast.  Consequently, a major question is  posed concerning whether mutational differences in chloroplast DNA  are strongly correlated with mutational differences between plant  species in their nuclear DNA, which is usually more difficult to  analyze.  Graduate student Dennis Loockerman, under the supervision  of faculty adviser Robert Jansen at the University of Texas, is  addressing this question in his study of a large group of sunflower  relatives, the Tageteae.  He will be analyzing large amounts of  data from both chloroplast and nuclear DNA sets, comparing patterns  of mutational differences among species, and reconstructing  phylogenetic trees for this group of flowering plants.  Results  from the molecular studies will be integrated with traditional  morphological characters, to improve classification of these plants  and designate reliable identification features.       Analysis of DNA data from both organellar and nuclear sources  in a large group of sunflower relatives, the Tageteae, and  integration with morphological characters, will improve taxonomic  and phylogenetic understanding of these plants.",
