 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lindenberg         This award supports the renovation of space, about 15,444 square feet, used  for chemistry research at the University of California at San Diego.  The renovation  project proposed will allow the collection (into one building) of support facilities  for  chemistry which are now scattered across the campus.  Such a project will: foster  collaborative research efforts that now are impossible in scattered spaces; promote  improved access and training for students and postdoctoral fellows; improve efficiency  of research and support staff; bring all spaces involved into conformance with modern  safety and ADA access codes; and permit better sharing of instruments and repair and  maintenance staff.  This facilities modernization project will enhance a computational  facility for research and training in chemistry.  It will house the NMR  and X-ray  facilities for large and small molecules as well as the laser facility.  Finally, it will  house the glass and electronics shops that support chemistry research.  This project  will impact about 40 faculty, 150 chemistry graduate students, and about 60  postdoctoral and visiting researchers.  This project will have a major impact on the  efficiency of research at this university and will influence research on chemical  materials that are important to the nation.",
