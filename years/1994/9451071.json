 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451071  Sherwin                              The Physics Learning Center (PLC) at the University of California,  Santa Barbara is a facility in the physics building that functions  as an interactive science museum. We propose to equip the PLC as a  site for holding microcomputer-based laboratory sessions, or  \"discovery sessions,\" for the introductory physics course for  non-science majors. This course, which has heretofore had no  laboratory component, will be restructured to emphasize the  applications and utility of physics. The \"discovery sessions\" are  intended both to increase the general scientific literacy of  non-science majors and to give them an understanding of the  scientific process. Students in the \"discovery sessions\" will  collect and analyze time-series data using the Universal Lab  Interface (ULI), and video data using camcorders and the VideoLab  software for digitized video. New, fast microcomputers will be  acquired for this purpose. Multiple setups of several selected  apparati will be obtained for use in the \"discovery sessions,\" as  will single copies of certain apparati, such as a fast  oscilloscope, which are suitable for a variety of different uses.  The apparatus and microcomputers added to the PLC under this  proposal will also be used by students in other lower- and  upper-division physics courses for individual exploration and for  carrying out computer-based homework assignments. In addition, the  microcomputers will be used by astronomy students for exercises in  astronomical image processing. All apparatus will be available to  local K-12 educators through outreach programs. The UCSB College of  Letters and Science has made a commitment to provide funds to match  the NSF contribution to this proposal. The Department of Physics  has pledged release time from teaching for Dr. Sherwin for the 1994  Fall quarter, and will provide a teaching assistant to help in the  development of materials.",
