 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to create a novel predoctoral training program at the  interface of Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Cornell  University.  While this interface has been crowded lately with  \"fuzzy-engineering\" approaches typically identified as Artificial  Intelligence (common-sense reasoning, neural nets, etc.), we plan  to focus, instead, on \"formal-scientific\" aspects, including the  formal modeling of computational and inference processes, computer-  human interface and computer science education studies, vision and  robotics, learning theory, and intelligent information retrieval.   We argue that         1.  both disciplines, Computer Science and Cognitive Science,            will benefit from such a program,              and         2.  Cornell is uniquely suited to accommodate such a program.    Indeed, we hope that the proposed program would serve as a model of  how and engineering field and a liberal-arts field can leverage  each other and ultimately lead to both (1) engineering artifices  that pay more  attention to the human user and (2) a better formal  understanding of human thought process    The proposal is organized in four parts.  First, we present several  con=crete and promising research directions.  Each module is  concrete in that at least one current doctoral student or faculty  member is interested in pursuing the topic; each module is  promising in that progress will depend on and advance both  participating disciplines.  Second, we briefly portray the current  infrastructure at Cornell and we present the structure of the  proposed program.  Third, we present a plan for recruiting and,  fourth, we justify the need for funding.",
