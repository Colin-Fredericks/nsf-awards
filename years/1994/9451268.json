The exercises  will enable students both to learn laboratory skills and to design  independent research projects.  The Institute for Science Education  and Science Communication has a well established history of  training individuals in the media communication and teaching  professions. A significant proportion of these students are  minorities and women. The Institute for Science Education and  Science Communication sees as its mission the ongoing education of  the public in science through the education of Columbia College  communications and teaching degree program students. Students are  encouraged to incorporate their major fields of study, personal  interests, hobbies and cultural  backgrounds along with the use of state-of-the-art analytical  instrumentation in projects that may take the form of Paintings,  films, videos, dances, theatrical performances, poems, photoessays  or even sculptures.",
