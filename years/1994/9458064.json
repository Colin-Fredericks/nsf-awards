 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to  bring together   expertise in  geometrical modeling, numerical analysis, large scale   computing,  and scientific  visualization applied to problems in medicine---computational   interactively investigate  bioelectric fields and provide the   ability to design  bioelectric devices.  Every year, 500,000 people die suddenly    due to  abnormalities in their heart's electrical system (cardiac    arrhythmias) and/or  coronary artery disease.  Traditional  electrograms (ECGs)   show damage that  already has occurred in the  heart; consequently physicians   currently treat many  life-  threatening disorders of the heart's rhythm after they   occur.  This  project seeks to equip physicians with a noninvasive and    accurate means of  determining the changes within the heart's  electrical system   that signal the  onset of disease much earlier  and allow them to treat the   disease prior to  significant damage  to the heart.    To accommodate efficient   design and  optimization, a  computational steering package is developed   which   allows the user to design bioelectric devices and measure   their  effectiveness in  an interactive graphical environment.  Using  interactive   graphical input  devices, engineers are able to  design devices, place them   directly into the  computer model, and  automatically change parameters and   boundary conditions as  well  as the mesh discretization level needed for an accurate   finite  element  solution.  Instead of the typical simulation mode --    manually setting input  parameters, computing results, storing  data off to disk,   visualizing the  results via a separate  visualization package, then starting   again at the  beginning --  software is developed to ``close the loop'' and   allow the  visualization to help guide (steer) the design and   computation  phases of the  simulation.  Not only are specific results on  bioelectric   field problems  significant, but this general approach  is applicable to many   other engineering  and scientific problems,  and the computational   infrastructure developed  is broadly useful to many other researchers.",
