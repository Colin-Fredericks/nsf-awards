Dr. Higgins received his  doctoral degree from the University of Wisconsin/Madison under  the supervision of Professor Robert Corn. Dr. Higgins will  continue research at the University of Minnesota under the  sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara. His postdoctoral  research will couple the use of time-resolved spectroscopic  methods with near-field scanning optical microscopy to  investigate the effects of different microscopic domains  present on semiconductor electrode surfaces.  Longer term, he  will apply near-field scanning optical microscopy to the  in-situ study of the photo-electrochemical reactivity of  microscopic crystalline domains on the surface of n-doped  polycrystalline titanium dioxide.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***",
