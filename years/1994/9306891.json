Dr. Thomas Croat of the Missouri Botanical Garden, a  specialist on the aroid or philodendron family, is studying the  neotropical genus Dieffenbachia in Mexico and Central America, with  an estimated 30-35 species, in preparation for a taxonomic  monograph of the group.  The genus includes the second most  important species of ornamental plant in terms of commercial sales  in the U.S.; however, relationships among species, sources of  germplasm for breeding, geographical ranges, and aspects of  pollination and dispersal biology and possible hybridization are  poorly known.  Descriptive information about the plants, taken from  living material and herbarium specimens, is entered in a computer  database, which eventually will be accessible over the Internet to  interested researchers and students.  The research will lead to  improved diagnosis of each species, a preliminary account of  phylogenetic relationships, mapping of geographic ranges, notes on  flowering and fruiting phenology and other aspects of ecology, and  identification keys for reliable assignment of scientific names.       The inventory of plant diversity in the tropics remains an  ongoing endeavor by a small group of devoted taxonomic specialists.   The collections they create, both herbarium specimens and living  material in botanical gardens, and the published information and,  now, computerized records, become resources for wise use and  stewardship.",
