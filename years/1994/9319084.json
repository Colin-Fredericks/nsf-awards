Chemically  designed icosahedral and decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, as well  as crystalline alloys of high structural quality and thermal  stability, will be synthesized and measured in order to evaluate  the effects of quasiperiodicity and strength of atomic potential on  the electronic and optical properties.  Experiments to be performed  include magneto-transport, heat capacity, thermopower, optical  conductivity, NMR, x-ray spectroscopy, and neutron scattering.   Several of these studies will be performed jointly with other  groups.  Other goals of the study will be to understand the bandgap  and nature of localized and itinerant states in these novel  metallic alloys, as well as to explore possible new electronic and  magnetic phenomena in these materials.  %%%  The electronic alloys to be studied are new and unusual in the  sense that they are semiconductors and insulators composed entirely  of elemental metals, in contrast to the traditionally studied  covalent or ionic non-metals such as silicon and gallium arsenide.   Some of these materials have structures not describable by text-  book crystallography; the atoms in these solids order in a \"quasi-  periodic fashion, hence the name quasi-crystal.  Because of their  quasi-crystallinity, a number of novel physical properties have  been predicted and these will be investigated in this proposal.   Current commercial applications of quasicrystalline materials are  where materials are required which have low sticking coefficients,  have a high thermal stability and have low surface sticking  coefficients.  ***",
