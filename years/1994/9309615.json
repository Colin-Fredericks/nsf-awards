 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed support for the semi-annual                         Universities' Research Conference (URC) in Cambridge,                           Massachusetts.  This conference series provides the occasion for                formal and informal discussions for researchers who otherwise                   might have little opportunity to interact with other specialists                in their fields.  A special emphasis is placed on involving less                established scholars, women and minorities.  Conference topics                  are chosen for their relevance to current economic policy                       discussions as well as their interest to academic economists.                   Recent conferences have focused on economics of the environment,                labor markets and financial institutions and instability.  The                  spring 1993 meeting will focus on cooperation, coordination and                 collusion among firms.  Papers for presentation at the                          conferences are solicited from over 70 economics departments and                50 business schools.  Conference organizers are careful to select               a mix of established and less well known researchers.  Special                  emphasis is also placed on including women and minorities.                      Discussants and other conference participants are also chosen to                encourage interaction among economists with similar interests at                different universities.  A typical conference includes 7 to 10                  papers and about 80 participants from 40 different universities.",
