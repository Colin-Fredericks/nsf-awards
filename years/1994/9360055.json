During Phase I, the intensive care   patient monitoring system will be reviewed and analyzed in terms of   human tasks and equipment monitoring functions and with respect to   the equipment setup process, calibration and initialization of   monitoring.  A functional analysis of the overall patient care   monitoring system will be performed to identify the needed   ergonomic design improvements.  These activities will be done in  collaboration with hospital doctors and nurses who operate the  equipment regularly.       Ergonomic problems that result in human errors or excessive  response time, whether in operating specific equipment or in  management of the hospital patient monitoring systems, will be  identified, classified, and prioritized.  Overall recommendations  regarding design changes and providing tools for human factor  reviews and improvements will be made.",
