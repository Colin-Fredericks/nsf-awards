Geographic information systems (GIS), with their  capabilities for spatial analysis and modeling of diverse  datasets, provide a means of understanding and dealing with  issues such as biodiversity, habitat fragmentation, effects  of climate change, soil erosion, water quality, and impacts  of urbanization, to name only a few of many resource and  environmental issues that have a spatial dimension. GIS  provides a means to organize and analyze the myriad of  spatial data associated with these problems.       GIS has become an important tool for scientific research,  as well as resource management, and it has become an  essential research tool for many faculty and graduate  students on the St. Paul Campus of the University of  Minnesota. Presently, there is GIS activity and varying  degrees of capability in six departments in the Colleges of  Agriculture, Biological Sciences, and Natural Resources. A  growing number of faculty and graduate students are making  increased use of our current facilities for GIS and image  processing. The present facilities, which reside in  individual and departmental laboratories, range from  beginning level to advanced; but all need access to more and  better facilities than are now available or affordable from  individual departments and research grants. The technologies  of GIS and related areas are advancing very rapidly.  Equipment that was state-of-the-art several years ago is  rapidly becoming obsolete. At the same time the scale of the  problems being addressed, and therefore the volume of needed  data, is rapidly growing and overwhelming the capacity of  our present computer  systems.       This proposal is to develop and link state-of-the-art  facilities for spatial analysis and modeling of natural  resources and environment in six departments on the St. Paul  campus. A distributed system linked by network among the  various departments is recommended. We would maintain  facilities within our individual departments, but centrally  manage the operating system, major software and databases,  and selected peripherals. Concurrently we would add expanded  and enhanced hardware-software to our campus capability.       The equipment requested in this grant proposal would  improve the productivity of our faculty and graduate  students by: (a) expanding the range and depth of analysis  and modeling capabilities available for research  applications, (b) increasing access to GIs capability for  faculty and student researchers, as well as advanced  graduate-level courses which incorporate spatial analysis  approaches, by providing additional workstation terminals,  (c) enabling us to work on landscape to regional scale  issues and problems that require the analysis of large  volumes of soil, terrain, and vegetation data, (d)  consolidating GIS hardware and software costs and management  tasks that are currently being replicated by several  research groups on the St. Paul campus will enable us to  devote more resources to analysis, (e) alleviating current  data storage and access problems by providing additional  magnetic disk and read/write optical devices, and (f)  providing capability for high quality output that is  currently not available.       Additionally, we believe this project will bring together  researchers from several disciplines to use spatial analysis  techniques and that it will foster interdisciplinary  approaches to research problems by standardizing certain  aspects of our GIS operations and facilitating sharing of  data and analytical techniques. Preparation of this proposal  has already served to bring together the various researchers  from several discip lines with both existing and potential  capability to use GIS technology in their research    4",
