Columbia University  Title: The Affect of Altered Ocean Heat Transports on Climate:          Feedback Potential During Periods of Atmospheric Trace Gas          Increase    The objective of this project is to investigate the decadal to  century-scale affects of ocean heat transports in numerical climate  change simulations.  The project uses the Goddard Institute for  Space Studies atmospheric general circulation model, coupled to an  ocean model that includes meridional transport of heat by the  oceans, to test directly whether changes in ocean heat transport  could enhance or ameliorate the effects of trace-gas-induced global  warming.  The project is designed as a three year, two phase study:   In the first phase, surface heat flux diagnostics from GCM  experiments will be used to calculate the potential ocean heat  transport associated with historical (20th century) anomalies in  sea surface temperatures and sea ice extent.  The SST and sea ice  anomalies will be acquired from the most comprehensive data sets  available including: COADS, Navy/NOAA, Walsh, ESMR, SMMR, and  SMM/I, all of which are currently in-house.  In addition, ocean  heat transports will be calculated from GCM simulations and proxy  data from the Little Ice Age (ca. 1700 AD) and Last Glacial Maximum  (ca. 18-2lky BP) in order to obtain larger variations of heat  fluxes that may be closer to the potential variability of the  system.  The second phase of the project focuses on simulations of  the climatic effects of altered ocean heat transports in  conjunction with transient trace gas increase scenarios.  Ten 100-  year simulations are planned in which the ocean heat values,  calculated in phase one, will be used to perturb the normal pattern  of climate change associated with the atmospheric trace gas  increase.  The simulations in phase two will take approximately two  years to complete, based on estimates of the current comput ational  efficiency of the GISS 4ox5o GCM running on IBM RS/6000-580  workstation.  Individual transient experiments will be completed  and analyzed at the rate of one every three months.    The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns of  climate change that are associated with variability in the  air/sea/ice system and to estimate the potential ocean energy  feedbacks that may accompany climate changes induced by atmospheric  trace gas increase.  Fingerprinting of such climate patterns will  improve our ability to detect the signs of ocean-induced climate  change and can improve our ability to distinguish between natural  variability and anthropogenic climate change.  Furthermore, it will  provide us with a quantitative assessment of the oceans ability,  through energy transport feedbacks, to alter the climate  sensitivity and GCM predictions of future climate change.  In lieu  of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice models, which are unlikely to  reach a reliable predictive capacity in the near future, these  experiments provide the realistic alternative for gauging the  ability of the oceans to alter GCM future climate diagnoses.      This project is funded under the USGCRP NSF Climate Modeling,  Analysis and Prediction program.",
