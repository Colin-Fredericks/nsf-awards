The  specific problems to be studied include dissipative quantum  tunneling of single defects in disordered metals, modulation of  microscopic defect properties by externally applied electric and  strain fields, and the role of mesoscopic superconductors in  enhancing electronic quantum phase coherence.  Measurements of 1/f  noise in larger samples complement the mesoscopic measurements by  providing statistical information about defects in disordered  systems.    Non-technical abstract:  This proposal focuses on two areas of  study related to disordered metals.  The first is the study of  individual, atomic defects.  By carefully measuring the electrical  conductance of sub micrometer samples, one can detect the motion of  a single atom within the sample.  This type of study reveals  details about individual defects that are not obtainable from  studies of larger samples.  The second area of study is the  quantum-mechanical behavior of electrons in metals at low  temperature.  Due to their wave-like nature, electrons in metals  exhibit interference.  In sub micrometer samples of normal and  superconducting materials, this interference leads to a number of  new, intriguing electrical properties.  These effects can have  potential impact on the development of future mesoscopic devices.  ***",
