The Hawaiian and Pacific Special Collections of  Hamilton Library in the University of Hawaii contain a vast  collection of materials, both published and unpublished,  including microfilmed copies of most of the many journals and  newspapers, also in several languages, published in Hawaii since  the mid-nineteenth century: this unrivalled database has been  barely touched by researchers. The project will search and (where  necessary) translate these materials with the goal of compiling  an annotated bibliography of all references to language contact  in this literature and all citations of utterances used in  contact situations. The citations will be analyzed linguistically  to determine to what extent modes of communication represent  unstable jargon(s) and whether any could be described as stable  pidgins. Materials so far sampled indicate that a radical version  of the role of Hawaiian (and perhaps other indigenous contact  languages) in language contact will result from this research,  challenging received opinion which gives English the major role  in Hawaii contacts and an almost exclusive role in Pacific  contacts.  Valuable light will also be cast on the nature of the  input that gave rise to Hawaiian Creole English.",
