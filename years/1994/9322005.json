 "awd_abstract_narration": "A physics research program for nine undergraduate students  is planned at University of California, Irvine each summer  for the next three years.  The program involves projects  with a variety of physics research groups under close  supervision by faculty and senior research staff.  Research  opportunities are offered in the areas of experimental  elementary particle physics, condensed matter, plasma  physics, and astrophysics.  Close contact between student  participants, encouraging the sharing of research  experiences in these varied areas, is promoted by providing  shared housing, and through social activities.  The research  experience is further enhanced through a seminar series,  visits to the labs of fellow participants, and excursions to  other research labs in the Los Angeles area.  The program is administered by the co-principal  investigator, a woman who has involved undergraduates  extensively in her own research leading to numerous papers  including undergraduate authors.  With the assistance of the  project PI, this administrator arranges publicity,  recruitment, orientation, seminars, excursions, a postsummer  follow-up program, and generally works to insure a valuable  research experience for students in the program.  ***",
