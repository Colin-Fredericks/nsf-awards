 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410579  Glanzman    The goal of this project is to explain the mechanisms of  learning and memory in an invertebrate animal, the sea slug  Aplysia.  The sensory and motor neurons which mediate  certain simple defensive withdrawal reflexes of Aplysia can  be removed from the animal's nervous system and grown in  cell culture; here they will reform their original  connections (called synapses).  These synapses in cell  culture are ideal for analyses of the mechanisms of learning-  related changes in the strength of the synapses.  Recently,  these researchers found that the synapses formed between  Aplysia sensory and motor neurons in culture exhibit a long-  term change similar to that which occurs at synapses in the  vertebrate nervous system and which is thought to mediate  associative learning.  This synaptic change is known as  \"long-term potentiation\" (LTP).  This project will analyze  the cellular mechanisms of LTP in the Aplysia synapses in  cell culture and determine whether LTP of sensorimotor  synapses mediates classical conditioning of Aplysia's  withdrawal reflex in the whole animal.  The hope is that an  understanding of how the relatively simple nervous system of  Aplysia mediates learning will help advance our  understanding of how the far more complex nervous systems of  mammals mediate more sophisticated forms of learning and  memory.",
