In addition, plants are a rich source of isoprenoids  important for pharmaceutical uses.  Yet, our understanding of the  isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants is limited.  Recent  studies indicate that tobacco cell suspension cultures are uniquely  suited for detailed physiological and biochemical studies of one  important but putative branch point in isoprenoid metabolism.  When  fungal elicitors are added to the cell cultures, the cultures cease  sterol production and instead synthesize and secrete anti-microbial  sesquiterpenoids.  The decline in sterol biosynthesis has been  correlated with suppression of squalene synthetase enzyme activity,  and the induction of sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis with the  induction of a sesquiterpene cyclase.  Because these two enzymes  are positioned at a putative branch point in the pathway, the  induction of one enzyme and the suppression of the other are  interpreted as an important regulatory mechanism controlling carbon  flow and hence, end product formation.  Alternatively,  independently regulated arrays of isozymes dedicated to the  production of specific end products might be aligned along a  surface or membrane.  Regardless of which metabolic organization  might be occurring within a plant cell, squalene synthetase and  sesquiterpene cyclase are key enzymes for sterol and sesquiterpene  biosynthesis.  The long range goal of this research is to  understand all aspects of these two enzymes, from a complete  understanding of their enzymology to the fine details of how  expression of the corresponding genes are regulated.  The current  objectives are to continue defining the DNA sequences and DNA  binding proteins important for controlling the transcription rate  of the cyclase and squalene synthetase genes, and to begin an  analysis of the cyclase reaction mechanism using a combination of   comparative molecular biology and an evaluation of chimeric cyclase  genes expressed in bacteria.  Results from these studies will help  elucidate the mechanisms regulating isoprenoid metabolism in  plants, and will have important ramifications for future  manipulations of this pathway using genetic engineering technology.  ***",
