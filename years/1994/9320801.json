 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320801  Proctor  This project addresses the ethics of recent human-induced  environmental change, considering Pacific Northwest Forests as a  case study.  The research focusses on the underlying ethics  informing public opinions on old-growth forest management in the  Pacific Northwest.  Though the range of recent public attitudes  and values toward old-growth forests has been fairly well  documented, little detailed work has been done to explore the  specific ethical presuppositions of these attitudes and values,  and to derive implications regarding public support for, or  criticism of, practices responsible for environmental change in  Pacific Northwest forests.  In this study, public attitudes  regarding old-growth forest management will be viewed as  surrogates for positions taken on recent and near-future  environmental change in Pacific Northwest forests.  These  attitudes will be analyzed to determine their delineating ethical  features, major forms of ethical justification, and resultant  approach to moral judgment in terms of balancing ecological and  socioeconomic concerns.  The primary source of data for this  project is the administrative record, and its accompanying  database, of public comments received for a recent Draft  Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Pacific Northwest  old-growth forest management, residing in Portland, Oregon.   Individuals submitted comments which will be analyzed following a  two-by-three matrix of subcategories.  The matrix will be divided  according to location of residence and position with respect to  Option 9, the Clinton administration's preferred management  alternative.  Data analysis involves (a) search, sort, and simple  statistical operations using all appropriate records on the  existing database, and (b) more detailed content analysis using a  random sample of roughly 50-100 records from each subcategory.   Results will be compared across subcategories in order to draw  implications regarding the relationship between major syste ms of  ethics suggested in the analysis and recent and near-future  human-induced environmental change involving pacific Northwest  forests.  Results will be disseminated through presentations and  articles, and yield valuable insight into future research needed  in this significant area.    ***",
