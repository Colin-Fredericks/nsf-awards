 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452398  Brem  We propose establishment of an analytical geochemistry facility  in the Department of Geological Sciences to be used in required  and independent-study courses. Current analytical equipment  cannot be used because it requires time-intensive methodologies  unusable within the constraints of laboratory courses, includes  irreparable items, and cannot analyze samples for a broad range  of elements or in aqueous media. Our request consists of: (1)  equipment for rapid and contamination-free sample preparation and  (2) an ICP spectrometer capable of analyzing a broad range of  major and trace elements in different types of media. The  equipment is essential for use in the required Geochemistry (GEOL  4O6), the required Senior Thesis Research (GEOL 498) and the  elective Water Quality Investigations and Control (GEOL 437)  courses. The equipment will greatly improve the undergraduate  program and will allow us to meet the following goals: to  increase students' ability to quantify geologic problems rather  than relying solely on traditional qualitative and descriptive  methodologies, to reinforce students' comprehension of basic  scientific concepts by problem solving, to increase students  comprehension of uncertainty and error present in all geochemical  data and, finally, to encourage student interest in graduate  education resulting from positive, research-based experiences at  the undergraduate level.",
