 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361116  Koh  Microorganisms are primarily responsible for the degradation of  toxic chemicals that enter the environment.  Successful isolation  and exploitation of these microbes for bioremediation requires  identifying the physico-chemical conditions under which  detoxification activity is maximized.  This work proposes to  develop an analytical diffusion gradient chamber that mimics the  diffusive processes that prevail in the microbial world.  This  system can be used to separate, enrich for, and isolate detoxifying  microorganisms, as well as study the behavior of , and  detoxification processes mediated by, these organisms.  The  proposed system will consist of a gradient chamber for culturing  microorganisms in multiple, continuous diffusion gradients of small  soluble molecules.  In addition there will be an effluent chamber  for consolidating effluent flow from the system, an environmental  control unit of maintaining constant temperature, and an imaging  unit to monitor and quantify  microbial growth and movement.  These  components will be developed by Koh Development, Inc.  The system  will be tested and evaluated by Koh Development with help from  researchers at Michigan State University (MSU).  The scientists at  MSU will also use the system to evaluate the chemotactic response  of an individual bacterial species to multiple chemical cues.  In  addition, gradients of salt and toluene will be used to evaluate  the response of a natural community from a soil site contaminated  with oil brine.  Mathematical models will also be developed that  aid in optimizing the performance of the system.",
