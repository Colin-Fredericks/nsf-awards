 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at the SUNY--Stony Brook acquire a solid state 300 MHz NMR spectrometer which  will be used in research investigations in the following areas of chemistry, material science, and  earth space sciences:  (1)  to study the absorption of basic probe molecules and  hydrofluorocarbons on surfaces, using double and triple resonance NMR, and to probe the  distributions of ions in disordered continuous solids such as fluorine fast-ion conductors and  oxy-fluorides; (2)  to investigate speciation in silicate glasses and liquids, in order to couple  structural information with the development of thermodynamic models for prediction of  phase equilibria of geologically important compositions at elevated pressures and  temperatures; (3)  to investigate models for metal-cysteine centers in metalloproteins; (4)  to study the molecular basis of amyloid fibril formation in type-II diabetes; and (5)  to use  NMR in close combination with diffraction data, to tackle problems of disorder in  mineralogy and zeolite chemistry.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
