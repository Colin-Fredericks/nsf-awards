 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319816  Karatzas       This project will focus on various mathematical problems  arising in continuous-time finance that require the development  of new techniques in stochastic control theory. These include (1)  questions of optimization, hedging, and valuation of contingent  claims in incomplete markets and/or under constraints; and (2)  questions of economic equilibrium in incomplete or \"effectively  complete\" markets. With regard to (1), it is expected that the  problem of portfolio optimization with random endowment streams  will require non-standard techniques from functional and convex  analysis. Questions of pricing are formulated in terms of a new  kind of stochastic control problem where the terminal reward  function has a random component. Issues related to (2) include  the establishment of the martingale property for certain  exponential local martingales, and the representation property of  a given set of martingales as stochastic integrals with respect  to a second, given set.       Existing methods for pricing financial instruments (for  example, contracts whose value will be revealed at some future  date) assume that financial markets are \"complete\" of \"perfect\"  in the sense that it is possible to exactly calculate the present  value, and hence the price, of such instruments. In reality, this  is not the case; markets are \"imperfect\" or \"incomplete\" due,  among other things, to investment constraints, transaction costs,  different interest rates, different patterns of information, etc.  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing  financial instruments in imperfect markets; such methodologies  will be investigated in this project. In a similar vein, standard  economic equilibrium theory provides ways to determine prices for  financial assets so that individual agents' utilities are  maximized and \"markets clear\" (that is, supply equals demand) -  but again, only in the context of perfect markets. This project  will develop an equilibrium theory which is more g eneral and at  the same time also more applicable by being able to deal with  imperfect markets.",
