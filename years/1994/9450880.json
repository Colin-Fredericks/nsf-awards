 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is purchasing computer equipment to  upgrade the control interface of two computer-controlled  instruments: a FT-IR and a mid-field FT-NMR.  These two instruments  find heavy use in our project-oriented laboratories at the  sophomore, junior, and senior levels.  Throughout the program  students undertake extended multistage laboratory projects  requiring them to display a growing independence.  In the sophomore  year, which is the primary beneficiary of the project, the students  select a multistage synthesis from the original current research  literature to investigate.  Examples of recent projects are  synthesis of a pheromone of the western pine beetle, and of a model  compound for the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol.  Both the number and  sophistication of IR and NMR spectra are increasing with the new  interfaces; sophomores are  able to run their own 2 - D NMR spectra  by the end of the year, and students in the upper-level  laboratories use the full capabilities of both instruments in  characterizing compounds prepared in their projects.",
