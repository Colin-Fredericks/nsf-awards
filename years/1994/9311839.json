Human-Centered, Intelligent Agents Supporting  Communication and Collaboration in Domain-Oriented  Design Environments               This is the third year funding of a three-year  continuing award. There is a growing awareness among  researchers and users of  computer systems that systems  based on a \"tool\" metaphor do not  scale up to the  information-rich, high-functionality systems of the  future.  The goals of this project are (1) the  extension of  theoretical and conceptual frameworks and  (2) the design,  implementation, and evaluation of  prototype systems in order to  accommodate the need for  and to evaluate the contribution of  intelligent agents  for supporting communication and collaboration  within  domain-oriented design environments.    The proposed  research will explore the embedding of intelligent  agents  into domain-oriented design environments with  the goals of reducing  the cognitive load on designers  through active behavior, and  improving the quality of  the designed artifact.  Agents could, for  instance,  help designers avoid overlooking important  possibilities  and settling on suboptimal plateaus.  Incorporating intelligent  agents into design raises  numerous conceptual, technical, and  social issues.  Technical problems will  include user manipulation of  agents through and agent editor,  activation of agents  in a shared context, presentation of agents,  and  creation of shared context through specification,  construction, task representations, and interaction  histories.  Social issues  will include the new role  distributions between humans and  computational agents,  namely, the embedding of agents in human-  centered  cooperative problem solving systems supporting  communication, coordination, and collaboration.  These  issues will  be addressed by providing extended task  representations and accountability through explanation.",
