The course provides a short, two week, intensive training in classical and molecular approaches to the use of fission yeast as an experimental organism.  It is designed to prepare the student to enter directly into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized techniques and concepts in molecular genetics, classical genetics and biochemistry that can be applied to many studies, including cell cycle regulation and growth control.  The emphasis is placed not only on techniques but on the approaches to experimental problems.  The course is organized to instruct students in three major areas.  In the first, which is the cell biology of fission yeast, students gain expertise in the use of fluorescent probes for microscopy.  In addition, state of the art techniques for cell cycle analysis, such as flow cytometry and synchronization of cells by elutriation are presented.  Biochemical experiments are also presented to enable students to connect genetic and biochemical data and prepare them to relate these approaches to their own work.  The course also provides scientific expertise in the powerful classical genetic analyses possible in yeast.  Students learn approaches to identifying mutant genes, mapping genes and to tetrad analysis.  Finally, students gain expertise in molecular genetics.  Students are trained in the theory and practice of the use of recombinant DNA technology in studies in yeast.  The faculty are chosen on the basis of their contributions to and knowledge of field.  The faculty invite lecturers who give up-to-the-minute reports on current research.  The lecturers have all made significant contributions to their fields.  The trainees range from graduate students to senior investigators, and are chosen by the course faculty.   %%%  This grant supports an annual two-week course in the molecular genetics of fission yeast at  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the fall of 1994-1998.  Because of the short duration of the course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend and receive a short, intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their time and attention.  The course provides an unusual opportunity for scientists to retrain in another speciality or to apply the work of a new field to their own research interests.  ***",
