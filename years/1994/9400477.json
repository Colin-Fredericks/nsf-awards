 "awd_abstract_narration": "9499477  Rundle    In the last decade serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) have  emerged as important regulators of eukaryotic cell metabolism and  development.  PP control essential cellular functions such as the  completion of mitosis and the regulation of enzyme activity in  pathways as diverse as glycogen metabolism (in animal cells) and  sucrose biosynthesis (in photosynthetic plant cells).  PP activity  is controlled by different regulatory subunits (RS).  These  subunits alter both the specificity and activity of the enzyme.   This research proposal outlines strategies for detecting RS of PP  of plants.  To date only one study on this subject has been  reported.  The goal of this research is to use a molecular cloning  approach to detect the presence of plant PP RS.  Three different  strategies will be used to isolate cDNA sequences encoding RS from  animal systems to detect and isolate RS genes of plants.  Second,  the polymerase chain reaction will be used to amplify RS DNA  sequences from A. thaliana genomic DNA.  Third, interaction cloning  will be used to detect proteins that interact with the catalytic  subunit of PP.  Characterization of the PP RS isolated by these  methods will provide important first hints concerning factors that  control plant PP.  This work will also have a significant impact on  the emerging field of study concerning protein phosphorylation-  controlled events in plant cells.  %%%  Dr. Sabine Rundle has been the holder of an NSF Post-doctoral  Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for the past two years.  She  has recently accepted her first tenure-track faculty position at  Western Carolina University where she will pursue research on the  role of certain enzymes, serine/threonine protein phosphatases in  regulating cellular functions in higher plants.  This award will  provide a starter grant for support of her research program.  The  initial goals of this research are to detect and isolate genes for  the components of this type of enzyme from the model  plant,  Arabidopsis thaliana.  The results of this line of research  ultimately will contribute to our understanding of fundamental  regulatory events in plant cellular function.  ***",
