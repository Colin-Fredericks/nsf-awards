 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320673  Thompson    Campaign financing is a prominent issue on the contemporary  public agenda.  The costs of campaigns are increasing at a rapid  pace and reports indicate that political action committees (PACs)  are contributing a greater proportion of funds to candidates.   Turnover rates are declining and, as a result, the public is  concerned about the influence of \"special interests\" and career  politicians in legislative decision making.    The primary purpose of this investigation is to collect state  legislative campaign finance data from a large and representative  sample of states.  Data are gathered from approximately 25  states, selected in relation to important differences in their  political characteristics (degree of partisan competition for  legislative seats, degree of legislative professionalism, etc.),  regional and cultural differences, electoral system  characteristics, legal requirements (campaign finance  restrictions, public funding of elections, etc.), and structural  factors (costs of campaigns, size and type of district).    Information is collected for approximately 40 potentially  important explanatory variables.  These include candidate  characteristics (party, race, gender, leadership position, etc.);  electoral variables (primary and general election votes in  current and previous elections, etc.); revenue and expenditure  variables; and, system characteristics.  Data are collected for  the four most recent election cycles - - 1986, 1988, 1990, and  1992.    This data set will be the first multi-state, longitudinal (over  four election cycles) one available to researchers.  The data  will be archived at the Inter-university Consortium for Political  and Social Research where it will be available to other  researchers to pursue additional research topics.  ***",
