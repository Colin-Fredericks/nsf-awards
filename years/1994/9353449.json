It consist  of two 2-year cycles (staggered by one year).  Each cycle will have  16 participants at each of 6 sites--impacting a total of 192  teachers over its 3-year life.  To encourage cross-grade dialog,  participants are selected in teams consisting of both middle and  high school teachers.  The aim of the project is to prepare the  participants to become change agents and assume leadership  positions in a systemic reform of mathematics teaching, curriculum,  and assessment in their respective districts.  The project consists  of 3 phases: In Phase 1, teachers are asked to initiate 4  \"structured experiments\" (i.e. open-ended problems) in their  classrooms, and meet some 10 times during the semester to reflect  on, critique, and discuss what these experiments reveal about the  nature of mathematics, and how it can be effectively taught and  learned.  They also develop individual \"action plans\" for further  changes in their teaching practices.  Phase 2 consists of an  intensive 4-week institute, in which the teachers themselves do  mathematical inquiries at their own level, continue their  discussions of the teaching of mathematics, and learning and  practicing leadership skills.  In phase 3, they examine and help  reshape their district's reform plans, continue changing their own  classrooms practices, and--with support of project staff--begin  outreach programs in their districts.  An external evaluation seeks  to document and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the  project, which is based on the assumption that reform must come  from within the system itself.      Cost-sharing is 22% of the total NSF contribution.",
