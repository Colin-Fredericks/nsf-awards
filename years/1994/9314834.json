The objective  of the research is to develop more powerful theorem proving  programs using completion and paramodulation-based techniques.   They propose to investigate applications of paramodulation and  completion developed at Boston University and in France.  They  will also undertake the development of a new version of ORME (a  term-rewriting software system currently used in France).     This project takes advantage of French expertise in term-  rewriting.  The U.S. investigator will use the French developed  software, ORME, for testing his ideas.  He brings to this  collaboration expertise in integrating methods of theorem proving  with those of term-rewriting.  The proposed research will advance  the use of completion-like techniques in software engineering.  ***",
