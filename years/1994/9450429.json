 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450429  CUNY York College  Jamaica, NY  Schlein, Jack, Jason Finkelstein and Concepcion Wibrowski    \"CUNY Headstart for College Continuum Summer Science Camp\"    The office of Academic Affairs of the City University of New York  and York College of CUNY, in collaboration with the New York City  Public Schools, propose to develop and implement a Head Start for  College Continuum (HSCC) Summer Science Camp (SSC) for  underachieving minority eighth-grade students who aspire to go to  college.  The proposal request of $139,970 for three summers will  serve 150 students--a cohort of 50 students each July--from 1995 to  1997.  The HSCC Summer Science Camp (SSC) objectives will include  1) strengthening the commitment of early adolescents to remain in  school and go on to college; 2) illustrating the importance of  science, math and communication skills in our lives; 3) exposing  students to a broad range of participatory activities in science,  math, technology, age-appropriate research strategies and  interactions with minority mentors, role midels and practicing  scientists, engineers and mathematicians; 4) offering students  information and guidance in the career exploration process  including the academic preparation necessary for a variety of  professions; and 5) heightening student awareness of science,  mathematics and teaching as potential career choices.    The HSCC summer camp will provide a 4-week total immersion in  science, engineering and math (SEM).  Students' perception of SEM  in their daily lives will be guided through study of commonplace  devices such as clocks, radios, and cameras.  At camp's end, they  will know why such devices are important scientific products.   Motivation to learn will be driven by students' curiosity and their  need to know why such devices work.  During morning  (interdisciplinary) laboratory classes, they will learn problem-  solving strategies in small cooperative learning groups.  In the  afternoon, they will \"do\" research projects, telecommunicati on  networking and construct devices related to each week's scientific  theme.  Parental involvement will be promoted throughout the  program.  HSCC campers will be enveloped in an ongoing supportive  environment that rewards students' competence.  They will gather  information regarding SEM career options and requirements during  interactions with practicing SEM role models at the college, on  weekly trips, at the NY State Job and Career Center and at  worksites.  Students will be guided by undergraduate SEM mentors  who will work with them daily.  The two-year HSCC follow-up program  of alternating mentoring and precollege experiences will reinforce,  strengthen and extend SSC objectives and their impact on students.   Campers ability to successfully negotiate significant turning  points in their lives can begin the summer before they enter HSCC  giving them a better chance to realize their potential in SEM and  teaching careers.  ***",
