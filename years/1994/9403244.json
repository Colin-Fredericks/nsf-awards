Evolutionary mechanisms responsible for diet breadth  will be sought using two sibling species of seed-feeding beetle,  Stator beali (a specialist restricted to the host plant  Chloroleucon ebano) and Stator limbatus (a feeding generalist  associated with more than fifty host plant species).  The work  involves documenting patterns of intra- and inter-population  variation in oviposition preference and host suitability, and  subsequently examination of genetic and environmental sources of  this variation using laboratory and field experimentation.  %%%  Performing a genetic analysis of mechanisms responsible for insect  diet breadth is important to understanding sympatric speciation,  incorporation of novel host plant species into diet (particularly  for introduced pests), maintenance of genetic variation within  natural populations, and development of reliable pest control  practices / techniques.  ***",
