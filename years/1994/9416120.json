 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416120  Kanamori    This research is to investigate the relationship between the 3-D  crustal structure, the fault geometry and the dynamic  characteristics of the Northridge earthquake sequence.  The 1994  Northridge earthquake occurred on a south-dipping fault beneath the  Transverse Ranges, in striking contrast to the 1971 San Fernando  earthquake which occurred on a north-dipping fault.  This will  investigate why the two faults are segmented like this (north vs.  south), and what prevented the rupture of the Northridge earthquake  from extending further to the west.  Since the Transverse Ranges  involve many active structures formed under a regional north-south  compressional stress system, a much larger earthquake than the  Northridge earthquake could occur if the system, a much larger  earthquake than the Northridge earthquake could occur if the  rupture extended over many segments of faults.  The work will also  involve investigation of the variation of dynamic characteristics  (waveform, stress drop, energy-moment ratio) of the major  aftershocks in relation to the 3-D structure.  This project is a  contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program  and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency  Appropriation.  ***",
