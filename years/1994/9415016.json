 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1800, Middlebury College, located in western Vermont, has committed itself to  academic excellence in all disciplines, including the sciences.  Research by undergraduate  students, working in close collaboration with faculty mentors, is the centerpiece of science  education at Middlebury.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Department of Chemistry and  Biochemistry.  The commitment of faculty, in carrying out significant research in the setting of  an undergraduate institution,  has increased of the number of students pursuing chemistry,  biochemistry and molecular biology.  Success has come in spite of antiquated facilities for  research and research training.  Recognizing this need the college will renovate laboratory space  in the Science Center for chemical and biochemical research with support from the Academic  Research Infrastructure Program.  Present conditions of research space dedicated to the department are inappropriate and poorly  configured to support research activities.  Renovations will include consolidating research space  that is currently dispersed throughout the building.  Instrumentation rooms will be created for all  major analytical instruments.  New fume hoods and ventilated storage cabinets  will be located in  all laboratories, improving laboratory safety.  The renovated laboratories will provide access to  modern research space for more undergraduate students and will substantially improve the  environment for student-faculty research.  These modifications will facilitate the substantial flow  of scientific results from Middlebury faculty and students, and will contribute to the recruitment  and training of future scientists.",
