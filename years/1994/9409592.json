 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409592  NAGIN  This project aims to advance developmental theories of crime and  deviance by examining the life course of different groups of  offenders.  The theories offer different explanations of the  evolution of antisocial behaviors from childhood through  adulthood.  One purpose of this project is to test the  proposition that some individuals are at greatly elevated risk of  continuing antisocial behavior.  The research will identify the  distinguishing characteristics of such individuals and measure  the impact of events later in life that appear to cause decreases  in criminal behavior for some individuals and increases for  others.  This analysis will allow the principal investigator to  determine which theoretical explanation best fits these findings.    The analysis will be conducted on three important data sets:  (1)  the classic matched sample of delinquent boys assembled by the  Gluecks (Boston area, subjects born in the 1920's), (2) the  National Youth Survey (U.S. probability sample of 11 to 17 year-  olds in 1976), and (3) the Dunedin, New Zealand survey of a 1972-  73 birth cohort.  The use of these three widely differing data  sets will allow the principal investigator to determine the  generality of the findings, thereby enhancing the theoretical  significance of this research.  ***",
