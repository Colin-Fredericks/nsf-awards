 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all mathematical problems in science and   engineering are  approximated by linear and non-linear systems of integral   and/or  partial  differential equations, which vary widely in number,  form,   and character.  Since analytical solutions do not exist for  most problems of   interest,  numerical approximation techniques,  such as finite element   and finite  difference methods, are widely  used, ultimately resulting in   a system of linear  or non-linear  algebraic equations, which must then be   solved.  In the realistic  representation of practical applications over large and/or    domains, such systems may contain m=104 to 107  unknowns.    For non-linear or  transient problems, the system  requires the repetitive   solution of  corresponding linearized  problems for changing parameters.    Direct solution  methods often  cannot be used because of excessive storage   and time requirements  (the latter are O(m3)).  Iterative methods (such as   multigrid,  conjugate  gradients, SSOR, orthomin, and GMRES), which take time  O(m2)   per iteration, are  almost universally applied.  Another  candidate for solving   very large linear  systems is the Monte  Carlo method, which takes time O(m) per   iteration; but the  high  variances of the estimates and the very slow   convergence has  tended to  eliminate it from consideration.  The sequential Monte  Carlo   method is a  promising modification which shows guaranteed  convergence.    This method is  applied to broad classes of  large systems of linear and non-  linear equations.  Preliminary  computations show promisingly large improvements   in speed and  efficiency over both plain Monte Carlo and deterministic   methods.",
