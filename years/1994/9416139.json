 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416139  Walser    This is a grant for the PI to plan an NSF Industry/University   Cooperative Research Center on Magnetics at the University of Texas  at Austin.  The award provides funding for the planning,  determination of the feasibility and viability of developing an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center at the University  of Texas at Austin with focus on research on the topic of  magnetics.  The funds are used for the administrative costs  involved in the preparation of an operational plan for the Center,  and in acquiring industrial support for the Center.  The  institution will plan and host a two meeting with potential  industrial partners to review potential research topics and  determine interest of industry to support the Center as  partners/collaborators/supporters.  The topics proposed for the  Center include: power electronics and telecommunications,  integrated electromagnetics, identification and security,  electromagnetic radiation control, and magnetic sensors.  Research  to be addressed by the center will include (1) synthesis,  processing and characterization of advanced magnetic materials,   (2) design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of novel magnetic  devices and,  (3) integration of advanced magnetic materials,  processing and devices, and  (4) transfer of novel technologies to  industry.    The success of the effort will be measured by the success of a  proposal to the National Science Foundation for support of the  planned Center as an Industry/ University Cooperative Research  Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Texas at Austin be  awarded $24,993 for 6 months for this planning grant.",
