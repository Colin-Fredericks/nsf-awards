 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns the development of techniques for solving some  new types of integral equations, and the application of these techniques to a  variety of physical problems.  Of particular interest are equations of  Volterra type whose solution experiences a blow-up, and equations of Fredholm  type whose solution exhibits boundary layer effects.  The areas of application  include (i) localized plastic straining effects in high-strength metals, (ii)  the ignition of combustible solid materials, and (iii) the migration of atomic  impurities in crystals.          The project concerns the development and  application of new techniques for solving certain scientific and engineering  problems which can be formulated in mathematical terms as an integral or  integro-differential equation.  The results will be used to enhance the  understanding of phenomena which exhibit explosive behavior, such as the  ignition and burning of solid matter.  Related applications concern the  failure of high-strength metals which undergo viscoplastic strain due to  extreme loading.  Another area of potential use concerns the effects of  impurities in crystalline materials.",
