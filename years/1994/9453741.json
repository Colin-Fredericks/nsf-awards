 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453741  Teasdale    To change the perceptions that young women have about themselves, as well as about the fields  of engineering as career options, a two-week summer engineering experience for young men and  women will be offered by the University of Idaho College of Engineering.  The workshop will  incorporate strategies to improve:  the instructional climate provided by the faculty; the  understanding of gender and cultural diversity issues by students, faculty, and counselors; and  the self-esteem of the young women.  The new strategies and approaches will be incorporated  into an ongoing summer experience for high school students which has been offered for a  number of years, but which previously had not been successful in attracting young women.    This project will offer the first opportunity for a university experience for most of the students.   They will register for a two-credit pre-engineering course, live on the University campus, attend  courses and work in laboratories in University buildings, as well as use other University  facilities.  The college atmosphere will provide a transitional experience for the students which  will be valuable when they attend college after high school graduation.  It is anticipated that not  only will the young women develop more positive perceptions about their abilities in math,  science, and engineering, and change perceptions about engineering as a career option, but that  the young men will have a better understand of diversity issues and profit from the enhanced  learning environment.  ***",
