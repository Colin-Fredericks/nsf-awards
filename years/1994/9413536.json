 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high resolution X-ray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) will be  acquired with funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure  Program and will be employed in the characterization of advanced  materials such as ceramics, polymers, model catalyst systems and  composite materials. The XPS will have an energy resolution of  0.50eV at a counting rate of greater than 100 counts per second  and broad range survey counting levels will be in excess of 7  million counts per second. The facility will feature in-situ  sample preparation with sample heating, gas dosing for surface  reactivity experiments, and depth profiling through inert gas  sputter removal. The spectrometer will be used for:  characterization of polymer/ceramic and polymer/ polymer  interfaces; study of surface modifiers in heterogeneous catal-  ysis; understanding the processing mechanisms in photovoltaic  cell synthesis; identification of bonding configuations in ion  implantation surface modification; study of metal/ceramic  interface properties; study of radioactive waste remediation;  studies of adhesion; and studies of the corrosive behavior of  ceramics.    The X-ray photoemission spectrometer will be employed for a wide  range of materials studies. These include the studies of a  variety if interfaces and surfaces. The investigations will  involve the chemical reactivity  and adhesion of surfaces, the  surface bonding modifications resulting from ion implantation,  the catalytic properties of modified surfaces, and the study of  the synthesis of photovoltaic cells.",
