 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401839  Hadjipanayis    This award for a modern analytical electron microscope will  support and augment the materials research programs in the  Department of Physics and Astronomy and in the Department of  Chemistry at the University of Delaware.  Programs include  magnetic domain and Microstructural studies in permanent  magnets and magnetic thin films, melting and freezing of  small particles and multilayers, and the structure  morphology of ultrafine particles.  The microscope is a JEOL  JEM 2000FX scanning transmission electron microscope  equipped with several accessories including an X-ray  detector, special lenses for magnetic imaging (both Lorentz  microscopy and DPC imaging), and heating and cooling stages.  It will replace a 28 year-old JOEL JEM 100 C TEM.  The high  resolution capability of the JEM 2000FX is needed to  characterize the grain boundary phases observed in novel  permanent magnet materials, the core-shell-type structure  morphology of ultrafine particles, interfacial effects in  nanocomposites, the role of defects in freezing and melting  of small particles, and the structure morphology of small  semiconductor particles.    Several other Departments and Research Centers also have  ongoing programs which urgently require the use of this  instrument, which does not exist at the University of  Delaware.  Each of these research programs will benefit  greatly from the presence of the modern electron microscope  and interdisciplinary research will be enhanced.  In  addition, the microscope will offer the type of education  and training in state-of-the-art electron microscopy skills  needed by students and post-doctors.  ***",
