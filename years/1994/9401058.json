Jones (SUNY at  StonyBrook) will attempt to verify their conjectured calculation  of the algebraic K- and L-theories of the integral group ring of  a given group in terms of the K- and L-theories of the integral  group rings of a class of subgroups of that group.  This class  consists of all the virtually cyclic subgroups of the given  group.  They envision applications of this work to differential  geometry, in particular, to questions of rigidity.       The objective is to classify geometric objects by  numerical invariants.  The geometric objects are Riemannian  manifolds, spaces which locally resemble Euclidean space except  that the notion of distance may be warped, and they arise  naturally and ubiquitously in the mathematical formulation of  physical theories.  Thus, as is familiar from the general theory  of relativity, a space can be curved; e.g., it could be a sphere  or a torus (doughnut surface).        Some basic numerical invariants of such a space are its  fundamental group and its sectional curvatures.  For example, the  curvature of the torus changes continuously from point to point,  varying between positive and negative numbers, whereas the  curvature of the sphere of radius 1 is identically 1.  Farrell  and Jones have shown that two closed negatively curved Riemannian  manifolds with the same fundamental group invariant are  homeomorphic; i.e., there is a continuous one-to-one mapping  between their points.  (The case of 3- and 4-dimensional  manifolds is still open.)  But they gave examples where the  mapping can never be smooth.  A search will be made for  additional numerical invariants guaranteeing a smooth mapping,  which is highly significant for any physical applications.  ***",
