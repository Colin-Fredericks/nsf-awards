 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311597  Nocera    This proposal is motivated by the challenge of rationally designing  magnetic substances.  This research will exploit the structural  control available in layered materials to study the interplay  between molecular interactions and magnetic coupling.  The  intracrystalline environments of phosphate layered hosts will  provide the scaffolding to position organic inorganic intercalants  in well-defined relationships to the layers and to each other.  Magnetic intercalates of layered phosphate and phosphonate hosts  will be synthesized by redox and ion-exchange intercalation  methods.  Insertion of specially designed isostructural organic and  inorganic sets of para- or diamagnetic guests will permit the probe  of intralayer, layer-guest, guest-guest, and higher order magnetic  interactions.  In the case of paramagnetic intercalants, the roles  of the open-shell orbitals' shape and alignment relative to the  layers can be assessed in connection with quest orientation within  the galleries.  Finally, an exploratory path is outlined to  assemble magnetic host layers about paramagnetic quests.  As this  proposal addresses structural issues of magnetic coupling, new  strategies for the rational design of materials with magnetically  tailored properties will emerge.  Additionally, the structure-  magnetism correlations assembled in this layered magnetic materials  synthesis program will provide impetus for the development of new  predictive structural theories of magnetism.  Although the primary  focus of the proposed work is synthetic, development of mechanistic  models will be pursued as needed within an established  collaboration with the condensed matter physics group at the  University.  ***",
