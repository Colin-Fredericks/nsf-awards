 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406396  Johnsson       Understanding of complex organic/inorganic interactions in  forested ecosystems requires an interdisciplinary approach wherein  field observations from carefully selected study areas are combined  with macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic investigations and with  surface-sensitive technologies (e.g., atomic force microscopy, AFM;  scanning tunneling microscopy, STM; X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy, XPS) that are capable of probing the unique  structure, composition, and reactivity of the mineral/water  interface.  This Research Planning Grant proposal outlines two  studies wherein an interdisciplinary approach is taken to  understanding the effects of organic acids on chemical weathering  and trace-metal mobilization in acidic, organic-rich soils and  streams.  These studies include (1) the effects of simple (oxalate)  and complex (humic and fulvic) organic acids on hematite  dissolution in mixed-ligand systems, and (2) the effects of organic  acids on AL-hydroxide secondary phase formation during the  dissolution of phyllosilicates (muscovite and kaolinite).  Both of  these studies involve integration of geochemical experimentation  from the atomic- to the water shed scale.  Results of these  preliminary studies will be used as background for submission of a  large-scale NSF grant, in 1994-95. In addition, establishment of a  new field study area, design and construction of a flow-trough  reaction vessel attachment to a computerized potentiostat, and  development of expertise in the use of 14C- labelled organic acids  in competitive sorption experiments will lay the groundwork for  additional research efforts involving a wide range of  organic/inorganic interactions.",
