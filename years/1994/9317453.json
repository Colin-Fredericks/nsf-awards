This will be the first  workshop of its kind held in Pakistan and follows as a logical  next step in continuing the dialogue between Pakistani and U.S.  scientists working in this field.  Many of the Pakistani  scientists did there graduate studies in the U.S.  With INT  support, Professor Shah gave a short course on Computer Vision at  Mehran University of Engineering in 1992 and made the necessary  contacts to start a linkage program between the University of  Central Florida and the University of Sindh.  Shah is responsible  for building up computer vision research in his department and  leads a computer vision research group consisting of doctoral and   masters candidates and undergraduates.   Shah is a recipient of  major NSF funding to build such research capability in the U.S.   One of his students who did outstanding research was invited to  make a presentation on his REU project at NSF in 1990.    Scope:  Computer vision research has important application in  High Performance Computing and Communications, and in industrial  automation and robotics.  Factories of the future are expected to  be heavily automated.  The participants will evaluate the current  state-of-the-art in this area and suggest directions for the  future.  Particular attention will be given to identification of  the University-industry interaction and for the Pakistanis U.S.  perspectives on curriculum development.  ***",
