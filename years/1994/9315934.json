 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315934  Ackley  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program  (\"Anzflux\") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is a spatially small-scale and mesoscale study of the  growth of sea ice in open water, and the physical, chemical,  biological, and thermal properties of the existing ice cover.  The  rates of sea ice growth determine salt and latent heat fluxes that  affect the density of the oceanic surface layer.    Additionally, longer-term heat and mass balance measurements on  various ice types in the vicinity of the ship will be carried out.   This involves installing ice thickness gauges, thermistor  (temperature) strings, and stress sensors, which will be sampled  periodically over the duration of the drift.  Radar backscatter and  passive microwave emission measurements will be made at several  frequencies to establish the dielectric properties of the sea ice  and to provide ground truth information for future satellite-based  radar experiments.    These measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***",
