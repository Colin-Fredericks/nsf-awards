 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the concerns of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science (AAAS) for undergraduate science and  mathematics education are the large attrition of students from  introductory to the intermediate courses and concomitant  declining numbers of majors, lack of attractive offerings for  non-science majors, poor science and mathematics preparation  for prospective pre-college teachers, and inability to recruit  and retain women and minority students.  Other organizations,  including the NSF, also have concerns and issues that they  would like to bring to the attention of appropriate university  faculty and administrators for action and/or comment.  There  is, at present, no single effective and efficient access point  for presenting these to the higher education community , nor,  more seriously, for coordinating and exchanging information  among the science and mathematics departments at different  institutions.  This is a missing piece of the science and  mathematics teaching/learning infrastructure.  The AAAS  proposes here a mechanism, a Science Deans Colloquium, for  addressing the problem of access to the science and mathematics  communities in large research universities with the long-term  goal of improving undergraduate science and mathematics  education through continued interaction among the Deans.  ***",
