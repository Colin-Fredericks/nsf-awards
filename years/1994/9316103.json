To this end the principal investigators plan  to collect data on both the kinematics of the upper crust and the  deep structure.  Both instantaneous (earthquake and GPS  measurements) and Cenozoic deformation will be constrained to  compare with lower crust and upper mantle structure (from seismic  and magnetotelluric measurements).    The principal investigators have decided to adopt a phased approach  to the study in order to answer some preliminary questions about  field conditions and data availability which might have a bearing  on the design of the full experiment.  The first phase will consist  of a combined field trip/workshop in the summer of 1994.   Information gathered during this workshop/field trip will be  valuable in its own right and will be invaluable in the design of  future studies of this region.   ***",
