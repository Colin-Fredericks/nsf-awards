It concerned with the  determination of the extent to which the spectrum of the Laplace-  Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold determines the  geometry of the manifold.  Recent examples show, for instance,  that the spectrum alone does not determine manifolds up to  isometry.  Further work will also be done in efforts to  understand how manifolds can be isospectral yet not even locally  isometric.  Examples growing out of these examples provide  excellent opportunities to identify specific local geometric  invariants which are not spectrally determined.  Work related to  isospectral plane domains will also continue.  Constructions of  such domains are surprisingly simple; they arise as underlying  spaces of certain orbifolds.  Using this method, work will be  done to establish whether or not it is possible to construct  isospectral sets of non-isometric plane domains of any finite  order.  Finally, studies on Laplace versus length spectra of  hyperbolic manifolds and on the Schrodinger operator on tori and  Heisenberg manifolds will be carried out.       Analysis of domains and manifolds through the study of  classical differential operators defined on these spaces is now  an established field of geometric analysis.  One knows that  geometric properties of the domains are intertwined with  properties of the spectrum of the operators.  Results of the last  decade show that the dependence is not as simple as once thought.       This work seeks to clarify the connections and broaden the  scope of the theory's applications.  ***",
