 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451796  Nelson  The Department of Biological Sciences proposes to improve the  quality of its heavily utilized 200-level Human Anatomy and  Physiology course sequence. This two-semester program is taken by  as many as 600 students per annum, most of whom are destined for  positions in education, science, and the allied health fields. For  many of these students, this will be their only training in the  structure and function of the human body. In its current  configuration, the laboratory segment of this program is largely  anatomical with instructional aids consisting of charts, models,  and preserved dissection specimens; teaching of physiological  principles in the laboratory is restricted to \"demonstration level\"  activity. We suspect that this emphasis on anatomical study, as  opposed to \"hands on\" experimental exercises, dominates the  laboratory components of similar courses at other institutions.  Thus, many students are missing a valuable opportunity to enhance  their analytical and technological skills while learning  physiology.     Our proposal seeks to redress a perceived decline in the  quantitative abilities and instrumentation literacy of our  graduates by providing the means for outfitting the 200-level  Anatomy and Physiology laboratories at Towson State University with  low-cost, durable physiological monitoring equipment. We also  propose to use this instrumentation in novel laboratory exercises  in which the students themselves serve as subject and experimentor.  Emphasis will be placed on \"hands-on\" learning of physiology and  requiring the students to master quantitative skills in order to  analyze the data they collect. Exposure to instrumented physiology  at this level will also provide the students with a foundation in  the analytical and evaluative techniques focal to their fields of  inquiry and will accelerate their transition to professionals.  Additionally, by instrumenting our 200-level laboratories, we will  expose prospective students of our advanced physiology   laboratories, slated for a transition to computerized data  acquisition, to conventional instrumentation technology at the  sophomore level.",
