 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landry  9315432     Most of the organic production in the oligotrophic open  oceans is created by or passed through bacterioplankton and  consequently made available for consumption by small  flagellated protozoa which feed by direct interception.   At  spatial scales relevant to such organisms, predator-prey  interactions are likely to be controlled by the balance of  molecular and hydrodynamic forces acting or small particles  moving relative to one another in a liquid media, rather  than by complex hunting or avoidance behaviors.  Thus, it  may be possible to understand clearance rates and selectives  of bacterivorous flagellates from physical and chemical  first principles.  The present research focuses on the  influences of bacterial motility and physiochemical surface  properties (hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge) on  zooflagellate bacterivory.  In an ecological context,  increased motility and hydrophobicity may provide survival  advantages to bacterioplankton in oligotrophic environments.  However, such characteristics would also increase the  frequency of random contacts with predators and would be a  likely disadvantage in terms of mortality rate.  Dr. Landry  will use  an integrated descriptive, experimental, and  theoretical  approach to:  1) characterize size, abundance,  motility, and  surface properties of natural microbial  communities in  waters of Hawaii; 2) test the effects of  prey motility and  surface properties on feeding rates of  zoofagellates; 3)  determine the selective advantages of  motility and  hydrophobicity as a function of nutritional  environment and  zooflagellate predation; and 4) continue  development of a  Force-Balance model of direct contact  feeding.       ***",
