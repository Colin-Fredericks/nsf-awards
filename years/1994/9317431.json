 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317431     DiTullio  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short, but  intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in many  Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early in the  season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  This research will investigate the  initiation of the phytoplankton spring bloom, especially the  factors which may be important in triggering and terminating the  Phaeocystis pouchetii bloom.  Specific research will focus on  sulfur and manganese cycling processes especially with regard to  possible global climate change processes.  Correlations of  particulate and dissolved dimethyl sulfide concentrations will be  estimated with respect to phytoplankton pigment concentrations.   Phytoplankton growth rates will be assessed using pigment labeling  techniques.  The fate of the dimethyl sulfide produced will be  determined.  Measurements will be performed to determine the  relative importance of:  (a) bacterial uptake (b) fluxes out of the  photic zone from sediment trap samples and (c) atmospheric  emissions.  The effects of acrylic acid production on various  components of the food web, such as its bactericidal properties  will be investigated.  The overall goal of this component is to  understand the dynamics of the oceanic sulfur cycle during the  spring bloom.",
