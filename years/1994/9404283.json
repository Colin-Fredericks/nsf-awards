 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404283  Symes       This project will focus on inverse problems arising in  geophysics, in particular, the determination or estimation of the  index of refraction, or wave velocity, of a medium from  measurements made at or near the surface of the body. The field  equations for such problems are hyperbolic, or are closely  related to hyperbolic systems. Several key mathematical questions  will be investigated, each with substantial practical  implications: 1) global estimates for a linearized inverse  problem for the wave equation in the presence of caustics; 2) the  relation between nonsmooth propagation of singularities and  linearization; 3) design of objective functions to give  quasiconvex optimization formulations of inverse problems; and 4)  accommodation of attenuation and dispersion; for example, inverse  problems in viscoelasticity.       The remote sensing techniques of pure and applied geophysics  use measurements of an acoustic or electromagnetic field near the  earth's surface to infer the internal structure of the earth.  These fields are modeled by the solutions of some appropriate  field equations in a domain representing a portion of the earth.  The coefficients of these equations represent distributed  physical parameters such as conductivity, stiffness, density,  etc. Thus remote sensing techniques pose inverse problems: to  estimate coefficients of field equations in the interior of a  domain from measurements of fields near the boundary. This  research concerns models of those experimental designs and  parameter ranges which cause the probe fields to consist of  propagating waves.",
