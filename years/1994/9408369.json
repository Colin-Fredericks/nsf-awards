 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408369  Rodriquiz  This research deals with the Metabolite Signal Model which provides  a new perspective on source/sink relations during cereal seedling  development by integrating gibberellic acid (GA) regulation into a  larger regulatory circuit.  Metabolic regulation of gene  expression, in which metabolites effect changes in gene expression,  regulates genes encoding at least three enzymes of carbohydrate  metabolism in cereal seedlings.  Two alpha-amylase genes, one  expressed in scutellum and the other expressed in the aleurone  (source), are repressed by sugar or a metabolite derived from  sugar.  Synthesis or release of GA from the embryo (sink) may also  be controlled by metabolic regulation.  If this is the case, then  the metabolic regulatory signal and the GA regulatory signal may  form a regulatory feedback circuit controlling the process of  seedling development.    Having the complete set of rice alpha-amylase gene clones enables  Dr. Rodriquiz and his colleagues to study the regulation of this  gene family at the gene-specific level.  The metabolically  regulated alpha-amylase genes RAmy3D and RAmy3E, which are the main  focus of this research, are distinct from the majority of alpha-  amylase genes cloned from other cereals.  There is evidence that  genes homologous to RAmy3D are present in other cereal species, so  studies with rice may help us to understand seedling development in  other species.  The switch from the early isozyme RAmy3D to a set  of later isozymes may be part of a developmental and physiological  transition that prepares the germinating seed for the next stage of  development, seedling elongation.  The relatively unique ability of  rice seeds to germinate under anoxic conditions and the  availability of a GA-deficient dwarf mutant of rice provide two  experimental systems which will facilitate this study.  ***",
