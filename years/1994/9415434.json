The meetings will provide a forum for researchers from  universities, industry and national laboratories and government  officials to discuss the impact of  societal change on the  mathematical and physical sciences communities. About forty  regional participants will participate in the two day meetings.  A summary report will be prepared summarizing conclusions and  recommendations, including whether such meetings are of value  and should be pursued.    Town Hall meetings of this type serve a useful purpose in  opening lines of communication between government, industry and  university scientists and policy makers. A better apppreciation  of the views of each is anticipated, ultimately leading to a  community better able to function in a changing environment.",
