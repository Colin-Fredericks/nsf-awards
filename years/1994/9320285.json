The            student will live with the Indians in three hamlets in the            Brazilian Amazon to assess the effects of varying contact with            the Brazilian National Indian Agency (FUNAI) on their health and            medical practices.  Using techniques of compiling personal            medical histories, dietary analysis, anthropometry, time            allocation studies and ethnographic interviews,  the student will            assess the viability of the traditional belief system.             This research is important because it provides information about            one of the few remaining communities of foragers in the world,            who are changing rapidly.  Aside from the benefits to U.S.            science of training a professional anthropologist and providing            knowledge about this important area of the world, this sort of            case study about medical traditions and practices will provide            valuable information which can be used to inform policies of any            state with respect to such small, unintegrated groups.  The            research also has the potential of discovering valuable            traditional health practices which could be beneficial in other            situations.              ***",
