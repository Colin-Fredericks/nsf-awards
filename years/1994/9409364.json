 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409364  Adams  This award supports Professor Michael Adams and two  graduate students of the University of Wisconsin at  Madison to collaborate with Rainer Koschel and others of  the Neuglobsow field laboratory of the Institute for  Inland Freshwater Ecology, at the northern edge of  Brandenberg State, Germany.  This laboratory was once  part of the East German Academy of Sciences, and was not  easily accessible to Western limnologists.  Together the  two research groups will study coherence and other  parameters of primary production patterns in U.S. and  German lakes of similar biogeographical settings.  In a  related study, they will examine the effect of re-  unification on water quality in the eastern states of  Germany.  Specifically they will collect and compare  primary productivity and other limnological data from the  North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research  (LTER) Program site in northern Wisconsin and the  Mecklenburg-Brandenburg lake district of northeastern  Germany.  The history of the land use pattern at each  location, the relative location in the respective  landscape in reference to the groundwater system, the  regional climate, and information on nutrient loading and  nutrient recycling will be incorporated into the  analysis.      This project is the first significant freshwater ecology  collaboration on waters of the former East Germany.  The  region being studied is an extensive, important, post-  glacial lake district, with more than 10,000 lakes  greater than one hectare in surface area.  Collaboration  with local limnologists will be an interesting and  valuable opportunity for participants in the Northern  Temperate Lakes LTER site, and should be mutually  beneficial to both research groups.  Observed patterns in  lake primary production may be associated with global  change in climate.  This is because lake systems can  serve as integrators of environmental information, such  as the effects of global solar radiation and thermal  regimes on inorganic carbo n fixation through  photosynthesis of lake phytoplankton.  This research may  be useful in contrasting such patterns between continents  and at different latitudes, using otherwise similar  biogeographic units.  ***",
