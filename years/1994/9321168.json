The conference will  highlight the latest developments in the field  of high energy physics and cosmology.  The  emphasis will be on the discussion of particle  phenomenology, QCD light cone methods, neutrino  physics and weak interactions.  In the more  mathematical section, the conference will focus  on formal aspects of field theory:  superstrings, conformal field theory, finite  temperature field theory and its implications.   A third session will be devoted to general  relativity and cosmology.      Scope:  This meeting is expected to be attended  by scientists and young physicists from South  Asia, and Central Asia, as well as by speakers  from the U.S., Canada, Europe, including from  Turkey.  The aim of the conference is to  promote research in fundamental physics and  mathematical physics in the countries of South  and Central Asia, and to create linkages  between young scientists in these regions and  U.S. scientists.  This fits well with the  objectives of the Division of International  Programs.  ***",
