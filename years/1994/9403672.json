 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403672  Siniff  A study of the ecology of Antarctic seals will be conducted in  conjunction with a physical oceanography cruise that will take  place in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during February and  March 1994.  The objectives of the oceanography and design of the  cruise track offers an unparalleled opportunity to investigate  the region's seal populations.  A recent international workshop  on Antarctic seals has identified these top level predators as  potentially important in the carbon flux of the Southern Ocean.   This workshop posed questions to address hypotheses regarding the  seals' roles in the pack ice ecosystem.  This cruise will help  collect data on one of these nine important research questions:   \"What are the causes and scale of variation in the distribution  of pack ice seals?\"  Since the cruise is multidisciplinary in  nature, there will be data collected on oceanographic parameters,  as well as bird abundance which will make possible analyses to  give insight into functional relationships and hence causes of  variations in distributional patterns.  The seal studies will  collect data on densities and distribution, as well as tissue  samples for genetic comparisons among regions of the Antarctic.  ***",
