 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408266  Dunlap  Mutualistic luminescent symbiosis between the marine bacterium  Vibrio fischeri and sepiolid squids (Euprymna scolopes and E.  morsei) is a model system to identify microbial determinants needed  for colonization.  Cyclic nucleotide metabolism in V. fischeri,  which may play a fundamental role in host-symbiont interactions,  will be examined from two perpsectives.  The role of periplasmic  3':5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CpdPase) will be  determined with colonization assay of the squid using V. fischeri  cpdP deletion mutants.  V. fischeri cpdP deletion mutants will be  prepared using molecular biology methods.  Differential expression  of the cpdP gene will be determined measuring CpdP enzyme activity,  protein levels, and mRNA in bacteria during the initiation and  maintenance phases of the symbiosis.  The role of microbial  adenylate cyclase and cAMP receptor protein in squid symbiosis will  be observed also using squid colonization experiments with cya and  crp mutants from a squid-symbiotic V. fischeri strain. For these  studies, V. fischeri cya and crp genes will be obtained from a V.  fischeri DNA gene library by complementation with Escherichia coli  deletion mutants. Once obtained, wild-type V. fischeri genes will  be inactivated and transposon insertion will be employed to produce  cya and crp defective squid-symbiotic V. fischeri mutants.  Loss of  ability of the cya and crp deficient mutants to establish symbiosis  will help us understand the molecular basis of V. fischeri  squid  colonization and identify the cAMP regulated genes involved.  %%%  Symbiotic associations between bacteria and higher organisms  dominate almost all terrestrial and marine habitats.  Vibrio  fischeri, a marine bacterium, forms a beneficial symbiosis with  certain squids.  The symbiosis is a useful model system that can  provide insight into the ways which animals prevent potentially  pathogenic bacteria from developing disease.  Preliminary evidence  indicates that cyclic AMP (cA MP), a regulator of bacterial gene  expression, is likely to mediate bacteria-animal interactions  critical to this symbiosis.  Genetic experiments are designed to  identify these interactions and learn how cAMP works.  Mutants of  V. fischeri will be constructed that lack the gene for periplasmic  cAMP phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that breaks down cAMP outside  the bacterial cell, the gene for adenylate cyclase formation,  and/or the gene for cAMP receptor protein, which makes bacteria to  respond to cAMP.  These V. fischeri mutants will be tested in squid  to measure their ability to establish symbiosis.  Loss of this  ability will help us find V. fischeri genes necessary for the  symbiosis to develop.
