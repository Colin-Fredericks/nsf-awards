 "awd_abstract_narration": "An algorithm is said to be online if it receives input in a  sequence of requests, and must service each request as it arrives  without any knowledge of the future.  Many fundamental problems in  computer science are inherently online.  A commonly used method of  analyzing online algorithms is competitive analysis, where the  performance of the online algorithm is compared to the performance  of the optimal clairvoyant algorithm.  There are several practical  problems with the usual style of competitive analysis, including   the use of worst care adversary, the lack of attention to  implementation efficiency, and the lack of empirical evidence  concerning the performance of competitive algorithms.  The goal of  this project is to help bridge the gap between theory and practice  in this rapidly growing area by developing efficient, adaptive  algorithms for fundamental systems problems.  These algorithms  should perform well against a statistical adversary, and will be  empirically evaluated.    Interactive activities include:  participation in the mentoring and  outreach programs of Women in Engineering; development of and  experimentation with software for teaching math to girls, via  collaboration with Professor Steve Tanimoto's research group at the  University of Washington (UW) and with Professor Maria Klawe's E-  GEMS project at the University of British Columbia; and teaching an  undergraduate course and seminars in computer science and  undertaking joint research with other members of the computer  science faculty at UW.",
