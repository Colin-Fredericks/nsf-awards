 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morelli       This award funds the research of Professor Robert Morelli into toric varieties and  lattice point counting.  The work is a combination of ideas from several parts of number  theory and combinatorics.  The work includes developing general techniques for  counting points in convex polytopes.  The investigator also intends to explore  connections between these problems and problems involving zeta functions and  modular forms.       This work falls into the general areas of Number Theory and Combinatorics.   Number Theory is the study of properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest  branch of systematic mathematics. Combinatorics is the study of problems involving  the counting of complex collections.  The research involves establishing general  methods for counting regularly distributed points within regular boundaries.  This has  important application in many different areas of mathematics and science.  Recently  both Number Theory and Combinatorics have found applications in theoretical computer  science and modern communication. ***",
