The research focus is at the interface of  harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.   A number  of outstanding mathematical scientists will be in residence  during the program working informally with the visitors and  conducting seminars on various topics.  These include such areas  as harmonic analysis related to curvature and  oscillatory integrals, well-posedness and local smoothing effects  in nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive partial  differential equations.  The program will capitalize on  applications of previously developed ideas while fostering growth  in what is the most promising new directions in harmonic analysis  and differential equations.  Many leading experts from the U.S.  and U.K. will participate in this activity, which is also  receiving financial support from the SERC (of Great Britain).   ***",
