 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells communicate with one another via a slender  cellular process called an axon.  Each nerve cell, or  neuron, has a very specific pattern of axonal connections,  and normal function of the nervous system depends on this  specific pattern of connections.  Development of the proper  pattern of connections in the brain requires a precise  regulation of axonal branching in the vicinity of a neuron's  target cells.  The long-term goal of this project is to  identify the mechanisms that regulate axonal branching in  the developing nervous system.  Recent studies show that  neurons grow by the continuous addition and retraction of  branches.  An increase in axonal branching, such as that  observed after activity is blocked, might occur through a  decrease in the amount of branch retraction or an increase  in the amount of branch addition.  To resolve this issue, it  is necessary to continuously monitor the living axon over  time.  This can now be accomplished using laser scanning  confocal microscopy.  This project will determine the  temporal limits for modifications of axonal structure and  test the hypothesis that blocking synaptic activity  increases the rate of branch initiation.   These results  will provide important new insights into the mechanisms  responsible for nerve cell form and function.",
