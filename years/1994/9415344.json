Built completely on private-sector resources, LFM is well known as an innovative program and one of the most important benchmarks in the field.  However, it has been limited mostly to large firms due to the cost of implementing some of the unique features of the program.  With TRP funding, small and medium firms will be able to participate with benefit to both students and member firms.  The program draws active participation from both the Management and Engineering Schools in stressing the practical aspects of manufacturing while taking into account fundamental principles.  ***",
