This materials system has been chosen because it  represents a model strained heteroepitaxial system, about which  much is already known.  Surface impurities, such as H or Sb, have  been found to dramatically alter the morphology and structure of a  growing layer.  The transmission ion channeling technique will be  applied to investigate the atomic structure and composition of  monolayer germanium films growing on silicon in order to understand  the microscopic role played by the impurity atoms.    %  %  %  %    An important goal in materials science is to be able to build  tailor-made materials with specific desirable properties.  A major  step in fulfilling this goal is to learn how to grow high quality  crystalline layers of one material on another.  Perfect growth can  be inhibited by various factors, including a tendency of the  overlayer to form islands, the creation of defects, etc.  It has  recently been shown that certain impurities, often referred to as  surfactants, can have a dramatic effect on the structure and  properties of a growing film.  The mechanism by which surfactants  influence growth of germanium on silicon, an important  technological system, will be studied using a novel ion scattering  technique.  With this technique it is possible to measure the  atomic structure and the composition of the growing film.  ***",
