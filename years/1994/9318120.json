 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318120  Kawai         The molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation of the  contractile apparatus are investigated in mammalian cardiac  muscles. The cross-bridge kinetics are assessed by the method  called sinusoidal analysis, which changes the length of the  muscle sinusoidally at varying frequencies, and measures  concomitant amplitude and phase shift in tension. The length  change perturbs the steady state distribution of the cross-  bridges, and this perturbation results in the transient change in  tension. From these data, 3 apparent rate constants are  extracted. These are further studied as functions of the MgATP,  MgADP, phosphate (Pi) concentrations, and 6 rate constants and 3  association constant (kinetic constants) that characterize a 7  state cross-bridge model are extracted. The rate limiting step is  characterized by the ATP hydrolysis rate measurement. The  strength of our approach is that the rate constants ranging 3  orders of magnitudes can be characterized by a single experiment.       The role of cooperativity of the regulatory units of the  thin filament in cross-bridge kinetics is investigated in this  proposal. Skinned cardiac muscle is activated by varying  concentrations of Ca2+, and the apparent rate constants are  examined to see if the cross-bridge kinetics are affected by  Ca2+. Troponin C (TnC) is partially extracted from skinned  myocardium, the extracted preparation is activated in a solution  containing high Ca2+ concentration (40 uM), and 10 kinetic  constant that characterize elementary steps of the cross-bridge  cycle are obtained as functions of the degree of TnC extraction.  The preparation is also reconstituted with cardiac TnC in which  Ca2+ specific binding site is destroyed by genetic engineering to  examine if the binding of TnC alone affects the cross-bridge  kinetics. These experiments will determine whether the  cooperative activation of regulatory units on the thin filament  affects elementary steps of the cross-bridge cycle. The Troponin  complex  is then placed into the turned on state regardless of  Ca2+, either by extracting TnI or by using  aTnC (turned on TnC),  and cross-bridge kinetics. at varying Ca2+ concentrations are  studied. This experiment will determine if there is an additional  Ca2+ binding site, such as in the myosin light chain 2, and if  Ca2+ binding into this site modifies the cross-bridge kinetics.  The degree of extraction and reconstitution of troponin  components is quantified by using SDS polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis, and phosphorylation by using isoelectric  focusing gel. The proposed research uses biophysical,  biochemical, engineering, and genetic engineering techniques, and  it is aimed at understanding the basic mechanisms of contraction.  ***",
