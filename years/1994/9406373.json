 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406373     Benoit    Silver is one of the most toxic metals in the aquatic environment,  yet, because of past contamination artifacts, there are currently  no reliable data on its concentration, transport, and fate in fresh  waters.  Based on lab experiments that simulate estuarine  conditions, silver at moderate levels can be directly toxic to  plankton and invertebrates while low levels can influence estuarine  community structure and reduce bivalve growth rates.   Fresh  waters, having more silver sources and less complexation by  chloride  than do estuaries, are likely to have an even greater  problem with silver toxicity. Silver's naturally low abundance  means that it may derive almost entirely from anthropogenic  sources, and can serve as a non-degradable tracer of pollution,  free from obfuscation by natural background concentration  variations.  An equally important reason to study silver is that it  is one of the few pure class B metals, and as such, its  study can  help to delineate one end of the total range of metal behavior.  At  present the aquatic chemistry of silver is poorly understood.    Because of the almost complete lack of reliable information on  freshwater silver, this proposal is designed as a reconnaissance to  explore the biogeochemical context of silver cycling and to  position researchers for more detailed studies of specific  processes in the future.  The research comprises three main  components:  1) to initiate establishment of benchmark Ag levels in  freshwater, 2) to identify and quantify natural and anthropogenic  sources, and 3) to specify and begin to investigate processes and  mechanisms that control silver's transport, bioavailability, and  fate.      The research will use ultra-clean methods to avoid contamination  artifacts that have plagued nearly all previous studies on trace  metals in fresh waters.  An important goal is to prompt additional  freshwater studies  that use these methods.  The investigation will  be conducted along the entire length  of the once highly-  industrialized Quinnipiac River, including a mid-stream lake.  A  mass balance approach will be used, providing the opportunity to  compare natural, point, and nonpoint sources of silver, and to  quantify removal rates.  Based on preliminary measurements,  headwaters of the Quinnipiac are extremely clean, while the lower  river is badly contaminated.  Two other rivers, the Naugatuck and  Connecticut, will be studied in less depth in order to increase the  generality of  the findings within the constraints of a modest  budget.  Of these two, the Naugatuck has a history of severe metal  pollution, while the Connecticut does not.    Techniques that will be used are:  1) conventional membrane  filtration (to separate particulate and non-particulate fractions),  2) ultrafiltration (for colloidal forms), 3) anodic stripping  voltammetry (to appraise silver -organic matter complexes), 4)   thermodynamic calculations (to estimate dissolved ion speciation),  5) measurement of pore water (to evaluate diffusive flux from  sediments), and 6) Ag concentration  and 210Pb geochronology of  sediments (to assess resuspension fluxes and document contamination  history).",
