Unified School District and the L.A. Community College District are jointly sponsoring the development of a public-private manufacturing-focused educational complex and industrial park to be located in a manufacturing intensive area in Los Angeles.  This complex, the Manufacturing Learning Center, will provide state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and educational programs to prepare young people for the highly skilled manufacturing jobs of the future.  Using a model proven effective in Detroit and adapted to Los Angeles, the project establish an organization with substantial business and community involvement to develop and manage the Center.    The mission of the Manufacturing Learning Center is to promote personal dignity and advanced engineering education, community harmony and economic development through the preparation of inner city youths for world class manufacturing leadership.  The Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC) will have five principal components, key features to integrate these components, and opportunities to contribute significantly to the Southern California economy by focusing on the telecommunications and transportation industries.    The Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC) consists of five principal components:    1. The Center for Advanced Technologies:  The center will be a highly advanced, flexible manufacturing production facility in which manufacturing technical training and engineering education will be provided for inner city young people leaving high school as well as dislocated manufacturing employees needing retraining or upskilling.    2. The Manufacturing Career Academy:  In collaboration with the L.A. Community College District and private industry, the L.A. Unified School District (LAUSD) will develo p for 500-700 students a grades 10-13 \"middle college\" or academy for manufacturing careers.  Students will gain academic and manufacturing skills through the integration of work and learning in actual and simulated production environments.  The last year (grade 13) of the Academy will be called the Manufacturing Technicians Institute and will receive post secondary accreditation toward the Associate of Arts degree and the Bachelor's degree in engineering.  The Career Academy will be constructed with $15 million in State funding on land donated by the State.  To be eligible for this funding LAUSD must secure matching funds from a private developer or lead tenant for the industrial park portion of the project described below.    3. Industrial Park:  Approximately 10 of the 20 MLC acres will support private industrial development.  The property will be made available on a lease basis to private industry for the development of manufacturing facilities.  Lease revenues will be utilized by the Career Academy to help sustain the educational program.    4. FAST TRACK Program:  Modeled after the Focus:  HOPE FAST TRACK program, this intensive, eight week program upgrades the basic skills, computer skills, work habits, leadership and team skills of inner city high school graduates.  Through a curriculum with an underlying theme of manufacturing engineering entrepreneurship, the academy prepares participants for (1) entry into the off-campus, manufacturing technician program of the MLC, (2) entry into traditional (on-campus) college programs, or (3) immediate job placement.    5. Manufacturing Teacher Training Institute:  The institute provides training to instructional staff of the Manufacturing Career Academy (high school, community college, and industry-based teachers) and the Center for Advanced Technologies on how to teach to manufacturing skill standards in real and simulated production environments.  The training is conducted by outstanding manufacturing engineers and educators.  ***",
