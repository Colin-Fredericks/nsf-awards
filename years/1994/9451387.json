American industry needs engineers who can design products which are  competitive in quality and performance in an increasingly  aggressive global market place. There is a sense that dividing  Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial, and Computer engineers into  separate compartments may produce only locally optimal designs. In  education, the traditional emphasis on single-student analysis  within an \"Engineering Discipline\" is giving way to  interdisciplinary, design-team oriented education.  With these  global trends in mind, we propose a new laboratory-based course,  \"Design of Consumer Electronics,\" to address the need for  interdisciplinary, design-team oriented education within the  College of Engineering at the University of Washington. We request  funding to develop this course, to disseminate the course content  and format to other institutions, and to encourage and compile an  expanding collection of curricular materials from among a diverse  group of faculty at UW and other institutions.",
