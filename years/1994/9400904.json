In particular, an attempt will be made to obtain a  better understanding of the exponential rank of homogeneous C*-  algebras and stable C*-algebras. (2) Investigation of related  work involving multiplicative commutators. (3) Continuation of  work on the K-theory of smooth crossed products. (4) A study of  spectra of elements of the reduced C*-algebras of free groups.       Operators are infinite dimensional generalizations of  matrices. There is a natural multiplication and addition of  operators and, consequently, some collections of operators can be  considered as mathematical structures called operator algebras.  There is an involution on operators much like the transposition  involution on matrices. An operator algebra that is closed under  the action of this involution is called a star algebra. A C*-  algebra is a star operator algebra that has additional  topological properties. In many commutative algebras, elements  that have multiplicative inverses have logarithms or,  equivalently, can be written as an exponential. This is not the  case in non-commutative C*-algebras. A portion of this project is  aimed at determining the number of exponential factors required  to write invertible elements as products of exponential.  ***",
