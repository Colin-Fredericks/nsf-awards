It is one of the major  intents of ICS to bring in young researchers to the discipline of  magnetospheric substorms.  They, it was agreed that special efforts  be made to encourage graduate students to participate in it. The  study of magnetospheric stbstroms has now become well established  as one of the major disciplines in space plasma physics,  magnetospheric physics and solar-terrestrial physics.  It includes  practically a study of all fundamental processes in the  magnetosphere-ionosphere system similar processes may be found in  solar flares, the magnetized planets and even in comets.  The first  ICS (ICS-1) was held in Kiruna, Sweden, on March, 1992.  It was  attended by about 150 researchers and was a great success as can be  judged from the excellent Proceedings produced promptly by the  organizers.  In order for every attendant to hear talks by the  others, there was no parallel session.  (The program was attached  in Appendix II).  ***",
