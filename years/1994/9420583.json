First are described the four major research thrust areas related to contaminant transport, fate, and remediation within which our proposed educational objectives will be implemented.  This theme represents an important and timely topic both in research and in engineering practice.  Curriculum development is then discussed, including a description of new courses for our revised program, modifications to existing courses, and detailed examples of plans for integrating modeling and measurements into selected courses.  The participants in the proposal are briefly described.  In addition to Hopkins faculty, these include interested individuals from private and government sectors, to help bring real-world problems into the classroom and to assist in designing a program that will produce graduate who are to advance the practice of environmental science and engineering.  Next we describe our plans for ongoing, substantive project evaluation and assessment, as well as for dissemination of results.  Finally, we conclude with a detailed schedule of activities.  ***",
