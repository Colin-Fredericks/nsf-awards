 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation constitutes an interdisciplinary and  international approach to establishing new mathematical tools and  computational models for the study of localizable and  nonstationary chaotic attractors with the statistical behavior of  solitons.  These attractors, termed chaotic solitons, have been  theorized as having a role in simple conservative systems with  direct relevance to a wide range of phenomena including  elementary particle interactions, atomic clustering, and  biomolecular dynamics such as protein folding and cytoskeletal  assembly.  Chaos and solitons have generally been portrayed as  being disparate with the consequence that quantum theory and  chaos have been generally dissociated.  However, the present line  of research points toward mathematical affinities between quantum  field theory and multidimensional nonstationary solitons; these  affinities indicate simpler methods for describing quantum  processes, derivable from classical chaos and network theories.  Algebraic and topological methods for representing the  statistical descriptions of attractor field states will be  explored.   Extension of one-dimensional chaotic soliton models  into two, three and four dimensions with constraints relevant to  observed physics will be a fundamental first step.    An extensive amount of theoretical work has been done in  particular by a long-standing group of mathematicians at the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, under the  direction of Dr. I. Bogolubsky.  A major goal of this proposal is  to consolidate, evaluate, and mathematically transform the work  that has grown out of this Russian team into mathematics and  computer modeling readily accessible to the U. S. mathematical,  statistical, and physics communities.  The proposed effort is  based on the belief that it is time-critical to organize efforts  to consolidate and extend this work through international  cooperative study.",
