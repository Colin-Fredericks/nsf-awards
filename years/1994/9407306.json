 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program, concerns the combination of capillary electrophoresis in   narrow-bore capillaries with sensitive and selective detection methods to   address several unique experiments in cellular neuroscience.  The three   fundamental goals of this project are to develop ultra-low volume   separation methods to dynamically and selectively follow chemical release   from single nerve cells, growth cones, and synapses; to develop capillary   electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to quantify phospholipids in membranes   of whole cells, regional sections of the plasma membrane, and axonal   growth cones in culture; and to develop methods to identify and quantify   chemical messengers in single developing growth cones.  These techniques   will be brought to bear on two important areas of neurobiology, namely   neural development through the study of growth cones and cell-to-cell   communication through events at the membrane.      The analytical methodology development to be pursued in this project,   which builds upon results obtained by Professor Ewing and his students   during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-9106832, is important to the   achievement of dimensionally and molecularly selective neurochemical   measurements at the single cell level.  These general methodologies are   also important in biotechnology and can be expected to contribute to the   development of essential instrumentation for environmental studies",
