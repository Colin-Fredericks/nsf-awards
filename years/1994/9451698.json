The best way to learn  science is to do it. For this, one needs curiosity, questions,  hypotheses and some tools. To provide these components to our  undergraduates, we propose a course \"Methods in Modern Biology,\"  that will be team taught by cell, molecular, developmental, and  evolutionary biologists. This course will teach students how to ask  rational scientific questions, search for solutions, and find the  answers to those questions using a wide variety of techniques. An  SEM is essential in our plan because it will provide: 1. a link  between molecular and evolutionary processes with complex  morphologies; 2. an effective demonstration of the complementarity  of techniques; and 3. a graphic, easily achieved, and often  beautiful product that provides a sense of accomplishment,  satisfaction, and excitement for students. To encourage information  exchange among undergraduates, we will establish an electronic mail  network and newsgroup (SEMLAB). Using SEMLAB, students at Hofstra  can exchange reciprocally ideas, problems, solutions, techniques,  etc. with students and faculty at other internet nodes. SEMLAB  should stimulate the interests of our students, because they  actually will become members of the \"scientific community.\"",
