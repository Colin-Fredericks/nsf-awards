The energetics of metal migration along alkyl chains will be determined, methods will be developed for the preparation of terminally functionalized polyethylene, and highly functionalized polyethylene will be prepared using previously identified cobalt catalysts. New nickel and palladium catalysts, based on cationic allyl complexed, and highly selective rhodium catalysts will be prepared for the production of functionalized polyethylene.  Some of the highest volume commercial polymers are obtained from the polymerization of olefins. Most commercial catalysts are based on metals which occur on the left side of the periodic chart. This study is aimed at metals in the middle of the chart since these metals are more compatible with a wide variety of  olefins which will permit the design of new catalysts for the improved production of plastics with a wide range of properties.",
