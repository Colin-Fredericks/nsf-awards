A major focus of the  plan is the proposed series of four atomic absorption spectrometry  experiments. After each experiment is done, and students have  examined data from other groups and interpreted their results, they  propose that a full lecture period be allocated for students to  make presentations of their interpretation of the experimental  data. Faculty will summarize student findings and put them into a  practical perspective. The experiments are designed so that the  students will practice the component parts of scientific  investigation. They will use well-designed experiments to make  comparisons of averages or trends, test hypotheses using inductive  reasoning, and examine and interpret relatively large data sets  reduced to graphical form. In addition, they will do short, out-of  lab writing exercises which will be evaluated by their peers.   They intend to make students comfortable with the idea of, and  enchanted with the ability of, the component methodologies of good  laboratory science.",
