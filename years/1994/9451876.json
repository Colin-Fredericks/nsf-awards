 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451876  Brown  Connecticut College has been given a grant from the Olin Foundation  to construct a new science center that will have an observatory on  the roof.  We are requesting funds to equip this observatory with  a new telescope and modern instruments.  We would like to obtain a  research-grade 20 inch telescope, a CCD camera, a spectrometer and  a computer workstation in order to provide better opportunities for  student research in astronomy and astrophysics as well as improve  our introductory astronomy sequence.  The introduction of this new  equipment will significantly enhance the department's major in  astrophysics and minor in astronomy, as students would be able to  engage in a wider variety of research projects using modern  apparatus than previously possible.  We currently use a  hundred-year-old Clark refractor for both teaching, labs, and  research projects.  Students, instead of dealing with science  questions and doing astronomy, spend a great deal of time adapting  the Clark to work with 20th century equipment and expectations. The  new telescope will be the focal point of the observatory and  astronomy program and will greatly contribute to the new prominence  that has recently been given to astronomy at the college.",
