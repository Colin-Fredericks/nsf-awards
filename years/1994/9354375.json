 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354375  Bendall  Students who enroll in introductory physics courses already have  ideas about how the world works. Very often these beliefs are in  contradiction with those of the expert physicist. There is evidence  that traditional instruction has little impact on the  pre-instruction beliefs of students. What is lacking on the  students' part is an integrated conceptual understanding of the  fundamental principles, laws and concepts of physics. In contrast,  physicists understand and utilize comparatively few principles and  concepts of physics to explain a wide variety of phenomena;  principles such as conservation of energy and concepts such as  acceleration. In order for students to develop a conceptual  understanding in physics, they need the opportunity to make sense  of the physics principles and concepts for themselves. Our goal is  to provide them with this opportunity through a two part learning  strategy. First, students will write extensive explanations which  require the use of specific physics ideas. The act of writing well  constructed explanations externalizes students' thoughts, helps  them to organize their thoughts in meaningful ways, and helps  students to make qualitative connections between ideas. The  explanation assignments will require consideration of traditionally  difficult issues such as the differentiation between velocity and  acceleration. These assignments will be developed based on a  taxonomy of conceptual change proposed by Dykstra. Second, students  will participate in a collaborative peer evaluation of the  explanations. Through peer evaluation students are able to see how  others think about physics concepts and principles, individuals can  clarify their own thinking, and they can receive immediate feedback  from peers. We have proposed a number of evaluations to guage the  impact of our strategies on student understanding. If successful,  our learning strategy could be implemented in both the university  algebra-based and calculus-based physics courses , and with  modifications could be used at other course levels.",
