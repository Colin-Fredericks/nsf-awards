 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the student-appeal and effectiveness of instruction for Calculus I, II and  III; Differential Equations; and Finite Mathematics. It will build upon the groundwork laid down  by other projects that emphasize the use of graphing calculators, but will exceed the calculators'  limitations by incorporating the greater power of computers.  The use of graphing calculators in mathematics instruction has been well received. However, in  certain areas -- 3-D graphics, contour plots, implicit plotting, analytic solutions, etc.-- the  calculators lack power, convenience and flexibility. Graphing calculators are also not well-suited  for Finite Mathematics instruction. By using graphing calculators and computers, the project will  enhance the understanding of topics, and give students the technical tools to better analyze & solve  problems.  Forty experiments/projects for the Calculus and Differential Equations courses will be implemented  under the grant. The design will be to emphasize the qualitative properties (such as the shape of  a curve) of the topics under study, rather than the analytic analysis of expressions (algebraic  calculations). The recent applications of mathematics (e.g., linear programming or graph theory)  in disciplines such as economics, biology, and political science require such methods of analysis.  An additional 10 experiments/projects will be implemented for Finite Mathematics, based solely  on computers.  To accomplish this, the project is seeking support for a 35-station computer lab, with appropriate  supporting equipment.",
