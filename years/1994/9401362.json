 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401362  Bridson       This project focuses on three areas of geometric group  theory: quasi-isometry invariants for finitely generated groups,  in particular, the study of isoperimetric inequalities; the  geometry of spaces of non-positive curvature and the structure of  their isometry groups; and automatic group theory and its  generalizations, with emphasis on the task of distinguishing  bewteen the various classes of groups which have arisen in this  context.  Examples drawn from geometry and low-dimensional  topology are of particular interest in each case.  More  specifically, attacks are planned on the problems of determining  the structure of the (countable) set of functions that arise as  Dehn functions of finitely presented groups, and the structure of  the set of flats in a CAT(0) space.  (This last problem is of  particular interest in the case of 3-manifolds.)       Geometric group theory is a young and highly dynamic area of  research in which techniques from geometry and topology are  adapted, extended, and used to solve problems in algebra.  Conversely, geometric problems are converted into questions in  group theory (encoding the symmetry of the geometric problem in  algebra) with startlingly powerful results.  For example,  questions concerning the area of minimal surfaces (like soap  films) can be converted into questions about how hard it is to  solve equations in finitely presented groups.  In many cases this  leads to a sharp solution of the original geometric problem; this  is the nature of the 'isoperimetric inequalities' and 'Dehn  functions' referred to above.  Remarkably, if one pursues this  line further, then deep and fascinating connections become  apparent between linguistics (formal grammars), computer science  (automata theory), and the geometry of interesting spaces such as  3-manifolds (e.g., the universe).  The goal of this project is to  deepen our understanding of these connections.  ***",
