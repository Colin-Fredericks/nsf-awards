 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an outgrowth of recent paleontological expeditions  to Madagascar.  The research include:         (1)  Functional anatomy of extinct lemurs, encompassing            descriptions and functional interpretations of previously            unknown carpal and pedal materials, vertebrae, and            pelves.  The goals are reconstruction of positional            behavior of extinct lemurs, description of new species,            and analysis of patterns of long bone structural            adaptation.         (2)  Lemur evolutionary ontogeny.  Indroids (including the            giant extinct forms) have patterns of dental and somatic            growth that are exceedingly unusual for primates.             Available ontogenetic series will be examined and            compared, using new analytical strategies.         (3)  Geographic variation, sexual variation and phylogeny of            lemurs.  A multivariate analysis of subfossil lemur            skeletal variation will be conducted and a taxonomic            revision of the lemurs will be undertaken, including            phenetic and cladistic treatments of characters            previously studied only among extant lemurs.    Interactive activities include a course on \"The Evolution of  Ontogeny\" and a graduate seminar designed according to student  needs on topics such as:  problems in allometry, mathematical  modelling in evolutionary biology, sexual dimorphism, the evolution  and extinction of Malagasy primates.  In addition, guest lectures  will be offered with special emphasis on subfossil lemurs.",
