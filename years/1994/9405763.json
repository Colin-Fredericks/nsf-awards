As a model system, pigment granule  transport in melanophores from Tilapia mossambica and  Fundulus heteroclitus will be examined.  The cells  cyclically aggregate and disperse pigment to and from the  cell center.   Dispersion is mediated by kinesin and  requires protein phosphorylation by cAMP dependent protein  kinase, while aggregation is mediated by dynein and requires  protein dephosphorylation by calcineurin.  The current  studies seek to determine if the regulatory control is  exerted on dynein, on kinesin, or on both motors.  Studies  will be undertaken to localize the motors during each  direction of transport and to determine if the ability of  either motor to interact with pigment granules or  microtubules differs when obtained from cells undergoing  opposite directions of transport.  During pigment granule  dispersion, the granules saltate, making transient  retrograde excursions during a process of overall  anterograde movements.  Phosphatase activity will be  inhibited in melanophores undergoing dispersion to determine  if saltations require transient dephosphorylation events. In  addition, dynein activity will be inhibited in aggregated  cells or kinesin activity will be inhibited in dispersed  cells to determine if these inhibitions result in  spontaneous dispersion or aggregations.  The results of  these studies should reveal if it is dynein or kinesin that  is regulated.  A protein of 70 kD is specifically  phosphorylated during dispersion and dephosphorylated during  aggregation.  This protein is immunoprecipitated with  antibody to kinesin heavy chain.  Studies will be undertaken  to identify this protein and elucidate how its  phosphorylation state might regulate pigment transport.   %%%  The regulation of skin coloration in fish is due to the  distribution of pigment granules in certain skin cells  called melanophores .  When these granules are tightly  aggregated near the center of the cell, the fish appears  light.  When the granules are dispersed throughout the cell,  the fish appears dark.  When stimulated (e.g., by changes in  ambient light conditions, fright, or other causes), the fish  will change its coloration appropriately.  The mechanism  whereby these subcellular pigment granules move inside the  cell involves cellular motor proteins which transport the  granules along stationary tracks, or cytoskeletal  structures.  The cytoskeletal structures are  called  microtubules, and radiate out into the cytoplasm from a  central location in the cell called the microtubule  organizing center.   The microtubule-associated cellular  motor proteins are called kinesin and dynein.   The goal of  this project is to elucidate exactly how the pigment  granules become associated with the motor proteins, and how  the directionality of the movement is controlled by the  cell.  The significance of the project extends well beyond  simply understanding how fish change color, since  microtubule-mediated intracellular motility is key to many  critical cellular functions, including cellular division  (movement of chromosomes during mitosis), nerve cell  function (movement of synaptic vesicles bearing  neurotransmitters from their site of synthesis to their site  of release from the neuron), and ciliary and flagellar  beating (sliding of microtubules to produce waves of motion  necessary for swimming of sperm and protozoans and for mucus  movement along the lining of the respiratory tract).  Thus,  understanding the mechanisms which regulate the activity of  motor proteins is a cutting edge problem in cell biology.  Furthermore, since the cellular machinery is so very small  (the diameters of cytoskeletal elements are in the nanometer  range), a complete understanding of how these  chemomechanical transducers work can provide a valuable  paradigm for nanofabrication engineering of \"smart\"  materials.  ***",
