 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320733  Milgrom  In the standard theory of markets, prices coordinate a system in  which independent decision makers, acting in their own interest,  manage to use resources efficiently.  Many economic problems,  however, are characterized by fixed costs, indivisible goods, and  other problems, where the price system does not in general lead  to an efficient allocation.  Firms and whole societies can get  stuck at an inefficient allocation, what many economists now call  a coordination failure.  When such a system is characterized by  strong complementarities among various decisions, that structure  can sometimes be exploited to develop a more centralized approach  to overcome the coordination failure.    The broad objective of this research is to understand how firms  and other complex organizations can organize to improve  coordination in these situations.  This project will (1) develop  methods of comparative static analysis, (2) develop testable  implications about the organization of firms based on the  presence of complementarities, (3) identify the characteristics  of decision problems, and (4) identify the sources of resistance  to change by individuals and the methods by which these may be  overcome.  ***",
