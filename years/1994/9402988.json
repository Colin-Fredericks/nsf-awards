 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402988  Morgan       Professor Morgan continues to study Donaldson polynomial  invariants of smooth 4-manifolds M.  This includes searching for  explicit computations.  One is a blow-up formula that would  express the invariants for the connected sum of M with a complex  projective plane in terms of those for M.  Such a formula should  prove essential for understanding general relations among the  invariants.  Another part of the project, continuing work begun  with Tomasz Mrowka of Cal Tech, studies the invariants of a  4-manifold split into two pieces by a 3-torus.  These invariants  should be related by a generalized product formula to the  invariants of the two pieces.  In a more qualitative vein,  Professor Morgan intends to look for other contexts in which  these invariants may be defined, hoping that other points of view  will illuminate the theory and will explain some of the  surprisingly simple and coherent numerical results now being  obtained.  Professor Birman's project centers on the theory of  knots and links in 3-space.  She is approaching this problem from  two points of view.  The first is joint work with W. Menasco (now  in its 8th year, with much of the preliminary work completed).   Its goal is an algorithmic solution to the link problem, via the  theory of braids.  Her second project is closely related to the  first, and involves Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariants of knots and  links in 3-space.  These numerical invariants include all the  information which is contained in the Jones polynomial and its  generalizations, and possibly more.  A central question is  whether Vassiliev invariants contain more information than Jones  invariants, and, in particular,  whether they detect orientation.  The asymptotics of the dimension of the Vassiliev algebra, as the  order of the invariants goes to infinity, also involves some very  interesting problems in combinatorics, which Professor Birman is  studying.       Professor Morgan's research concerns invariants of four-  dimensional man ifolds, while Professor Birman's centers on  computers and knots.  Each is an effort to tame geometric  complexity by rendering it susceptible to numerical or algebraic  computation.  Consider the latter, for example.  While knots are  among the most familiar of everyday objects (as every fisherman  knows), their classification turns out to be a deep and difficult  problem in 3-manifold topology.  Roughly speaking, given two  knots, one would like to be able to decide (with the help of a  computer) if one can be twisted and deformed, keeping its ends  fixed and without cutting the string) until it looks like the  other.  Precisely describing a method for doing this is an  unsolved problem on which Professor Birman is working (with W.  Menasco, of SUNY Buffalo).  A different aspect of the same  question concerns a vast collection of computable invariants  (discoverd by V. Vassiliev) which give a partial answer to the  knot question.  With regard to the algebraic invariants, the  central question is exactly what information is 'missed' by the  Vassiliev invariants.  While the motivation for this work is a  wish to understand the underlying mathematical structure, one  would expect that answers to questions such as the ones being  asked would have applications wherever knots (or 4-manifolds)  occur, i.e. to biology, chemistry, and physics.  ***",
