 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith-Ferri    With National Science Foundation support, the Grace Hudson  Museum, which is located in the city of Ukiah, California, will  curate the Pomoan materials collected during the late 19th and  early 20th centuries. The Pomoan Indians inhabited this region of  California, to the North of San Francisco and Grace Hudson, her  father and later her husband collected Pomoan materials in a  careful and systematic fashion. The documentation which  accompanies the collection is, in most cases, detailed and the  scientific value of the materials is increased by photographs,  systematic ethnographic investigation and related correspondence.  Unfortunately the collection suffers from disorganization and a  lack of cataloguing and cross-referencing that renders much of  these important holdings inaccessible to all but the most  knowledgeable and persistent researchers. With NSF support, the  museum will: re-transcribe linguistic manuscripts into  a  universal phonetic transcription system; catalogue and annotate  photographs; catalogue baskets and other ethnographic artifacts;  work with manuscripts and correspondence to increase their  general availability.    The last native speaker of Pomo is extremely old and much of what  is known of early historic Pomoan lifeways is contained in the  collections of the Hudson Museum and a few other institutions.  Not only are these materials of great historical significance,  but they are also invaluable scientific resources. In their  current condition however they are very difficult to use and this  grant will significantly increase their access to the scientific  community.",
