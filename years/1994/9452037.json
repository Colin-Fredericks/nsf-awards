 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452037  McCabe  A programming laboratory for Computer Networks is proposed.  Standard Computer Networks texts and curricula have emphasized  general concepts ranging from the physical layer to the application  layer, but most undergraduate Computer Networks courses fail to  provide experiences of network management and program development  in an actual network environment. A basic knowledge of Computer  Networks has become a necessary part of the undergraduate  curriculum for CS students. Exposure to network concepts is not  enough. For most students, network concepts remain abstract and  difficult to understand if lecture material is not followed by  laboratory exercises that crystallize the concepts. Since standard  network systems are used as an environment for intensive network  programming assignments, the resulting laboratory manuals are  portable to other universities.",
