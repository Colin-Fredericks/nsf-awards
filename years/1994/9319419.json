 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319419  Bentrude  New free radical and photochemical reactions of tri- and   penta-coordinate phosphorous molecules will be studied with   attention directed to reaction mechanisms and synthetic   applications. The reactions will include the use of   organophosphorous molecules as free radical trapping agents   and the chemistry of cation radicals produced from tri-  coordinate phosphorous derivatives by single-electron   transfer. Photochemical studies will include   photorearrangements of allyl phosphite triesters and photo-  Abruzov rearrangements of benzyl phosphites. Questions of   1,3-biradical intermediates in the allylic rearrangement and   of singlet or triplet excited states in the photo-Abruzov   rearrangement will be explored.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Wesley G. Bentrude at the   University of Utah. New reactions of molecules containing   phosphorous atoms with three and four other atoms or groups   attached will be studied. The groups will contain carbon,   hydrogen, oxygen, and other atoms. The reactions will   include trapping of carbon free radicals (e.g., carbon   bonding to three other atoms and possessing one non-bonded   electron) and ultraviolet-light induced reactions. Attention   will be given to the detailed steps in these reactions and   synthetic applications. This work provides potential impact   in areas such as antitumor and antiviral agents, fuel   additives, pesticides, and key biochemical intermediates.  ***",
