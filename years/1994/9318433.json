 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evans  9318433       Many organisms, when faced with unfavorable environmental  conditions, respond by slowing or arresting growth and development.   At one end of the scale, animals such as bears have the ability to  slow metabolism by hibernating.  At the other end of the spectrum,  many higher plants have the ability to more or less arrest growth  and development of seeds until favorable conditions are  experienced.  This dormancy of seeds has led to the existence of  seed banks--populations of dormant, viable seeds in the soil.       Despite the profound implications for the ecology and  evolution of plants, virtually no information is available on how  dormancy affects other traits.  Two experiments will address this  question in the short-lived perennial desert mustard Lesquerella  fendleri.  The first explores whether past evolution has led to  adaptive syndromes of germination requirements and  post-  germination traits.  The second asks how evolution could act by  performing an artificial selection experiment.       This work has applied value in several regards.  Efforts to  understand plant responses to environmental change will remain  incomplete (and perhaps erroneous) until we understand the  important, but neglected, seed stage of the life cycle.  Knowledge  of the seed stage is also critical for plans to revegetate human-  impacted lands.",
