In a multi-pronged effort to demonstrably affect 100 6th and 7th  grade middle school students activities include:  year-round,  campus, local school and community-based components, led by trained  EPWG Clud Advisors; linking distinguished scientists,  mathematicians and engineers with clubs through an \"Adopt-a-Club\"  modality; offering a mentor/mentee semester-long experience;  teacher-training and curriculum enhancement for middle school  staff; and parent empowerment through an EPWG Parent Advisory  Council.    Broad goals are:  to foster a positive climate of \"women to women\"  to sustain the young women's interest, curiosity and achievement in  order that they might pursue viable careers in SEM; to utilize a  multi-disciplinary approach that integrates science, math and  technology; to affect curriculum development and enhancement, as  well as teacher-training; to harness community, industry, school  district and University interest to successfully intervene with  young women to present a model for dissemination through journals,  associations, a video presentation and other publicity.  ***",
