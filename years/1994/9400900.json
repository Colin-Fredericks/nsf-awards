 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400900  Floyd       Professor Floyd plans to continue a joint research project,  with Professor J. W. Cannon (of Brigham Young University) and  Professor W.R. Parry (of Eastern Michigan University), in  geometric group theory. Their research is an attempt to prove the  conjecture that a word hyperbolic group with visual sphere at  infinity the 2-sphere acts cocompactly, properly discontinuously,  and isometrically on real hyperbolic 3-space.  By a result of  Cannon-Swenson, proving the conjecture is equivalent to proving  that a particular shingling of the visual sphere at infinity is  conformal.  The main emphasis of the project is on determining  when a sequence of shinglings of a surface is conformal.       An important special case is to understand the  intrinsicgeometry of a sequence of tilings given by a finite  subdivision rule.  As an example of a finite subdivision rule,  consider subdividing a rectangle (tile) by dividing it in half  horizontally and into thirds vertically, so as to get six smaller  rectangles (subtiles) of equal size.  If one repeats the process  inductively on the subtiles, one gets new subtiles which are  becoming distorted (tall and narrow).  Understanding whether one  can change the shapes so that the subtiles do not become  arbitrarily distorted is at the heart of an important problem in  topology and group theory.  The investigators are trying to  prove that, in the cases under consideration, there is an  intrinsic geometry in which the subtiles do not become distorted.   In some examples, to achieve this one changes the shapes of the  tiles so that they have fractal boundaries.  ***",
