 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores adaptive methods for high performance, lossy  signal compression, and in particular, focuses on a variety of  methods that rely on signal expansions.  Among these are: (1)  signal adaptive expansions that include quantization and entropy  coding.  These are generalizations of transform or subband/wavelet  and wavelet packet schemes.  In particular, adaptive wavelet  packets are being studied, both from the point of a view of  constructing bases and that of finding good and efficient  algorithms to find the best bases.  (2) Overcomplete expansions or  frames.  The focus is on quantization performance and computational  complexity.  (3) The class of compression algorithms that use  successive approximation.  A rage-distortion version of matching  pursuit is being developed; generalizations of hierarchical methods  based on wavelets and wavelet packers are being investigated.  (4)  Adaptive schemes for compression, including adaptive transforms and  quantization.  Goals include a lossy equivalent of arithmetic  coding, and a lossy dictionary based predictive compression scheme  that resembles a lossy Lempel-Ziv algorithm.",
