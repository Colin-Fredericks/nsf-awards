 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416354  Wood  Tilt-up construction is widely used throughout the U.S. for low-  rise industrial and warehouse facilities.  Tilt-up buildings are  economical to construct, however, they are susceptible to seismic  damage.  Approximately 25% of the tilt-up buildings in the  epicentral area sustained structural damage during the 1994  Northridge earthquake.    The objective of this project is to develop procedures for  evaluating existing tilt-up construction and designing cost-  effective rehabilitation schemes.  Establishing a link between  the structural characteristics of the building and the expected  performance during an earthquake is emphasized in this study.    In-situ tests of tilt-up buildings will be conducted to evaluate  diaphragm stiffness, damping characteristics, and displacement  distributions.  The results of these tests, together with data  collected on tilt-up buildings damaged in the Northridge  earthquake, will be used to validate detailed analytical models  under development.  Existing retrofit requirements as well as the  latest proposed changes will be reviewed and summarized.  Typical  rehabilitation schemes will be evaluated.    Alternate analytical models and design methodology that are  consistent with dynamic behavior of tilt-up construction will be  developed.    The results of this investigation will provide a basis for  evaluating the seismic vulnerability of and developing cost-  effective rehabilitation schemes for the large number of  potentially hazardous tilt-up buildings throughout the U.S.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project, involving complementary  efforts between the University of Illinois and a consulting  engineering firm, Wiss, Janney, Elstner and Associates.  ***",
