 "awd_abstract_narration": "940577  Nevai       This project is concerned with mathematical research in  approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials and related areas of  analysis.  The work involves extremal problems, ordinary and  generalized polynomial inequalities, difference and differential  equations, spectral theory of real, complex and matrix-valued  tridiag  gonal (Jacobi) and banded matrices, Toeplitz and Hankel  and Hilbert space operators.  Work will also continue on the  development of software directed at analyzing the numerical  aspects of orthogonal polynomials.  Specifics of the research  include investigations into conditions on assuring boundedness  for solutions of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous perturbations  oflinear difference equations in terms of their unperturbed  counterparts.  The ratio and comparative asymptotics of extremal  problems involving weighted best approximation of monomials by  lower degree polynomials will be taken up.  Efforts to understand  the connection between a Jacobi matrix and its spectral measure  and its analogues on the unit circle will also be made.  Work  will be done extending recent results on the asymptotic behavior  of Christoffel functions to measures in the complex plane and on  generalized polynomials and their suitability as means of  approximation.        Approximation theory and especially the theory of orthogonal  polynomials has fruitful connections with many branches of  mathematics such as differential equations, operator theory,  numerical integration, continued fractions and control theory, to  name a few.  These subjects have received strong impulses from  the theory of orthogonal polynomials in the past and this process  continues with increasing vigor.  ***",
