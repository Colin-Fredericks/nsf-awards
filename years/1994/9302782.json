 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed toward computational solution   of the  linear particle transport equation, which usually is termed    simply the  ``transport equation.''  This equation historically has    provided a major  challenge to the state-of-the-art computer  hardware   available at any given  time.  More specifically, the  project is directed toward   spatial approximations  to this  equation, because new approaches and better basic   understanding  in  this area seem essential to permit the solution of the    transport equation in  the complex material arrangements  underlying some of the   emerging applications  of this equation  (e.g., identification of underground waste   locations for  environmental restoration).    A certain abstract model (CLOF methods) of one-dimensional   approximations in particle transport  is being extended and   applied, as follows:  a massively parallel code is being developed for a  general   class of  one-dimensional spatial  approximations; the model is being  extended to multiple (two or more)  spatial dimensions; a   that permits computational determination of  the order of   accuracy of an  arbitrary two-dimensional CLOF is being developed; the CLOF  methods that have the very desirable  property of satisfying   the diffusion limit  are being  characterized.  The corner-balance method, which   is a novel  spatial  approximation that seems to enjoy several properties   that  are highly  desirable for multidimensional calculations, is being   extended to the  three-dimensional setting,  initially for parallelepiped   cells, and subsequently  for  meshes composed of cells that are general (convex)    polyhedra.",
