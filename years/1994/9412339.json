 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412339  Hansen         The most common model used in applied econometrics to study  the properties of time series is the \"unit root model.\"  A  multivariate generalization of univariate unit roots which allows  for common unit root components is the model of cointegration.   In most applications, testing for unit roots or cointegration are  viewed as useful preliminary steps in the building of an  empirical models.  But in many cases, cointegration emerges as an  implication of an economic model and cointegration tests can be  used to directly test the model.  Examples include studies of the  life-cycle model, the present value model of stock prices, real  business cycle models, models of the term structure of interest  rates, a model of intertemporal consumption, and the long-run  money demand function.  But unit root and cointegration tests can  not be used for many economic applications because they are not  powerful enough to discriminate among competing hypotheses given  the typical number of observations available in economic data.    This project develops a method for increasing the power of unit  root and cointegration tests dramatically by using information  that is ignored by more conventional methods, generalizes this  method to all cases, uses the technique of local-to-unity  asymptotics to investigate the adequacy of the asymptotic  approximations in finite samples, and reexamines the Nelson-  Plosser data set to see if the improved tests can shed light on  the stochastic properties of the series.",
