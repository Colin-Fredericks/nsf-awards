Shaw      A general purpose analytical electron microscope (AEM) Model JEM-2010 with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis capability will be purchased.  The instrument is manufactured by JEOL, Ltd.  The AEM will replace the outdated Amray 1000A electron microscope with EDX capability purchased thirteen years ago through NSF grant.  The 200kV AEM system with a spatial resolution of 2.3 nm will provide both structural and chemical information at near-atomic-level.  Data and image processing software included with the package will provide better visualization and understanding of the microstructure of materials under investigation.  The AEM/EDX equipped with a TV monitoring system is controlled by user friendly software, which is ideally suited for the large number of users anticipated for this instrument.    The AEM will be maintained and operated by a research associate who has extensive experience in electron microscopy and sample preparation.  He will be responsible for training graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the proper use of the instrument and data interpretation.  The on-going sponsored programs will utilize the instrument in the following areas:  phase identification in nanocomposite superparamagneric materials; phase identification and evolution in oxide superconductors; growth kinetics of sputtered and laser deposited semiconductor/superconductor thin films; grain boundary and substrate/film interface studies of semiconductor and superconducting thin films; and high temperature refractories and catalysts.    The analytical electron microscop will generate the following activity:  it will (a) enhance the quality of on-going research in materials related sciences at the State University of New York; (b) provide a hands-on experience to graduate students and post doctoral fellows on the state-of-the-art instrument; (c) provide the necessary data for future research programs addressing new technologies; and (d) increase university -industrial  collaboration through materials characterization and technology transfer.",
