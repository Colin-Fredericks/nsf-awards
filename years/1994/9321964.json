 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321964  Zhu        This award supports mathematical research on problems  related to the modern theory of functions of a complex variable  and operator theory for operators defined on spaces of such  functions.  The primary objective of the work focuses on the  structure of Bergman spaces of analytic function defined in a  disc.  Recent results have established a factorization of  functions in the Bergman spaces similar to that found in the  classic Hardy spaces.  With this new development arises the  possibility that a classification of the subspaces invariant  under multiplication by the identity function will be possible.   Work will be done on this question.  A second, related line of  investigation concerns Toeplitz operators arising from projection  of functions into the Bergman space.  One question of particular  interest is the identification of those Toeplitz operators which  are hyponormal.  Finally, work will be done on Bergman spaces in  several complex variables to study those domains for which the  Bergman projection of the Lp-functions is surjective onto the  space of Lp-holomorphic functions.        Studies in complex analysis combine the regularity of  analytic functions, the geometry of complex domains and the  subtleties of boundary characteristics to provide a basis for  deep and powerful ideas relating many different areas of  mathematics.  The application have ranged from partial  differential equations and harmonic analysis to the geometry of  circle packing.   ***",
