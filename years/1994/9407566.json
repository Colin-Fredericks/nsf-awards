 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of hydrocarbons are emitted into the atmosphere  from both natural and anthropogenic sources.  Isoprene (2-methyl-  1,3-butadiene) is of particular interest because it has the largest  global flux of any single hydrocarbon species with the possible  exception of methane,  Isoprene reacts rapidly with hydroxyl  radical (OH) and ozone (O3) in the presence of NOx forming   3-buten-2 one( methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) and 2-methyl-2-propenal  (methacrolein, MACR).  Once formed, tropospheric MVK and MACR, as  well as many other hydrocarbon oxidation products, may undergo a  variety of reactions in the gas phase.       It is likely that MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation  products can also partition into atmospheric water drops and  undergo subsequent aqueous-phase reactions leading to the formation  of peroxyl radicals (HO2/RO2) and other oxidant species, and there  by, consuming MVK and MACR.  Peroxyl radicals can destroy  tropospheric O3 and form  peroxides that rapidly oxidize sulfur  dioxide (SO2) in the aqueous phase.  The sulfate aerosol that is  subsequently formed efficiently backscatters incoming solar  radiation and exerts a significant cooling effect upon climate.       These researchers therefore will study: 1) partitioning of  MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation products from the gas  phase into water, 2) aqueous-phase photochemistry of MVK, MACR, and  other hydrocarbon oxidation products under conditions that are  typical of atmospheric water drops, and 3) aqueous-phase reactions  of MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation products with selected  photochemical oxidants.",
