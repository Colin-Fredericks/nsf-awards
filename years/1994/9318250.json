In recent  years, the role of the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be more  than structural.  This filamentous network functions in  intracellular movement, polarity development, and integration of  cellular signals in a variety of organisms.  Although the role of  the actin cytoskeleton in the growth and development of higher  plants has so far received limited study, the role of actin  microfilaments in the environmentally controlled development of  polarity of the brown alga, Fucus, has been elegantly described.   It is likely that changes in the actin cytoskeleton play equally  important roles in the development and environmental responses of  flowering plants.  The plant cytoskeleton is uniquely suited to act  as the signal transducer from the membrane and extracellular  matrix, which sense external events, to the auxin transport stream  which allows response to these signals.    The experiments in this proposal are designed to test the new  hypothesis that polar auxin transport is regulated by interactions  of the regulatory protein of the auxin efflux carrier with the  cytoskeleton.  In order to understand the nature of the regulation  of auxin transport, the interaction between the inhibitor or  napthylphthalamic acid (NPA) binding protein of the auxin efflux  carrier and actin must be further delineated.  Using molecular  probes and basic biochemical approaches, the interactions between  the NPA binding protein and the actin cytoskeleton during polar  development will be examined.  These experiments will be performed  using Fucus as a simplified model system.      Although it has been more than one hundred years since Darwin  suggested the importance of polar hormone transport in plants, the  mechanisms by which auxin transport is regulated still remain  unclear.  The polarity a nd quantity of auxin transported are  controlled at the site of auxin efflux from cells.  A regulatory  protein has been identified which binds specific inhibitors of  auxin transport that act at the site of auxin efflux.   Characterization of this inhibitor binding protein, and the  mechanisms by which it controls auxin transport, is the critical  first step in the dissection of the regulatory pathway of auxin  transport.  ***",
