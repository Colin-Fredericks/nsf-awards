These problems are related because questions about lattice  varieties can often be interpreted as problems in free lattices.   The first objective of this work is to determine which finitely  generated equational classes of lattices have a term rewrite  system.  The second objective is to find an algorithm for  determining all lattice varieties which cover a given finitely  generated lattice variety.  The principal investigator will also  study which ordered sets can be embedded in free lattices, and  which lattices are sublattices of free lattices.                 Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure  reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.   This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many  mathematical environments.  It also means that problems are easy  to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature.  The  results of this work will impact many areas of mathematics,  computer science, the social sciences and business management.",
