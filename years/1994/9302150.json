 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302150  TAKAHASHI    CFCs (CFC-11., -12 and -113) and CO2 (total CO2 concentration and  pCO2) will be measured in seawater during the French CONFLUENCE  program in the western South Atlantic Ocean between 35.0S and 43.5S  in collaboration with Dr. Veronique Garcon of Observatoir Midi-  Purenees, CNRS, Toulouse, and Dr. Christine Provost of Universite  P.-et-M.  Curie, Paris.  The French Research Vessel Le Suroit has  been scheduled for the expedition, December 1993, through January  1994, and the ship's time and hydrographic program have been funded  by CNRS. The Scientific objectives of the proposed study are as  follows: 1) Investigate ventilation of the South Atlantic  subtropical gyre thermocline waters by the mode waters using CFCs  and minimum potential vorticity as tracers.  Since near surface  waters in the confluence zone are highly undersaturated with  respect to atmospheric CO2, the CO2 uptake and transport by the  mode waters can be estimated using these chemical and physical  tracers.  2) In intermediate depths, a CFC maximum is associated  with the salinity minimum of AAIW.  The circulations pathway and  time of formation of AAIW will be investigated using CFCs. 3) The  data obtained during the 1988-89 SAVE program show that the western  boundary undercurrent which flows poleward along the Argentine  continental slopes at a depth of about 2000 meters exhibits a local  minimum in CO2 and CFC.  These signals have been traced from 10S to  about 35S. Temporal and spatial changes in the CFC and CO2 signals  will help to understand the spreading processes of NADW in the  South Atlantic.  4) High CFC values have been detected in bottom  waters entering into the Argentine Basin from the South Georgia  Basin. These CFCs will be measured in the bottom water in order to  learn its spreading pathway in the Argentine Basin.",
