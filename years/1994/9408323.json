 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408323  Harnishfeger      The goal of this RPG project is to investigate developmental changes in cognitive inhibition in children's memory performance.  Cognitive inhibition is defined as the process of actively suppressing previously activated cognitive contents of cognitive processes.  The theoretical basis of this research is that children's cognitive inhibition increases in efficiency with age over the middle childhood years, and this increasing efficiency contributes to developmental improvements in memory performance.  This research will focus on one specific form of inhibition, retrieval inhibition, which has been identified as a central component of performance in directed-forgetting memory tasks.  Results from this research will be important in the continuing attempt to determine the underlying bases for age-related improvements in memory and cognitive processing.",
