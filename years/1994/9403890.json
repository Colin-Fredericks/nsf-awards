 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403890  Matalon        This program is concerned with the dynamic behavior of premixed and  diffusion (non-premixed) flames. It is proposed to derive simplified  mathematical models that permit the description of flames of general shapes in  open and confined environments, and to study dynamical aspects of flame  behavior within this framework by means of asymptotic and perturbation methods  supplemented by numerical computations. Specific problems that will be  addressed include identifying intrinsic instabilities associated with  diffusion flames, exploring the dynamics and stability of premixed flames  complicated by non uniform flow fields and by effects due to confinement, and  examining the dynamics of flame spread over liquid fuels.        The significance of the proposed research is enhancement of the current  understanding of the complex phenomena involved in combustion processes. The  proposed work is not only of fundamental importance to combustion science but  has also direct relevance to practical applications.          This proposal consists of a basic research program whose aim is gaining  fundamental understanding on how the complex chemical and physical processes  interact in real combustion systems. The problems under consideration include  the burning of premixed combustible gases in open and confined environments  which is of interest in various engineering systems, flame spread over  flammable liquids which is of great importance in fire hazards with accidental  spillage, and the burning of pure (nonpremixed) fuels which is most relevant  to fire safety and fire prevention. To gain insight into these problems, and  in particular into the mechanisms responsible for the sustenance of the  burning and those responsible for its extinguishement, it is proposed to  develop simplified mathematical models and analyze them in depth. This  approach, which identifies cause and effect, is likely to explain and guide  experimental observations. A deep understanding often lead to suggest ions of  new directions for experiments and design.",
