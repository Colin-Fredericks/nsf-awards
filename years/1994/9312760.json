First, a linear inverse model based on  the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of a series of runs of  the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) will be developed.  The SWE were  chosen for ease of comparison with previous and ongoing studies.   This simple inverse model will include the EOFs, their tendencies,  and statistical noise.    EOFs will then be used to construct an inverse model of the  Community Climate Model of NCAR.  Such an inverse model has not yet  been applied to climate models to our knowledge.  Thus a simple  (fast, easy-to-run) climate model with statistics identical to the  full climate model on which it was based will be constructed.  Such  a model will be useful for instances where the statistics need be  to reproduced, but for which the exact time development is not  essential.  Various sensitivity analyses will be performed to  determine the best methods to construct these models.    This line of research will lead to a new method to decrease the  number of degrees of freedom necessary to obtain adequate  resolution in some geophysical models.  In addition, it will give  new insight into the interactions of the empirical modes of motion.    This work is preliminary to developing s fully nonlinear climate  model based on orthogonal projections.    It is important because it would facilitate the testing of climate  hypotheses which require credible but simple (computationally  cheap) climate models.    This research is funded under the NSF USGCRP CMAP program.",
