A series of 16 state specific    Living With The Shore books has been produced by the Study of Developed Shorelines at Duke University.  The shore series has been mainly funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The new books signal the expansion of the shore series into the realm of multihazards.  The multihazard volumes will consist of compilations of available knowledge on local geologic hazards plus field observations to provide the basis for site specific hazards maps with hazard risk ratings.  The elements of mitigation for both property damage and personal risk will also be discussed (including considerations of earthquake and high wind construction codes).  The goal of the project is to further the dissemination and utilization of scientific and engineering knowledge on hazards. The volumes are intended for public consumption. This activity is being funded cooperatively by NSF and FEMA.",
