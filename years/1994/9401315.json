 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401315  Yeh    technical abstract:  The effects of controlled defects on the  vortex phases and dynamics of high-temperature and conventional  superconductors will be investigated by systematically varying the  type and density of defects in the superconducting samples.  In  particular, the role of zero, one, and two-dimensional defects, as  well as their interplay on the vortex phases and the phase  transitions, will be studied by measurements of low-frequency (dc-  10 MHz) electrical transport and magnetic properties.  The samples  are yttrium barium copper oxide single crystals with controlled  densities of point and columnar defects.  In addition, the  microwave vortex dynamics associated with the local pinning  properties of superconductors wil be compared with the critical  dynamics obtained at lower frequencies.    Non-technical abstract:  The presence of defects in superconductors  plays an important role in determining their response to external  electromagnetic fields and their tolerance to the increase of  temperature.  The main theme of this work is to investigate the  effects of controlled defects on the properties of high temperature  and conventional superconductors in large applied magnetic fields.   Information learned from this investigation can lead to  optimizarion of the properties of these superconductors for a  variety of applications in large magnetic fields, including  microwave components for communication signal detection and  processing, as well as high performance superconducting magnets.  ***",
