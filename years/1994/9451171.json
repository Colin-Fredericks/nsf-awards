The goal is to make the  learning and appreciation of mathematics a shared responsibility on  campus by enhancing the mathematics components of a wide range of  courses, especially in the core (or general education) curriculum.  The computer lab supports this effort as well as undergraduate  mathematics courses, including Calculus, Linear Algebra and  Differential Equations.  The initial reform of the mathematics  curriculum is the use of the Harvard Calculus Consortium materials  supported by the use of this computer laboratory.  The lab is  staffed and managed in a newly created Mathematics Center.  The  Director builds upon past experience and expertise in the uses of  technology in mathematics education. He works with faculty outside  the Mathematics Department to enhance the role of mathematics and  technology in their courses, assists students in coping with  mathematics-related assignments and helps to revise mathematics  courses.",
