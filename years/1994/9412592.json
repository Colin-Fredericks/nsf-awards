As a result, promoters of  technological innovations frequently make claims regarding the  significance of those innovations in realms far removed from the  specific activities directly related to the innovation.  Advocates of geographic information systems (GISs), for example,  have claimed that wide-spread adoption of GISs will minimize  locational conflicts by making a greater range of more accurate  and more current information available to conflicting parties.  This assertion has not been scientifically tested, however.  Researchers who have examined the sources and dynamics of  conflict among people and groups have identified two separate  bases of conflicts.  \"Cognitive conflict\" relates to conflicts  based on different interpretations of factual information.  Evidence exists that new information technologies like GISs often  facilitate resolution of conflict by helping conflicting parties  to operate from more similar knowledge bases.  In contrast.  \"interest conflict\" is based on differences in the values of  conflicting parties.  This Research Planning Grant for Women  Scientists will conduct a pilot study of methods designed to  examine the ways that underlying value differences affect the use  of GISs by conflicting parties.  Three case studies will be used  to examine an alternative hypothesis that holds that GISs  increase rather than decrease conflict over land uses, because  the additional \"facts\" and analyses available through use of a  GIS are used selectively by the different parties to support  their own positions.  The three case studies consist of  examinations of financial redlining, electoral redistricting, and  distribution of public goods in legislative districts.  Each case  study will consist of identification of \"key players\" in the  controversy followed by telephone and face-to-face interviews   with those participants, during which special emphasis will be  placed on the role of GIS technology in the resolution or  continuation of conflict.       As a planning grant, the primary purpose of this award will  be to develop and refine research methods that can be used in a  more comprehensive study on this topic.  This pilot also will  yield more immediate benefits.  In addition to contributing to  new understandings of the specific cases under intensive review,  the project will enhance theoretical discussions of the forms and  roles of cognitive and interest factors in conflicts and the  social consequences of new information technologies.",
