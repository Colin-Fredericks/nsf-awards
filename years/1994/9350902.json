 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350902  Dugan  The project creates an instrumentation repair and maintenance  service for small colleges in Appalachia and surrounding regions in  Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.   These small academic institutions must buy and use modern  scientific instruments so their mostly rural students are not at a  disadvantage compared to those at major universities.  Factory  service for these instruments is, however, prohibitively expensive,  and they are often idle when in need of repair due to this high  cost.  This program addresses this need by utilizing the service  infrastructure at the University of Kentucky College of Engineering  as a support base of technical expertise to keep these instruments  operational at affordable costs to the small colleges.  Startup  funding is being provided by the grant, and through user fees the  colleges are contributing an increasing share of the costs as the  program becomes fully established.",
