The workshop will  include presentation and discussion of results from research  conducted under NSF Grant No. 91-08033 to the University of Miami  and the associated subcontract with Florida International  University's Drinking Water Research Center.  This research has  been conducted with a large, engineering-scale, electron-beam  accelerator located at the Miami-Dade wastewater treatment plant  on Virginia Key.  The workshop will address progress made in  destruction of hazardous organic compounds in contaminated water,  soil and gaseous waste streams and the potential application of  this environmental technology for disinfection of infectious  medical solid and liquid wastes.    The workshop is expected to result in identification of further  needed research that has promise of advancing uses of ionizing  radiation in engineering design of processes and systems for  decontamination of environmental resources.  ***",
