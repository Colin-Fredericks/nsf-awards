 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418779  Zou       This award supports mathematical research on problems  arising in two areas of nonlinear partial differential equations.  The first is related to the analysis of the asymptotic behavior  and classification of positive solutions of semilinear equations  in n-dimensional space, focusing on the Lane-Emden equation. The  problem has been studied exhaustively in various special cases.    Extensions and generalizations of this work will also be carried  out.  Uniqueness of positive solutions, especially in the case of  radial solutions will also be taken up.  A new direction  of research concerns existence and non-existence questions  for semilinear systems such as the Fujita system.  More  applied studies will consider the thermistor problem,  analyzing electrical resistors whose resistance increases rapidly  with increasing temperature.  Finally, work will be done on  the existence problem for ground states for quasilinear elliptic  quations and the Dirichlet problem for the Monge-Amper Equation          Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
