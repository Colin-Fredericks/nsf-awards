As a step toward elucidating the  details of these processes, this project studies the rates of  some of the rapid and reversible chemical events that occur in  the submembrane region.  Three subprojects focus on different but  related aspects of this reversible chemistry.  The first  subproject measures the rates of reversible binding and unbinding  among certain key cytoskeletal proteins and between these  proteins and the membrane lipids.  Surface diffusion rates of  these proteins while they are nonspecifically adsorbed at the  membrane is also measured and evaluated for its possible role in  enhancing the reaction rate to specific sites.  The particular  proteins whose interactions are to be examined are all actin-  binding ones; myosin I, the spectrin/calmodulin system, protein  4.1, and actin itself.  The second subproject examines the rapid  time course changes in local calcium ion in the immediate  submembrane region, in contrast to the transient changes farther  into the cell, that act as a trigger for actin polymerization in  some cases and exocytosis of secretory vesicles in other cases.   The third project examines the rate of cholesterol transmembrane  translocation (flip-flop) which is believed to affect the cell  surface's plasticity during membrane shape changes and may even  play a role in regulating those changes.  %%%   This project examines the speed of reactions that occur just  beneath the membrane of biological cells. These reactions are  very likely to be important in determining the cells' mechanical  properties, its ability to move around, and its response to  external natural chemicals. Because these reactions are localized  in a very thin region, this project also develops or extends  novel optical techniques particularly useful for s tudying  biochemistry at surfaces, techniques that should find  applications beyond the particular experiments here. The novel  optical techniques are based around modifications of fluorescence  microscopes, so that binding and unbinding of molecules to  membrane surfaces, random diffusion of molecules for small  distances along these surfaces, rapid changes of salt  concentrations right near surfaces, and flipping of molecules  from one side of a membrane to the other, can be detected and the  corresponding rates can be measured.    There are three main subprojects. The first looks at the dynamics  of formation and dissolution of protein filaments that form a  biological cell's \"skeleton\" at the points where it connects with  the cell surface from the inside. In order to interpret the  results and draw some general conclusions, a variety of living  and model biological systems will be studied. The second  subproject examines whether the calcium ion concentration just  beneath the membrane changes in a different manner than the  calcium ion concentration farther inside the cell upon chemical  stimulation of the cell. Calcium is believed to play a central  role in the triggering of several membrane reactions, and this  project offers a fluorescence method to examine the calcium  chemistry in a highly localized region. The third subproject  examines the rates at which lipid molecules flip from one side of  the membrane to the other. This flipping can have important  effects on the cells mechanical properties and the reactions that  occur in the membrane.  ***",
