 "awd_abstract_narration": "19405075  Molz    During the past decade, interest in the use of fractal concepts to  describe various phenomena in the Earth Sciences, including  subsurface hydrology, has been increasing.  It has become apparent  that many, if not most, porous media posses a hierarchical  structure.  It is not clear how classical transport theory based on  the concept of a representative elementary volume should be applied  at the vastly different scales of interest in such natural media.   While it is not known how the term \"hierarchical structure\" should  be defined, there is experimental evidence that the hierarchical  structure of the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity function  exhibits the spatial structure of certain self-affine, stochastic  fractals called Gaussian noise (fGn) and fractional Brownian motion  (fBm).  This work would develop a fractal-based method for  constructing three-dimensional distributions of field-measured K  from a limited number of measurements.  Three dimensional horizontal K distributions will be obtained at a  variety of field sites using the new electromagnetic (EM) borehole  flowmeter.  Data sets will then be analyzed for the presence of  fGn/fBm using rescaled range analysis.  This will be followed by  the generation of stochastic K interpolations and a study of the  distribution properties using modern computer graphics.  Finally,  an attempt will be made to relate the potential fractal properties  of natural porous media to the physics of the probably chaotic  processes that determine the property distributions of sediments.  From an aquifer transport viewpoint, K is the single most important  property function.  For any particular aquifer, K varies over one  or more orders of magnitude and is highly heterogeneous.  Yet  making sense of the K distribution is often a prerequisite to  understanding the pattern of contaminant migration in polluted  aquifers.  A tremendous amount of money is spent attempting to  characterize aquifers using tools that are not adequate  to the  task.  The proposed work has the potential to lead to the  development of new theoretical tools and practical insights that  could contribute significantly to the long-term solution of  subsurface contamination problems.  It will have the potential to  establish a new practical framework for transport phenomena at a  variety of scales in natural porous media.",
