 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. M. Heaven of the Chemistry Department of Emory University   will study the weak bonding interactions and predissociation dynamics of   open shell van der Waals molecules.  Specifically, the van der Waals   complexes formed by the hydroxyl, cyanogen and methyne radicals with rare   gas atoms will be investigated.   The excited electronic states will be   characterized by  high resolution fluorescence excitation spectroscopy,   fluorescence depletion spectroscopy, and quantum beat measurements.  The   electronic ground states will be probed by stimulated emission pumping   techniques.  For the lighter systems, ab initio calculations of the   potential energy surfaces will be performed to complement the   experimental results.  Electronic and vibrational predissociation will be   investigated through wavelength resolved fluorescence and pulsed laser   pump-probe measurements.    The study of weakly bound van der Waals complexes is one of the frontier   areas of contemporary physical chemistry.  While numerous van der Waals   complexes formed by stable (closed shell)  molecules have been   investigated, the study of such complexes in which one of the component   members is a radical (molecular fragment) is still in its early stages.     Owing to the presence of significant electron spin couplings of the   radical with its closed shell partner, theoretical models developed for   the bonding interactions in closed shell van der Waals complexes are not   applicable to open shell systems.  This research provides an important   data base for open shell van der Waals complexes for the development of   theoretical models of these systems.  The results of this research are of   direct relevance to work on collisional processes involving open shell   diatomics which is currently pursued in several laboratories.",
