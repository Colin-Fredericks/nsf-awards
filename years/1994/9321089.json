The project focuses in particular on procedures  that restrict the opportunities for elected representatives to  shape final policy outcomes through the amendment process.  Such  procedures include confidence votes, delegated legislation,  package votes, and guillotines (or timetable procedures).    One significant feature of the study is that it is genuinely  comparative.  This is important because although existing  theories of parliamentary procedures yield predictions that  should be empirically testable across countries, previous  empirical research focuses almost exclusively on the U.S.  Congress.  Consequently, it is difficult for scholars to defend  claims about the comparative properties of legislative rules and  procedures, or to point to general theories that can guide the  choice of particular institutional arrangements.    A second significant feature is that the study explores linkages  between parliamentary procedures and two important aspects of  political performance:  the nature of policy outcomes and levels  of cabinet stability.  With respect to policy outcomes, the  research will focus in particular on explaining how various  institutional structures influence the ability of politicians to  adopt new policies (i.e., move away from the status quo), and on  explaining whether particular institutional structures encourage  policy outcomes that are systematically moderate or  systematically extreme relative to the preferences of the median  member of the legislature.    By focusing on legislative rules and political performance in a  genuinely comparative context, the study will clarify choices  that politicians make in designing their rules of parliamentary  procedure.  This final point is especially relevant for  individuals in nascent democracies ho for the first time must  design procedures that will enable legislatures to pla y more than  a symbolic role in the policy-making process.  ***",
