The investigator proposes to continue his development of  modern functional analytic techniques that are suitable for  studying large-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to monotone  dynamical systems. A particular emphasis of this part of the  proposed research will be on the large-time asymptotic behavior  of orbits (trajectories) in almost periodic monotone dynamical  processes. Various instability phenomena are described by a  parabolic system of complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. The  investigator proposes to establish the local (in time) existence,  uniqueness and complex analytic extension of solutions to the  parabolic system. This will be followed by a development of  suitable global estimates in the Lebesgue-Hardy spaces over a  region in multi-dimensional complex space in order to prevent all  the derivatives of the solution from blowing-up in finite time.  For the Ginzburg-Landau equation it should be possible to obtain  such estimates directly from the equation.       Global existence, uniqueness and complex analytic extension  of solutions to a mathematical model guarantee the existence and  uniqueness for all times of a particular physical (biological,  material or economic) structure described by this model, and its  smooth dependence upon the spatial and temporal variables (no  sudden jumps). These properties are essential for the design of  measurements to be performed on the physical structure. Large-  time asymptotic behavior of solutions to a model determines the  ultimate state of relationships within the modeled structure.  Mathematical models investigated in this project are expressed in  terms of non-linear differential equations.  ***",
