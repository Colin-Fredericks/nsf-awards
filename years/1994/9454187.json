This is an extension to fifth grade of an on-  going, joint research and teacher enhancement project in elementary  mathematics education implementation in urban school districts.   The project has conducted intensive teacher enhancement for grades  K-3 along with longitudinal data collection on students as they  progressed from K through third grade.  This project will continue  the project to complete fifth grade with these students and their  teachers.  The project has a strong research component focusing on  the issues performance and behaviors and beliefs related to  mathematics.  Cost-sharing is 31% of the NSF funding request.",
