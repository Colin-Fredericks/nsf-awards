 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452418  King  The goal of the Harvey Mudd College Engineering Department is to  assemble a Design Center which allows product and process design  via software simulation. We expect our design center to be capable  of down loading data files to appropriate manufacturing equipment  for prototype manufacture. Further, the Center will be capable of  collecting test data from the manufactured prototypes to compare  with predicted simulations.    We have assembled the equipment and software needed to perform computer  simulations in mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering fields. We  have also acquired several data acquisition systems. Funding is now  requested to expand the Design Center to incorporate manufacturing  capabilities. Specifically, we request money for a three axis CNC mill  and an automated circuit board manufacturing machine.    The acquisition of this equipment will allow us to continue our  development of a coherent engineering training discipline rooted solidly  in design. By providing our students with the capabilities of performing  simulation, manufacturing, and testing while teaching them engineering  fundamentals, we can continue to develop broad-based engineers  well-practiced in the art of engineering design.",
