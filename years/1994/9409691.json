 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409691  Sreenivas  The research deals with the study of systems whose states have  logical or symbolic, rather than numerical values that change  with the occurrence of events called Discrete Event Dynamic  Systems (DEDS).  In this proposal we outline research issues  concerning modeling, analysis, control and performance evaluation  of DEDS.  The supervisory control problem for a broad class of  infinite-state DEDS is solvable.  This fact can be used to combat  the complexity problem in DEDS.  This issue is the focus of the  modeling and analysis section.  The control section addresses an  archetypal problem in the control of DEDS, where we propose a  novel approach to the elimination of deadlocks.  Finally, in the  performance section we consider an approach that will permit a  system designer to modify, automatically, discrete event  simulation programs that only estimate performance so as to  efficiently obtain the sensitivity of the performance.  This  sensitivity information can be used towards system optimization  using stochastic approximation techniques.    ***",
