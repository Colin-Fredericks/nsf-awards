The objective of their research is to empirically  investigate the cognitive processes underlying creative metaphors  and analogies.  The investigators hypothesize that certain  metaphors and analogies create similarities and that change of  representation underlies this process.  The investigators propose  to explore the process through joint experiments on perceptual  stimuli of geometric figures and verbal stimuli in the form of  written text.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration significant  expertise in modeling of cognitive systems and artificial  intelligence.  This is complemented by the French investigator's  expertise in cognitive psychology and her empirical research on  analogy.  The research explores a new area in artificial  intelligence; that is, the generation of representations  underlying creative metaphors and analogies.",
