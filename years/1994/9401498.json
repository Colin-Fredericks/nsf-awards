 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401498  Wilson       This award supports mathematical research focusing on the  development of integral inequalities which give precise  information on how the interior smoothness of solutions of  elliptic partial differential equations is controlled by the size  of their boundary functions.  Specifically, the project concerns  efforts to find necessary and sufficient conditions on pairs of  weights so that inequalities between derivatives of solutions of  partial differential equations and their boundary values hold.   That is, between the integral of various powers of these  functions.  These are usually referred to as two-norm  inequalities and are useful for several reasons.  One is that  they give information on how approximate solutions can be  expected to converge to the correct one.  In this work, the  underlying domains will have relatively course boundaries,  forcing the geometry of the domain to play a fundamental role in  the analysis.  Expansion of these inequalities to what are called  biharmonic operators is also expected.        Integral inequalities have traditionally played a central  role in the study of differential equations.  They give  criticalinformation about average values of solutions and  derivatives, often providing existence results where no concrete  form (except for numerical estimates) is possible.  ***",
