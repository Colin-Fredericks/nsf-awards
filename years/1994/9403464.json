SURAnet is the  midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations management and information services and  it will give the College of Notre Dame a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  By  linking to the mid-level and national networks, the College of  Notre Dame's faculty and academics will maintain a position of  leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting  from remote access to super computer centers, data bases and  information services, high speed communications, file transfer  and remote login, and access to library resources. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.",
