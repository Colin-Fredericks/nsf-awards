The objective of the  joint research is to investigate five projects--  four in non-critical string theory and one on  non-decoupling effects in four dimensional  particle theory.  The collaboration has been in  progress since 1988 and has produced numerous  publications to date.      The first four projects on non-critical strings  are closely related and require experience in  supergeometry, superstrings, topological quantum  field theory, and matrix models.  Both  investigators have worked on non-decoupling  effects and continue to do so.  The joint  research is a natural extension of the  investigators' respective studies and will  benefit from the fact that they have worked on  different sides of the problem.  ***",
