 "awd_abstract_narration": "Greenside         The investigator undertakes computational and theoretical  efforts to understand extensively chaotic nonequilibrium systems  such as those studied experimentally in fluid, laser, and chemical  systems by Ahlers, Behringer, Gauthier, Gollub, Kolodner, and  Swinney.  A spatially-homogeneous chaotic system is defined to be  extensive if its fractal dimension grows linearly with the volume  of the system.  Theorists hope that extensively chaotic systems  may be amenable to a thermodynamic-like description that  characterizes complex systems through laws relating intensive and  extensive macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables.  Specific  research problems studied are: the identification and analysis of  simplified mathematical models that have experimentally relevant  features of extensive chaos; a comparison of different spatial  correlation lengths for quantifying extensive chaos; a study of  the variation of dimension density and other intensive variables  with system inhomogeneities; the development and testing of  algorithms for estimating fractal dimension densities from time  series; the analysis of the lengthscales and timescales involved  with the transition between non-extensive and extensive chaos; the  identification and testing of Langevin descriptions of extensively  chaotic regimes; and the development of related numerical  algorithms and optimized computer codes for scalable parallel  computers such as the Duke 32-node CM-5 computer.       Many nonequilibrium physical systems---both natural and  manmade---are complex in that they evolve nonperiodically in both  space and time.  An increasingly important theme in many modern  areas of science and technology is how to quantify this complex  behavior.  Why do systems become complex as one varies parameters,  how does one complex state differ from another, and how does  transport of energy and matter depend on complexity?  Recent  experimental advances in the study of fluid flow, of liquid  crystals, of nonlinear optics,  and of chemical excitable media  have identified a new and important class of complex systems to  understand: large homogeneous sustained nonequilibrium systems  that undergo a sudden change from a time-independent homogeneous  state to a non-transient temporally and spatially disordered state  (spatiotemporal chaos).  This research uses a combination of  mathematical analysis and large-scale parallel computing to  explore the properties of carefully chosen models of  spatiotemporal chaos.  Of particular interest is to understand how  complexity grows with the size of a physical system (extensive  chaos) and whether a thermodynamic-like description can be found  in the limit of infinite system size.  An improved understanding of  extensive chaos should improve the design, control, and  optimization of engineering applications, improve the forecasting  of nonperiodic time series, and improve the validation,  efficiency, and accuracy of large-scale computer simulations for  complex systems.",
