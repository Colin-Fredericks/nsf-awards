 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316565  Cramer  The objective of the project is to obtain deeper insight into  physical mechanisms of the charge transfer processes in  biological membranes, in particular electron transfer in  membrane-bound cytochromes and polar amino acid translocation  across membranes.  Physico-chemical experimental and theoretical  studies of spectra, electrochemistry, and kinetics of model  proteins and heme complexes would be combined with biochemical,  biophysical crystallographic, and molecular biological analysis  of the structure-function of photosynthetic electron transport  proteins (cytochromes) and ion translocation of a bacterial ion  channel (colicin).  The problems whose understanding will be  advanced as a result of these studies are as follows:  the  specific features of the dielectric reorganization of proteins  and their surroundings in biological charge transfer processes;  the mechanism of electron transfer in cytochromes including  effects of electrostatic fields on the heme redox potentials,  inner-sphere reorganization, reorganization of dielectric  environment (membrane core, lipid heads), and electronic coupling  via alpha-helices; mechanism of docking and electron transfer in  the cytochrome f-plastocyanin system; the physical basis of the  \"cis-positive rule,\" describing orientation of intramembrane  proteins; mechanism of trans-membrane channel formation by  colicin and related toxin-like molecules.  %%%  The object of the project is to obtain a better understanding of  the mechanism by which electrical charge is transferred or  prevented from being transferred in the membranes that border and  contain biological materials.  The processes of charge movement  in membranes are closely related to the mechanisms of cellular  energy storage that take place in these membranes, and of the  translocation of proteins across membranes that is associated  with in the assembly of cellular structures and of the membranes  themselves.  ***",
