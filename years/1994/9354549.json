 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354549  Wigley  The Global Change Instruction Program is creating and disseminating  a series of innovative teaching materials on global change science  and policy for undergraduate nonscience majors.  There is a severe  shortage of materials on these topics for this audience.  A series  of freestanding modules is designed to pique the interest of  students who think science is difficult or boring, to attract more  into careers in research or science education, and to help produce  a more scientifically literate citizenry.  Because global change  is, by definition, interdisciplinary, the modules also help  instructors who are often teaching in areas beyond their own  expertise.  The materials are being written by specialists and are  designed to be flexible enough for use not only in global change  courses but as a focus for teaching basic science concepts in  traditional, disciplinary science classes.  In Phase 1 of the  project, nine modules were produced.  In Phase 2, we are producing  six more printed modules (to fill gaps in the series that  professors have identified as most critical); adapting four  supercomputer animations for classroom use with the modules; and  disseminating our products.",
