The investigators specialize in systems that mediate between  computers and humans, specifically, in natural language  understanding.  The objective of their research is to develop a  new computer architecture for cognition suited to the study of  comprehension processes.  Their proposed model is a hybrid  that  combines a production system based on weak rules with a  constraint process that stimulates the formation of mental  representations.  Weak rules, for example, are word  identification rules that lead to more than one possible meaning  of a word.    U.S. and French complementary expertise in theory and experiment  will advance this effort.  A joint experimental program to test  the new model through computer simulations is proposed. This  project will advance understanding in natural language  processing.  ***",
