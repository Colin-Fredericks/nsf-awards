 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of feasible computations determines whether one   can efficiently solve the optimization problems  posed by nature and the   modern world.  The  long-term goal  of this research is to understand which  problems have  efficient solutions, via learning why certain problems may lack  computationally feasible algorithms.  Of particular  interest are the structural  relationships between complexity  classes, and the internal structure of  complexity classes.    Though the project intends to broadly investigate this  area,  focus will be given to the research via two themes:  (a) dealing with  unpredictable execution order; and (b) the properties of sparse sets.  On  the first topic, this  project investigates the class of languages computable via  a  large number of short subtasks, each of which is given the  (small) result of  the subtask that executed before it.  This  has been studied by Cai and Furst  and others for the case  where the scheduling of the subtasks is trivial and  fixed.  However, the project studies the case in which the order  in which  the subtasks execute is unpredictable.  On the second topic,   several issues dealing with sparse sets (which are a classic  examples of  `sets of low information content`) are examined.",
