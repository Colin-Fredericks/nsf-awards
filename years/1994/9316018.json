 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316018  Subramani      Peroxisomes are ubiquitous subcellular organelles  present in most eukaryotic cells.  They house a large array  of enzymes intimately involved in lipid metabolism.  The  long-term goal of the work described here is to identify the  protein components and to elucidate the mechanism by which  matrix and membrane proteins are targeted to the peroxisome.  Two peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2) have  already been implicated in the transport of matrix proteins  to peroxisomes.  Little is known regarding the signals that  target membrane proteins to the organelle.  The first goeal  of this proposal is to elucidate the signal that targets  proteins to the peroxisomal membrane.  An understanding of  the mechanism of peroxisomal protein import requires the  ability to investigate the steps in an in vitro system.  A  cytosol-dependent permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cell  system has been developed for PTS1-containing proteins.  The  second goal of the proposal is the identification and  purification of mammalian cytosolic components and  peroxisomal membrane proteins required for import of PTS1  containing proteins.  %%%  The name \"peroxisome\" derives from the fact that the enzymes  that produce and degrade hydrogen peroxide are localized in  this organelle.  However, perooxisomes also contain all or  part of several other biochemical pathways.  Part of the  problem in assigning a single predominant function to this  organelle is that the content of peroxisomal proteins varies  between organisms, cell types and the environment of the  cell or organism.  Therefore, the studies proposed here will  result in a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved  in the biogenesis of this important organelle.  ***",
