 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404374  Muraki        The theme of proposed work centers on the evolution of  spatial structure in nonlinear models which derive from physical  systems of current interest: a) self-focussing of light in  nematic liquid crystals, b) interfacial pattern formation in  chemical reactions, c) flow structures in complex fluids. In  particular, the mathematical objective is to establish  relationships between coherent structures, instability and  dynamics as pertains to the development of weakly-turbulent  behaviors in simple nonlinear systems. The basic strategy  involves both the identification of the primary structural modes,  and the determination of their dynamics and interaction  properties. A combination of asymptotic analysis, dynamical  systems methods and numerical computation are employed to obtain  clear illustrations of the mechanisms by which spatial structures  are created and sustained by nonlinearity. This, in turn,  provides an analytical basis leading to a physical understanding  for the underlying nonlinear phenomena.     A familiar example of  a spatio-temporal evolution is the video record of satellite  weather maps as often shown on the evening news. While the  imagery of spatial features that evolve over time is a common  theme for many physical and biological phenomena, our  quantitative understanding of these processes is actually quite  limited. The proposed research investigates the model equations  for unusually complex patterns -- the break-up of optical laser  beams, and the spreading of chemicals in surface reactions --  which have only recently been produced in the laboratory, but  hold future promise for the design and control of new fine-scale  processes.",
