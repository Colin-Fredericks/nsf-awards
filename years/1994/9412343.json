 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412343  Fourer       This objective of this research is to establish a dedicated  computing facility for investigating a variety of large scale  optimization problems using parallel processor environment.  The  classes of problems under consideration are combinatorial in  nature.  The equipment obtained as part of the research will be  used by multiple researchers to develop optimization algorithms  that can be implemented in a parallel processor network to reduce  the taken required to solve large scale optimization problems.  The  class of problems to which the multi-processor platform will be  used under this study include (1) alternative to direct solution of  the normal equations in interior-point methods for linear  programming, (2) difficult discrete optimization problems using  cutting plan methods, and (3) vehicle routing problems.       The facility will enable the development of new optimization  algorithms and exploitation opportunities for multi-processor  optimization environment.  The feasible demonstration of parallel  processor for solving large scale optimization problems can lead to  technology that offers tremendous opportunity in reducing both  computational and storage facility requirements.  The technology  can also be readily transferred to other users and industry.",
