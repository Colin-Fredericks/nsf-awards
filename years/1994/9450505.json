 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450505  England    The Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) for the Greater Philadelphia Region is a five-year collaborative effort  of the Philadelphia Consortium/Partnership which is dedicated to doubling the number of underrepresented minority  students (African American, Hispanic, and Native American) receiving baccalaureate degrees in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) and entering into graduate degree programs in SEM disciplines.    The Consortium consists of sixteen colleges/universities, metropolitan school districts, corporate partners, SEM  professional organizations, community groups, and educational support organizations established through the  implementation of the current Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities (CRCM) funded by the National  Science Foundation.  Temple University will serve as fiscal agent for the Consortium.    The AMP will not only focus its efforts on retention in SEM at the undergraduate levels, but it will also place a  strong emphasis on the recruitment of students through early intervention mechanisms tied to pre-college initiatives  in the region.  Retention efforts will focus on improving the quality of the learning environment and the academic  performance of minority students using community-building principles which will emphasize collaborative learning  approaches, including group study and support, and positive and sustained interaction with faculty.    Eight institutions will lead the Consortium efforts:  Drexel University, University of Pennsylvania, Temple  University, University of Delaware, Cheyney University, Lincoln University, Community College of Philadelphia,  and PATHS/PRISM.  These institutions will strengthen and expand their own minority recruitment and retention  efforts, and use the knowledge gained from their experiences to expand effective practices to other Consortium  institutions and beyond.  This will be accomplished through the integration of three areas of concentration:    1)   Academic Enrichment which i ncludes pre-freshman bridge and minority undergraduate support programs,       curriculum review and development, and undergraduate research activities.    2)   Outreach/Transition Activities which includes an early identification mechanism, articulation programs and       graduate programs to promote the development of minority faculty, and scholarships.    3)   Industry Involvement which includes:  pre-professional employment programs, and career awareness       activities.    Lead institutions will participate in all project areas, exchange ideas and information, set specific group and  institutional objectives, and assist each other with program planning and delivery.    In addition to the assessment of all programmatic activities through the use of a database monitoring system all  institutions will be evaluated on their recruitment effectiveness and retention of minority students in SEM.  At  present, the SEM retention rates at consortium institutions range from 50% to 80%.  Regularly scheduled regional  meetings, research conferences, newsletters, and electronic media and a resource center will be used to facilitate  networking and dissemination of information.    Through institutional cost sharing (one-to-one match), dedicated staff and SEM faculty support, and in-kind  contributions by Consortium institutions, the proposed activities will lead to improvements in the quality of the  learning environment for minority SEM students at Consortium institutions, and the development and implementation  of effective SEM recruitment and retention models.  The project will impact approximately 3,500 minority students  per year.",
