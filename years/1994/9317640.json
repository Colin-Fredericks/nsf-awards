 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317640  Taparowsky    Understanding how programs of cellular growth and  differentiation are regulated during morphogenesis  represents one of the fundamental experimental goals in cell  and developmental biology. Skeletal muscle provides an  excellent model system for investigating these programs due  to the availability of cultured myogenic cell lines and the  wealth of information on the molecular mechanisms regulating  muscle specific gene expression. Recently, the developmental  control of skeletal myogenesis has been linked to the  activities of a family of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs)  that function to convert undetermined cell types to  committed myogenic lineages and to trans-activate muscle  specific gene expression. Intrigued by the possibility that  MRFs may represent a common target for the actions of  several inhibitors of myogenesis in culture, Dr.  Taparowsky's  laboratory demonstrated that oncoproteins (Ras  p21 and Ad5 E1A) and growth factors (bFGF and TGF-beta)  antagonize skeletal muscle differentiation by down  regulating expression of MRF genes, such as MyoD, and/or by  interfering with MyoD protein function. To extend these  studies, this proposal is designed to investigate the  intracellular pathways through which MyoD activity is  regulated by these inhibitors. Since MyoD is a  phosphoprotein, the role of phosphorylation in modulating  MyoD function will be established. In addition, the role of  specific protein kinases in directly phosphorylating MyoD,  or otherwise contributing to the inhibition of myogenesis,  will be explored. Experiments to integrate the activities of  protein kinases into the signal transduction pathway(s)  initiated by bFGF or TGF-beta (and perhaps mediated by Ras  p21) will be examined using kinase inhibitors and dominant  negative mutations. The long term goal of these studies is  to provide a complete picture of the molecular pathway(s)  through which the effects of negative and positive factors  are delicately balanced to regulate this im portant  developmental pathway.  ***",
