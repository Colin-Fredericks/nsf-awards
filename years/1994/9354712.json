 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354712  Holland           The problems we address are not unique to Baruch College: student  lack of interest in science; lack of problem solving skills; lack  of feeling of connection with science and scientists; and low  numbers of students going on to study science beyond the  introductory courses.  Our overall goals are: to increase  scientific literacy and problem solving skills of undergraduate  non-science majors; to stimulate students to study science beyond  the required courses; to encourage more students to prepare for  scientific careers in research, teaching, or science writing; to  provide teaching/learning experiences for science majors; to create  a sense of community among scientists, both students and faculty,  at Baruch.  We propose the following specific curricular changes:  (1) introduction of journalistic methods into introductory courses  in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Environmental Studies; (2)  development of a new interdisciplinary Science/Journalism course  with a laboratory component.  Our target audience is undergraduate  students: non-science majors in introductory courses, journalism  students considering careers in science journalism, and science  majors who will serve as teaching assistants/peer mentors in this  program. During the two project years this will involve 800  students; when the proposed curricular changes are fully  institutionalized, approximately 2500 students per year will  benefit.  The methods developed here have wide application beyond  Baruch College. Changes in introductory science courses, the only  science most undergraduates take, will have the most impact on  scientific literacy and problem solving skills. The  science/journalism course, a truly interdisciplinary course  including a laboratory component, can serve as a model for other  institutions.  ***y",
