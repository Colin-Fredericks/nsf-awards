 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311965  Laub    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in advanced computer-aided design tools for robust control  engineering between Alan J. Laub of the University of California  at Santa Barbara and Pascal Gahinet of the French National  Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt.  The objective of their  research is to develop efficient, reliable, easy to use software  for the design of the next generation of control systems.   Specifically, the U.S. and French investigators will combine  their complementary expertise to develop state of the art  techniques and tools for robustness analysis and control design.    Robust control theory addresses practical control engineering  concerns with powerful state-space techniques and offers a  variety of analysis and design tools.  The current lack of  reliable, easy to use computer-aided design packages is an  obstacle to wider diffusion of robust control techniques in  industry.  The proposed research addresses this issue and deals  with problems of generic interest to control engineers.  The  results will have widespread applications in aeronautical,  chemical, electrical, and optical systems, among others.  ***",
