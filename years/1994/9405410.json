 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405410  Kelso       This award provides one-half the funding necessary to  acquire equipment for a magnetics laboratory to be installed  and operated in the Department of Computer, Geologic and  Mathematical Sciences at Lake Superior University. The  University is committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary to acquire the equipment.       The equipment consists of a high-temperature (i.e.,  operated at greater than 77K) superconducting magnetometer,  a thermal demagnetizer, an alternating field demagnetizer,  and a magnetic susceptibility bridge. The new equipment is  to be used primarily in the research projects and classroom  exercises of the Principal Investigator and students. These  projects will include study of  the time-temperature  dependence of  how rocks are magnetized in situ and  application to geological problems such as the magnetization  of the oceanic lithosphere and the effect of chemical  changes and metamorphism on the magnetic properties of  rocks. The Principal Investigator's department does not  offer the doctoral degree, and Lake Superior University is  eligible for the NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions  (RUI) activity. The Principal Investigator's research and  teaching programs will involve significant participation by  undergraduate students.  ***",
