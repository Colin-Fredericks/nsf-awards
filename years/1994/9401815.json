 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401815  Li       This award supports mathematical research on geometric  problems in three related areas all based on solving various  types of partial differential equations.  The first concerns the  problems of prescribing scalar curvature on the n-sphere with  certain hypothesis on the critical points.  The problem has been  solved in dimensions two and three, this project will consider,  with flatness assumptions on the critical points, the existence  of a prescribed curvature(s) for a given infinitely  differentiable function.  The second area involves the Weyl  problem with nonnegative Gauss curvature.  Roughly this problem  focuses on whether or not a sphere, with a given Riemannian  metric an everywhere positive Gauss curvature can be  isometrically embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space with  the standard flat metric.  While this problem has been solved,  only partial results exist for the case where the curvature is  only nonnegative.  To find necessary and sufficient conditions  for smooth isometric embedding when the Gauss curvature is only  nonnegative is the goal of this effort.  Finally, work will be  done in the study of the compressible fluid model of uniformly  rotating white dwarf stars.  Equilibrium solutions have been  established for small angular velocity and the nonexistence of  equilibrium solutions for large angular velocity has also been  shown.  What now must be done is to establish the existence of a  global branch of equilibrium solutions - which amounts to solving  a certain free boundary problem.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  existence, uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition,  analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions  and estimates on the accuracy of these  approximations.  ***",
