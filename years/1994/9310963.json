 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310963  COSTELLO    While the importance of scyphomedusae as predators in planktonic  communities has ben amply demonstrated, we are not presently able  to clearly predict which components of planktonic populations will  be affected by scyphomedusan predation.  Conventional methodologies  such as laboratory \"black box\" feeding studies or gut contents from  field samples have been valuable but insufficient approaches to  resolve this issue because they do not reveal how the feeding  interactions occur.  The how is necessary to predict which prey  will be consumed in novel situations.    A new approach will be developed in this project that combines the  separate expertise of two investigators specializing in video and  conventional methods for the study of prey selection.  First,  laboratory work will quantify relationships between medusan body  plan, fluid motions and prey capture.  Second, field studies of  prey selection by gut analyses will determine congruence of an  evolving model with in situ selection patterns.  Third, mesocosm  studies with controlled predator-prey conditions will critically  evaluate the model via hypothesis testing.      The research will center on the ephyral through young adult  transition period of two abundant and cosmopolitan scyphomedusae,  Auerlia aurita and Cyanea capillata.  While sharing similar ephyral  morphologies, the adult forms diverge widely in body plan.  The  results of this work will contribute to our understanding of these  specific predators, the ephyral form shared by most scyphomedusae  and, ultimately, to the mechanics of predator-prey interactions in  planktonic communities.",
