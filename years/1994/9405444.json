This project is concerned with  the design, evaluation, and implementation of reliable network  protocols through the use of self-stabilization.       A protocol is self-stabilizing if it begins to behave  correctly no matter what state it starts in.  The principal  investigator believes that self-stabilizing network protocols are  simpler (i.e., a small number of uniform mechanisms instead of  multiple mechanisms to deal with a catalog of anticipated faults)  and more robust (e.g., can recover from transient faults such as  memory corruption as well as common faults such as link and node  crashes).       While there are self-stabilizing protocols in existing  networks, such protocols typically rely on timers that are  proportional to worst-case network delays and result in slow  recovery times. Further, there are only a handful of such  protocols.  This project will investigate stabilizing protocols  that have much faster recovery times and for a larger class of  problems.       This project will apply techniques from the theory of  distributed algorithms (that the principal investigator and others  have developed) to the systematic design of self-stabilizing  protocols.  The work in the distributed algorithm literature has  introduced some useful paradigms and techniques but has not fully  applied these ideas to real networks.  It is this gap that this  project will address.   ***",
