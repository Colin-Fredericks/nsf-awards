 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452525  Dorf                                 Traditionally, computer software development courses have produced  projects with small numbers of homogeneous users requiring limited  maintenance and which run on a single platform as opposed to  products which are distributed to large numbers of diverse users,  run on multiple platforms, and which are upgraded and re-released  many times. This proposal focuses on establishing a software  product development laboratory in an effort to provide students  with the product development experience that many will need upon  graduation. Initially, the laboratory will be for development and  maintenance of a multimedia student/campus directory for  distribution and use by the students and staff of The University of  Toledo and possibly other institutions. This user population will  force development for multiple platforms and provide a significant  user population for evaluation of the product. Due to the amount of  information and the variety of queries to be supported, database  engineering will be a significant factor in the development of the  product. To provide this expertise, Software Engineering and  Database Systems classes will be required to work together to  design a solution.  The first year a basic, but usable, product will be developed and  distributed on campus. The following year's Software Engineering  and Database Systems students will be required to maintain the  previously distributed product by providing bug fixes and enhancing  its capabilities. This software product development laboratory will  provide the facilities for a realistic development experience.",
