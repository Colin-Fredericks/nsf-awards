 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313126  Lewis       The broad objective of the research is to improve the quality,   reproducibility, and speed of ceramic-based multi-chip module    manufacturing.  An interdisciplinary effort will simultaneously    focus on materials and processing issues, and on automated visual   inspection of tape-cast ceramic layers.  Currently, a scientific    understanding of the effects of materials composition on both    suspension rheology and as-cast properties (both macrostructural    and microstructural) is lacking.  This will be addressed by an    experimental program which (1) characterizes the rheological    properties as a function of suspension composition and time, and    (2) determines the microstructural variations within the layers.    Insights gained from this experimental program will be used to    derive statistical models for defect occurrence, which will then    drive the inspection process.  An inspection methodology that    combines process knowledge with computer vision and image    processing techniques does not yet exist.          The end result of the research will be improved dimensional  control and reproducibilty and automated visual inspection of  tape-cast sheets.  In addition, this work will provide a basic  understanding of the relationship between the materials system,  processing parameters, and microstructural development that is  readily applicable to the production of advanced ceramic  components.  Such understanding may allow the production of more  reliable electronic devices and assemblies.",
