 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404689  Anantharam       This project involves fundamental research in the modelling,  analysis, and design of the next generation of communication  networks.  Specific projects include: 1) the investigation of  recently proposed classes of models for bursty traffic with  particular emphasis on the behavior of queues driven by such  traffic; 2) the development of a novel, game theory based approach  to the optimal design of control and resource allocation strategies  at network elements; 3) the use of timing information to  communicate over highly noisy asynchronous data links; and 4) the   investigation of stability questions and characterizations of the  dominant stationary regimes in packet switched and circuit switched  networks.       The research will use stochastic models and a range of  mathematical tools from the theory of stochastic processes,  stochastic game theory, large deviations theory, and information  theory.  Successful completion of the proposed research would lead  to an enhanced understanding of the characteristics of the next  generation of networks, and will provide techniques for informed  choice among design alternatives.  Several parts of the research  will lead to prescriptive methodologies for different aspects of  network design.  ***",
