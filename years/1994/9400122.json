 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400122  Silvera    In order to provide liquid helium for a cryogenic laboratory with  experiments focused on spin-polarized atomic hydrogen, superfluid  helium, and high pressure studies of molecular hydrogen, a small  system capable of liquefying at least 24 liters/day with peaks of  40/day is being developed.  Experiments are carried out in three  dilution refrigerators, 3He refrigerators, and pumped 4He  cryostats.  The sub-kelvin studies are mainly on the properties  of spin-polarized atomic hydrogen, the only atomic system that  remains gaseous to T=0K.  Experiments include the development of  a microwave atom trap working at low temperature, compression of  a gas of hydrogen in intense magnetic fields, the formation of a  two-dimensional gas on a surface of superfluid helium, and the  study of cryogenic hydrogen maser.  This research is aimed at  observing quantum degenerate properties of hydrogen and to study  H-H and H-He interactions.  The ultimate goal is to attain Bose-  Einstein condensation and superfluidity in a gas; the cryogenic  maser is expected to surpass current standards in the measurement  of time and frequency.  Experiments at high pressure on molecular  hydrogen and its isotopes, D2 and HD are designed to achieve  pressures in the 2-4 megabar.  New Phases have been observed at  megabar pressures.  The ultimate goal is to make and study  metallic hydrogen, which has been predicted to be a room  temperature superconductor.  a rigorous test of metallization is  to show that the electrical conductivity remains finite in the  limit that temperature approaches zero, requiring liquid helium  temperatures and the combination of low temperature techniques  with ultra high pressure diamond anvil cells.    The principal liquefier consists of a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler  using a newly developed rare earth metal generator to precool  compressed helium gas which is liquefied by expansion through a  Joule-Thompson valve.  The estimated production is a conservative  1 liter/hour.  The  liquefier is designed to operate as a turn-key  system under computer control, requiring little daily  maintenance.  Two special cold traps for purifying the helium of  air impurities will be computer monitored for alternate switching  into the gas stream as they saturate and for automatic  reactivation.  A second system for use in high helium consumption  cryogenic experiments will reliquefy or absorb the heat load on  the helium reservoir by submerging a refrigerated probe in the  helium bath.  This system will be capable of reducing helium  consumption by 16 liters/day and can greatly reduce the demand on  the principal liquefier in peak periods of helium use.  This  system has potential to impact the commercial use of liquid  helium as in magnetic resonance imaging, industrial research  laboratories using cryogenic systems, as well as university  teaching laboratories.  ***",
