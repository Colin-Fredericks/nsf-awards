 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321985  Beaton    Under the direction of Dr. John Beaton, Mr. Douglas Bird will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his  research among Australian Aborigines who live along the shoreline  of the Torres Straits. Although these groups no longer follow a  strictly traditional hunting and gathering way of life and have  been partially integrated into the larger Australian economy,  they still rely heavily on shellfish which they gather from reefs  in the region. Mr. Beaton will use models based on optimal  foraging strategy and analyze subsistence practices. He and his  associate will observe foragers during the entire yearly round  and determine what factors govern shellfish collecting behavior.  This will involve intensive sampling and observation of  individual collectors. Activity diaries will be kept and the  amount of food per species and associated processing activities  will be noted.    Because food is essential for life and food collecting strategies  are behaviorally determined, both biologists and anthropologists  wish to understand subsistence strategies which different species  follow. When multiple kinds of resources of varying nutritional  value are unevenly distributed across a landscape, how do  foragers determine where to go and how to focus their efforts?  Because shellfish are sessile and their distribution is easy to  determine, they provide an excellent context in which to study  this issue.     This research is important because it will offer insight into  human foraging behavior. It will provide data of interest to both  cultural anthropologists and archaeologists and will also assist  in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
