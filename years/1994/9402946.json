 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402946  Makarov        This project emphasizes mathematical research on a basic  concept in mathematical analysis known as harmonic measure.   There are several equivalent definitions ranging from the  probability that a Brownian path hits a fixed set to the  equilibrium distribution of that set as understood in potential  theory.  In recent years there has been considerable interest in  the study of global metric properties and characteristics of  harmonic measure such as the dimension of the minimal Borel  support, the size of exceptional sets for the boundary behavior  of the Green function, the bounds for the dimension distortion  under conformal maps, etc.  At the same time close connections  with the ergodic theory of analytic dynamical systems have been  established.  Harmonic measure has a natural characterization in  dynamical terms for boundaries which are like Cantor sets or  Julia sets, and ergodic theory provides a powerful tool for the  study of its metric properties.  In the opposite direction, the  estimates of harmonic measure describe the geometry of the  fractals and certain properties of the dynamics.  The main goal  of this project is to explore the fine structure of harmonic  measure for general plane domains as well as for some important  particular classes of fractals.  A continuation of studies on  various multifractal spectra that characterize the global metric  properties of harmonic measure.  Application to the ergodic  theory of Julia sets deal with the problem of analyticity of the  corresponding pressure functions and with the phase transition  phenomenon.  Efforts will be made to understand the evolution of  fractality in the structure of harmonic measure on the boundary  of diffusion limited aggregates.       Harmonic measure lies at the intersection of several  important areas of analysis and probability.  It seeks to measure  fine structure of sets.  It provides quantitative information of  highly complex object like fractals and badly disconnected sets  with  hidden structures arising in the study of two-dimensional  dynamics.   ***",
