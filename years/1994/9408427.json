 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408427  Epple    Until about a decade ago, it was believed that morphine and  the closely related codeine are only produced by the poppy  plant, and no other plant or animal species.  However,  recent research revealed that both opiates are actually  produced by a variety of animals, including the human.  Particularly high concentrations were found in certain  regions of the central nervous system and in an endocrine  organ, the adrenal medulla.  These surprising findings  raised the question of the functions of the endogenous  opiates, and they also raised the question how these opiates  interact with the opioid peptides, totally unrelated  substances which are common in various reigons of the  nervous system, and in endocrine glands.  Before the  discovery of animal-produced opiates, it was assumed that  the psychological and analgesic effects of morphine were due  to actions on organs that normally respond to endogenous  opioid peptides.  Now, it has become critical to separate  the specific actions of the endogenous opiates and opioids  from each other.  Without this information, we will not  clearly understand the basis of the therapeutic and abusive  effects of both codeine and morphine.  The issue is very  confusing since certain cells produce and release both  opioid peptides and opiates, which in turn interact with  additional regulatory substances released from the same  cells and from neurons.    Using an ideally suited animal model, the chromaffin cells  of the American eel, Dr. Epple's NSF-supported research has  shown, inter alia, that codeine and morphine interact with  each other in the control of opioid peptide (enkephalin)  secretion; and that enkephalin, in turn, controls the  secretion of catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline)  which are the actual hormones of the chromaffin cells. Thus,  the chromaffin cells use substances that affect the cells  themselves (\"autocrine secretions\")  to control release of  hormones which then largely act on distant \"target\" organs.  In teresingly, these actions occur at opiate concentrations  that are far below those needed for therapeutic or abusive  effects.    The specific aim of the proposed investigations is to  further unravel the complex interactions in the control of  catecholamine release, with particular emphasis on the  interaction with the innervation.  The expected data should  provide once more \"unconventional\" insights into the self-  regulations of both neurons and endocrine cells, and thus  have important implications for both basic research and  therapeutic strategies.  ***",
