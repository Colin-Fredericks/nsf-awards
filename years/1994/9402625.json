 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402625  Miller       This award covers partial expenses for U.S. research  mathematicians to participate in a workshop whose primary focus  concerns symmetries and integrability of difference equations.   The motivation lies in efforts to develop tools for solving  nonlinear differential equations.  There are two main methods,  one involves Lie group theory, the other is integrability theory.  A notable development in the last twenty years exemplifying  integrability theory was the introduction of the inverse  scattering transform.  A much more recent development is that  similar techniques are being successfully applied to solve  equations that involve discrete variables: difference and  differential-difference equations.  Such equations are important  in physics in their own right, in the study of discrete systems  and theories on lattices, cellular automata, etc.  Moreover,  difference equations an variations thereof have gained great  prominence recently in the theory and applications of quantum  groups.       The workshop brings together contingents of leading  researchers from the United States and Canada together with a  sizable number of graduate students and postdoctoral faculty to  work together, with few formal lectures, for a period of seven  days on issues related to some of the truly exciting emerging  areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.  ***",
