The study will be the first full-length anthropological study of  a West African community of migrants in the area.  The research  will focus particularly on the legal dimensions of the economic  practices of migrants in the informal economy of a major U.S.  city, generating empirical data on how migrants become conscious  of and learn to interpret local laws.  The study will make a  major contribution to the scientific knowledge base about migrant  behavior and will be useful for policy makers concerned with  issues posed by the recent growth of immigration to U.S. cities  and the migrant impact on informal urban economies.     The principal investigators, who speak the Songhay language, will  conduct interviews with street-vending migrants, with migrants in  other informal occupations, with local business people in Harlem  and other areas affected by the informal economic activities of  West African migrants, and with city, regional and federal  officials familiar with problems associated with immigration and  the informal economy of New York City.  The principal  investigators will also conduct ethnographic fieldwork, engaging  in extensive observation of West African migrant activities in  New York City's informal sector.  ***",
