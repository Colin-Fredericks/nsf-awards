 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with  the capability of studying the chemistry of electronic material  design  and its application to nano-device fabrication will  be  acquired  with  the  Academic Research  Infrastructure  Program  funds.  The  JEOL STM instrument will operate between  30K  and  1500K.  The  research  will  emphasize  deposition  and  growth  reactions  involving silanes and chlorosilanes in an effort  to  elucidate  the role of hydrogen and chlorine atoms produced  by  the growth precursors. The variable-temperature capability will  play  an  important role in the study of adsorption,  diffusion  and growth reactions. The catalytic role of atomic hydrogen  in  promoting  ordered crystalline growth in electronic  materials.  Various  approaches will be considered in efforts to  fabricate  controllably doped diode nanostructures and quantum dots.    A  variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope  will  be  utilized  in the study of the chemistry of electronic  material  design and its application to nanoscale device fabrication. The  role  of  atomic hydrogen and chlorine in the growth  processes  will  be  studied. Adsorption, diffusion, and  growth  reaction  studies will be carried out versus temperature. Efforts will be  made to fabricate nanoscale devices.",
