RAP1 is the  first eukaryotic telomere binding protein amenable to both genetic  and molecular analysis.  A wide array of telomere-related  phenotypes have been observed in rap1 mutant strains of the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including loss of telomere size control  and stability, as well as the altered expression of telomere-    adjacent genes.  The genetic and molecular analysis of these rap1  mutant strains addresses three critical questions.  First, what is  the nature of  binding protein interactions that influence telomere  position effects, size control and stability? Second, what is the  role of telomere structure in regulating long range position  effects and telomere size control? Finally, what other factors  associate with the telomere to maintain its structure and function?  This project addresses these questions with three specific  interrelated aims.  The first aim is to evaluate the role of RAP1  in maintaining the fidelity of telomere addition or repair.  The  second aim is to investigate the domains of RAP1 important in  telomere function.   The third aim is to identify and characterize  extragenic suppressors of rap1 nonsense and missense alleles.    %%%  Telomeres, the unique protein-DNA structures present at  the termini of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for  maintaining chromosome stability and structure.  First, telomeres  serves as \"caps\" to protect chromosomes against degradation and  rearrangement.  Second, telomeric DNA serves as substrate for a  unique non-DNA templated mechanism of replication that prevents the  loss of terminal (and ultimately essential) sequences.  Third,  telomeres have long range effects on the transcription,  replication, and chromatin structures of adjacent genes and  sequences.  The functional importance of telomeres is underscored  by ev idence linking loss of telomeric sequences to cellular  senescence, tumor formation , and oncogenesis.  Hence, an  understanding of the proteins that interact with telomeric DNA is  of general importance. This project is a genetic and molecular  analysis of such a protein, designated RAP1, from the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  ***",
