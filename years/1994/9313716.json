 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313716  Johnson       Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale  convective systems (MCSs), have been identified as producers of  most of the rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the  Spring, Summer and Fall.         Under prior NSF support, the Principal Investigator has  exploited data sets from previously held field experiments to  further understanding of MCSs and their interactions with the  atmospheric boundary layer.  He will continue these investigations  using both numerical models and observational case studies.       The Principal Investigator will focus on processes which  initiate, maintain and modulate mesoscale convection as well as the  coupling between convection and the atmospheric boundary layer.   Specific meteorological phenomena to be studied include wake lows,  mid-level mesoscale vortices and heat/moisture budgets in and near  mountainous terrain.       If successful, this research will lead to better understanding  of MCSs which may lead to better predictions of timing, location  and amount of rainfall as well as severe weather.  ***",
