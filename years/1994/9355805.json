 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355805  Nolet    PEPP aims to install an array of seismographs in high schools and  colleges nationwide, to create a computer network to share  seismological data and information, to develop a series of Earth  science and physics curriculum modules around analysis of  seismological data, and to form a network of supporting members  of IRIS (Incorporated  Research Institutions for Seismology, an  NSF-supported consortium of more than 80 universities - see  Appendix A) to train and support science teachers.   The main goals of the project are:    - The develop \"hands on\" seismological data acquisition equipment  for use at high schools and colleges, to increase the curiosity  of students to explain nature,  - To increase the understanding of Earth science and physics  concepts through connected lab experiments in seismology, while  developing a sense of familiarity with the seismometer as an  instrument for using these concepts,  - To support teachers to do real \"classroom science\" with their  students and provide scientific back-up for teachers as they  undertake these activities with their students,  - To stimulate interaction between teachers in Earth sciences and  physics with researchers in geophysics,  - To give teachers organizational and intellectual support by  providing curriculum materials, computer networking as well as  research opportunities,  - To disseminate PEPP nationally and build a unique seismological  array that allows students and teachers to share data over  Internet and to make real discoveries,  - To stimulate developments in instrument design that improves  the sensor to be used in this project.    PEPP is rooted in the recent developments that have  revolutionized observational seismology.  New networks of high  quality, digital seismographs are being installed right now, both  on a national scale by the USGS, as well as on a worldwide scale.   IRIS, a consortium of (mostly academic) seismological  institutions in the US is the driving force behind the  installation of  a worldwide network.  The school network  supplements this in the US.  It not only provides real data for  use in the classroom - it has unique scientific potential because  it provides a station density that could never be obtained using  purely professional resources.  In the final stage of the  project, research workshops for teachers will be developed in  which the data are used.  This project will enable secondary  science teachers to undertake long-term, networked seismic  monitoring that will contribute seismology research while  supporting the reform of science education through the infusion  of teacher-led, student-based scientific research.  By locating  this scientific research in schools, participants will help shift  science instruction in their schools toward a more project-  oriented, inquiry-based paradigm.",
