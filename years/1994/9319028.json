 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myers  9319028  This project is investigating the molecular mechanisms controlling morphologic development.  Multicellular eucaryotes contain many types of genetically identical yet morphologically distinct cells, indicating morphologic differentiation is an integral aspect of development.  Little information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms by which morphologic differentiation is regulated.  This question will be addressed through the identification of gene loci that influence a defined morphologic differentiation pathway in the ascomycete Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  A screen is being used to recognize genes within this group likely to code for regulatory components of the differentiation response.  The genes will be characterize by molecular cloning methods, and their sites of action will be ordered in a presumed hierarchy of events that determine the differentiation state.  The first specific objective of this project is to identify additional loci in the S. cerevisiae genome required for normal control  of cellular dimorphism.  Genetic analysis using visual characterization of cell and colony morphology as a scorable phenotype will accomplish this goal.  The second objective is to isolate selected genes by molecular cloning, and to determine the primary structure of the corresponding protein products by nucleotide sequence analysis.  This goal will be met by selecting plasmids from a genomic library based on their ability to restore yeast-like growth to a specific pseudohyphal mutant.  The role of each cloned gene in determination of morphologic differentiation will be confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis and gene replacement methods.  The third objective is to determine whether the genes act in a linear pathway controlling the differentiation response and, if so, to determine their relative sites of action.  This goal will be accomplished by determining epistasis relationships between genetic elements that either stimulate or repress pseudohyphal growth.  %%%  Accomplishing  these objectives will provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control development of cell shape.  Specific proteins will be identified that control morphologic differentiation, and their primary structures most likely will suggest biochemical activities by which this regulation is accomplished.   Information regarding the relative sites of action of these molecules in a differentiation pathway will suggest the function of specific factors.  Future investigations could then utilize this information to characterize control of morphologic development at the biochemical level, and to examine whether similar mechanisms are broadly conserved in evolution.  ***",
