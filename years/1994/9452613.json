 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452613  Toll  This project is supports recent curricular reform in biology by  introducing undergraduate students to modern, experimental research  technologies and techniques in the study of animal systems.  In  improvements to laboratory instruction of physiology, students will  use Macintosh computers, fitted with hardware/software interfaces,  transducers, and signal conditioners, to function as virtual  oscilloscopes and chart recorders. Experiments based on these  technologies will encompass physiological study of the respiratory,  circulatory, muscular and nervous systems.  Students will use  microsurgical transplantation and microinjection technologies in  developmental biology, directed toward the study of controls of  cytodifferentiation and organogenesis in both protostomes and  deuterostomes. With the benefit of these new technologies, students  will first master the new techniques and then will be encouraged to  design conduct, and analyze the results of their own experimental  procedures.  These modernized laboratory experiences will be  incorporated in the new biology curriculum for implementation in  the fall of 1994 as follows: one first-year course required of all  students, both majors and non-majors; the second semester of  introductory biology required of majors; two upper-level courses in  biology. The new curriculum has at its core, experimentation and  original, creative research, with all second-year biology majors  taking a laboratory-based research methods course in preparation  for advanced classes.",
