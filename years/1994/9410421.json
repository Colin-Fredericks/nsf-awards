 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410421  Jayanti  The main objective of this project is to obtain a classification  of synchronization primitives in parallel processing systems,  with the goal of reflecting the power and limitations of each  primitive. The effectiveness of a parallel processing system to  solve a computation depends to a large extent on the support for  communication and synchronization among processes. In shared  memory systems, higher level shared objects such as  shared queues are implemented in software using shared hardware  primitives like registers and test&set instructions. In fault-  tolerant asynchronous systems, where processes progress at  arbitrarily varying rates, such software implementations must  guarantee that a process can complete successfully, regardless of  how fast or slow the other processes are. It is known that  hardware primitives vary widely in their ability to support such  software implementations. The classification proposed in this  research will bring out the capabilities and limitations of  synchronization primitives. The classification  will be useful to  the designer of a multiprocessor in deciding which primitive to  support in hardware. It will also be useful to the systems  programmer in determining whether a high level object of  interest (e.g., a queue that can be accessed concurrently by 100  processes) has a software implementation in a given system.  ***",
