 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450235  Becker    The Southwest Regional Laboratory(SWRL) proposes to develop,  produce, field-test, refine, evaluate, and disseminate a  series of eight instructional modules for secondary school  physical science or general science.  Each module builds  upon a video-taped portrayal of a selected episode in the  history of science which is rich in conceptual challenge,  conflicting points of view and cultural context.  The units  will include statics, kinematics, dynamics, electricity and  magnetism, heat, light, the structure of matter, and modern  problems in physical science.  Some of the portrayals will  include building the Brooklyn Bridge, Galileo's observations  of falling bodies, Emilie du Chatelet and Voltaire's studies  of collisions, Count Rumford's experiments with heat,  Newton's optics, Marie and Pierre Curie's experiments with  radiation.  Issues of stability and change, scale and  structure, and systems and interactions will be central to  the development of the materials for each unit.  The  materials should motivate students who have shown little  interest in science, challenge their conceptions of the  structure and workings of the physical world and build  greater understanding of the process and culture of  scientific activity.  The videos are supplemented with  student reading selections with both excerpts from original  documents and modern interpretive text. Protocols for group  and individual projects including cooperative learning  activities, student presentations and laboratory  investigations and teacher guides for class discussion and  debate are also provided.  The videos are produced by KCET;  Evaluation is carried out at SWRL      ***",
