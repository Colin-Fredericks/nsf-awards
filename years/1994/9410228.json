 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research applies the technique of competitive  analysis,  originally developed to study on-line algorithms, to the design  of  algorithms for distributed systems with unpredictable  failures.  Competitive  analysis compares the performance of an  algorithm with that of an optimal  ``off-line'' algorithm designer  in effect to predict the future.  Using it, an  algorithm designer  can avoid the perils of designing for the worst case  (yielding  algorithms too inefficient under milder conditions to be  practical)  or for a normal case that may turn out to have little  correspondence with  reality.    (1) The first task of the project is to formulate performance  measures for distributed algorithms that are amenable to  competitive analysis  (the surprising difficulty of this task may  explain why previous applications  of competitive analysis to  distributed problems have largely concentrated on  the on-line  aspects of those problems).   (2) The second is to construct  distributed algorithms that perform well by the competitive  measures.  By  implementing these algorithms it is possible  to test that the measures do  in fact predict good real-world  performance.  This work  will yield both  insights into the theory of distributed algorithms and better  practical algorithms for the distributed system builder.",
