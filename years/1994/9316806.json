 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berry  9316806  Photomorphogenesis, the phenomenon of growth and development in  response to light, provides a valuable experimental system to study  the control of gene expression by environmental stimuli.  In  Amaranth seedlings, light coordinately regulates the expression of  genes encoding the large subunit (LSU) and small subunit (SSU) of  ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase), a principle  enzyme in photosynthetic carbon fixation.  While long-term changes  in RuBPCase gene expression are regulated by light at the level of  mRNA accumulation, very rapid changes in RuBPCase gene expression  are induced at two translational levels.  RuBPCase synthesis is  rapidly induced at the level of translation initiation when dark-  grown seedlings are transferred to light (light-shift), and is  rapidly blocked at the level of translation elongation when light-  grown seedlings are transferred to darkness.  We propose to  investigate the regulation of chloroplast-encoded LSU and nuclear-  encoded SSU at these two translation steps.  Regulation of  translation initiation will be investigated in light-grown, dark-  grown, and light-shifted seedlings by analysis of polysome-  associated proteins, analysis of proteins that associate with  RuBPCase mRNAs, and by in vivo and in vitro analysis of RNA  sequences and associated factors.  Regulation of translation  elongation will be studied in light-grown and dark-shifted  seedlings by analysis of ribosome distribution and sites of  ribosome pausing, analysis of the elongation block in homologous  translation runoff extracts, and analysis of polysome-associated  proteins.  The investigations proposed will provide new insights  into coordinate regulation of expression of nuclear- and plastid-  encoded genes at the translational level.  %%%  In plants, light serves as an environmental signal that regulates  development.  Investigations into light-regulated responses in  plants are important in determining how factors that control plant  development respo nd to environmental stimuli, such as light.  To  begin to understand how this occurs, we will study light-control of  plant genes responsible for forming the carbon dioxide fixation  enzyme in Amaranth, a grain plant.  Experiments will be performed  to observe how light exposure can control rapid changes in the  amounts of the enzyme in the plant.  This appears to happen at the  level of messenger RNA, which is produced from DNA and afterwards  is translated into the plant carbon dioxide fixation protein.   Results of this research will provide unique perspectives about  light on the genetic control in photosynthesis.  In addition, our  basic research with Amaranth will contribute to the development of  the plant as an important agricultural crop for food production and  for industry.  ***",
