 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main theme of this work is \"probabilities with minimal  structures\", and in particular the research of upper and lower  bounds for stochastic processes under general conditions.  Connected sidelines are applications to Banach spaces, to  combinatorics, to probabilistic analysis of hard problems, to  random Fourier series and of course to more classical  probabilistic questions such as trajectories of stochastic  processes and gaussian processes.  The central philosophy is to  give priority to tools that require very little structure over  more specific arguments.  The ideas of isoperimetry in product  spaces, that have given a new understanding of the notion of  probabilistic independence will continue to be a central tool.  The true scope of these ideas has been realized only recently,  and the potential for future progress and applications should not  be underestimated.       The main thrust of this research is to pursue the  development of abstract tools of probability in particular in  relationship with the classical idea of isoperimetry. It was  realised by the investigator that the classical idea of  isoperimetry can be made meaningful in a much more general  setting than was previously believed. This gave rise to new  families of inequalities that have solved numerous problems in  abstract probability, and had impact in areas where probability  is a tool rather than an object of study in itself, and in  particular operation research and theoretical computer science.  The potential of these idea, both at the theoretical level and  the level of applications starts only to be understood, and  appears very promising.",
