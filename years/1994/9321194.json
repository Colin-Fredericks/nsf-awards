Using a combination            of archival and ethnographic research, the student will study two            villages, one with a sure source of irrigation water from a water            control project, and one with the traditional insecure sources of            water.  The student will interview members of the three dominant            ethnic groups in these villages to investigate how social class,            ethnicity, and access to development programs interact to affect            the productivity of small-holder farming.             This research is important because traditional farmers in many            parts of the world are involved with state irrigation programs.            Increased understanding of local cases such as this one, of how            ethnic differences and social-economic class position within the            village affect the farmers' ability to take advantage of state-            sponsored programs, and whether these programs actually increase            productivity, will provide valuable information to economic            development planners.             ***",
