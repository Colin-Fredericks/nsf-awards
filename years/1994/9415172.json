 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  award will provide funding for the renovation of the Hobbs Science Building on the  campus of Lynchburg College.  Constructed in 1959, the building can no longer support ongoing  research and research training activities.  Though structurally sound, the facility lacks modern  interior space, mechanical and electrical systems, and controlled climate critical to the operation  of computers and research equipment.  The renovated Hobbs Building will become the  cornerstone of the Lynchburg College Science Center, a comprehensive science facility that will  house all of the science programs.  With improved ventilation, adequate electric power, and more  effective use of existing space, the quality and quantity of research and research training will be  significantly enhanced.  The new facility will also assist the College in its efforts to attract and  retain qualified students pursuing scientific endeavors.  As a modern science facility,  it will be a  showcase to demonstrate effective science research and training methods and provide a  technologically advanced science resource for the entire educational community of Lynchburg,  Virginia.",
