 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel program decomposition is the process by which a single  application is decomposed into multiple processes for  execution on parallel  hardware.  For real programs, the  execution speed of a good decomposition can  exceed that of a  poor decomposition by factors of ten or more.  Unfortunately,  optimal program decomposition is known to be an NP-hard  problem, and efficient  exact solutions are unlikely to  exist.  Hence, the key to finding automatic  approaches to  the program decomposition lies in discovering efficient  algorithms that produce approximate solutions.    A novel decomposition  algorithm with nearly linear time  complexity is explored.  The algorithm  initially decomposes  the program into a sequence of small, parallelizable  sections of code, known as partitionables.  A locally  optimal decomposition is  selected for each partitionable  based on information contained in an  empirically derived  database.  Dynamic data redistribution is combined with a  static technique called decomposition smoothing to produce a  good global  decomposition.    The principal contributions of the research are:  (1) to  define new methods for program decomposition that go beyond  simply minimizing  communication and consider aggregate  parallel execution performance, (2) to  establish the extent  to which fast decomposition strategies can produce  acceptable solutions for practical applications, and (3) to  collect and  disseminate a database of performance results from kernels of scientific  applications.",
