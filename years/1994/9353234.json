The self study and the development of the implementation plan will be directed by a Governing Board (GB) consisting of the Mayor, superintendents of the participating districts and other key leaders.  The GB is responsible for implementing policy decisions and developing community awareness and support.  Data gathering and analysis, and obtaining community and other stakeholder input will be directed by a Steering Committee (SC) appointed by the GB.  The SC will include representatives of the school districts, government and other stakeholders.  The SC will carry out the self study using ad hoc subcommittees, paid consultants and information provided by various school district offices.  It will then develop policy recommendations and the implementation plan for consideration by the GB.",
