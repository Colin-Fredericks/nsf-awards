 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406224  Munck  Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy will be used to study a variety of  iron-sulfur proteins and synthetic complexes that mimic the active  sites of these proteins.  The major focus of the proposed studies  will be nitrogenase, with particular emphasis on characterizing  intermediates of the catalytic reaction.  For these studies protein  is available that contains one cluster type (either the cofactor  centers or the P-clusters) enriched with the Mossbauer isotope 57Fe  whereas the other cluster type contains the Mossbauer-silent 56Fe.   The availability of such protein will facilitate the data analyses  substantially; moreover, it will allow us to probe the electronic  structure of both clusters in considerably more detail.  It is also  proposed to study carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase and two types of  hydrogenases.  One of the hydrogenases contains the so-called H-  cluster, the stoichiometry of which has not yet been determined in  any system studied thus far.  Finally, theoretical and experimental  studies of 3Fe clusters that occur in proteins and synthetic  compounds will be continued.  %%%  The biological system converts annually in excess of 10 million  tons of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is subsequently  incorporated into other cell constituents.  Since this process is  fundamental to agriculture, many biochemists, biophysicists and  geneticists have directed much effort to understand this process on  the molecular level.  The research of our laboratory has provided  a major contribution to the clarification of the structure of the  metal centers of nitrogenase.  While our past research has  addressed the structural aspects of two novel metal clusters in  this enzyme, future activities will be directed mostly towards  understanding the mechanism of the process, i.e. after having  defined the structure involved we wish to elucidate the sequential  events occurring during nitrogen fixation.  Moreover, we wish to  provide structural information to inorganic chemists  for the design  of catalysts that mimic the biological process.  Our struggles with  nitrogenase have involved complementary studies that lead to the  discovery of new clusters and to fundamentally new insights into  magnetochemistry.  The proposal studies will address the  biochemistry of nitrogenase as well as research of a variety of  other related proteins.  Our studies of the biological compounds  will be complemented by studies of suitable chemical models and  theoretical modelling.  ***",
