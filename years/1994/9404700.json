Although climatic factors are known  to contribute to desertification, the dynamics through which  winds, precipitation, and evapotranspiration affect the form and  migration of sand dunes is not well understood.  This doctoral  dissertation research project will model the meteorological  conditions that activate sand dunes in the Mojave Desert of  southern California.  Photographic and written accounts of will  be compared with climatic records of wind speed and duration,  precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration to identify  conditions leading to dune mobility.  Using an index of dune  mobility developed in other locales, special attention will focus  on the ways that climatic changes as well as human activities,  such as increased use of off-road vehicles, affect vegetative  cover that tends to stabilize dunes.       This project will contribute to new understandings in a  number of ways.  It will advance knowledge about desert  climatology and the influence of both climatic and anthropogenic  factors on landforms in arid regions.  It will increase  understandings of aeolian geomorphology, and it will provide new  insights into the possible consequences of climatic change on the  form and character of deserts.  As a doctoral dissertation  improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable  a promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.",
