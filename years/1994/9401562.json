 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wold  This research focusses on the investigation of the photocatalytic  activity of titanium and related compounds toward the degradation  of organic contaminants present in aqueous solutions at low  concentrations.  Previous studies have shown that the activity of  titanium oxide is dependent on the method of preparation, and  that the best samples are obtained from a volatile precursor.  Furthermore, the formation of active surface states can be  enhanced by the addition of a small quantity (~3%) of a   transition metal oxide containing a high formal valence state  metal, e.a. tungsten oxides or molybdenum oxides. This increase  in active site formation has been related to an increase in Lewis  acidity as evidenced by increased reactivity with  n-butylamine.  The proposed research will, therefore, be directed as follows: 1)  attempts will be made to prepare titanium with a higher  photocatalytic activity than the best titanium oxide samples  studied to  date; 2) a second group of oxides will also be  prepared by the use of supercritical carbon dioxide and they  involve two oxides which do not form a ternary phase in bulk  form; and 3)the work will be extended to a family of compounds  closely related to rutile in which three titanium ions are  replaced by two pentavalent and one divalent ions.  %%%    The photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds in an aqueous  solution containing a suspension of titanium(IV) oxide is a  comparatively new method for the removal of impurities from  water. The photoactivating light required is sunlight or near UV.  Many organic compounds have been shown to be oxidized to carbon  dioxide by this method. It has potential  application in the  treatment of both waste and drinking water. Titanium oxide thin  film coating on floating beads has potential to photocatalyze the  oxidation of organic compounds floating on water, such as those  typically resulting from an oil spill. This research focusses on  the investigation of the  photocatalytic activity of Titaniu m and  related compounds toward the degradation of organic contaminants  present in aqueous solutions at low concentrations.",
