 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314913  Steimle    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project between Professor Timothy  Steimle, Department of Chemistry and  Biochemistry, Arizona State University, and  Professor Shuji Saito, Institute for Molecular  Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes,  Okazaki, Japan.  In addition, two graduate  students from Arizona State University and  several scientists from Tokyo University and  Shizuoka University will participate in the  project.    This collaborative effort is motivated by both  practical and fundamental scientific interests.   Transient metal containing compounds are  important elements in processes such as rf-  induced chemical etching and chemical vapor  deposition.  The proposed millimeter wave and  optical spectroscopic detection schemes will be  sensitive, non-invasive means of monitoring and  controlling the chemistry of such systems.  In  addition, there are many fundamental scientific  problems associated with metal containing  radicals, not the least of which is their  electronic and structural characterization  (i.e. bond lengths and angles, electronic state  distribution, m.o. description, etc.)    The U.S. and Japanese teams have complementary  theoretical and experimental expertise.  The  scientists at Okazaki have diode laser  spectroscopic capabilities; the Tokyo  University scientists have Fourier transform  microwave capabilities, and the Shizuoka  University group has millimeter wave  capabilities.  Cw-dye laser optical  spectroscopy and pump/probe microwave optical  double resonances of molecular beam samples  will be performed at Arizona State University.  ***",
