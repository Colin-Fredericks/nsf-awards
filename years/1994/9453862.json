To reach these goals, DCPS proposes to carry out a four part program to: (1)  produce and implement a national-standards-based mathematics, science and  technology (MST) K-12 curriculum; (2) establish an extensive professional  development program for teachers and administrators to change the culture of  the classroom by use of exciting, hands-on student-centered instruction; (3)  establish demonstration schools at each educational level to be used for  constant refinement and dissemination of \"best practices' in MST education;  and (4) link community organizations, science-rich institutions and other  partners with the DCPS in support of K-12 MST education.  The reform will  be coordinated by the District's Center for Systemic Educational Change,  through its MST Resource Team which is led by the Deputy Superintendent,  DCPS.  ***",
