This project will expand on preliminary  observations that calcium plays a role in the regulation of these  processes.  Preliminary results indicate that a certain level of  extracellular calcium is necessary for adhesion and motility and  that Amphora responds chemotactically to simple sugars and  glutamate.  Calcium has a pivotal role as a second messenger in  control of numerous biological processes.  This ion is  responsible for signal-response coupling in animal, plant, and  other cells during such physiological processes as secretion and  the development of cellular polarity.  The availability of  calcium-sensitive fluorescent probes such as Fura-2, Indo-1,  Fluo-3 has made possible the direct visualization of spatial and  temporal changes in cytosolic free calcium in single cells using  confocal laser scanning microscopy, and changes in intracellular  calcium can be detected in suspensions of synchronized cells  using an appropriate spectrofluorimeter.  Research supported by  this Small Grant for Exploratory Research will establish the  experimental conditions for applying these important experimental  tools in studies of the role of calcium in regulation of cell  adhesion, motility, and chemotaxis in diatoms.  These tools will  then be used to study the effects of external calcium and sugars  that promote chemotaxis on intracellular free calcium levels as  part of a longer term study of the control of physiological  processes by calcium in these, rather primitive, eukaryotes.  %%%  Marine diatoms are responsible for more than half of the world's  replacement oxygen.  The diatoms that are the subject of this  research grow attached to illuminated surfaces in the nearshore  benthic zone.  Whether chemotaxis is a common property of these  organisms is not known.  Although diatoms are green algae and can  carry out photosynthesis, ma ny diatoms from this niche also can  use some simple sugars and amino acids to support their growth.   If, as suggested by preliminary observations, they can sense  chemical gradients of these compounds in the sediment pore water  and move toward higher concentrations, these diatoms could be  important in turnover of dissolved organic carbon in illuminated  sediments.  Yet, despite the potential importance of these  organisms, very little is known about the mechanisms of their  responses to stimuli such as organic compounds.  This Small Grant  for Exploratory Research will be used to lay the experimental  groundwork for studies of the signal transduction pathways  regulating diatom adhesion, motility, and chemotaxis.  The longer  term results of this research will not only fill a gap in  knowledge of the mechanisms by which these little-understood  organisms respond to environmental signals, but should also  provide new insights into their ecological role in the nearshore  food web.  ***",
