 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454719  Friedman    The establishment and assessment of the networking infrastructure  for education (NIE) testbed described in this document is an  integral component of New Jersey's Statewide Systemic Initiative  (NJ SSI) to achieve excellence in mathematics, science, and  technology education throughout the state.  Furthermore, the  activities described herein are guided by, and central to, efforts  toward the full implementation of New Jersey's State Educational  Technology Action Plan.    The critical importance of NIE in achieving statewide systemic  educational reform is reflected in the rate at which new materials  are compiled, new instructional tools are applied and new  instructional methods are adopted.  The curriculum alignment cycle  has been dramatically shortened.  If we are to keep pace, NIE must  be used to provide opportunity for teachers who will create  astounding instructional projects that must be captured  electronically and shared with colleagues at other schools to  support instructional reform throughout the state.    Our goal is to learn more about effective networking strategies and  to develop a significant component of a networking infrastructure  which: 1) enhances student learning; 2) empowers teachers, and; 3)  supports statewide systemic school reform.    Our objectives are: 1) to design and implement the technological  infrastructure; 2) to design and implement strategies for helping  teachers to develop the knowledge, skills, and ability to use the  technological infrastructure to access information and to use such  information resources effectively in their classrooms; 3) to  develop broader public understanding of the educational benefits  that result from the effective use of the technological  infrastructure and to consider public policies which promote such  use; 4) to assure that the benefits to be derived from the use of  the evolving technological infrastructure are available to students  regardless of gender, ethnicity, disability, and poverty level ,  and; 5) to document strategies and results so that others may learn  from our experience.",
