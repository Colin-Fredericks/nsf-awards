The  Vermont EPSCoR State Plan  has been designed to produce lasting systemic change in the  capacity of the state for science and  technology.  It has four goals: 1) to build research  competitiveness in science and technology,  2) to create knowledge transfer mechanisms that effectively link  university expertise to the  private sector, 3) to recruit and train scientists, from high  school to postdoctoral, in research,  and 4) to institutionalize science policy and planning for the  state.  Activity will be centered at  the University of Vermont, the only doctoral institution in the  state, and will involve other  colleges across the state.  About 80% of the resources will be  devoted to building  competitiveness in four subdisciplines: (1) The Evolutionary  Ecology; (2) Computational  Mathematics; (3) Receptor-Mediated Signalling and Biotechnology;  and (4) Advanced Materials  Science.  All the clusters will interact in the EPSCoR Modeling  Colloquium, an interdisciplinary  seminar series which will explore general techniques for modeling  complex systems and data  sets.  In addition, the EPSCoR project fosters interactions between  academic and industrial  scientists by setting up a technology transfer team, drawn from the  university and the private  sector and by also offering a Small Business Innovation Research  public seminar program and  a unique SBIR \"Phase O\" seed grant program to help increase the  rate of SBIR submissions to  federal agencies.  EPSCoR activities will be used to train research  students, from high school  to postdoctoral.  The lead laboratories will be those of the  cluster faculty.  Working with the  Vermont NSF-sponsored Statewide Systemic Initiative program, EPSCoR  will present a yearly  Science-Math-Technology Careers Day for high school science  students and a research program  that joins highly motivated high school students and their teachers  with the faculty of regional  colleges.  In  addition, EPSCoR will provide an undergraduate  research referral service, to place  high school and college students in faculty research laboratories  for a semester or year.  ***",
