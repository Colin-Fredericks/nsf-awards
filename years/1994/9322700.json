The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been extensively studied.  The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994.  NSF-funded projects will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies.  Data collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans and regions.    This component of the program involves shortwave and longwave measurements of the surface flux and optical properties of clouds, haze, and the clear atmosphere in the Arctic.  The CalSpace FTIR spectroradiometer will be installed on the U.S. icebreaker to measure zenith emission spectra in the longwave.  These data will be used to compile a climatology of cloud emissivity, optical depth, and effective radius of droplet size distribution.  Shortwave measurements will be taken using a four-channel solar radiometer system.  A zenith sky camera will be included, along with a standard Eppley Pyranometer and Pyrgeometer for monitoring purposes along the ship track.  Satellite data from the NOAA Polar Orbiters and the Defense Meteorology Satellite Program will be recorded using the on board TereScan facilities such that Arctic radiative processes can be studies from \"both sides\" of the atmosphere.  This will allow for refining cloud detection and radiation budget algorithms.  These integrated measurements have direct  bearing on our understanding of how clouds affect the transfer of heat between the atmosphere and the Arctic, which in turn impact on our ability to understand and predict climate  variability.  ***",
