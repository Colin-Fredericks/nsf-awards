 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  9318929, PI-Signer:  Research into plant biology is hampered by the lack of the technology necessary for site specific recombination.  With that as the ultimate goal, the specific aims of this proposal are to develop in vivo genetic methodology to exploit:  1. Site specific double-strand break repair by HO endonuclease, which should be of value in gene targeting, mosaic analysis, and marker eviction.  2. Site specific genomic rearrangements by FLP recombinase, which should generate deletions, inversions and translocations.  Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting genetic technology, particularly in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  This project will develop in vivo genetic methodology, initially for Arabidopsis but in forms suitable for other plant species too.  Experiments are planned to exploit expression in planta of two yeast site specific enzymes, HO endonuclease and FLP recombinase.  Areas to be explored are gene targeting, marker eviction, mosaic analysis, and genomic rearrangements (deletions, inversions, translocations).  This technology will allow the full range of modern recombinant DNA technology to be brought to bear on plant systems, for both fundamental research and improved engineering of agronomic crop species.",
