 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320527  Bergstrom  Economists usually assume that people are completely  selfish, though when pressed, we are usually willing to  admit that parents seem to love their children and perhaps  each other. This research develops evolutionary models of  human behavior to guide an understanding about the amount  and type of benevolence and conflict to be expected between  siblings, between parents and offspring and among other  relatives. The research draws on the literature of  evolutionary biologists and cultural anthropologists to  motivate the development of the economic models.        As has been observed by evolutionary biologists,  individuals whose genes tell them to be generous to their  relatives are likely to be beneficiaries  of actions by  relatives who share copies of the same genes. The same kind  of reasoning that applies to genetic evolution can be  applied to the evolution of culture and learned behavior.  Much as we have biological parents and biological siblings,  we also have \"cultural siblings\"--those who learned their  behaviors from the same role models as ourselves.This  research project explores the logic of evolution as applied  to genetically and culturally determined behavior towards  ones relatives and neighbors. The study pays particular  attention to the question of how much unselfish cooperation  we would expect to see, given the evolutionary history of  our species.  ***",
