 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eastern U.S. is a major source of ozone and ozone  precursors to the North Atlantic region.  Previous studies have  shown that emissions from this region significantly affect levels  of NOx and hydrocarbons over the Western North Atlantic Ocean, and  recent measurements indicate that transport of ozone produced over  the eastern U.S substantially alters the ozone budget of the  temperate North Atlantic region.  However the total impact of  anthropogenic emissions on the photochemistry of this region is  currently poorly understood.  A primary reason is a paucity of  information on NOx (NO + NO2) and total reactive nitrogen levels  over the central and eastern North Atlantic, which results in  uncertainty as to the ultimate fate and impact of anthropogenic  emissions on the regional ozone budget.       This project seeks to address this problem through  measurements of NO and NOy (total reactive nitrogen oxides) at a  site in the Azores.  The location is ideal for observation of aged  emissions transported from eastern North America and is suitably  isolated from European impacts.  Measurements would be made in  conjunction with a currently-planned CO (carbon) and O3 (ozone)  monitoring program, and would take place in concert with the other  measurement programs in order to assess seasonal variations.  The  resulting data would be used to quantify anthropogenic impacts on  NOx and ozone levels in the North Atlantic troposphere.",
