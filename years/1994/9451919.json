This is apparent in modern computer architectures  and is reflected in the ACM curriculum guidelines.  The purpose of  this proposal is to provide a significant exposure to parallel  processing for the undergraduate students at Mankato State  University. This exposure will be provided through changes to  several existing courses by adding one or more parallel processing  lab exercises to each course and by a new course devoted entirely  to parallel processing.  A MasPar MP-1 processor has been  identified to serve as the hardware platform.  This processor will  provide students with a high degree of parallelism and a user  interface built upon the familiar Unix/C/X-windows base.   Documentation of the experiences, including both successes and  difficulties, will be published allowing other universities to  better evaluate this approach and platform.",
