 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320660  Mare         This is a study of the effects of families on socioeconomic  well-being, collecting data to test a variety of theories in the  Human Capital and Human Resources traditions.  It will field a  module for the 1994 General Social Survey (GSS) that will focus  on these effects.  This module will supplement an established  national survey and obtain information on family structure and  socioeconomic achievement of respondents and their kin, including  siblings, parents, offspring, and spouses.  Sibling information  will be obtained through face-to-face interviews with respondents  and telephone interviews with one adult sibling of each  respondent.  This information will include socioeconomic and  demographic measures routinely asked of GSS respondents plus  information that will enrich our understanding of kinship and  intergenerational mobility processes.  It will include a reliable  measure of cognitive ability for respondents and siblings.  The  module will support a richer array of studies of the  intergenerational mechanisms that contribute to socioeconomic  achievement and inequality than have been possible to date.   Research issues that will be addressed by users of the data  include, but are not limited to: sibling resemblance and family  effects on socioeconomic achievement; measurement errors and  their impact on inferences about the intergenerational  transmission of socioeconomic statuses; the effects of  grandparents on the success of their progeny; multi-generational  models of mobility; marriage patterns and the socioeconomic  makeup of families; and the effects of cognitive abilities on  socioeconomic success.  %%%       The data collected in this research will be a valuable  public resource for studies of the links between family  structure, intergenerational processes, marriage, and  socioeconomic welfare.  By adding a module to both General Social  Surveys administered in 1994, and through the parallel telephone  survey of siblings, this project greatly expan ds the value of one  of NSF's major, long-standing scientific survey projects.  Policy  makers concerned with careers, income and mobility will find the  large resulting data set of great value to them in their  important work.    ***",
