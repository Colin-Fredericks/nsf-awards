 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353582  Lee    As students progress through the educational pipeline from  elementary and high school, into college and graduate school, the  proportionate representation of females interested in studying  science or pursuing it as a career declines sharply.  While it is  reasonable that the group who persists in science becomes  increasingly selective academically at points further along the  pipeline, the fact that this \"select\" group contains so few young  women is more difficult to explain.  The study aims to develop an  educational (rather than an individual choice) explanation for this  phenomenon.  Using data from the current, large, and nationally  representative National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988  (NELS:88), preliminary investigation reveals a gender advantage in  science achievement for 8th grade boys.  More important, the  largest gender differences in science achievement are for students  of the highest ability. Since future women scientist are likely to  be drawn from this pool, these findings suggest a possible cause of  the underrepresentation of women in scientific careers.  The  study's major focus is on students' school and classroom  experiences in science as they move through the pipeline.  Using  the first three waves of NELS:88 data, the study aims to capture  the educational trajectory of the same students in their 8th, 10th,  and 12th grade years.  The focus is on the opportunities schools  provide students to learn science, and how these opportunities  differ by gender-- espcecially for the ablest students.  ***",
