The effects of  local structure, defects and adsorbate interactions on surface  chemical and physical properties are studied in systems ranging  from isolated rare gas atoms and aromatic molecules to self  asembled monolayers and polymer films.  Instrumental  development and expansion of the capabilities of the scanning  probe microscope, including the development of the tunable  microwave frequency AC STM, form a large fraction of the  research effort.  Real systems of fundamental and technological  interest will be examined using scanning probe microscopy in  these studies.  %%%  Scanning tunneling microscopy has proven to be an invaluable  method for the examination of the detailed structure of  surfaces and molecules adsorbed on surfaces.  The research  supported in this program addresses the detailed understanding  of the imaging mechanism operative in scanning probe  microscopy.  A full understanding of the mechanism of image  formation will enable the development of improved scanning  probe methods, increasing the range of interesting and  technologically important surfaces and adsorbed overlayers  which can be probed with these methods.  This instrumentation  development forms a large fraction of the work supported here.",
