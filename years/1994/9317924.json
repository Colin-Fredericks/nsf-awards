 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lively  9317924       The purpose of this study is to evaluate some of the critical  assumptions of the recently developed parasite hypothesis for the  maintenance of genetic diversity and cross fertilization in natural  populations.  The most critical assumption of the parasite  hypothesis is that there is selection imposed by parasites against  host genotypes that become locally common.  If this idea is  correct, then there will be a disadvantage to clonal reproduction  that is proportional to the frequency of any clonally produced  type.  Such selection requires that there is a genetic basis to  infection by parasites, and that parasites rapidly \"track\" locally  common host genotypes.  An ideal system for testing these ideas is  the snail-parasite interaction that Dr. Lively has been working on  since 1985.  The snail and its parasite ( a trematode worm) can be  easily reared in the laboratory.           The goal of the study is to determine whether the parasite  rapidly evolves to infect different clonal types, and whether it  can prevent clones from competitively displacing cross-fertilizing  forms.  The results will be of interest to evolutionary and  conservation biologists interested in the maintenance of genetic  diversity, as well as epidemiologists working on similar parasites  that cause human disease(e.g. Schistosomiasis).",
