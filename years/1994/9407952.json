 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cockburn         The investigator studies, both theoretically and  computationally, massively parallel, efficient methods for  numerically solving problems in which convection plays a major  role.  Of particular interest are the drift-diffusion and  hydrodynamic models for semiconductor devices, and the  compressible Navier-Stokes equations (with high Reynolds numbers)  for viscous flow.  The investigator obtains new a posteriori error  estimates for nonlinear scalar conservation laws, independent of  the numerical scheme under consideration, upon which adaptivity  strategies could be devised.  He also studies a priori error  estimates that allow a deeper understanding of the numerical  methods under consideration.       The objective of this research project is to develop, both  theoretically and computationally, ways to enhance the speed and  the accuracy of massively parallel methods for simulating several  problems in which convection plays a central role.  Applications to  the high-performance computing of simulations of semiconductors  and high-speed fluid flow are direct applications of the results  of this project.  A deep mathematical understanding of the  algorithms for this type of problem is essential for efficiently  obtaining accurate results, but is unfortunately lacking.  The  investigator studies theories that provide such an understanding  to obtain the desired practical high-performance computing  algorithms.",
