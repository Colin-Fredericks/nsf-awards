 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide information regarding  the small sample properties of several recently proposed  methodologies for estimating marginal model mean parameters.  Focus  will be on the generalized estimating equation methodology (Liang  and Zeger, 1986, Zhao and Prentice, 1990, Prentice and Zhao, 1991)  and a likelihood approach to estimation in this setting  (Fitzmaurice and Laird, 1993).  These models are applicable when a  sample of clusters of correlated observations is collected, as in  a longitudinal study.  The critical need for such methods is when  the correlated response measures are discrete or cannot be modelled  with a multivariate normal distribution, and there are both time-  varying and time-stationary continuous covariates.  The impact of  missing data on the small sample properties will also be assessed.   Large-scale computer simulations will be used to address these  questions, with attention paid to computational concerns and  required resources.    The interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate-level  course to statistics students; participating in a graduate-level  course on longitudinal data; organizing a series of mini-courses on  topics related to this research; seminars; informal groups; and  visiting local area statistical organizations with students.",
