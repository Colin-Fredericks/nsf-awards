Key elements of the Initiative are: (1)  twenty-three K-12 constellations (a neighborhood high school  with feeder middle and elementary schools); (2) a core  curriculum based on the NCTM Standards and emerging NAS  science standards and that includes practical applications,  African-centered/multicultural perspectives, algebra for all  students and state-of-the-art technology; (3) a teacher  enhancement program that targets all professional staff and  focuses on enhancing content knowledge, improving  instructional strategies, and altering belief systems; (4)  systemwide organizational and policy changes that will  address equal access, flexibility and change attitudes; and  (5) redeployment of extant resources.  Organizational  changes include establishing K-12 constellations as learning  communities, increased use of mathematics specialists in all  elementary schools, and plans to attract, retain and certify  minority mathematics and science teachers.  Community  collaborations and partnerships, parent programs, and career  counseling are designed to support achievement of the goals  of the USI.",
