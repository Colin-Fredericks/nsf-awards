The project involves three aspects of  this problem, singularity formation, weak solutions, and pattern  formation.  A singularity occurs when the thickness of the film  goes to zero.  Physically the singularity corresponds to a  topological transition in the fluid.  The study will be made via  a combination of numerics and analysis the onset of such  singularity formation forth order degenerate diffusion equations.  This work may include collaborations with M. Brenner, L.  Kadanoff, T. Dupont, and A. Bernoff.         The investigator is working with Mary Pugh at the  Courant Institute on the weak solution problem.  This  collaboration recently established sharper existence and long  time behavior results for weak solutions to the thin film  equation.  The existence is in a regularity class that just  includes a family of unique `source type' solutions        analogous to the `Barenblatt' solutions of the porous media  equation.  Preliminary numerical computations show that in  general weak solutions converge rapidly onto the `source type'  solution.  It is planned to complete the numerics as well as to  relate these weak solutions to slip models' suggested for the  spreading drop problem.  Lastly, in a joint project with M.  Brenner, problems in pattern formation such a gravity and  temperature driven fingering instabilities in thin films will be  studied.  ***",
