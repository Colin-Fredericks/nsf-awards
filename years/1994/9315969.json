 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315969  Rikvold  The proposed research consists of two main parts: lattice gas  modelling of phase transitions in electrochemical adsorption, and  the study of metastability near first-order phase transitions.   Both projects employ non-perturbative statistical mechanical  numerical methods; ie Monte Carlo simulation, finite-size scaling  and transfer matrix calculations.  (1) The electrochemical  adsorption of urea, acetic and oxalic acid molecules and of  chloride and phosphate anions onto single crystal platinum surfaces  will be simulated and directly compared with experimental  observations.  (2) Metastability near first order phase transitions  in simple model systems will be examined via transfer matrix  techniques which produce complex valued free energies - the  imaginary part being proportional (it is believed) to the lifetime  of the metastable state. These lifetimes will be compared with  those obtained by more direct numerical methods.  %%%  This work involves the understanding of phase transitions - both at  the fundamental level and at the system-specfic level.  In the  latter case, the adsorption of molecules and charged ions at  electrodes in solution will be modelled and compared directly to  experiment.  In the former case, metastability near abrupt phase  transitions (eg supercooling of water below the melting point) will  be studied via a new mathematical method which gives the lifetime  of these states directly.  These lifetimes will be compared with  estimates from nucleation theory and from direct numerical  modelling.  ***",
