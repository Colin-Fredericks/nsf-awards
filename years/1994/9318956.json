 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with analytically verifying the  satisfaction of timing constraints of component interfaces in board  level circuits.  A methodology, VITCh (VLSI Interface Timing  Checker), that will allow the analytic timing verification of  realistic board-level circuits through new models of behavior and  verification is proposed.  A hierarchial model of interface  behavior that allows the task to be decomposed to minimize overall  complexity is also proposed.  The proposed model will allow  efficient timing analysis of board-level circuits and thereby  enable the analytical verification of large and complex circuits  that existing approaches are unable to verify.  A CAD system  implementing VITCh to provide a testbed for experimentally  validating the model and methodology is proposed as part of the  project.  The proposer attempts to solve the timing analysis  problem by decomposing the task into several subtasks that can be  executed concurrently.  Each subtask is performed such that timing  constraints are verified during the process of circuit behavior  enumeration and eliminates the need to build and analyze composite  representations of circuit behavior.  The research plan includes  testing VITCh on circuits ranging from tens to hundreds of  components to establish the range of applicability of the algorithm  as a function of circuit size.",
