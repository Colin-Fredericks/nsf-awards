 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403318  Garrigan     The metabolic load (ML) hypothesis suggests that quantitative  differences between specialist and generalist insect herbivores are  responsible for the evolution of dietary specialization.  This  hypothesis is underpinned by two critical assumptions: that the  capability to detoxify plant secondary compounds is physiologically  costly to insects and that specialists have a detoxification  advantage relative to generalists.  Rigorous evaluation of the ML  hypothesis will only be possible when reliable data are collected  in a consistent fashion for several specialist and polyphagous  herbivore.  Bomb calorimetry and newly - developed flow through  respirometry will be employed to calculate growth and metabolic  efficiency for 12 Lepidopteran herbivore (six generalist and six  specialist) species being fed six different plant - derived toxins;  cost and efficiency estimates will be in comparable energetic  units.  %%%  This research addresses the topic of host specialization in plant  / insect interactions.  Within the past five to ten years, the  scientific community has come to recognize that a treasure trove of  biologically active chemical compounds exists within the natural  world.  The most intelligent way to understand this complexity is  by ascertaining how it evolves over ecological / evolutionary time.   One of the most elegant ways of accomplishing this goal is by  \"assaying\" coevolved ecological relationships using a battery of  extractive and quantitative chemical methods of analysis.  Results  of such studies can then be adapted for pharmacological purposes.  ***",
