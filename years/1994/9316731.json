 "awd_abstract_narration": "Button  9316731     A rather even distribution of bacteria occurs in the  world's oceans.  They recycle a large fraction of the  organic material to CO2, leaving a very dilute organic  mixture, and send an unknown fraction up the food chain.  Their adaptation to the dilute solution results in cellular  properties that set them apart from organisms commonly  cultured from the sea.  These properties include small size  necessitating special methods of observation, the ability to  subsist in very dilute conditions suggesting the name  oligobacteria, and resistance to cultivation.  The  development of a number of new methods is at the stage where  scientists can now applied them to these typical  oligobacteria: (i) dilution culture for isolating members of  the population and determining  their viability, (ii)  population structure in sea water for estimating in situ  growth rates, (iii) high resolution flow cytometry for  quantifying their populations, evaluating their  biochemistry, and determining their 3-dimensional  distribution, (iv) phylogenetics for taxonomic evaluation,  and (v) kinetic theory for interpreting the results.  The  overall objective of this project is to describe the balance  between the concentration of dissolved nutrients and the  organisms that affect nutrient concentrations through  selective removal.  To understand how oligobacteria regulate  the concentration of  organic nutrients,  Dr. Button plans  nutritional, kinetic and biochemical studies on isolates.  Integrated in these studies are experiments to produce dense  cultures to learn how dilute organic solutions regulate  maximal marine populations.  In addition, the project will  investigate using freshly collected sea water the range of  growth rates and organism characteristics that one considers  common, in order to refine concepts of viability and  to  evaluate the effect of grazing on bacterioplankton  characteristics.  ***",
