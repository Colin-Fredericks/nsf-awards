The original reason  for the word \"Informal\" in the title is not clear, for this  conference has had a long and illustrious history since it was  first held in 1952 at UCLA.  Like Gordon Conferences, results  presented at these conferences are not to be referenced in the open  literature; this policy encourages discussion of new, controversial  findings and perhaps accounts for the word \"Informal\" in the  conference title.       NSF funding will be used solely for the purpose of supporting  student and postdoc participation.  A registration, lodging and  travel subsidy of up to 50% will be provided on a competitive  bases.  Students and postdocs will be asked to write a page  describing their research and whether they are coauthors or  presenting authors of a paper.  The conference organizing committee  will review the requests and will allocate funds based on need, but  with preference going to those who present papers.",
