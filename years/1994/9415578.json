Krylov space methods are used for the iterative solution of large  systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems that arise in  scientific and engineering applications.  In addition to work on  algorithm design and analysis by numerical analysts, engineers  and scientists study the properties and suitability of these  methods in the context of special applications.    The purpose of this workshop is to bring theory and applications  together.  Four teams of speakers will discuss in detail their  collaborative work on the application of state-of-the-art ideas  from numerical analysis to the solution of real world problems.   A team consists of a numerical analyst and an expert in an  applications area.  The tentative list of applications includes  problems in geophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, and fluid  mechanics.",
