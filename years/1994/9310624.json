 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310624  Ereshefsky  Linneaus developed his system of classifying animals and plants to  accord with the biological theory of his day, namely a theory based  on creationism and essentialism.  Linneaus assumed that God created  an initial pair of organisms for each species and after God's  original creation no new species could arise.  Contemporary  biology, of course, does not contain such tenets.  The source of  species is not God but evolution through natural selection and  various other biological processes.  Despite the abandonment of  Linneaus' biological assumptions, the Linnaean System is still the  preferred framework for constructing classifications of the organic  world.  However, with the advent of evolutionary theory, the  Linnaean System faces numerous problems that undermine its  effectiveness.  The Linnaean System has lost its theoretical basis  and has become both cumbersome and ontologically vacuous.  Yet,  there is currently no thorough study of the problems confronting  the Linnaean System.  Dr. Ereshefsky, under this grant, is  providing just such a study.  Another aim for Dr. Ereshefsky is to  investigate an alternative taxonomic system, namely Willi Hennig's  1969 numerical system.  Preliminary work indicates that Hennig's  system can overcome many of the problems facing the Linnaean  System.  ***",
