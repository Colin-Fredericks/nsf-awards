 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403210  Catchen    This is an interdisciplinary program to investigate bonding  symmetry on surfaces and at interfaces using perturbed-angular-  correlation spectroscopy.  The investigations will use the indium-  lll radioactive PAC probe to measure nuclear electric quadruple  interactions on well characterized semiconductor surfaces of  gallium-arsenide and related compounds produced by molecular beam-  epitaxy (MBE).  In addition, interactions at strained interfaces  will be investigated, within as-grown and annealed low-temperature  gallium arsenide, and epitaxial metals deposited in-situ.  These  experiments can produce information on:  (1) the strength and  symmetry of bonds between probe and surface atoms, (2) the thermal  stability of various semiconductors and metal surface sites, (3)  the kinetics of indium-lll probe diffusion and redistribution at  semiconductor-semiconductor and semiconductor-metal interfaces, (4)  the local strain at the indium-lll probe in pseudomorphic  materials, (5) the interaction of these probe atoms with point  defects in the crystals and the evolution of those interactions  with annealing, and (6) magnetic hyperfine fields and the character  of surface magnetism in epitaxial magnetic-metal films.    % % % %    This is an interdisciplinary program to investigate chemical  bonding symmetry on surfaces that are prepared by molecular-beam  epitaxy.  Surfaces of gallium-arsenide semiconductors and related  compounds, and interfaces between surfaces of dissimilar but  related crystals such as the interface between gallium-arsenide  surface and an indium arsenide surface will be investigated.  The  work will be extended to the investigation interfaces between  gallium arsenide and various magnetic metals.  The study also will  include epitaxial growth under non-optimal and non-equilibrium  conditions.  The investigations will use a nuclear technique known  as perturbed-angular-correlation (PAC) spectroscopy.  The technique  involves measuring the interactions of ra dioactive probes, which  are deposited during crystal growth, with the effect of local  electric field and magnetic fields in the vicinity of these  radioactive probe nuclei.  The indium-lll isotope will be the  isotope of choice.  ***",
