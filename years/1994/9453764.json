 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453764  Feurzeig    The projected National Information Infrastructure will have to  accommodate a tremendous level of user traffic, with great dynamic  fluctuations in both user load and computational demand-and it will  have to do this in a user-transparent seamless fashion.  At the  same time, the system will need to be a great deal more accessible  and friendly than current networks, to better serve users of widely  varying degrees of sophistication.  This calls for the development  of new networking technologies incorporating significant advances  in the underlying technological foundations.  It also calls for a  new and more natural superstructure based on a distinctly different  organizational paradigm that will provide the required salability  while supporting the rich, complex, multi-media communication,  computation, and collaboration essential for distributed  educational networking applications.  We propose to develop and  demonstrate MuseNet, a sophisticated technological infrastructure  for network-mediated science and math education.  MuseNet is a  generic distributed computer and communications environment  simultaneously accessible by multiple users over interactive  computer network connections.  The system will support  instructional interactions centered on student work with science  and mathematics microworlds including visual simulations and  models.  The programs will be distributed through network servers  for local operation on client machines.  The enabling technology  will support the communication, computational, and educational  environments for supporting an extensive and diverse set of science  education projects.  It will serve as a pilot facility for  exploring and investigating the technical and educational issues  posed by high bandwidth networks such as the projected NII system.  ***",
