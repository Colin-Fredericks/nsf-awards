 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400213  Ogale       The goal of this research is the development of methodologies  for the integration of materials design with free form  manufacturing.  Design will be based on the assumption that the  product can be built by decomposing it into layers, and then  creating each layer by a free form manufacturing technique.   Knowledge of the designed material and stress and strain contours  in the product will be used to plan the prototyping process.  Surface contour and form error desired, as well as structural  analysis results will determine the layer thickness, layout of  fibers in each layer, beam diameter, traverse speed and  polymerization.  The design methodologies will be validated by  processing parts in an automated photolithography unit.  A  continuous fiber dispensing device will provide automatic fiber  placement and laser beam motion in the required patterns.  In situ  addition of fibers will provide an opportunity for the  investigation of two fundamental issues, wetting of the fiber  surfaces by photoresins and the hindered cure kinetics of  photoresins due to the presence of reinforcing fibers.         This research will provide information about the movement of  liquid fronts along fiber surfaces and give insight into the \"slip\"  phenomenon at the gas-liquid-solid interface, and it will help in  developing an understanding of the cure mechanisms in  multifunctional photoresins that are used in free form  manufacturing techniques.",
