 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the design and implementation   algorithms for nonlinear optimization.  The research focuses   on  the solution of  large problems, and has two broad objectives.  The first is   to develop a new  algorithm for solving large and  unstructured unconstrained   problems.  This work is  motivated by the need of solving   large and nonsparse  problems  efficiently.  The new algorithm uses ideas from   both  Newton  methods and variable metric updating, and is tested  on large   problems arising in weather forecasting.    The second   objective is to study  efficient techniques for  handling inequality constraints   occurring in nonlinear  programming.  This research focuses on large problems, and   techniques are designed to be useful in that case.  The  use   of an  ellipsoidal-type method is explored.  This  approach has the   advantage of  leading readily into a sequence of  equality constrained   subproblems which can  be solved by existing  software.  An alternative approach,   which consists of  extending  the primal-dual method of linear programming to   the nonlinear  case,  is also explored.  The algorithm is posed in the  framework   of trust  region methods, and its relationship with  sequential   quadratic programming is  fully exploited.  The  two new approaches for handling   constraints are tested on a set of large problems, and the   treatment of  ill-conditioning receives careful consideration.",
