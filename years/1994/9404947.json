 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404947  Kobayashi       Network technologies have been progressing rapidly toward  faster and larger networks which are capable of providing  integrated services.  These technical developments in turn require  advances in analytic methodologies that can be effectively used in  the design and control of future networks such as ATM-based B-ISDN,  all-optical networks and wireless communication networks.  Emerging  high-speed integrated communication services require us to analyze  network systems, in which information loss probabilities range from  10**-2 (e.g., call connection loss) to as small as 10**-10 (e.g.,  ATM cell loss).       In this proposed study we will develop a theoretical foundtion  for evaluation and control of connection-oriented services, which  in particular will enable us to handle this wide range of loss  probabilities. We begin by generalizing  the product form solutions  obtained for loss networks with fixed routing.  Our formulation  encompasses a broad range of state-dependent call generation  patterns, different types of network services, and the whole range  of traffic levels. Using our experience in computational algorithms  for closed queueing network models, we will develop new practical  methods for estimating loss probabilities in connection-oriented  services.  In order to insure the accuracy of approximate formulas,  we will develop  appropriate error bounds.  A refinement and a  rigorous validation of the reduced load approximation method,  also  referred to as the Erlang's fixed  point method in the case of  Poisson arrivals, will be attempted for networks with state  dependent arrivals.       In parallel with the above algorithmic and asymptotic methods,  we will explore a model of connection-oriented network services  based on a multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  diffusion process.  The diffusion process approach will allow  us not only to evaluate  more general types of networks (i.e.,  loss/queueing networks not  amenable to product form solutions) but  also to obtain  time-dependent, i.e., transient, solutions for network behavior.   Finally, we will formulate and  solve network control policy  problems such as call admission control and routing decisions.  ***",
