The research will examine  cultural representations of paternity among poor, unmarried  parents.  Drawing on 60 interviews in New Jersey with never-  married mothers and fathers (black and white) with incomes at or  below 125% of the poverty line, the study investigates the  categories into which they interpret the rights and  responsibilities of fatherhood.  It also explores whether  different representations of paternity can be explained by the  socio-demographic characteristics and cultural or structural  environments of respondents.  This analysis will speak to such  sociological questions as: 1) What is the significance of  paternity for the poor in contemporary society?  2) Do never-  married parents perceive legal fatherhood to be culturally  normative, or do they accept the mother-child dyad or the  matrifocal, extended family as equally viable cultural  alternatives?  3) For unmarried parents, does the recent increase  in nonmarital childbearing symbolize a cultural response to  improving social conditions for women or the reproduction of  gender inequality within new family arrangement?  %%%       This research will contribute to the sociology of the  family, of gender roles, and of contemporary urban culture.   Given that about a quarter of all births in the United States now  occur outside of marriage, the research will also contribute to  the knowledge base upon which policy makers will decide the  public response to changing social conditions and problems.  In  addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,  this award will materially assist a highly promising student in  completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it  contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and  the thorough training of the next generation of social  scientists.    ***",
