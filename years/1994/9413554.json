 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hare    This grant provides partial support to permit the Carnegie  Institute of Washington to purchase a high-performance liquid  chromatograph, gas chromatograph, combined gas chromatograph/mass  spectrometer and an autosampler for an amino acid analyzer. These  instruments will be used by Dr. P Edgar Hare and his colleagues  to expand their research into the chemical changes in organic  matter in fossil mollusks and ostrich egg shell. For a number of  years these researchers have worked to use such reactions as a  chemical clock to date sites of archaeological significance. The  methods they have developed are particularly important for sites  too old (older than ca. 45,000 years) and too young (younger than  ca. 400 years) for radiocarbon dating. In particular the group  will focus on the development and application of amino acid  racemization and other digenetic reactions in ostrich eggshell  for dating African and Asian archaeological sites. They will  attempt to develop simultaneous equations for both age and mean  temperature history. They will also study digenetic changes other  than racemization for the dating of very old sites and continue  to improve the use of aspartic acid racemization for dating  recent occurrences. The techniques will be applied to a number of  sites including late Holocene cores from Lake Titicaca, Bolivia,  archaeological sites in central Texas as well as Nile Delta  cores.    Accurate dates are crucial in archaeological as well as  climatological, geological and other environmentally related  sciences. Although a number of techniques such as radiocarbon and  argon/argon dating are available, these and others have  limitations both in the kinds of materials they require and the  time range they cover. Ostrich eggshell and many types of mollusc  shell are present in a wide range of archaeological sites. They  also occur naturally in a wide range of geological situations.  The potential to obtain accurate dates from such materials has  widespread significance acr oss a range of disciplines.",
