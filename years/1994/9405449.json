 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405449  Abstract  This project focuses on the nature of RNA polymerase II  transcription termination in higher eukaryotes.  In contrast to  prokaryotes, the 3' ends of mature eukaryotic mRNAs are generated  by processing rather than by transcription termination.  The  processing of the nascent RNA transcripts, combined with the  inherent instability of the primary RNA products generated by  termination, has thus restricted the in vivo analysis of  transcription termination.  It is clear, however, that RAN  polymerase II transcription termination is seldom, if ever,  localized to single discreet site, but rather, occurs over a region  that may extend for several kilobases.  both the sequence and  location of the termination region with respect to the end of the  mature mRNA are specific to each transcription unit.  Although the  sequences encompassing the termination region appear to play a  significant role, the key termination signal appears to be  generated by the 3' processing of the nascent RNA transcript.  3'  processing is an obligatory step in the  biosynthesis of a  functional mRNA.  Therefore the coupling of pre-mRNA 3' processing  and RNA polymerase II transcription termination offers an elegant  mechanism for assuring that mRNA synthesis is complete prior to  transcription termination.  ***  The central goal of this project is to elucidate the biochemical  basis for the coupling of RNA polymerase II transcription  termination and mRNA 3' processing.  The recent development of a  well characterized and highly purified mRNA 3' processing system  will form the basis of this work.  The specific objectives of this  proposal are to: 1) Develop an in vitro system for the  investigation of the coupling of RNA polymerase II transcription  termination to the 3' processing of the nascent RNA, 2) Delineate  the role of a 5' to 3' processing machinery and the RNA polymerase  II transcription complex.  A basic knowledge of the mechansims that  serve to direct the termination of RNA polymerase II t ranscription  may lead to an understanding of the manner in which this process  contributes to the regulation of gene expression.  %%%",
