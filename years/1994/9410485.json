 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410485  Sundaram    The framework of Markovian or Stochastic games has been used to  analyze a great variety of issues in economics and game theory.   It is somewhat surprising then that, in contrast to the very  well-understood framework of repeated games, remarkably little is  known in general about the properties of abstract Markovian  games.  The first part of the project addresses open theoretical  questions about the existence of subgame-perfect equilibrium in  Markovian games, and the properties of the equilibrium set.  The  second part continues ongoing research by the investigators into  the applications of the Markovian game framework to economic  problems.  Research is continued on common-property resource  games, research and development in oligopoly, and repeated  elections and principal/agent games.  Two new classes of games  studied are those of information-processing and of natural-  resource exploitation.  The investigators plan to complete a  paper detailing the literature on the applications of Markovian  games and publish it jointly with an earlier paper providing a  detailed summary of available theoretical results on the  existence and properties of equilibrium in abstract Markovian  games as a monograph for other researchers and advanced graduate  students.",
