Barrientos of  the University of Chile.  The researchers will analyze  historic earthquake seismograms from events between  1920 and 1963 along the Chilean subduction zone. They  will use modern waveform methods to determine  earthquake source parameters  and will evaluate  seismic cycles of the underthrusting and normal fault  earthquakes along the coast of Chile.  The study will  include detailed analyses of earlier historic  earthquakes.     The Chilean subduction zone segment of the Nazca South  American plate boundary has failed repeatedly in large  earthquakes.  To better assess future earthquake  hazards along this plate boundary, more information  about previous earthquakes is needed.  Since this type  of tectonics has parallels in areas of the U.S. and  its territories, the proposed study may lead to  increased understanding of U.S. earthquakes hazard.  ***",
