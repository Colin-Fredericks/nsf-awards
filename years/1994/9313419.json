This building houses the   molecular  biology and molecular virology research activities of the campus that  have spun-off world leaders in these fields.  Both research and research training  programs take place in this building and the respective activities have made  these departments world class.  However, this building was built in 1965 and  has not been renovated since it's inception.  The renovation to take place will  replace the heating system, the ventilation system and fume hoods, the distilled  water supply system, and other mechanical support systems that have become  obsolete and worn that now impede the over-all research effort and capability.   Finally, this renovation project will solve a variety of safety-related issues having  to do with the use of hazardous chemicals in fume hoods, the handling and  storage of radioactive materials, and current crowing of incompatible operations  in unsuitable laboratory spaces.  A total of 163 faculty, postdocs, and students  will be impacted by this renovation.  The renovation project underway will  enhance the research and training efforts in a strategic research area,  biotechnology.",
