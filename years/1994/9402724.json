The study, based on ethnographic  and  archival  analysis,  focuses on alterations  that  have  occurred  during  the  past  50  years in the Tlingit  village  of  Hoonah,  Alaska.  It  is proposed that these changes were the  results  of  events beyond village control as well as deliberate decisions  by  village leaders. Furthermore, it is suggested that social  change  may be deliberately created by members of a society as a means to  generate  political power. The project will fill a major  gap  in  our knowledge of contemporary Native American social organization  and   contribute   to  anthropological  knowledge   of   cultural  transformation.  ***",
