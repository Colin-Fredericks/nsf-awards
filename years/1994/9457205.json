 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457205  Orme       The award is for research focused on the union of nanophase  materials synthesis and net-form manufacturing with controlled  molten metal droplet deposition.  Novel methods of droplet  generation form capillary stream break-up enable higher levels of  control and  manipulation of the droplet characteristics (e.g.,  droplet sizes and separations) than could be obtained with  conventional methods of droplet generation.  Precise control of the  droplets trajectories (angular dispersion of the order of 1 micro-  radian) is the basis for the net-form manufacturing claims.   Control of the droplet sizes and trajectories leads to control of  the solidification characteristics of the deposited droplets.  As  the droplets impinge onto a temperature controlled substrate, they  \"splat\" and rapidly solidify.  Rapid solidification leads to the  synthesis of materials with refined micro/nano-structures.   Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the synthesis of   nanophase materials composed of low-melting point bismuthtin  alloys.  Technical issues to be investigated include heat transfer  and phase change, fluid dynamics of droplet impact, and  characterization of control parameters for optimization of net-form  manufacturing and nanophase materials synthesis with higher  melting-point materials.       Application of novel research in droplet generation and  control to the manufacturing discipline of rapid prototyping or  net-form manufacturing opens the door to a novel and efficient  manufacturing process that could likely increase the  competitiveness of the nation's industrial base.  The impact of the  research is three-fold.  Fist, net-form manufacturing has  significant economic benefits since the engineering part is made  from the raw stock in one integrated operation, thereby eliminating  many machining steps.  Second, noncrystalline materials synthesis  is known to produce materials with enhanced mechanical and magnetic  properties.  Third, due to rapid solidification of the dr oplets,  the synthesis of new alloys which could not be made by conventional  methods due to macroscopic segregation is now a likely possibility  which would have significant impact on industry and society.",
