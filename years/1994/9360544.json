 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360544  Owen    If academic subjects are taught in isolation, students cannot  appreciate the development of and the relationships emanating from  the concepts that they are required to master.  Integration of  subjects or \"integrated curricula\" is a new pedagogical approach  that affords excellent platforms for research and a far better  educated populace than is to be found currently.  Presently,  however, most middle and secondary teachers have neither the time  nor the administrative support to enable them to teach a subject in  an integrated framework--one that may use the historical and  cultural context to show it development.  This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to investigate  the feasibility of developing a teacher assistant software design  for middle and secondary teachers of mathematics that uses concepts  and their contexts (cases) for case-based reasoning (CBR) for use  on Internet.    The project has the potential to contribute an effective and  accessible teaching aid for integrating curriculum.  This tool will  facilitate the maintainence of learners interest and the  development of a mental facility in students for linking concepts  and thus enlarging their problem solving capabilities.  ***",
