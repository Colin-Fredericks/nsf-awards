We will build a teaching laboratory for  undergraduates interested in robotics. The laboratory will be at an  intermediate stage of advancement situated between the basics  taught in an undergraduate robotics course and the advanced topics  taught in first year graduate courses. The laboratory will provide  hands-on experience for undergraduates. Our goal is to strengthen  the manufacturing base by educating students in the fundamentals of  industrial manipulation and by exposing them to the practical  research results of the last two decades.  We envision that the  laboratory will contain a series of robots, geometric modeling  systems, and small-scale factory work cells. The robots will be  Zebra Zero force-controlled robots, controlled from workstations  running planning and geometric modeling systems. Each robot will be  given a camera and frame grabber for use in hand-eye tasks.   Undergraduates will be expected to enroll in this laboratory course  for academic credit. The curriculum will consist of a structured  sequence of robot manipulation tasks, ranging from parts orienting,  to parts assembly, to the planning and execution of cooperative  robot strategies among several robots.",
