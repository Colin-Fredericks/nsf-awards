 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407124  Bates     This project supports three cultural anthropologists studying how  Puerto Rican sufferers from chronic, incurable arthritis cope  with their pain and disability.  The researchers will identify a  group of about 65 sufferers from arthritis and in a series of  intensive interviews will study how they cope with and manage  their diseases.  This information will be compared with the  studies of how Anglo populations cope with chronic disease.  Methods include intensive life history interviews, examination of  patient records, and the administration of standardized  questionnaires dealing with pain management, coping strategies,  and psychological adjustment to chronic illness (the Arthritis  Impact Measurement Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Satisfaction  With Life Scale, Ethnicity and Pain Questionnaire, and Locus of  Control style.       This project is important because it broadens the model of  adaptation to chronic illness to include ethnic variables.  It  will add to our understanding of the human ability to adapt to  incurable chronic disease by determining what coping strategies,  resources, constraints and other factors in the subjects varied  environments affect their overall level of adjustment.  The  knowledge from this project will be useful to all health care  personnel seeking to develop culturally relevant health care  delivery procedures.  The project also involves the research of  handicapped and minority scientists, and therefore contributes to  the diversity of the active researcher population.",
