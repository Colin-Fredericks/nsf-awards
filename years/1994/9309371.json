 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309371  TURVEY    This research will address how perception of the properties of  objects and surfaces can be achieved on the basis of touch and  without benefit of vision.  The focus will be on the dynamic touch  system, in which perception is tied to circumstances that affect  the muscle and tendon states (as when effort is expended in order  to heft an object or strike surrounding surfaces with a cane).  In  these experiments, people will wield an unseen object to perceive  its length, weight, shape, or orientation, use a cane to explore  occluded objects, apertures, and surfaces at a distance, or  oscillate a taut strand anchored at both ends to perceive objects  attached to the strand.  They will adjust movable surfaces or  visible pointers to quantify the perceived properties.  Distance,  length, orientation, and so on, will be manipulated.  The  experiments will be directed, first, at identifying the  capabilities of the dynamic touch system, i.e., what properties can  be perceived reliably, and, second, at the basis of that  perception.  The latter will highlight the physical constants that  relate the lawfully varying forces and motions; these constants are  assumed to govern perception of object and surface properties by  dynamic touch.  Identifying hand-related capabilities and the  physical properties that underwrite them will have implications for  the design of robotic limbs and prostheses, as well as for the  general theory of special purpose cognitive mechanisms.    ***",
