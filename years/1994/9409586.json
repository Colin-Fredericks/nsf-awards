 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409586  Schreiber    Under the direction of Dr. Katharina Schreiber, Mr. Dennis Ogburn  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological fieldwork in the Saraguro region of highland  Ecuador. Centering the study on the known Inca sites of Ingapirca  and Tambo Blanco, Mr Ogburn and colleagues will conduct a survey  of a 150 - 300 square km area. Prehistoric sites will be  recorded, photographed and mapped. Architectural data will be  noted and all ceramics and artifacts will be collected. If  necessary, limited excavation will also be conducted. Available  museum collections will be examined. Mr Ogburn will attempt to  determine the changes which occurred when Incan peoples conquered  the region. To accomplish this, he will reconstruct both pre-Inca  and Incan settlement and subsistence systems and compare the two.  Through study of ceramics he will gain insight into the extent of  population continuity or change.    The goal of this research is to understand how, at a simple  technological level, empires are established and maintained.  Historic and ethnohistoric evidence demonstrate that within a  relatively short period of time Incan peoples from highland Peru  expanded their area of control to include most of the Andes. It  appears that they employed a number of methods to incorporate  conquered territories into their empire and to control them. One  of these included wholesale movement of peoples. Mr. Ogburn  wishes to gain insight into such strategies through the intensive  study of one such area.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on  mechanisms of social control and organization, and will assist in  the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
