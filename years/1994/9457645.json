 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of adaptive and learing strategies in engineering systems  is  important for several reasons including increased  robustness  against  changes in operating conditions and errors in  data  and  modeling,  reduced  need for explicit programming,  and  improved  performance  over time.  However, although such  strategies  have  been  widely  used and studied, certain basic questions  such  as  \"What are optimal strategies for adaptation?\" and \"How much  data  is  required?\" remain largely unanswered.  Therefore, the  design  of  adaptive and learning systems is generally done in an ad  hoc  manner with little experience gained from on e application to the  next.   furthermore,  very  few  performance  guarantees  can  be  provided  for the algorithms used.  The goal of this research  is  to  contribute  to the theoretical foundations  of  adaptive  and  learning  systems.  Some particular topics to be pursued  include  the  analysis of estimation and adaptive control algorithms under  arbitrary  disturbances, the study of fundamental limitations  in  system  identification,  and  understanding  the  role  of  prior  uncertainty and feedback in determining system performance.   The  primary goal is to obtain results on the fundamental capabilities  and  limitations  of adaptive and learning systems  in  order  to  allow more principled design and analysis of such systems.",
