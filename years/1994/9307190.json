 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307190  Amy  This is an award to provide support for research to develop a  comprehensive model that describes the competitive sorption of  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water by minerals bound and  naturally present organic matter.  The investigators plan on  relating the transport of hydrophobic organic compounds like  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to factors that facilitate or  retard them by sorption on materials through which the water  flows.  The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to be studied span  the solubility range from naphthalene to benzo(alpha)anthracene.  The natural organic matter will include standard reference humic  substances as well as that in natural soils.  Minerals used will  include quartz, goethite, calcite, kaolinite and montmorillonite  alone and in various combinations typical of aquifers.    The result of this project is expected to be a mathematical model  that describes transport characteristics of polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons in groundwater when subjected to contact with  naturally present organic matter and aquifer minerals.  Its  potential use will be in the design and operation of processes  and systems for remediation of groundwater and soil that has been  contaminated with hydrocarbons.",
