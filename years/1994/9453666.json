 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453666  Richardson  The Baltimore Urban Systemic Initiative (BUSI) has as its  core a vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and  science fundamentals which will permit all students to  participate fully in a technological society and enable a  significantly greater number of Baltimore students to pursue  careers in mathematics, science, engineering, and  technology.  The BUSI features five major components: (1) a  new standards-based, K-12 science, mathematics and  technology (SMT) curriculum which includes increased science  and mathematics content and hands on, student-centered  pedagogy; (2) extensive professional development for  teachers to support the new curriculum; (3) a variety of  academic enrichment and support services offered directly to  students and teachers; (4) policy changes that \"enable\"  systemic change; and (5) the use of the \"Efficacy Model\" to  alter the belief systems of students and school personnel as  to the ability of all students to perform at a high level  and succeed in obtaining a quality SMT education.  The  Initiative will be implemented in partnership with Morgan  State University (MSU).  Professional development for  teachers will be offered through MSU and other local  universities and informal science organizations.  MSU's  successful Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities will  be an integral component of the BUSI plan, with particular  responsibility for providing student enrichment activities.",
