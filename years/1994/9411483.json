The project deals with the synthesis,  properties and utilization of materials related to poly(ethylene  oxide), a polymer manufactured in both Bulgaria and the United  States.  Specifically, the work to be performed at the SUNY-  Syracuse campus would involve associative star polymers with  poly(ethylene oxide) arms end-capped with a hydrophobic moiety.   Such star polymers, presently being investigated in our  laboratory, cause phase separation when added to water, with  formation of a polymer rich gel phase.  This phase has a high  capacity and affinity for hydrophobic organic solutes.  The  project aims to synthesize and characterize new associative  amphophilic star polymers with PEO arms, to find the factors that  govern the phase separation in water and that control the  transfer of organic solutes to the gel phase, and to explore  methods to recover the star polymers after extracting the organic  solutes from water.        This proposed research in theoretical physics fulfills the  program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest  and competence.  ***",
