 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the electrical signals required for neuronal  communication are produced by the activation of ion channels  located in the surface membrane of neurons.  A rich  repertoire of electrical signals can be produced within a  single neuron by the selective activation of various types  of ion channels heterogeneously distributed among different,  specialized regions, including the cell body, which contains  the nucleus and the metabolic machinery involved in protein  synthesis, and the dendrites and axons, long filament-like  processes through which neurons communicate with each other.  We are studying the mechanisms by which ion channels are  synthesized by neurons and inserted into their surface  membrane, with the overall goal of identifying mechanisms  that neurons used to regulate the expression of ion channels  in their surface membrane.  In particular, our proposed  research is focused on the packaging of ion channels into  small transport vesicles that carry the channels from their  site of synthesis in the cell body to the surface membrane  throughout the neuron.  We recently developed a simple  technique for collecting transport vesicles from cultured  cells.  From samples of these vesicles, we are using  immunological techniques to isolate subpopulations of  vesicles carrying specific ion channel proteins, thereby  enabling us to use biochemical and electron microscopy  techniques to characterize in detail the properties of the  vesicles and their ion channel cargo.  In addition, we are  testing the hypothesis that:  (1)  different types of ion  channels are sorted, packaged and independently transported  to different regions of the surface membrane and (2)  ion  channels acquire their functional properties prior to  insertion into the surface membrane.  Although the scope of  this investigation will not be affected by the reduction in  my current budget request, the reduction will require my  continued reliance on equipment in other laboratories.",
