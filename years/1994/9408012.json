 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408012  Goetz    Ovulation is the release of a mature egg from its enclosure  in the ovary.  Progestational steroids have been implicated  in the control of ovulation but little is known about their  specific role in this process.  The objective of this  proposal is to determine what these steroids are  specifically stimulating in the ovary at the time of  ovulation.  To accomplish this, a fish model, the yellow  perch, will be used.  The reason for using this model is  that research on perch has already demonstrated that  ovulation is regulated by a progestational steroid and that  the regulation requires the activation of genes and the  synthesis of new protein.  When a gene is activated in a  cell, a specific message (called messenger RNA; mRNA) is  created that acts as a template for protein synthesis.  In  the present study, the mRNAs that are stimulated by the  progestational steroid during ovulation will be isolated  using molecular biological techniques and their biochemical  sequences determined.  These sequences will be compared to  those of known proteins that are maintained in the national  GenBank database.  Through these comparisons an initial idea  of what the steroid is specifically stimulating at the time  of ovulation can be obtained.  ***",
