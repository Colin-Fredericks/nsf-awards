The workstations are  equipped with object oriented software development tools for  efficient construction of substantial signal processing  applications. This equipment is used to provide an extensive  laboratory experience as part of a senior level course in  non-stationary signal processing that focuses on speech signals.   At the core of the proposed course is a semester-long software  development project with small interdisciplinary design teams  consisting of engineering students, voice science students and  faculty from outside the engineering department. Each team  identifies needs of the speech scientist that can be met through a  software solution, and then designs, implements and tests an  application program to meet these needs. Software development takes  advantage of the efficient techniques of object oriented  programming for modularity, thereby allowing future work to easily  build on past accomplishments and facilitating dissemination of the  results. The student-designed signal processing objects are  collected in a library for use in future projects and available to  other schools through the INTERNET.",
