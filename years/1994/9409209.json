Gornet's research focuses on the question \"What geometric  information is contained in the spectrum of a manifold?\"  In  particular, she has developed a new construction for producing  pairs of isospectral Riemannian nilmanifolds. This construction  has produced new pairs of isospectral manifolds exhibiting many  properties not previously found. Such examples are the only way  to discover properties not determined by the spectrum.  Geometric properties Gornet is currently studying include the  length spectrum (the collection of lengths of closed geodesics)  and the marked length spectrum (which also includes information  on the free homotopy classes of the closed geodesics.) Techniques  used in Gornet's research come from Riemannian geometry,  representation theory, and Lie groups. Gornet proposes to use the  Research Planning Grant to explore new techniques in  representation theory and in the study of closed geodesics to  supplement her current background in spectral and Riemannian  geometry.  ***",
