 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403708  Gaffney       Gaffney studies the local geometry of analytic sets and  mappings.  The goal in this area is to find numbers with a  geometric content which will describe the geometry of the object  under study.  A first step is to find numbers of this type whose  constancy in a family of objects implies that the geometry of the  family is constant in some well-defined way.  Specifically,  Gaffney looks for invariants whose constancy is necessary and  sufficient for the Whitney equisingularity of the family of sets  or maps being considered.  This condition implies that the  embedded topology of the family is constant.  For sets, Gaffney  proposes to use invariants associated with the integral closure  of a module of non-finite colength to control the Whitney  equisingularity of the family.  These invariants will play the  role that the multiplicity does for ideals and modules of finite  colength.  Gaffney will also look for similar invariants coming  from the tangent space to the A orbit of a map-germ to describe  the equisingularity of a family of mappings.       Families of sets and families of mappings (which are just  the possible relationships between sets) occur in many different  situations.  Any shape in space which changes with time can be  thought of as a family of sets--one shape for each instant of  time.  Generally speaking, the shapes will seem essentially the  same,  except for exceptional moments when drastic change seems  to occur,   after which the sets will appear to be similar again.   Given the equations that describe a shape, this project will look  for numbers which can be calculated from these equations which  will tell us when the exceptional moments are.  Some possible  applications are to robot navigation, and to the wealth of  physical problems which can be studied by looking at equilibrium  points of families of differential equations.  (In the case of  robotics, the shape consists of the set of inaccessible points to  a robot or one of its members; when the  nature of this shape  changes, the path to a goal may change.)  ***",
