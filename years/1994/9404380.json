 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404380  Chen/Zhou        This research will focus on (1) the formulation of boundary integral equations  and development of boundary element schemes and software for dynamic shell  equations; (2) the analysis of vibration eigenfrequencies and damping rates of  dynamic shell equations; (3) the study of qualitative stability properties of shells  when damping is present; (4) structural shape control and optimization, for several  thin or shallow circular cylindrical, conical, and spherical shell models.        Shells are known to have advantageous structural properties.  Under suitable  design, even very thin shells can support large loads.  They are  therefore widely  used in aircraft and ship structures where light weight is  essential.  In other cases,  such as pressure-vessels, roofs and domes, the combined strength and enclosing  properties of shells are utilized.  Mathematically, shells are described by coupled  systems of partial differential equations of higher order.  This research is directed  towards (1) computing the deformation and stress distribution of shells in   aerospace, civil and maritime structures (in particular, with efficiency greatly  surpassing the traditional finite element method); (2) providing feedback designs of  control systems that can stabilize dynamic shell motion; (3) analyzing and  simulating ``smart structure control'' of shells such as the automatic tuning of the  radius of curvature of a spherical shell in a deformable mirror.",
