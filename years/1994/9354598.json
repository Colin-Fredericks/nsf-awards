 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354598  Popyack  We are developing a new approach for teaching 'introduction to  computing' courses, tailored to the needs of students in different  curricula. This approach is based on the following precepts:  There  is a strong need for students in all curricula to understand the  concepts of programming a computer, particularly in the sciences  and engineering fields.  It may no longer be necessary for  students in many majors to know how to write programs in  traditional block-structured languages (such as Pascal).  There is  a wealth of software in wide use today which allows the user to  write programs in specialized built-in 'macro languages'.  Teaching  programming concepts through the use of powerful, user-friendly  software with programmable features allows the user to write  programs immediately which produce non-trivial results. This  provides stronger motivation to learn programming than traditional  approaches.  Moreover, the essential concepts of computer  programming, (such as variables, branching, iteration, etc.) can be  readily illustrated and implemented using the sophisticated  features of a variety of commonly available software packages, such  as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases. The main intention  of our approach is to teach programming concepts and techniques,  not simply how to use software. Students are exposed to the kinds  of functionality common to all languages, thus facilitating the  learning of a general purpose language or new, innovative software  they will need for pursuing both their education and their careers  in science, engineering, or teaching.  ***y",
