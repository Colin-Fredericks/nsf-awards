 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of systems have now been developed that obviate the need for the use of animals in the scientific investigation of biological processes. This research seeks to develop a new model system for the study of neuronal differentiation in cell culture.  When maintained under cell culture conditions, a small fraction of embryonal stem (ES) cells differentiate into neurons.  The studies that will be performed will investigate methods to maximize the percentage of ES cells that choose the neuronal development pathway.  Success in this endeavor will provide a number of significant advantages for future neurobiological research.  As an example, the effects of the modification of a specific gene on neuron development can be studied in culture, without the necessity of generating animals that carry the modified gene.  Further, since the developmental process under study can be continually monitored, the entire process is subject to investigation.  Development of this technological advance has the potential, therefore, to be of fundamental importance in understanding the processes involved in the development of the nervous system.",
