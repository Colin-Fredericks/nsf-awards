This information is not available, for the  most part, for adsorption of reactive molecular species on well  characterized solid surfaces.  This research project, supported  in the Analytical and Suface Chemistry Program, is designed to  obtain this sort of information for a number of catalytically  important systems.  This information will be obtained by  careful microcalorimetry measurements on well characterized  thin metal and metal oxide single crystal specimens under ultra  high vacuum conditions.  The work will emphasize systems which  can not be studied by more traditional methods such as thermal  desorption spectroscopy.  Detailed information about adsorption  bond strengths, and the effect of surface structure and  composition on these thermodynamic properties will be obtained.  %%%  A basic understanding of the strength of bonding between an  adsorbed molecule and a catalytic surface is needed in order to  develop and probe reaction mechanisms for these technologically  important processes.  This research project is designed to  develop and apply a technique for the direct measurement of  this adsorption strength on well characterized catalytic  surfaces.  The thermodynamic information obtained will be very  useful for evaluating possible surface reaction mechanisms and  developing a basic understanding of catalytically important  processes.  ***",
