 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408145  Durand    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stephen Durand will  collect pilot data to assess the feasibility of a technique to  determine the geographical source for timbers used to construct  the Great Houses in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Chaco Canyon is a  major archaeological site which was occupied between 900-1150 AD.  The amount of labor involved in the construction of large  \"apartment houses\" and ceremonial kiva lodges indicates a high  degree of political organization and the integration of large  numbers of individuals within a single social system.  Archaeologists wish to understand what led to the emergence of  the Chacoan system and have attempted to determine the geographic  extent of its sphere of influence. Dr. Durand's project will  provide important information which will assist in this process.  His very preliminary data indicate that the wood used to build  the great Chacoan structures bears the chemical imprint of the  specific region in which an individual tree grew and that  variations in chemical composition reflect the substrate of the  particular region. Therefore, through analysis of the trees, it  should be possible to determine points of origin. In this first  stage of the project, he will collect pilot data to determine how  well the chemical fingerprinting system works.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many regional archaeologists. It will shed  new light on the development of cultural complexity in the  Southwestern United States and help in the development of a tool  of potentially broad scientific utility.",
