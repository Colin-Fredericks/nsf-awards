The primary goal  of this initiative is to create a unique SPM undergraduate  laboratory course using affordable, state-of-the-art  instrumentation for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic  force microscopy (AFM).  This ILI-LLD project is a significant  first step in bringing this very important new technique to the  undergraduate curriculum by chemists who are doing cutting edge  research in the area. The course is designed to serve as a magnet  to bring together students from different disciplines and ethnic  backgrounds and to help prepare them for the imminent revolution in  nano-science engineering and technology. The course will  incorporate the following key features: (i) Fundamental Principles  to provide students with a working knowledge of STM and AFM, (ii)  Core Laboratory Experiments to illustrate important applications of  STM and AFM, (iii) Laboratory Projects to give students the  opportunity to perform short-term research investigations of their  choice, and (iv) Cooperative Learning Activities to allow students  to learn from each other. The primary products of this project will  be a model multidisciplinary laboratory as well as a laboratory  manual documenting all of the tested and refined experiments. The  laboratory experiments will also be available as separate units to  maximize the impact on existing laboratory courses in the  undergraduate science and engineering curriculum. This project will  involve expert faculty from the Departments of  Chemistry/Biochemistry, Physics/Astronomy, Geology, Biology  Chemical/Bio/Materials Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The  course will complement many of the existing undergraduate courses  and laboratories in the above disciplines, provide highly qualified  students for undergra duate research projects, and strengthen  special programs such as the federally-sponsored Interdisciplinary  Undergraduate Program in Materials Synthesis and Processing and the  Coalition to Increase Minority Degrees. The multidisciplinary SPM  laboratory course will have a positive impact on the quality of  science and engineering education at the university, local,  regional and national levels.",
