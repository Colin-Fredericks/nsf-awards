This  research project will be carried out in cooperation with Australian  colleagues who have a long-term data record on the species  composition and abundance of demersal/natant fauna in the mangrove  dominated Pumicestone Passage, Moreton Bay, which is located on the  central east coast of Australia. The project will first determine  what species of juvenile fish utilize meiofauna as a numerically  abundant diet item. Subsequently, the meiofaunal species  composition in the habitats where the fish live will be determined.  This data is essential to determine if the prey fauna in the guts  have been eaten where the fish live and, if gut contents are  consistent with the resident prey available. After these two  descriptive phases of the research are completed experiments are  planned to test meiofaunal removal rates by a dominant juvenile  fish predator and whether certain meiofauna are being selected by  bottom-feeding juvenile fish.  These experiments will be conducted  in microcosms in a recirculating sea-water system and will follow  the protocol used in similar experiments performed previously in  the PI's laboratory in South Carolina.  ***",
