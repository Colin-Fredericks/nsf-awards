 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves a systematic study of the microscopic   mechanisms of surface enhanced laser spectroscopies, including surface   enhanced Raman, hyper-Raman, second harmonic generation, and sum   frequency generation spectroscopy.  Several methods of nanostructure   preparation, combined with scanning probe microscopic characterization of   these structured surfaces, will be used to probe the electromagnetic and   chemical mechanisms of surface enhanced laser spectroscopies.  This work,   supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will directly   test present models of the surface enhancement mechanism by fashioning   surfaces which match the structures modeled in leading theoretical   descriptions of the effect.  Contributions to the understanding of the   surface enhanced spectroscopy, as well as to the development and   characterization of nanostructured surfaces should result from this work.    Impact well beyond the use of this method for studies of roughened   surfaces is expected.    Further development of the analytical methods of surface enhanced laser   spectroscopy relies on the development of a quantitative, predictive   explanation of the enhancement process.  This research program will   develop the theoretical underpinning for this technique by a careful set   of experiments which rationally prepare surface structures which can be   accurately theoretically modeled.  The insights gained from the   comparison of measurements on modelable surfaces should allow development   of a quantitative theory.  It is expected that useful methods for the   fabrication of materials with nanostructured surfaces will also result.",
