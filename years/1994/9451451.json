The purpose of this equipment  acquisition is to expose a large number of students, from freshman  through senior levels, to NMR instrumentation and the capabilities  of the instrumental technique. The proposed program will expose  students in a stepwise fashion to increasingly more complex NMR  concepts and techniques over four academic years. In the freshman  laboratory course, students (400 annually) will be introduced to  the qualitative and quantitative application of NMR spectroscopy.  During the sophomore level organic laboratory course, students  (approximately 175 annually) will employ proton NMR spectroscopy  for routine structural analysis. The junior level advanced organic  laboratory course will introduce students ( approximately 20  annually) to the use of carbon- 13, 2-dimensional and more advanced  NMR techniques. Finally, the senior level inorganic laboratory  course will introduce students to more advanced NMR theory and NMR  spectra of quadrupolar nuclei, as well as build upon the students'  previous experience with 2-dimensional NMR techniques. In short,  the Varian UNlTYplus spectrometer, when connected to the Macintosh  computers and equipped with an automated sample changer, will serve  as the instrumental cornerstone for a program designed to  systematically educate science and engineering students in the  concepts and applications of NMR spectroscopy.",
