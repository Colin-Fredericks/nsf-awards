 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354676  Wankat     Weak academic advising programs in the engineering education  system contribute to considerable dissatisfaction among  successful students and to the decision of other students to  leave engineering.  This research will develop a proactive  engineering academic advising system which will provide better  quality academic advising to all students, particularly those  who need it the most.  The academic information computer  program will use hypermedia to provide both career and specific  academic advising information at both engineering colleges and  remote sites such as community colleges.  The advisor contact  computer program will keep track of all of the student's  significant contacts with advisors and professors, and will  guide the efficient use of scarce advising resources so that  the students who most need help will receive it.  The new  advising system will use people to provide the personal contact  which many students now miss in engineering education.   Formative and summative evaluations will also be done of the  different parts of the project.  Transferability of the entire  system will be tested at Purdue North Central and at Clemson  University.  Workshops and papers will be presented to  encourage adoption of aspects of this advising system at other  universities.  The deliverables from this project are: 1.  development of a proactive advising procedure and a computer  program to keep track of student contacts, and 2. development  of an engineering-specific, academic advising computer program.  ***",
