 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make possible interactive, process-oriented  laboratory instruction throughout the biology curriculum.  Experiments will emphasize observation, measurement, organization  and analysis of data, and hypothesis formulation and testing.  Students will employ electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, and  centrifugation to investigate topics in biotechnology and molecular  biology, genetics, and environmental biology. Students will use  networked Macintosh workstations to and computer-based  instrumentation to investigate a variety of physiological  conditions, as well as to process and graph data. The new  laboratory environment will foster scientific inquiry and will help  students develop critical thinking skills.  Students also will use  computer-based post laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and  laboratory activities. As well, computer augmented instruction will  afford a flexibility to better meet the needs of our single and  working parents. Faculty will use the Macintosh server as a  workstation to develop simulations supporting laboratory materials.  Published reports and presentations on the results of this project  will stimulate other community colleges to lab investigations  modeled on those from this project.",
