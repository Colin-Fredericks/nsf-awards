 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414334 Kuech  Research will be carried out to obtain a  fundamental understanding of the influence of impurities on the  properties, and atomic level structure of metallo-organic vapor  phase epitaxy(MOVPE) grown interfaces.   The role of impurities on  the detailed structure and properties of interfaces has been  largely unexplored in the MOVPE technique, despite the importance  of this area to the development of nanostructure and  heterostructure devices, due to the lack of combined experimental  studies and the related modeling of the observed interactions.   Through a tightly coupled experimental and modeling effort, the  interplay between the interface or surface structure and impurity  incorporation and behavior will be identified in this research  project.  We will use a comprehensive approach which includes  changes in the chemical nature of the impurity containing precursor  as well as the surface structure.  These experimental studies will  be complemented and supported by modeling efforts of the chemistry  and structure of the developing growth front.  Several  complementary modeling techniques will be used including realistic  continuum descriptions of fluid flow, heat and mass transfer  combined with detailed gas phase and surface chemical kinetic  mechanisms and phenomenological models of impurity modified MOVPE  growth.  %%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a  fundamental understanding of the epitaxial growth, processing, and  properties of compound semiconductor materials so that they can be  fully exploited in the realization of a variety of advanced  electronic and photonic devices.   The findings of these studies  will lead to a better understanding of the basic interface and  growth processes relevant to a range of growth and processing  techniques for electronic/photonic materials.  An important feature  of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate  students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of  materials and processing  research.  This research will contribute  to improving the general perform ance of advanced devices and  integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and  tele communica tions.  ***",
