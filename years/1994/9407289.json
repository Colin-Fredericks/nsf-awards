Zink, Chemistry Department, University of California - Los Angeles, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the electronic excited states of metal-containing molecules. Excited state geometries will be determined from highly resolved vibronic structure in emission and excitation spectra of molecules in the cold collision-free conditions of a supersonic free expansion jet and by excited state pump-probe Raman spectroscopy. Resonance Raman excitation profiles and low temperature single crystal polarized electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy will then be used to determine distortions in the excited state. The goal of these studies is a unified understanding of excited potential surfaces which will lead to an understanding of the geometries, reactivities, electronic structure and vibronic interactions which occur as metal complexes are in their excited states.     Before normally stable molecules will undergo chemical reactions, they must be \"excited\" so that they become less stable and more reactive. This project aims at determining what changes metal containing compounds undergo as they are \"excited\" by the addition of energy. This is important because the \"excited state\" of a molecule must be understood in order to predict its chemical behavior. This investigation will concentrate on some molecules which are important to establishing a general understanding of the behavior of \"excited states\" and some which have important reactions which occur in the gas phase, such as those used as precursors for electronic materials.",
