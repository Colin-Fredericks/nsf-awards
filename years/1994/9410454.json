This program is  unique in its focus on the lateral growth instabilities which occur  during initial precipitate growth perpendicular to the direction of  interdiffusion.  A quantitative hypothesis has been developed which  predicts how the addition of a third element affects morphological  development during the lateral growth of interfacial reaction  products.  The prediction of the ternary effect is a function of  the slope of the solvus with composition in an isothermal section  of the ternary phase diagram and the degree of resistance to  interdiffusion at the interface between the dissimilar materials.   A critical experimental test of this hypothesis is to be carried  out by studying precipitate morphology as the composition and  interface characteristics are varied in a systematic manner.  %%%  The results of this grant could impact important processes in  technology, such as diffusion bonding of different materials and/or  reactions of substrates with thin metal films.  ***",
