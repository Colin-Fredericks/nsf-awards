 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401222  Scherson    This U.S.-Poland Joint Collaborative Research grant to study  \"Efficient System Support for Data-Parallel MIMD\" is between Dr.  Isaac D. Scherson of the Department of Information and Computer  Science, University of California Irvine, and Dr. Piotr  Chrzastowski-Wachtel of the Informatics Institute, Warsaw  University.  A novel massively parallel architecture, dubbed P3,  led to the identification of a number of important open problems  related to the feasibility, applicability and performance of very  large SIMD systems.  However, because of the strong recent trend  among commercial machines towards the SPMD-style of programming  on MIMD machines, the researchers are relaxing their previous  SIMD assumptions and applying their knowledge to SPMD system  support issues.  Specifically, their goal is to model the SPMD  paradigm and reduce or even eliminate barrier synchronization to  minimize wasteful processor idling.  To this end, the American  researchers will collaborate with the Polish researchers, who  have performed extensive work on algebras and models of  concurrency.  Additionally, the researchers hope this  international exchange will shed new light on their continuing  research (MIP-9106949, MIP-9205737) on scientific numerical  techniques, and the development of very fast and efficient  interconnective networks.      This proposed research in information and computer science and  engineering fulfills the program objectives of advancing science  by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.    ***",
