 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program, Dr. Harry B. Gray and Dr. Jay R. Winkler of the   California Institute of Technology will explore metal-ligand   electron-transfer (ET) processes under conditions where semiclassical ET   theory should break down. To  determine the role of tunneling, a series   of Ir(I) complexes in which the ET rates at high driving forces are   substantially slower than theoretically predicted will be studied. To aid   in the theoretical interpretation of the ET rates, nuclear reoganization   parameters, temperature, and isotope effects on ET rates will be   determined. A systematic investigations of bimolecular ET reactions of   Ir(I) dimers will show whether electronic excited products can reduce the   effective ET reaction driving force. Photoinduced ET reactions in the   region where ET is slower than predicted tend to be faster than   recombination processes at comparable driving forces. Based on this fact,   coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes with weakly coupled electron   acceptors will be investigated to determine whether long-lived   charge-transfer states can be prepared by direct light absorption.    Some of the most important processes which occur in chemical and   biological systems involve the transfer of electrons and the rate of such   transfers is often critical to the operation of the process. A   semi-empicical theoretical model has been developed to account for these   rates. In this study specially designed iridium complexes will be used to   probe the factors which this theory uses to describe the rate of electron   transfer. Such studies are important both to the basic understanding of   electron transfer and to the development of new methods of, for example,   solar energy conversion.",
