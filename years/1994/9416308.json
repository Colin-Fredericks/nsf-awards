Harmonizing the  three  themes  in  a  multinational  context  is an even more daunting proposition,  in  view  of  differences in national political, economic and legal systems, for example.  Yet  the  coherent, mutually-beneficial development of the  North  American  region  envisioned by the NAFTA agreement will depend critically upon  such  harmonization.   This  project, which is being  supported  jointly  by  the  National  Science  Foundation, the Canadian Social Science  and  Humanities  Research  Council (SSHRC), and the Mexican National Science and  Technology  Council (CONACyT), will bring together for 10 days in August 1994, scholars  and policy makers from the United States, Canada, and Mexico for a critical  examination  of  the issues that need to be addressed in understanding  and  harmonizing   the   relationships  among  the   problems   of   innovation,  competitiveness,  and sustainability in a North American regional  context.  The  principal  objective will be to develop a long-term agenda  that  will  provide  scholars  throughout North America with guidance  toward  further,  detailed   exploration   of   these  three  critical   themes   and   their  relationships.   An immediate outcome will be a network  of  scholars  with  interest  and expertise in various aspects of the problem, and  a  plan  to  expand  and sustain that network.  A published proceedings will also result  from  the institute.  Planning and follow-up for the project are under  the  direction  of   a  trinational  steering  group  chaired  by  the  Canadian  Principal  Investigator,  with  U.S.  and  Mexican  representatives   being  distinguished  social  scientists  nominated,  respectively,  by  NSF   and   CONACyT.    ***",
