The aim of the project is to  make mathematics teachers (grades 7-12) knowledgeable about, and  skillful in, the uses of modern assessment practices, and to  integrate such practices successfully into their teaching.  To  these ends, 40 teachers from 6 ethnically diverse school districts  will be selected to participate in a 3-year professional  development program consisting of two sequential academic year  institutes and summer workshops.  Communication between  participants and staff will be facilitated by a state-wide fiber  optic communication network.  An outreach program will begin in  Summer 2, when the original 40 participants will begin to help  project staff run institutes for some 120 teachers around the  State, again relying heavily on telecommunications.  By Year 3, it  is expected that some 200 teachers around the State will be  implementing modern assessment practices in their classrooms.  By  way of dissemination, the project will organize working groups of  mathematics educators from around the State to produce both a  handbook and a television course on modern assessment in  mathematics.  From its beginning, the project will be represented  by both participants and staff on the State's new testing  committee.",
