 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354373  Tewksbury  An introductory course on the geology of Africa is being developed.   The goals of this new course are 1) to attract black students to  take geology and to encourage them to major in geology, 2) to  provide all students in the course with a perspective on how the  geologic evolution of a region has a fundamental influence on  historical, cultural, economic, and social issues, and 3) to  provide both non-science students and prospective geology majors  with a rigorous, hands-on science course in which students really  \"do geology\".  This new course, \"The Geology and Development of  Modern Africa\", will be part of both a major in geology and a major  in Africana Studies.  Students who take this course will not simply learn facts about the  geology of Africa.  The course will be designed as a lab course to give  prospective geology majors and non-science majors alike a rigorous,  hands-on experience in science and an opportunity to think creatively  about the underlying geologic context for events and trends in the  history and development of modem Africa.  The course will be designed to  have a maximum enrollment of 50.  A group of several students, both black and white, will participate  during the summer of 1994 in designing the course, which will be offered  for the first time during fall semester 1994.  Students who helped  develop the course will serve as teaching assistants and tutors during  the first year that the course is taught, and one of the goals of the  course will be to develop a nucleus of black students who are  well-trained and interested in geology.  The course will be evaluated and  revised during spring and summer 1995 and offered again in the fall of  1995.",
