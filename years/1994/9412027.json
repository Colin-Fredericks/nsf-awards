 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318671  Dehmelt       This proposal, \"Single Atomic Particle at Rest in Free  Space 4 (SEPARIS 4)\", is for the continuation of efforts to  approach the fundamental limits of resolution and accuracy  in optical spectroscopy for an individual atomic ion  elastically bound in a purely electric rf trap.  The aim is  an accuracy of; one part in 1018.  The best \"accuracy\" and  1000-day stability realized in the past is 1013 or 105 less.  The new \"accuracy\" would mean that independent frequency  measurements on the same atomic line by two different groups  in the same laboratory agree to better than 1018 and long  term (108 sec or 1000 days) stability is as good.  This  would have numerous implications for measurements in  fundamental physics and cosmology.  The precision of current  atomic clocks is already being strained by the  extraordinarily high timing stability of the millisecond  pulsars and the needs of space missions.  The mass loss of  other pulsars due to gravitational radiation could not have  been observed without precise atomic clocks.  Closer to home  the Global Positioning System relies crucially on precise  atomic clocks.  There seems to be an unlimited field of new  applications in metrology as more and more measuring tasks  are reduced to precise frequency measurement.",
