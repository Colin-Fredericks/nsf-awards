 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developments in genetics since World War II are leading us to  revise our understanding of the processes of scientific change.   These developments include the \"molecularization\" of genetics;  i.e., the apparent reformulation of classical genetics in terms of  DNA and the subsequent advances in our explanatory and  investigative practices.  Dr. Waters is examining the new kind of  changes taking place in genetics, its underlying strategy, and how  this new strategy works  to bring about progressive developments in  explanatory and investigative practices in science.    The relationship between classical Mendelian genetics and molecular  biology is viewed by philosophers of science as a paradigm of non-  reduction, i.e. , as an example of scientific progress where the  molecular-level account answers new questions, but does not  reformulate the classical theory or provide better answers to the  previously answered questions.  The genetics example plays a  prominent role in debates about the prospects of reduction in other  sciences, the nature of explanation, and the metaphysical  organization of the world.  The appearance of the Mendelian example  alongside the usual ones in physics marks a turning point.   Philosophers now look to biology for insights into the nature of  scientific knowledge.  Dr. Waters, however, believes these current  views are mistaken and have prevented a proper understanding of the  changes that have taken place in genetics.    In this study, Dr. Waters is examining in parallel the central  concepts, explanatory models and investigative practices of both  classical genetics and molecular biology.  He hopes to show how  molecular biology has deepened the understanding of heredity first  provided by classical genetics and then how theoretical connections  between classical genetics and molecular biology have led to a  fruitful interplay between investigative practices of genetics,  molecular biology, and biochemistry.  From this, he draws a new  model of antireductionism fo r all of the Science and Technology  Studies disciplines.",
