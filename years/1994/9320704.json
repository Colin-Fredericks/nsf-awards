The project has five  related aims: to add city permits and media records of  demonstrations from 1973 to the existing data set; to code the  content of all media traces for analyses of description bias; to  expand the analysis of media bias by developing multiple methods  for comparing media reports with systematic observations; to  assess implications of the findings for improving attempts to  limit researcher bias; and to explore the possibilities of  studying the national and international diffusion of the National  Park Service permit system.  %%%       This research contributes to political sociology and to the  development of scientific methodology for studying public  demonstrations and their handling by the mass media.  It  therefore will greatly strengthen social-scientific research on  important aspects of democracy that lie outside the system of  parties and elections.  Results will be of direct value for  political leaders who need to understand the meaning of public  demonstrations and for journalists who need to upgrade the  accuracy of their reporting.    ***",
