 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412944  Jayasumana  A novel WDM local-area network will be constructed, that greatly eases practical constraints related to the precision and stability of the channel wavelengths.  It is anticipate that the effort will result in the demonstration of:     a scalable, robust, fiber-optic WDM architecture with an  innovative medium access scheme relying on dynamic  wavelength selection by the individual nodes, and     a novel integrated WDM receiver and companion  multiwavelength laser sources.    In the robust WDM network proposed here any two nodes requiring a link will select a currently unused portion of the wavelength spectrum.  The receiver will then dynamically lock onto the precise wavelength used rather than tuning to a preassigned fixed wavelength channel.  The proposed receiver, using integrated high-speed winner-take-all electronic circuitry, can find an lock onto the optical signal, 10s of nanometers wide, in times on the order of intelligent, adaptive receivers able to handle changing and distorted dens WDM channels.  Precise wavelength trimming, either in the device fabrication or during operation is not required for either transmitters or receivers.  However, the concept is easier to implement for WDM source arrays with stable wavelength increments. The proposed endeavor combines expertise in laser sources, intelligent receivers, fiber optic system implantation, architecture and protocols to establish a well-integrated and cohesive research program.  This program aligns perfectly NSF HPCC effort.  The NSF component of HPCC includes \"..design and development of heterogeneous and distributed scalable parallel computing systems, ... early prototyping of hardware and software systems, ... and optical communications systems and devices\".  This precisely the thrust of the research program proposed here.      ***",
