One major direction of  the work concerns removable singularities for the boundary values  of holomorphic functions, that is, when can a function be  extended to a point and a neighborhood as an holomorphic  function?  These points are called removable singularities.  A  related direction of the work focuses on the study of removable  sets for holomorphic functions.  These are sets where the  natural boundary values of an holomorphic function agree with  those of a continuous function.  Work will also be done on  domains which are not necessarily bounded by smooth manifolds, an  area of several complex variables which has not received much  attention to date.  Finally, work will continue on the study of  Cauchy-Riemann functions in terms of one-dimensional slices of  their underlying domains.       Several complex variables arose at the beginning of  the century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of  one complex variable.  It became clear early on that the  theory differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying  geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory  had far more affinity with partial differential operators of  first order.  It thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep  characteristics of differential geometry and differential  equations.  Many of the fundamental structures were defined in  the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on  understanding these basic mathematical forms.  ***",
