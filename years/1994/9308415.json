The long-term goal of this research is to  develop and implement new strategies for building complete models  of three-dimensional objects from video sequences.  Efficient 3D  model-building capabilities are fundamental for mobile robot vision  tasks such as learning new shapes, manipulating intricate objects,  navigating around obstacles, and recognizing a known shape.  A  central focus of this project is the analysis of the problem of  recovering global three-dimensional shape information from an image  sequence under minimal viewing conditions using image curves that  are formed from both smooth and non-smooth components of three-  dimensional shapes. The viewing situations include two main  scenarios: active feedback strategies where information in the  image sequence is used to control the camera system; and  uncalibrated camera rigs where camera parameters are unknown. This  work is based upon an analysis of the behavior of projected curves  in image sequences and their relationship to three-dimensional  shape.  This research will provide a deeper theoretical and  empirical understanding that will lead to the development of  efficient, implemented and tested strategies for building detailed  models of three-dimensional objects under minimal viewing  conditions.",
