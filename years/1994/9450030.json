The project's structure will support  the development of materials and resources to deliver activities and career information on science  and technology to intermediate and high school girls, and will lay the foundation for long-term  continuation of these efforts.  Strategies for implementation include the expansion and  maintenance of a comprehensive database of science practitioners, students, parents, and  educators.  The Project will act as a central reference center offering resources to assist local  communities in encouraging young women to study science and mathematics.  A cadre of  advocates will disseminate career information, organize hands-on experiences, promote  mentorships, facilitate tutoring, and showcase practitioners in science and technical fields.  ***",
