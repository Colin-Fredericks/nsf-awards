Teams of political  scientists and sociologists have conducted national sample  surveys of the mass publics of newly democratizing countries in  Est Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Latin America.  From  these surveys, much is known about levels, trends, and sources of  mass support for democracy.  From the surveys, however, there is  little known about the dynamics of mass support for  democratization.    Which segments of the mass citizenry have continued supporting  democratization?  Which segments have discontinued their support  of it?  What has motivated some to modify their democratic  support?  Undoubtedly these questions are crucial to formulating  an appropriate strategy for consolidating nascent democratic  rule.  Yet these questions have not been addressed adequately in  the large body of literature which has recently accumulated on  the mass culture of democratization.    This research investigation seeks to address these questions of  strategic significance from the perspective of life quality which  ordinary citizens experience and envision for themselves and  their country.  Specifically, the study hypothesizes that  individual citizens react to democratization in response to their  perceptions of how it has affected the quality of their life in  the past and their expectations of how it would affect the  quality of their life in the future.  This hypothesis will be  tested with a new set of mass survey data to be collected from  Korea, a country which has made considerable progress in  establishing a democratic political culture over the past five  years.",
