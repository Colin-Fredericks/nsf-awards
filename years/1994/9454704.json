 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454704  Feldman    Our understanding of excellence in science learning has changed  dramatically in the past decades.  We now know that the concepts,  skills, and excitement of science are most effectively learned  through students' direct experience in real science activities-  collaborating to plan an experiment, collecting data, organizing  and representing the data, and interpreting the data.  Students  learn complex problem-solving skills by working with peers and  mentors to plan and carry out an investigation of a real science  problem.  Rather than textbooks and lab exercises, this approach  emphasizes authentic contexts for learning, that is, doing science.    To implement this approach, students need access to resources  outside their classroom-access to data beyond what they can collect  themselves, and access to scientists or other experts as they try  to make sense of their data.  Teachers need access to experts,  other teachers, and additional resources as they grapple with a new  way of teaching science.  The use of computers connected through  wide-area networks provides an effective way to access these  resources for teachers and students, and enables students and  teachers to work closely with others who are geographically remote.    TERC proposes to create a paradigm for education, which we call  telecollaboration, that will build on the model of Network Science  created in Alice/Collaborative Inquiry Testbed.  Telecollaboration  reflects a major change in our use of computers and  telecommunications in education, and enables teachers and students  to engage actively in high quality teaching and learning.  We will  create a Testbed through which we'll identify and encourage a range  of telecollaborative projects that will meet the needs of  educators,  support educational reform, and create new, scalable classes of  network collaboration.  While the paradigm we are developing is  applicable across the curriculum, the Testbed will focus on  telecollaboratives with an emphasis  on science and mathematics.",
