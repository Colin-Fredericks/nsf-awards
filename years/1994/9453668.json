 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453668  Woolery  The Dallas Urban Systemic Initiative (DUSI) has as its core  a vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and science  fundamentals which will permit all students to participate  fully in a technological society and enable a significantly  greater number of Dallas students to pursue careers in  mathematics, science, engineering, and technology.  The DUSI  has three major components: (1) the development of a new  management structure for the Dallas Independent School  District (DISD) based on the principles of Total Quality  Management; (2) the development and implementation of a  theme-based, K-12 science, mathematics and technology (SMT)  curriculum and; (3) an effective use of technology to  advance the teaching of the SMT curriculum.  The management  structure will be developed jointly by the DISD and experts  provided by the District's community partners.  The new  curriculum will be developed by teams of master teachers,  educators and science and mathematics professionals from the  community and will include the use of process oriented,  student centered pedagogy.  The reforms brought about by  DUSI will be supported by continuous professional  development for all teachers and by the extensive use of  educational technology in all classrooms.  The District will  implement policy changes and redirect its resources to  further support the plan.  Resources have already been, and  will continue to be, provided by the District's academic and  corporate partners.",
