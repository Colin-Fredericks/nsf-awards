 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318537  Singh  This theoretical and computationally-intensive research will use  series expansion methods to investigate a variety of problems of  current interest in condensed matter physics.  The principal  investigator has developed the basic methodology to generate series  expansions for quantum magnets, for models of strongly correlated  Fermi systems, and for disordered systems such as spin glasses.   For these systems, series expansions have been obtained for uniform  thermodynamic quantities, for static response functions, for wave-  vector dependent equal-time spin and charge correlation functions  and for frequency moments of dynamical correlation functions.  A  major focus will be to understand the normal state properties of  high temperature superconducting cuprates.  Results will be  compared to experiments on these materials such as nuclear magnetic  resonance, neutron and light scattering, photoemission, and  transport phenomena.  The Kondo lattice and Hubbard models on non-  bipartite lattices will be studied to gain insight into the  electron-correlation driven metal-insulator transition.  Other  systems to be studied include critical phenomena in random quantum  systems, ordering in frustrated spin models and conformal  invariance in two-dimensional non-integrable statistical models.  %%%  This renewal grant will use series expansion techniques, which were  originally developed for the study of phase transitions, and apply  them to problems involving strongly correlated materials.  The  approach taken by the principal investigator is somewhat unique and  complements other computational techniques used to study these  problems.  The problems to be studied include the high temperature  superconductors, magnetic materials and the metal-insulator  transition.  ***",
