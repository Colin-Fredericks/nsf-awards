 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311436  Gower, S.  The Kemp Natural Resources Station, a research center operated by  the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of Agricultural and  Life Sciences, is located in north-central Wisconsin.  The  station has several unique characteristics: (1) It is located  near some of the few remaining large tracts of old growth forests  int he easter United States, (2) It is located in a region that  contains diverse landforms that are juxtaposed in complex  patterns, (3) The proximal location of Keep to Trout Lake Station  offer an excellent opportunity to examine interactions between  terrestrial and research and undergraduate/graduate training  scale.  Keep has a long history as a center for community  ecology, wildlife ecology, plant pathology and entomology.   Current research programs include biological and physical  sciences such as terrestrial ecosystem ecology, ecophysiology,  restoration, and landscape ecology; and involve scientists from  UW-Madison and other UW campuses, USFS, USGS, and several  American and Canadian universities.  Despite recent and ongoing  improvements to both physical structure and research capabilities  at Keep Station, the laboratory facilities are not adequate to  meet current and future demands.  This project will support the  remodeling and expansion of the existing research laboratory and  the purchase an image analysis system.  The modernization of the  laboratory will re-establish Keep Natural Resources Station as a  center for terrestrial research and promote inter-disciplinary  research on terrestrial-aquatic interaction with scientists at  Trout Lake Station -- a center for aquatic research.  ***",
