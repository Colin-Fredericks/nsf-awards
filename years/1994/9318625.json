This research project,  supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is  designed to identify intermediates and reaction pathways for  reactions relevant to heterogeneous catalysis.  Reaction  intermediates will be generated and characterized on copper and  gold surfaces at low temperature by the decomposition of  molecular precursors and by the reaction of atomic hydrogen  with unsaturated molecular adsorbates.  This work will  concentrate on allyl, formyl and vinyl species as intermediates  in catalytic cracking and partial oxidation catalysis.  The  second part of this project will address the question of  activated adsorption of halocarbon molecules on these same  transition metal surfaces.  Vibrational spectroscopy and near  edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy will be the  primary tools used for these model studies.  %%%  The design of efficient and non-polluting catalytic chemical  processes relies on a knowledge of the mechanisms of the  transition metal catalyzed surface reaction.  One approach to  obtaining this mechanistic information is to establish the  chemical identity and reactivity of possible reaction  intermediates on the surface.  This research project addresses  this aspect of catalytic chemistry by preparing possible  reaction intermediates, characterizing them on the surface, and  exploring their chemistry.  The results of this work will help  to develop an understanding of important catalytic processes.  ***",
