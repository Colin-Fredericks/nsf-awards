Specifically, how does mediation provide for  negotiation about proposed solutions in a way that facilitates  dispute resolution rather than continued disagreement?  Previous  research has shown that agreement in mediation is more likely if  participants engage in the creative generation of ideas for  potential solutions.  Negotiation procedures which include such  activities are more likely to result in \"win-win\" solutions--  those that benefit both disputants.  However, previous research  also suggests that these benefits result only if the participants  are not committed to particular solutions.  Additional data are  needed to determine if there is a critical difference between how  mediators and disputants propose and/or interpret proposed  solutions: as possibilities or as requirements for resolution.    Approximately 30 mediation hearings at a community mediation  program will be observed and video-taped.  Transcripts of each  hearing and detailed observation records will be produced by  graduate student research assistants.  These data will be coded  for analysis by the principal investigator, using theoretically  defined categories of disputing behavior.  On the basis of the  coded data, the principal investigator will compare the  interactional interpretations of mediators and disputants as they  propose and work toward resolutions.  ***",
