 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321872  Phillips  The overall objective of the project is the successful use of detectors for x ray crystallography. This will be accomplished by (a) the development of a modular CCD based x ray detector designed to collect data from protein crystals at wiggler beam lines at the National Synchrotron Light Source, and (b) research on detector technology for x ray crystallography. This project has four main components: (1 ) design and construction of the detector, (2) characterization of the performance of the detector, (3) installation of the detector and data collection at beamlines X21 and/or X25, and (4) research on detector hardware and on methods for using detectors for x ray diffraction.    This detector will be capable of recording diffraction patterns accurately at the highest fluxes available at synchrotron beam lines. The detector includes software for control and data analysis. Major features of the detector include:     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  A Modular Design: The detector is assembled from an array of 4 modular units. Each unit has an active area of ~100x100mm square. The 4 modules form an area of 200x200 mm with ~2000x2000 pixels.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  Interchangeable Modules: Modules can be quickly interchanged, allowing the rapid replacement of a defective module with a minimum loss of beam time.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  High Performance: The dynamic range is >4x104; and the DQE ~0.7.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  Optimization for Synchrotron Operation: The dead time between successive images (readout time) is 0.8 seconds. Pixel binning can be used for faster readout and/or more efficient data r educ tion and data storage.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  High Reliability and Stability: The x ray converter and CCD sensor are directly coupled using a fib eroptic taper demagnifier, eliminating the need for image intensifiers and lenses.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  Fabrication from Multi Sourced Components: The programmable, low noise electronics are capa ble of operating with many types of CCDs; the fiberoptic tapers and CCDs are available from sever al sources; a VME system and a UNlX based computer will be used for data acquisition and detec tor control.     SYMBOL 215 \\f \"Symbol\"  Software; All routines necessary for detector calibration and control will be integrated into a graphi cally oriented package. A modified version of MADNES will be used for oscillation data collection.    An extensive characterization of the detector's performance will be carried out in order to deter mine (a) how best to use the detector for data collection and (b) how to advance detector technolo gy. The characteristics of each of the components used, and of new components, will be studied in order to enhance the performance of this detector and future detectors. Studies will be carried out to determine how measurements made with this type of detector influence the molecular struc tures derived from the detector data. Mathematical methods for deconvoluting data will be developed in order to improve the accuracy of intensity measurements made with x ray crystallography detectors.    This project will complement a proposal that has been submitted to the Department of Energy, Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) by the Brookhaven National Laboratory Biology Department. The Brookhaven proposal will provide ancillary hardware to complete a working beamline data collection facility for protein crystallography at the National Laboratory National Syn chrotron Light Source. The OHER project will provide a diffractometer on which to mount the detector, a motorized lift table for alignment of the diffractomet er, control instruments for these components, data reduction computers and substantial mass storage devices, and sufficient per sonnel to operate the instrument as a facility for inexperienced outside users. The detector will be installed as the principal instrument of the facility. The facility will be built to be mobile so that it can be used with any of the wiggler or dipole beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source. A goal will be to provide projects of sufficient scientific quality that the instrument will be in use for a major fraction of the time.           ~CRD3809TMP           YMx       ~CAL165BTMP           Lrz       ~CRD105ATMP            uz  #    ~CAL0E32TMP           !xz       ~CRD081DTMP           $xz       ~CAL3B02TMP           Z~z       ~CRD351BTMP            ~z       ~DOC0333TMP           %G        ~CRD2216TMP            i~       ~MF2E00 TMP            t        ~CAL1B21TMP           N9        9321872  Phillips  The overall objective of the project is the successful use of detectors for x ray crystallography.
