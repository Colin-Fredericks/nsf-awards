 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401166  Langsetmo       This career advancement award supports mathematical research  in the field of topology.  The work continues studied in homotopy  theory involving the relationship between periodic homotopy and  higher Morava K-theories.  In particular, work will be done in  extending the construction of Dyer-Lashof operations and  calculating the Morava K-theory of infinite loop spaces.  The  calculation of the Morava K-theory of various finite loop spaces  and determining the when the cobar (base to fiber) spectral  sequence converges will also be carried out.  Further study of  the relationship between stable and unstable localization in the  case of non-connective homology theories and the relationship  between unstable periodic homotopy and periodic homology theories  via unstable localization and mapping telescopes are planned.   Finally, applications to related fields such as representation  theory will be considered.       Topology is the study of spaces in which shape and  distance become less important while qualities of connectedness  and deformability.  Homotopy, in particular, focuses on the  development of a mathematical structure which measures the extent  to which curves may or may not be deformed into one another while  constrained to stay on a particular surface or within a given  space.  ***",
