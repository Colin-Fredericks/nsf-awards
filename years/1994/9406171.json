 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite their crucial role in reproduction, little is known  about seminal fluid molecules that are necessary for the  survival and activation of sperm and for the stimulation of  reproductive processes in the mated female.  In Drosophila,  many of these critical molecules are synthesized by the  male's accessory glands.  The PI's laboratory has shown that  accessory gland proteins (\"Acps\") are responsible for short-  term changes in the female's behavior after mating, and also  play a role in the storage and utilization of sperm by the  mated female.  They  have isolated and characterized 14  Acps.  The PI will continue to use a combination of genetic  analyses and determination of the fate of each Acp in the  mated female, to define the roles of individual Acps in  reproduction.  The PI will then focus on the mode of action  of two Acps.  One (Acp26Aa) is believed to act as a hormone  that modifies the mated female's physiology and the other  one (Acp36DE) is believed to be necessary for sperm storage  and function.  The sequences and modifications of the Acps  that are necessary for its localization and function, and  the nature and source of other molecules that modify it or  in other ways regulate or affect its function will be  determined.  This work addresses important problems in  reproduction, fertilization, prohormone action and  reproductive fitness;  it also has potential long-term  significance in the area of biological pest control.  ***",
