This remodeling of the insect has inspired a  great deal of research on the developmental changes in  epidermis.  On the other hand, changes in the physiology and  metabolism of internal tissues during insect growth and  development are not well-understood.  The proposed research  will reveal changes in the functioning of one such tissue,  the midgut, during larval growth, molting and metamorphosis.  The insect to be studied is the tobacco hornworm (Manduca  sexta).  This caterpillar is essentially an \"eating machine\"  that consumes large quantities of food to support its  phenomenal growth rate.  During the first 16 days of larval  (caterpillar) life, the insect increases in size nearly  10,000-fold.  This rapid growth rate is due, in part, to the  functioning of its large midgut which digests and absorbs  the ingested food.  The midgut also engages in high rates of  active ion transport and it is this process that is the  focus of the proposed research.  During larval growth, M.  sexta molts four times before it metamorphoses into a pupa.  Prior to each molt the gut is purged and during the molting  process new cells are added to the midgut.  The proposed  research will determine whether midgut ion transport changes  as the larva grows and whether the midgut temporarily ceases  to engage in active ion transport during the molting  process.  During the fifth and final larval stage, the large  larval midgut is destroyed and replaced by a smaller pupal  epithelium.  The PI has demonstrated that midgut active ion  transport is greatly diminished in the last half of this  period.   The proposed research will expand upon this work  of Chamberlin by measuring active ion transport across  midgut just after the molt to the fifth stage and at several  time points during the subsequent days .  These studies will  precisely determine when, in the metamorphosis of the  insect, active ion transport declines.  The energy for  active ion transport is supplied by aerobic metabolism and  therefore changes in midgut metabolism may affect active ion  transport.  The metabolic organization of the midgut during  larval growth and development will be determined by  measuring metabolite levels, maximal activities of key  metabolic enzymes, and the respiration of isolated  mitochondria, the organelle responsible for providing most  of the energy for active ion transport.  These studies on  midgut ion transport and metabolism will elucidate the  functional changes in an internal tissue during insect  growth and development.  Since molting and metamorphosis are  processes common to all insects, the proposed research will  provide fundamental information pertinent to understanding  the physiology of all insects.  ***",
