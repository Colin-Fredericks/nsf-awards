 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support travel expenses of approximately 25 U.S. scientists, approximately ten participants who have an official capacity such as organizers and invited speakers and approximately fifteen young investigators (including women and minorities), to attend the 17th International Biometric Conference. The meeting will be held August 8-12, 1994 in Hamilton, Ontario. The strength of the meetings lies in the broad international participation of statisticians, biologists and mathematicians interested in quantitative and statistical aspects of biology, genetics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medicine, public health and other fields. Topics to be discussed on statistical topics directly related to these issues include quality management, mixture distributions, neural networks, genetics, repeated measures and longitudinal data analyses, spatial models and climatic change in fisheries, bioassay calibration, epidemics, DNA and protein sequences, Gibbs sampling and resampling computer intensive methods, spatial and temporal environmental modelling, frailty models, cancer models and ecological impact analysis; all of which have direct bearing on solutions to the major concerns of today including ecology and the environment, AIDS, cancer and heart disease, plant science epidemiology, agriculture, forestry, etc. In addition, discussions on fundamental statistical issues of repeated measures, structural inference, image processing and causal inference all have direct application to current health related and agricultural sciences. It is anticipated that the Conference, which is the major international meeting of biostatisticians and biometricians throughout the world will be attended by 500 or more scientists from the international community.

The strength of the meetings lies in the broad international participation of statisticians, biologists and mathematicians interested in cutting edge research and the application of quantitative and statistical methods to of biology, genetics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medicine, public health and other fields. It is anticipated that the Conference, which is the major international meeting of biostatisticians and biometricians throughout the world will be attended by 500 or more scientists from the international community.",
