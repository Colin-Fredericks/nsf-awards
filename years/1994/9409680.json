Under this award, a service course will be developed to  teach asymptotic methods for approximate process models.  The  course and text will be aimed at advanced students who are  specializing in the area of deformation processing.  Over the last  several years, several new approximate models for sheet rolling,  extrusion, coating flows, etc. have been developed using asymptotic  methods.  The goal of this activity is to introduce these methods  into engineering curricula, educate engineers in their use, and  provide a monograph that will cover the recent developments.       This project should enable advanced modelling methods to be  introduced into engineering curricula, improving the education of  engineers in an important area of manufacturing.",
