This building supports the research and training efforts of 27  faculty, 92 research associates and postdoctoral fellows, 73 graduate students and 50  undergraduate students.  The renovation project in progress will make appropriate this  buildings infrastructure and support facilities, consolidate shared central facilities and  upgrade lab spaces.   The heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems will be  modernized as well as adding new fume hoods and an up-to-date mechanical system.   The research to be performed in the renovated spaces ranges from  basic nucleic acid  biochemistry to complex developmental events in nematodes, flies, and mammalian  cells.  This department is well known for its emphasis on model systems that aid in  the solution to major  biological problems.",
