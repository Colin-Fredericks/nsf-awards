The funds are used to set up the  program that is expected to become self sustaining.  Teachers, and  others, apply directly to the center with their research proposals.   The advisory board screens these, the staff helps to find funding,  and a visiting position is awarded.  The center is donating space  and support for up to four at any one time and the facilities could  support as many as twelve.  It is anticipated that the projects  will range from 15 to 90 days and that the participants will have  sabbatical leave from their home schools or institutions.  Follow-  up support is integral to the project and network access is seen as  crucial to this.    Future projects will vary in scope and discipline, but it is  expected that visualization and networking will be integral to all.   Educators in science and mathematics with strong interests in their  disciplines and a commitment to hands-on education will be actively  recruited.  Because of tools NCSA and others have developed,  programming is not essential for participation.    The cost sharing includes salaries of the Principal Investigators,  the space for the RSE staff, the space for four visitors, access to  NCSA responses, and space/staff for workshops, institutes and  seminars.  It is estimated at 28%",
