As the nation focuses on the civil infrastructure  systems (CIS), of which the power systems grid is a vital part,  the research issues for the various areas need to be clearly  defined.  This proposal is a plan to bring together about 40 of  the top power engineering experts for three days to develop a  blueprint for infrastructure research.       The NSF CIS Task Group report provides a conceptual  framework for infrastructure research by defining deterioration  science, assessment technologies, and renewal engineering.  A  special panel session at the 1994 Summer Power Meeting will shed  further light on specific infrastructure issues in power  engineering.  This workshop is to be a forum for experts to  continue this work and formulate specific research needs that can  be used by NSF and academic institutions to plan their R&D  efforts.  A conference record, including recommendations and  summarized discussions, will be produced for dissemination to a  wider audience.  ***",
