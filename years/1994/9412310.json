 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412310  McDOWELL       Many studies in geography and related disciplines have  examined the ways that human activities impact on natural  systems.  One of the locales where such studies have been  undertaken are streambeds, where direct human alteration of  channel characteristics and indirect impacts resulting from  changing patterns of land use on nearby lands have had profound  impacts on processes of erosion and deposition.  Relatively  little attention has been focused, however, on the processes that  occur when the impact of human activities are removed.  This  collaborative research project will examine stream channel  recovery from chronic human disturbance through what is  effectively a controlled experiment.  The project will document  the rate, magnitude, and processes of stream channel recovery  following the elimination of cattle grazing from pasture lands  along a number of streams in central and eastern Oregon.  During  the first year of work, data on channel morphology, streambed  sediment characteristics, fish habitat characteristics, and  indicators of fluvial processes will be gathered from six stream  segments.  Historical data on the nature and timing of land uses  from written sources and remote sensors also will be gathered,  with special attention given to the establishment of enclosures  that prevented cattle grazing on nearby lands.  These data will  be analyzed and used to develop models of channel recovery.  During the second year, field work will be expanded to examine  sites for which nearby enclosures were established more recently  and for which sediment, geologic, and ecological conditions of  streams are more varied.       This project will provide valuable new insights into  streambed recovery processes.  It will document differences in  morphologic and hydraulic characteristics between restored and  unrestored reaches of streams.  It will test hypotheses about the  ways that different factors respond during different phases of  the recovery process, and it wi ll determine the amount of time  necessary to achieve restoration.  This information will not only  have significant value to researchers, but it will have  considerable immediate utility to land managers in both the  public and private sectors.  Because part of the funding for this  project is being made through the Research Experiences for  Undergraduates Program, the project will provide an excellent  opportunity for promising students to directly participate in a  high-quality research project.",
