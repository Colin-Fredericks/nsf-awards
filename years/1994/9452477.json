 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452477  Olson  A laboratory improvement program has been proposed to integrate and  modernize the laboratory components of three environmental  engineering courses: \"Environmental Chemistry for Environmental  Engineering\", \"Physical-Chemical Processes\", and \"Microbial  Processes\". The project will involve the development of three new  pairs of laboratory exercises that will help to reinforce key  topics between the classes. In addition, the new exercises will  illustrate the fundamental relationships between chemical and  microbial systems, provide the opportunity to analyze more  realistic complex samples, and expose engineering students to  modern instruments in gas chromatography and spectrophotometry that  they currently do not have access to. Among the equipment items  requested, the two major instruments include a gas chromatograph  and a scanning spectrophotometer. A few additional equipment pieces  that support the new types of proposed exercises are also  requested. By the fall of 1994, the program will acquire new  dedicated wet-laboratory space for undergraduate environmental  engineering instruction. This laboratory will be used primarily by  undergraduate majors in Environmental Engineering, a brand new  baccalaureate program, and by Civil Engineering majors who  specialize in environmental engineering. The current enrollments in  each of the three classes are in the range of 35 to 55. While some  State of California funds are available to equip this new  laboratory, the amount available falls short of what is needed to  significantly modernize the facilities. The requested equipment  will greatly improve our ability, therefore, to provide an  exceptional laboratory experience for this new degree program.",
