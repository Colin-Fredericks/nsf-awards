 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT        This proposal is for travel funds to help support a workshop designed to bring chemists and chemical engineers together for the purpose of defining research horizons for \"Environmentally benign chemistry\".  The intended audience is academic chemists and chemical engineers.  The workshop will be sponsored by the National Science Foundation (CTS and Chemistry Divisions), Council for Chemical Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Center for Waste Reduction Technology (AIChE).  The program committee consists of chemists and chemical engineers from industry, and make decisions on financial support of the academics who attend.  We anticipate a total attendance of less than 100.  The main goals of the workshop are to develop areas of focus for research into chemical synthesis and process engineering as they relate to environmental concerns; interest the academics, especially the chemists, in these research areas; and provoke brainstorming on environmentally relevant basic research in the chemical sciences at universities.",
