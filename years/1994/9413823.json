 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gopal    Through its Academic Research Infrastructure competition, the  National Science Foundation provides funds to permit Dr. Hundraj  Gopal to purchase instrumentation for linguistic analysis. The  equipment centers around several personal computer-based  workstations which are networked. Each of the workstations will  be configured to perform acoustic analysis of speech for prosodic  information and playback/recording of conversations for auditory  analysis. Each of the workstations includes a portable digital  tape recorder, condenser microphone, a high-powered PC equipped  with a 16-bit sound card, 16 MB RAM, 1 GB of hard disc, a math  co-processor, headphones and loudspeakers. The software required  for discourse prosody, including word processing, database  processing and speech analysis is also provided.     Prosody constitutes a distinctive feature of spoken language. The  term refers to the melody or rhythm with which it is spoken.  Every language has distinct pitch, stress and timing patterns.  While linguists have focussed on smaller segments of speech for  many years, only recently have they turned to such larger units  which are amenable to prosody analysis. Only recently has the  relevant technology developed to the point where this aspect  naturally-occurring speech can be examined.    This work is important for several reasons. It will increase  scientific understanding of human speech. It will aid in the  training of students and it may have important implications for  such practical issues as computer recognition of speech.",
