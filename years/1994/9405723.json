 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405723  Que  Proteins with active sites consisting of diiron centers connected  by a single oxygen atom bridge and/or carboxylates comprise a new  subclass of metalloproteins. This growing class includes dioxygen  activating enzymes such as methane monooxygenase, ribonucleotide  reductase, and stearoyl ACP delta9 desaturase, and hydrolytic  enzymes such as the purple acid phosphatases.  A major goal of  this proposal is to determine how the diiron sites of the  different proteins are interrelated by comparing their  spectroscopic properties in the various oxidation states. A  second goal, which is specific for the dioxygen activating  enzymes, is to understand the mechanisms of oxygen activation by  characterizing transient species observed in the reaction of  dioxygen with the diiron(II) states of these enzymes.  A third  goal, which is specific for the purple acid phosphatases, is to  determine the roles the two metal centers play in the hydrolytic  mechanism.  %%%  This project is aimed at understanding how a new class of  metalloenzymes with active sites consisting of two iron centers  catalyzes metabolically important reactions. For example, methane  monooxygenase converts methane to methanol under mild conditions,  in contrast to the current energy-intensive industrial process.  On the other hand, ribonucleotide reductase is responsible for  making deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, during  cell growth.  Using a variety of spectroscopic methods as probes,  we will compare the active sites of these enzymes in their  various forms to understand their structural relationship, how  they catalyze their respective reactions, and the roles of the  individual metal centers in carrying out the reactions.  ***",
