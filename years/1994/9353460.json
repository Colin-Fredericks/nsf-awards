The two year program provides a rich, supportive context in  which undergraduates develop and hone their teaching skills well in  advance of the student teaching internship.  By providing an early  teaching experience, the project also provides an opportunity which  can motivate science undergraduates, particularly underrepresented  minorities and women, to elect the teaching of science as a career.  Another expected outcome of the project is an improvement in the  levels of science achievement and persistence in science and  mathematics programs of students in student support programs on  Long Island.  Over 300 children will be tutored, mentored, and  otherwise supported through a network connecting SUNY Stonybrook  science undergraduates in Partnership for Progress with five  federally sponsored programs covering school districts with the  largest percentage of minority students in Suffolk County.  ***y",
