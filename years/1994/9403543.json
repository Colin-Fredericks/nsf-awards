The primary vehicle for the investigation will be epitaxial Iron  thin films and multilayers and epitaxial Laves phase iron/terbium  thin films, which will be grown by UHV sputter deposition on single  crystal substrates. The various contributions to anisotropy in Iron  thin films and multilayers will be isolated through control of  epitaxial strain by use of alloy or strained layer superlattice  underlayers. The Laves phase iron/terbium compounds are known to  have enormous magnetostriction coefficients, and we propose to  capitalize on this to induce large magnetic anisotropies through  control of epitaxial strain. Finally we will investigate the  anisotropy induced by a regular array of steps by growing magnetic  films on vicinal surfaces. We see significant impact of these  studies on the technology of magnetic thin films for use in the  information storage, sensor, and actuator technologies.  %%% This  program will provide the fundamental understanding of magnetic  anisotropy which is an important characteristic of films used in  the information storage, sensor and actuator technologies.  The  results of this program will be used by technologists working in  these areas to design and fabricate new materials with improved  properties, allowing for higher density recording, more sensitive  sensors, and more efficient actuators.  An important feature of the  program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in  a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials  and processing research.  This research will contribute to  improving the general perform ance of advanced devices and  integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and  tele communica tions.  ***",
