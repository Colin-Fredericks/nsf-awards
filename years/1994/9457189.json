 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457189  Glasserman       This research is focused on the analysis and simulation of  multi-stage inventory systems with limited production capacity.   The emphasis and common theme is on the use of new techniques for  bounding and approximating the performance of such systems.  The  methodologies involve draw upon techniques for analyzing  probabilities of rare events, which, in a properly designed system,  correspond to inventory stockouts, last sales, long response times,  etc.  The different subclasses of problems to be studied include  capacitated multi-stage systems, capacity allocation among multiple  products, stocking levels in the presence of component commonality,  cyclic schedules for multiple products, and efficient simulation of  rare events.  In capacitated multi-stage systems,  the research  emphasis is on the study of features of the assembly and supply  chains of many industries with the objective of developing design  and control tools to coordinate the various stages to meet service  levels for external demands and to limit inventory costs.  Research  in capacity allocation problems will seek to extend the solution to  capacity allocation problems that involve multiple products in  make-to-order stock environment.  Research in stocking levels is  aimed at developing solution to the problem of setting stock levels  for components that are required by multiple products.  The study  of cyclic schedules in which products are made in a fixed schedule  and each visit to a product restores its inventory to a preset  target level that depends on intervening demand will also be  considered in this research.  The rarity of events such as  stockouts, lost sales, etc. in complex inventory systems make the  use of simulation as an evaluation tool of such systems very  difficult.  This research will also focus on the development of  variance reduction techniques, based on importance sampling, to  increase the efficiency of simulation analysis.       Expected outcomes of this research inclu de the  characterization of asymptotically optimal base-stock levels for  control of capacitated inventory systems, identification of  asymptotically optimal capacity allocation among products, and  better analysis, understanding, and design of cyclic schedules for  multiple products.  Furthermore, tools to better analyze inventory  systems through simulation will be developed.  This will make it  easier, more attractive, and computationally more efficient to  analyze complex inventory systems through simulation technique.",
