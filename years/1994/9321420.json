 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321420  Albert  The proposed project is a field study of the physical processes  that affect the manner in which atmospheric constituents are  incorporated into polar snow and firn at the surface of the  Greenland ice sheet.  These processes are an important component in  reconstructing the characteristics of paleoatmospheres from the  observation of inclusions in deep ice cores, and consist of the  direct transport by the flow of air within the snow (advection),  the molecular scale dispersion (diffusion), and the effects of  solar radiation penetrating into the snow.  The air-to-snow  transfer of atmospheric constituents is filtered and potentially  altered by such processes.    The objectives are to define the magnitude and extent in space and  time of these transfer processes, and to develop a process-level  understanding and a capability to model these processes.  Field  studies will be conducted in central Greenland in the summer of  1994 to determine the spatial and temporal variability of key  parameters, and to observe boundary conditions needed to constrain  the model.  An existing multidimensional numerical model will be  extended and verified to simulate the advection, diffusion, and  radiation transmission/absorption processes.  ***",
