Under the project, the process in which information is  gathered, analyzed, and conclusion reached under the continuous  improvement model will be evaluated according to standard  engineering design practices.  The effectiveness of teams of  workers to generate alternatives and make consensus based decisions  will be evaluated by observations and involvement by the project  team.  Interview with team members from both union and management  will be conducted concerning the adequacy of training received and  recommended changes to improve the effectiveness of the system.   Additional tasks to be performed under this project include the  evaluation of the transfer of recommendations to work units for  implementation, documentation and evaluation of the effectiveness  of communication and group dynamic process, evaluation and  documentation and incentives and motivation of team members and  their work unit members to accept recommended improvements, and  corporate policies encouraging increased productivity.       The potentials for this project include the strengthening of  the understanding of continuous improvement by the students and  faculty involved in the project.  Valuable insights will be gained  into engineering practices and management philosophy under  continuous improvement programs.  Similarly, the outcome of the  project will help Saturn Corporation and other similar  manufacturing organizations on how to refine continuous improvement  models and consequently, develop strategies to maximize the  benefits from such program.",
