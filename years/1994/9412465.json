Hill, Chemistry Department, Emory University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the development of heteropolyoxometallates (HPOM) as homogeneous catalysts. The  transfer of oxide from an HPOM to alkanes will be  developed because of its central importance to any process which involves oxidative functionalization. The factors which influence HPOM catalyzed oxidation using the environmentally advantageous hydrogen peroxide will be evaluated. As catalysts normally have a finite lifetime, new systems will be sought which will heal defects which occur in them as they operate. Finally, the ability of HPOM's to induce reactions of very unreactive materials such as diamond surfaces and to catalytically oxidize hydrogen sulfide will be determined.    Oxidation reactions are very common and important in many areas of chemistry. On the industrial scale they are often plagued by environmental problems because they either use or produce toxic, potentially polluting substances. In this project a new class of environmentally benign catalysts will be developed. The basic way  in which they function will be assessed and this knowledge will be used to design processes for oxidations of very non-reactive materials and for the conversion of toxic hydrogen sulfide into sulfur.",
