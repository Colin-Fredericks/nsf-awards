 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355656  Wolf         Lebanon Valley College and twelve school districts in  South-central Pennsylvania have initiated a science  education partnership affecting nearly 600 teachers and  20,000 students in grades 4-8.  The partnership goal is to  strengthen science teaching by increasing teachers'  knowledge of science, understanding of hands-on and inquiry-  learning pedagogies, and improving their skills to use  hands-on classroom materials.          Training is achieved through summer institutes  organizing teachers, science faculty and students into  collaborative teams and by in-service workshops which  integrate approaches to science content, pedagogy, and  development of practical and useful classroom science  materials.  A cadre of teachers serve as Peer Leaders in  their districts, conducting workshops and institutes and  catalyzing their colleagues' long-term interest and  confidence in learning new science content and instructional  strategies.  A Resource Center is housed at the College.",
