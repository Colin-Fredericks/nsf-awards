 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416484  Haroun  The Northridge earthquake induced a number of incidents of damage  to ground-based tanks, and even to some retrofitted tanks.  Utilities and industrial facilities in the strong shaking area  include a large inventory of tanks of all types, and many records  have been obtained in the vicinity of damaged and undamaged  tanks.  The mass of data on earthquake ground motions and  observations of the structural response have important  implications for the earthquake resistant design.  This is  project will study the performance of tank structures as follows:      Collection of data and documentation of the damaged sustained    by ground-based water and petroleum storage tanks.      Calculation of the dynamic response of representative tanks    and correlation of the computed response with observed damage    or lack of damage.      Study of the effects of long period components on the sloshing    phenomenon.      Study of the damage to retrofitted tanks to deduce the reasons    for the ineffectiveness of implemented to retrofit mechanisms.    Specifically, a study of damage to the anchors is proposed to    devise improved ways for the anchoring system.      Comparison of induced seismic forces with those specified by    available codes and standards such as API 650, AWWA 100, EPRI,    UBC and the New Zealand Recommendations.    New advances have been made in the analysis of liquid-filled  tanks such as non-linear sloshing of liquids, elephant foot  buckling of the tank shell, and combined liquid-structure-soil  interaction.  This is an opportune time to compare the predicted  response with actual behavior under earthquake loading to refine  and tune these methods and to provide improved seismic design  procedures.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
