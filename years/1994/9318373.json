 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical Ultracentrifugation facility will be heavily  involved in the development and the application of  methodology, hardware and software for advanced analytical  ultracentrifugation.  Optical and data acquisition system  improvements will be applied to both absorption and  interference optics of the new XL-A centrifuge.  These  innovations will have direct application to increasing the  scope and power of this new second-generation centrifuge.  Applications will deal largely with equilibrium  sedimentation studies of macromolecular interactions with  particular emphasis on hetero-association.  This will also  involve the development of software for data analysis as  well as research strategies to optimize such studies.  New  technical developments will be engineered and applied to  increase the accuracy and efficiency of velocity  sedimentation measurements, a technique which did not  receive high priority under the previous grant.    These resources have been made available to the scientific  community over the past three and a half years.  The  Facility has participated in or is still involved with 31  research projects (17 completed) involving over 100  combinations of macromolecular samples and experimental  conditions.  During the next five years this collaboration  with academic and industrial researchers and the publication  of the results of such research will continue to be the  central focus of the Facility.    The Facility also assists researchers to make use of the  newly developed technology in their own laboratories by  upgrading their instrumentation and computational methods.  This transfer is promoted by presentations at national  meetings and conferences, and by workshops held at the  Facility for investigators, students, and technicians.  This  training, along with the distribution of software and of the  schematics and construction diagrams for hardware, will  constitute the heart of the technology-transfer mission of  the Facility.",
