Time series measurements of dissolved gas  concentrations in the upper ocean, which respond to changes in  atmosphere-ocean \"forcing\" have proven effective in studying gas  exchange rates.  This project will develop and deploy a moored  sequential noble gas sampling system which will permit the  determination of a time series of noble gas concentrations at  several depths in the near surface.  The device will be capable of  obtaining between 50 and 100 samples at predetermined time  intervals over a course of days to months (as dictated by the  scientific program).  Samples would be processed in the laboratory  using a self-contained, automated vacuum system which would  sequentially extract and analyze the stored samples.  The noble  gases (He,Ne,Ar and Kr) will be analyzed to document the time  evolution of gas concentrations during high wind events, permitting  the quantitative modeling of bubble injection and gas exchange  rates at those wind speeds.  This will permit the comparison of  models of these important processes on larger scales.  Comparison  of results with noble gas analyses of conventionally obtained water  samples, as well as moored oxygen sensor and total gas devices will  be used to evaluate sampler performance and refine models.",
