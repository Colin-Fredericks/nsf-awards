 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316538  Smith  Remarkably little is known about the temperature at which  pyroclastic particles are transported.  Many factors, other  than the initial magma temperature, are known to affect the  emplacement temperature of  pyroclastic flows.  these  factors are known, or hypothesized, to be related to  descriptive and quantifiable textural and structural  characteristics of pyroclastic-flow deposits (ignimbrites),  including vesicularity, grain-size distribution, grain  morphology, bedding structures, and grading profiles.  In  this study, these characteristics will be compared to  emplacement temperatures estimated by application of  established rock-magnetism methods to previously well-  studied ignimbrites.  The same approach will also be  utilized to investigate a pyroclastic-flow deposit that was  the product of a subaerial eruption but can be traced from  the subaerial setting to a subaqueous depositional  environment.  Establishment of the thermal and textural  changes of the deposit that occur in the transition will be  critical to ongoing controversy on the nature of such  transitions, which are critical to understanding pyroclastic-  flow transport.",
