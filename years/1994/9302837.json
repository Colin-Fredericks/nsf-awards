 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302837  Gubbins    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Keith E. Gubbins, School  of Chemical Engineering, Cornell University, to pursue with  Dr. Soong-Hyuck Suh, Department of Chemical Engineering, Keimyung  University, and Dr. Soon-Chul Kim, Andong University, Korea, for  24 months, a program of cooperative research on the behavior of  fluids in narrow pores and in microporous media using the methods  of statistical mechanics and molecular simulation.  The  objectives of the research are (1) to use several molecular  dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques to study the  equilibrium and transport properties of simple fluid and their  mixtures in porous media having simple geometries, (2) to use  these computer experimental results to test recently developed  density functional and kinetic theories of fluids in pores, (3)  to study networking effects in porous media using molecular  dynamics simulation techniques, (4) to study the adsorption and  dynamical behavior of water in porous carbons, and (5) to further  develop and improve the density functional and kinetic theories  for fluids in porous media.    Microporous materials are widely used in the chemical, oil and  gas, pharmaceutical, and food industries to carry out chemical  reactions and for purification and separations.  The  collaborators expect the proposed work to help them design  improved processes and materials for these industries.  The  collaborators are recognized as experts in the field of the  proposal.  They will be assisted by several postdoctoral workers  and graduate students.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  Thi s project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No. CTS-9122460.  ***",
