Wilson,  working under the guidance of  Prof. Craig Harris, of  the Department of  Sociology at Michigan State University, to study the fisheries  management situation on the Tanzanian shore of Lake Victoria.  The research  will look at how several existing or proposed management regulations are  perceived by those in the industry, in terms of  their particular economic interests  and the interest of preserving the resource.  The study will use a multi-site, multi-  method approach to understanding the perceptions of fisheries management of  small-scale fishers, processors, and traders on eight fishing beaches, and their  large-scale counterparts in the three major lakeside towns.  Methods to be used  include formal surveys, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and a q-methodology  survey to identify how perceptions vary according to location, species pursued,  technology used, demographic characteristics, and the class of the various actors.   The research will be done in cooperation with, and assisted by personnel from,  the Tanzanian Fisheries Research Institute.  The characterization of the  constituencies in the Lake Victoria fishery that emerges from this research will be  given to the Tanzanian fisheries authorities to facilitate the design and  implementation of future management programs.    This study will make an important contribution to the social science understanding  of a major biological change in one of the world's great aquatic ecosystems.  The  research could provide useful real-world data to illuminate the issue of what  influences behavior toward either the \"free rider\" or the \"respecter of the  commons\" mode.  The grant will launch a young scientist on a comparative  research program to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of  this multi-site,  multi-method approach to understanding common pool resources.  ***",
