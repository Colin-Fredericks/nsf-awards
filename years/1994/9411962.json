 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ms. Michelle Anne Laughran, working under the direction of  Professor Shirley Roe, is examining the rise of efforts on the part  of cities and other governments to regulate human behavior in order  to protect human health.  The degree to which a government might  optimally intervene is of constant concern.  The United States, for  example, had a dismal failure in its attempt to criminalize  alcohol.  Use of alcohol in the United States was not stopped while  criminal behavior rose dramatically in order to meet the demands of  citizens wanting to drink.  The net effect was a broad scale  disrespect of the law.  Given this experience, Congress and the  Administration is currently debating how far it should go to  regulate smoking.  One approach, short of prohibition, would be  taxation; but even here, too high a tax will lead to smuggling and  other methods of subverting the law.      Regulation of public health arose in the modern world with the  efforts of cities in Northern Italy to prevent the plague.  Ms.  Laughran is examining the developments in Venice where a civil  magistrate for public health quickly expanded his powers to include  supervision of begging, prostitution, hostelries and the city's  poor population.  By tracing how this magistrate for health  expanded his power over such a broad spectrum of human behavior and  the effects this expansion had both on public health and the  operation of government, Ms. Laughran promises to illuminate both  the beneficial and the detrimental aspects of public health policy.",
