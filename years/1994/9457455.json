 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457455  Hawley      The data from the observations of the magnetic activity in low mass  stars can be used as a tool to study the formation, evolution, the  interior dynamo and atmospheric structure, and possibly the age of  the stars.  A concerted program will be carried out to investigate  stellar activity in low mass stars through two large observational  surveys and a major theoretical modelling effort.  The surveys will  focus on low mass stars in open clusters and in the field of our  Galaxy, and will comprise both photometric and spectroscopic  observations.  From the data obtained by observing the stellar  clusters, a snapshot of the activity at a given age (and  evolutionary state) is obtained, while the relationship between  activity and mass (and internal structure) is best studied in the  field stars.  To further the observational effort, a new Michigan  State University (MSU) optical spectrograph will be designed and  developed and used for the observations.  It will employ both a  grating and an echelle mode, suitable for low and high resolution  spectroscopic studies, respectively.  Several students will be  involved in the design phase which should be completed in 1994 or  1995.  Finally, the modelling effort employs a sophisticated  non-LTE radiative transfer method together with a self-consistent  description of the entire atmosphere of a star from corona to  photosphere to make models of the stars. The combination of  observation and theory promises to give new insight into the  physical processes and evolution of magnetic activity in low mass  stars.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  This award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
