 "awd_abstract_narration": "Politis       The general goal of this project is to develop methods of  inference for the statistical analysis of time series and random  fields that do not rely on unrealistic or unverifiable model  assumptions. Bootstrap resampling or computer-intensive methods  offer viable approaches to obtaining valid distributional  approximations while assuming very little about the stochastic  mechanism generating the data. However, many important questions  need to be addressed in order for these modern approaches to be  applied. The main issues we wish to tackle include the following:  finding general conditions for asymptotic validity of  computer-intensive methods, especially subsampling, in the  presence of nonstationarity; higher-order comparison of  block-resampling and subsampling; developing computationally  efficient and accurate estimates of standard error, and the  corresponding improvement on confidence regions for parameters of  interest; optimal choice of design  parameters, as well as  practical guidelines for implementation; assessing goodness of  fit in time series settings; and finally interval estimation with  random field data.       The statistical analysis of time series and random fields,  i.e., observations that exhibit serial (temporal) or spatial  dependence,  is vital in many diverse scientific disciplines,  with applications in the fields of physics, engineering,  acoustics, geostatistics, geophysics, medicine, econometrics,  ecology, forestry, seismology, and others. The general goal of  this project is to develop methods of statistical inference in  the context of time series and random fields that do not rely on  unrealistic or unverifiable model assumptions. The main approach  that will be pursued is the utilization and refinement of the  bootstrap and other computer-intensive techniques, which so far  have been developed extensively and have been proven very useful  in the setting of independent observations.",
