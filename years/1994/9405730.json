Daunomyucin is synthesized by several different species of  Streptomyces.  In studies, we found that the structure of the  daunomycin polyketide synthase (DPS) gene cluster of Streptomyces  sp. C5 contains differences from previously sequenced Type II  polyketide gene clusters.  Unique features of this st. C5 DPS gene  cluster include the presence of a third open reading frame directly  downstream of the polyketide synthase gene, an additional gene  encoding a putative acytransferase, and the absence of the acyl  carrier protein gene downstream from the other polyketide synthase  genes.  Instead, in the C5 DPS gene cluster, there is an acyl  carrier protein gene \"upstream\" from the polyketide synthase genes.   In this work, we will determine the DNA sequence between the acyl  carrier protein  and daunomycin polyketide synthase genes and  analyze its function by complementation of mutants blocked in the  early stages of daunomycin biosynthesis.  We will examine the  structure of DPS using antibodies against the putative enzyme  components to determine if DPS contains a third subunit suggested  by the sequence data.  We also will probe protein-protein  interactions between polyketide synthases and other daunomycin  biosynthesis proteins using the two-hybrid genetic system as well  as by ordinary methods of co-elution by gel filtration  chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical crosslinking.   Finally, we will work to isolate and characterize the putative  acyltransferase encoded by the gene associated with the DPS gene  cluster.  Our studies will provide new insights into structure and  functional differences between DPS and Type II polyketide  antibiotic synthases.  Data from these studies will aid our  understanding about the enzymology of secondary metabolite  biosynthesi s, provide rationale for tailoring pathways for  formation of novel hybrid secondary metabolites, and contribute to  understanding the physiological and molecular regulation of  antibiotic biosynthesis.  %%%  Daunomycin is used as a chemotherapeutic agent.  We have been  studying the biochemistry of its formation in Streptomyces, a type  of bacterium, for the purpose of getting the microbe to make more  of the compound or to make more potent analogues of it.  Recently  we isolated a fragment of DNA that contains more than thirty genes  involved in the formation of the compound.  Our goals are to  analyze this DNA fragment further, to examine the structure-  function of enzymes encoded by the DNA for daunomycin production,  and test the ability of these enzymes to form clusters involving  protein-protein interactions.  Our studies will help predict how  new molecules can be made through cell engineering.  ***",
