 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360331  Higgins  The objective of this project is to evaluate a physical  wastewater treatment process applicable to such waste streams;  namely, crossflow ultrafiltration (UF) using novel ceramic  membranes that are treated to have low-surface-free-energy, \"non-  fouling\" surfaces.  Processing of metastable oil-in-water  emulsions with conventional UF membranes leads to rapid membrane  fouling and flux decline and is generally uneconomic because of  this problem.  Ceramic UF membranes with modified, low-energy  surfaces will be evaluated using low-cost, high-surface-area  supports.  The resulting membrane modules will be evaluated for  filtration properties using different types of synthetic  metastable oil-in-water emulsions.  The objectives of these  experiments will be definition of preferred membrane modification  techniques and demonstration of the capability of surface-  modified membranes to maintain high, stable permeate flux levels  while producing a substantially hydrocarbon-free permeate.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation, addresses a class of wastewaters, metastable  oil/water emulsions and similar waste streams for which a need  exists for more cost-effective treatment and for which the flows  on a national scale are large.  Current treatment technologies  for metastable oil/water emulsions are often ineffective, and  substantial impairment of water resources results from disposal  of such inadequately treated waste streams.  The membranes to be  evaluated, if developed and integrated within a production scale  membrane module would be the key element in an oily wastewater  treatment system with low capital and operating costs.   Applications for this technology include those with extremely  high waste flows, such as produced water from oil wells and  desalter bottoms from crude oil washing at refineries.",
