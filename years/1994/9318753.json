 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318753  Yokota    This project investigates the regulation of the reptilian kidney  by neural and hormonal mechanisms, and uses the snake kidney as a  model for the development and application of methods to assess  vertebrate renal function in fine detail, in time and space. The  ophidian kidney allows the analysis of renal function at whole  animal, isolated organ and individual functional unit (nephron)  levels, and because of its unique morphology permits the  simultaneous application of several microtechniques which provide  unprecedented resolution of function of filtering units of the  kidney, the glomeruli. Using videomicroscopic and micropuncture  methods the blood flow in single glomerular microvessels, which  supply the glomeruli, and glomerular capillary blood pressures  can be measured continuously. These measurements allow  us to  define the state of glomerular function and the mechanisms for  modulation of  glomerular functional by neural and hormonal  factors. Studies on whole kidney function will define the  functional range for the control of renal function by vasoactive  hormones. And studies on intact animals will define the  physiological range of endogenous neural and hormonal effectors  in controlling  normal renal function and in  regulating  responses to changes in physiological state. Integration of these  studies will provide a more detailed picture of vertebrate renal  regulation than has been heretofore possible and may serve to  illuminate general principles for the regulation of renal  function for all vertebrate kidneys.  ***",
