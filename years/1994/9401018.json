In particular he  will continue his study of the equivariant derived category of  sheaves with a view to applications in equivariant geometry and  representation theory.       This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of modern  mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in  the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that  could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely  polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only  from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is  finding application in those fields as well as in physics,  theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
