 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316011  Scheffler  When yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) are switched  from a nonfermentable carbon source (e.g. glycerol, YPG medium) to a fermentable carbon source (glucose, YPD medium), the expression of a substantial number of genes is repressed.  This phenomenon, \"glucose repression\", has become a model system for studying the adaptation of cellular metabolism to a changing environment.  Past studies have focused wither on the promoter elements of relevant genes and on the transcriptional activators/factors, or on the elements in the signaling pathway connecting the sensing of extracellular glucose levels to nuclear events.  A foremost phenomenon is the repression of mitochondrial biogenesis, and in our studies the expression of the genes for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) has been emphasized.  SDH is part of complex II on the inner mitochondrial membrane and links the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain.  They have revealed that while the expression of the iron protein (p) and flavoprotein (Fp) genes is regulated at the transcriptional level, by far the most significant mechanism appears to be the regulation of the stability of the Ip and Fp mRNAs: in glycerol their half-life is < 60 min, while in glucose it is less than 5 min.  The analysis of a variety of chimeric transcripts has shown quite conclusively that the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of Ip mRNA is the dominant cis-acting element in establishing the differential stability of the transcript in YPG and YPD.  Furthermore, the 5'3' exonuclease encoded by the XRN1 gene appears to play a prominent role in the degradation of Ip and Fp mRNA's induced by glucose.  The emphasis on the importance of the 5'UTR in mRNA turnover is unusual, but it may provide significant clues to the coupling of translation and turnover.  This system represents a unique model system for studying mRNA turnover in yeast; under some conditions the transcripts are extremely short-lived, and we can manipulate the conditions to control the turnover rate over a b road range.   It is likely that many mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins are subject to the same control mechanism.  Advantage is to be taken of the powerful methods of yeast genetics to isolate mutations in which this control mechanisms is perturbed.  The Ip 5'UTR will be combined with heterologous coding sequences to create chimeric reporter genes, and these will be used to devise selections or screens based on the differential expression of the reporter gene product in YPD or YPG.  Such mutations will identify genes and their gene products which may play role in mRNA turnover in general, and specifically in the control of the stability of a subset of mRNAs by the carbon source.  It remains to be established whether a short-lived mRNA is stabilized i glycerol, or whether the addition of glucose induces a factor which promotes access to the 5' exonuclease.  What is the signaling mechanism?  The phenotype of the expected mutants will distinguish between the two possibilities.  The mutations will also identify genes which can be cloned, and the encoded proteins can be characterized.  The relatively short 5'UTR (44-59 nucleotides) of Ip mRNA will also be modified by in vitro mutagenesis to learn about its unique features which may single out transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins for this regulatory mechanism.  It is important to emphasize that mitochondrial biogenesis involves the coordinate expression of hundreds of nuclear genes ( as well as genes encoded by the mitochondria genome), and the regulatory mechanism being explored here must have a broad applicability.  Thus, the almost identical behavior of the Fp and CYC1 mRNAs must also be related to sequences within these transcripts.  %%%  The control of mRNA stability is being recognized as a prominent post-transcriptional mechanism for controlling gene expression during the cell cycle, during development, and in response to external signals.  However, knowledge of the sequence elements in the mRNAs, and the trans-acting factors involve d in the degradation its control, is still sketchy.  It is hoped that genetic approaches in yeast will contribute information which will also aid in our understanding of this phenomenon in other organisms.  ***",
