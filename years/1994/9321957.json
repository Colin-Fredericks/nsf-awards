Transmission electron microscopy  will be used to investigate the mechanism for misfit  accommodation, structural ordering, and stability of  semiconductor alloys of different systems and compositions grown  on different substrates (buffer layers) to study the effect of  lattice mismatch on the structure of semiconductor films. The  misfit accommodation mechanism will be studied in systems with  large and small lattice mismatches. Materials will be grown using  either molecular beam epitaxy or metal organic chemical vapor  deposition. The effects of growth parameters and growth methods  on the structure and quality of the films will be investigated to  obtain films with low defect density and single phase; special  emphasis will be placed on understanding the critical initial  stages of growth.  %%%  Most advanced electronic and photonic devices consist of compound  semiconductor heterostructures whose structural integrity and  quality are of critical importance, and very often determine the  performance and applicability of a device technology. In this  context, the accommodation of lattice mismatches between the  different layers in a heterostructure and between the film and  the substrate, is of fundamental significance. The proposed  research will significantly benefit our basic understanding,  control, and general ability to achieve improved materials for  devices and circuits needed in the general areas of  telecommunications, information processing; and high speed  computing.  ***",
