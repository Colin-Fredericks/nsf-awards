 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317373  Ringe  The overall aim of this project is to use protein crystallography  and site-directed mutagenesis to understand how the structural  features of an enzyme active site can control the chemistry of a  bound cofactor.  Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) requiring enzymes are  numerous and important in biochemistry, and catalyze a multitude  of different chemical reactions, including racemizations,  transaminations, beta-eliminations, and decarboxylations.  In  each case, the same cofactor is used, and the initial step in the  reaction is the same:  formation of an imine adduct between an  amino group of the substrate and the aldehydic carbon atom of  PLP.  When this adduct forms in free solution, many different  reactions can occur simultaneously, leading to a mixture of  products.  When the adduct forms on the enzyme, a unique product  is produced depending on the specific enzyme.  The enzyme  modulates and directs the chemistry of the cofactor.  To  understand how this happens five different PLP-dependent enzymes  have been selected for study, catalyzing different reactions.   The overall objectives for each are to crystallize the enzyme and  determine the three-dimensional structures of the enzyme itself  and complexed with inhibitors in order to suggest specific roles  for active site residues in controlling cofactor chemistry.   These hypotheses will be tested by site-directed mutagenesis and  crystal structures of the mutant proteins.  %%%  Many enzymes use organic cofactors as partners to assist in the  catalysis of chemical reactions.  Although enzymes-bound  cofactors still carry out the same transformations as when they  are in solution, the specificity of the reaction is much greater  on the protein surface.  An understanding of how environment  controls chemistry is the central aim in all studies of  homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.  Enzymes requiring  cofactors offer the ideal system for the unraveling of these  principles.  The enzymes chosen for this study catalyze diffe rent  and increasingly complex reactions, although they can all use  similar amino acids.  Therefore, comparison of the data from this  series of enzymes will provide a wealth of information about the  effect of protein environment on cofactor chemistry.  ***",
