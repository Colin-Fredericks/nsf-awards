The long-  term objective of this program is to find ways to induce higher-  order conformationally defined structures into synthetic polymers  by combining biochemical concepts, organic chemistry and polymer  chemistry, and lay the ground work for predictable control of  polymer chain folding.  Methods will be sought to control the  sequence, topology and surface functionality of synthetic polymers.    There are three parts to the project:  The first one involves  design, synthesis and characterization of repetitive oligopeptides  of controlled sequence and high propensity to form reverse-turns  (beta-turns), pleated beta-sheets and alpha-helices.  The second  part concerns the design and synthesis of novel organic, non-  peptidic beta-turn mimics that are convergent and rigid for  controlling chain folding and topology of advanced materials.  Two  broad classes of organic motifs will be targeted: (i) flat U-shaped  motifs, designed specifically to induce sheets, and (ii) non-planar  symmetric motifs for initiation of helical and twisted ribbon-like  structures.  The final part involves linking the oligopeptides and  the turn mimics to give oligomeric telechelic building blocks  containing either diamino or dicarboxyl end groups.   Polycondensation with diisocyanates, diacid chlorides, diamines  and/or diols, will be carried out to give novel hybrid polymers.   For materials of controlled sequence and topology, Alpha-Beta-type  oligomeric building blocks containing alpha-amino, omega-activated  carboxyl groups will be synthesized.  Polymerization of these will  give the expected polymers of controlled sequence, predetermined  chain folding and judiciously placed  functional groups.  Physical  properties, such as thermal and elastic behavior, modulus, tensile  and compressive strengths will be measured.    The capability to predictably control chain folding of  synthetic  polymers is expected to lead to novel polymers of predetermined  modulus and controlled crystallization.  Potential applications are  anticipated in preparation of chiral catalysts, chromatographic  packing materials for chiral separations, biocompatible polymers  and in electronics.  It is anticipated that the polymers will  degrade into environmentally benign by-products.  ***",
