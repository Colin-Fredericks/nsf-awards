Modern Anglo-American criminal  law is characterized by two features that differ from the origins  of public legal authority: (1) public agents, rather than the  victim, exercise the power to prosecute; and (2) criminal  sanctions are punitive rather than compensatory.  The proposed  research explores the origins and consequences of the shift to  public prosecution and punitive sanctions in medieval England.      Through analysis of manuscript sources in Great Britain's Public  Records Office, the project will seek to confirm preliminary  research that suggests that this key shift occurred in the early  thirteenth century, nearly a century later than usually believed.  It will also seek evidence to document the hypothesis that the  shift to public prosecution and punitive sanctions was the  unintended consequence of a procedural change to judicial  prosecution of discontinued private accusations, which was  probably introduced for other reasons such as increasing royal  revenue.  The consequences of this shift away from a system based  on private incentive were primarily negative, however, including  a doubling in the rate of flight from justice and a decline in  the rate of prosecution of most crime.      The proposed research will develop important historical data and  contribute to our theoretical understanding of the development of  criminal law.  It also has implications for criminal justice  policy-making.  ***",
