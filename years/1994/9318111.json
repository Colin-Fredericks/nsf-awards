Selective transcription of genes requires selective  interactions between protein and DNA. Construction of a  messenger RNA containing the protein coding information of  eukaryotic genes requires the recognition and removal of  introns and RNA splicing, a process dependent on an  elaborate set of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. The  translation of messenger RNA into protein is carried out by  a machinery made of RNA and protein as well, requiring  another elaborate set of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein  interactions. Control of the level of mRNA is a means by  which the expression of genes is regulated, often governed  by RNA structural elements in the mRNA. Detailed knowledge  of how and when these DNA-protein, RNA-protein, and RNA-RNA  interactions are established, maintained and disolved will  be essential for understanding the expression of genetic  information.    A set of powerful \"footprinting\" or \"structure probing\"  techniques for measuring the environments of nucleotides  along a nucleic acid chain is well developed and is in  general use among students of nucleic acid structure and  function. These approaches rely on detecting differences in  accessibility of the nucleic acid under study to some probe  (a chemical or nuclease), capable of reacting with nucleic  acid. The positions of reaction are mapped on the chain  using a variety of techniques, all of which require  radioactive labeling of the chain either directly or  indirectly. The radioactive products are separated by size  on a gel and the sites of reaction are calculated from the  size of radioactive products. The amount of reaction at a  particular site can be determined by the amout of  radioactive material present in products of a particular  size. For example, a protein that binds to a specific site  on a nucleic acid chain will protect the chain from attack  by the probe. After separation and com parison of bound  andunbound nucleic acid, gel bands representing protected  sites will contain less label. The technical limitations of  this general approach are two fold. First, it is often  difficult to isolate sufficient amounts of functionally  relevant protein-nucleic acid complexes to obtain detectable  signals, and second, some interactions are sufficiently  subtle that protection from probes, though meaningful, may  be only partial, and require careful quantitation of signal.  Both of these limitations arise from a single cause: the  requirement for exposure of radioactive gels to photographic  film for detection and quantitation of radioactive signal.  These limitations can be skirted by the use of a new  technology, storage phosphor imaging, rather than  autoradiography.    Phosphor imaging involves exposure of the footprinting gel  to a special storage phosphor screen, on which a compound  sensitive to radiation is bound. The compound is converted  by absorption of a radioactive particle. The screen is then  inserted into a laser scanning device that determines the  amount of converted compound present at every coordinate on  the screen.  This data is used to build a computer file that  expresses the amount of radiactive material at each position  as an image using a grey scale or color. The investigator  can inspect the image on a monitor and with the image  analysis software, analyze the data quantitatively. This  technique is orders of magnitude more sensitive than  autoradiography allowing better detection of signal, and  unlike photographic film the response of the phosphor to  radiation is linear, allowing accurate quantitation.    This proposal aims for a material extension of our  understanding of the function of nucleic acid-protein  complexes and RNA-RNA interactions through the analysis of  available footprinting data by the purchase and use of  phosphor imaging technology. The Noller and Puglisi groups  will use the device in their studies of ribosome structure  and func tion in the process of translation. The Ares group  will use it in their studies of the role of small nuclear  RNAs in spliceosome assembly and pre-messenger RNA splicing.  The Peck group will require this technology for  understanding the assembly and function of RNA polymerase  111 transcription complexes, and the Silverthorne group will  use it to study the role of mRNA structure in the regulation  of mRNA stability.",
