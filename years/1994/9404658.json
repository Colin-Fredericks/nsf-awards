 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404658  London       This award provides 55 per cent of the funding required  for the upgrade of an electron microprobe system at the  School of Geology and Geophysics at the University of  Oklahoma. The University is committed to providing the  remaining funds necessary for the equipment upgrade, which  will consist of modern computer automation of stage movement  and analytical functions, installation of x-ray diffracting  composite detectors for analysis of light elements, and a  sputter coater for carbon coating of non conducting  specimens. The upgraded system is needed to meet the needs  of a diverse user base at the University of Oklahoma who  rely on the electron microprobe for chemical microanalysis  of geological and other material samples. Specific projects  needing the capabilities of a modernized electron microprobe  include: (1) quantitative spatial analysis of the organic,  mineral, and trace elemental constituents of coals,  including a quantitative assessment of the correlation among  maceral composition, optical reflectance, and back scattered  electron signal intensity, (2) spatial analysis of rocks  forming reservoir rocks for hydrocarbon and water, and (3)  microscale studies of minerals grown from late-stage  magmatic fluids and gases.  ***  9405805  Craig       This award provides 75% of the funds required for the  acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted  and reflected light to be used in the rare gas isotope  laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the  University of California, San Diego. The University is  committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the  acquisition.       The microscope system is mainly to be used by  researchers working with fluid, glass, and crystalline  inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic rocks that have  been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope is  needed for the location and identification of these small  inclusions prior to extraction of the rare gases (argon,  helium, and neodymium)  for isotopic analysis. The  researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are  using the isotopic content of the rare gases brought up from  the mantle to understand the geochemical evolution of the  mantle.  ***",
