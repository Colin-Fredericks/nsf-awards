 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316897  West      Dictyostelium spore coats contain about one -half  polysaccharide, including cellulose and galuronan, and about  one half protein, including at least 7 different protein  species.  The coat is assembled in two phases.  First,  preformed coat proteins and the galuran are secreted,  forming a layer at the cell surface.  Most of the proteins  exchange between neighboring spores, indicating that  assembly occurs extracellularly after secretion.  One  protein. is unique in that it is not exchanged, as if it  anchors or initiates coat assembly.  During the second phase  cellulose accumulates, and the proteins organize further.  Cellulose has traditionally been considered to be the  primary determinant of structure and function.  The PI  proposes two hypotheses to investigate the relative  contribution of proteins and polysaccharides.  Hypothesis I  suggests that proteins play a critical role in initiating  assembly of the coat so that the absence of essential groups  of proteins  such as SP86, the protein part of the coat will  not assemble or will not be attached to the plasma membrane,  and what accumulates will not be positioned correctly.  Hypothesis II suggests that in the absence of cellulose, a  microscopically detectable and sedimentable protein  pseudocoat will still form..  The proposal has three aims:  1) To disrupt the gene for the spore coat protein SP87; 2)  To isolate the gene for the spore coat protein SP86 and  disrupt it; and 3) To disrupt the gene for UDPGPP2, and to  investigate the effect of this gene on coat structure.  %%%  Spore coats and other extracellular matrices protect  enclosed cells from unfavorable environments.  Although the  constituents of a number of these matrices is partially  known,  knowledge of how this parts fit together, how their  proportions are regulated, and how protection occurs is  largely derived by speculation.  The spore coat of the  cellular slime mold Dictyostelium is a good system to study  matrices at a molecular level, becaus e it is simple it can  be isolated in bulk and in high purity, the genes for a  number of its proteins and enzymes for polysaccharide  synthesis have been cloned and can be disrupted, and good  assays exist for the composition. structure and function of  the coat.  The results of this investigation will enhance  our knowledge about the assembly of walls in plant and  fungal cells.  ***",
