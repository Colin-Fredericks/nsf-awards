Synthetic and spectroscopic studies will be conducted to examine the importance of  precursor chemistry in the current methods used for making carbenes, to elucidate a new carbene  'zipper' reaction, and to generate novel strained bridgehead olefins which will be stabilized by  adamantyl groups. Focal points of this research are the exploration of the chemistry of carbene  and nitrene substituted carboranes, labeling experiments to elucidate carboranylcarbene  rearrangements, and reactions toward aza- and silacarboranes. High spin carboranes incorporating  several carbenes and/or nitrenes will be synthesized and studied for their properties. Dehydro-o-  carboranes will be used to form hydrocarbon addition products.     In this project Dr. Maitland Jones will conduct synthetic and spectroscopic studies on a spectrum  of carbenes and nitrenes including those that contain a carboranyl substituent. His research is  directed to improve current methods for generating these highly reactive species and to expand  their application for syntheses of new strained olefins and unsaturated carboranes. Fundamental  synthetic and mechanistic information will be obtained from these reactive intermediates that  crosses the boundaries between organic and inorganic chemistry.",
