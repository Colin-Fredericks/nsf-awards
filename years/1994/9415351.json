Some of these parallels were investigated under an NSF  researcch initiation grant and were demonstrated on two problems:  (a) on-line identification and adaptive control of an uncertain system; and 9b) synthesis of complex controllers using man-in-the loop simulations.  Experimental vertification using radio controlled aircraft is currentyly in progress.    This  project will extend the initial concept to include (a) analysis if IANS' capabilities  (completeness, robustness, and adaptiveness) and limitations ( Computational speed, storage, etc.); (b) higher order building blocks identification; (c) inclusion of several micro-features of the immune system; and (d) explore its usefulness in adaptive critic functions.  As part of this project, a 'Completely autonomous remotely piloted aircraft closed-loop control system will be developed and tested.  Towards this goal, efforts are already underway with the development of  a dedicated laboratory facility at the University of Alabama.  Other  applications will include uncertainty management for spacecraft control and operations.  Immunized artificial neural systems,  when fully developed and tested, could be used in a myriad of problems.  Some of these are:  complex process modeling, high performance aircraft/missile control, autonomous UAV mission control, autonomous scout aircraft/rotorcraft operations,  complex design ad manufacturing processes, and autonomous space explorations and robot planning.  u st adaptive nature desired in aretificial adaptive systems.
