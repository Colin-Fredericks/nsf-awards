 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316059  Einaudi  The focus of recent studies of epithermal deposits has been  on sources and physiochemical characteristics of  hydrothermal fluids in  the context of geothermal analogy.  Less well studied are links between such fluids and tectonic-  volcanic evolution in a given ore district.  This link will  be studied in the Jarbidge Rhyolite and associated  epithermal Au-Ag veins, Jarbidge mining district, Nevada.  The primary questions to be addressed are:  (1) style of  volcanism and relation to tectonics and structural  evolution, (2) spatial and temporal links between  hydrothermal activity and the plutonic-volcanic-tectonic  cycle, (3) absolute age, duration, and cyclicity of  faulting, volcanism, and hydrothermal activity, and (4)  vertical and lateral changes in hydrology and hydrothermal  fluid characteristics as a function of time, space, and  topographic/recharge characteristics at the paleosurface.  Detailed mapping will document the space-time distribution  and relative ages of volcanic rocks, faults, and  hydrothermal veins and alteration.  Sample collection,  binocular study of rock slabs and petrographic studies of  thin sections will be concurrent with mapping.  Laboratory  studies will focus on mineralogical and chemical  characterization of volcanic rocks and hydrothermal  alteration products, fluid inclusion studies of vein  minerals, and age dating of sanidine and adularia by high-  precision 40Ar/39Ar techniques.  The research will allow  further interpretation of the tectonic and volcanic control  of other epithermal districts.",
