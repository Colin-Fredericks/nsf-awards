 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355607  Sachse    In each of three years eighty teachers through out California will  continue implementation of coordinated science in grades 10-12.   Teachers will be selected from a pool of 40 SS&C Project schools  which have received UC-Office of the President approval of their  SS&C courses for college preparatory coursework.  Teams of two  teachers from the selected schools will participate in 2-week  institutes at either SCU-Sacramento or UC-San Diego.  The 2-week  summer institutes are complemented by eight Saturday workshops  during the academic year.  An additional two hundred teachers and  administrators will participate in linkage activity workshops in  the summer and throughout the academic year.  For example, one  administrator, two 11th grade teachers and two 12th grade teachers  from the participating 10th grade teachers' school attend.  All  teachers are also linked through CSUNET e-mail.    A comprehensive evaluation plan uses:  NSTA's Guideline for Self-  Assessment; Course Content and Instructional Analysis adapted from  a NSF study; the CA-Golden State Exam; CA-Learning Assessment  System, and; a daily log to study science content and pedagogy used  in the coordinated science classrooms.  The goal of this evaluation  is to compare student success in coordinated science (SS&C) with  the traditional layer-cake curriculum.",
