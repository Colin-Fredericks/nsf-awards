 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith  9310599         Some of the strongest atomspheric forcing of oceanic  properties anywhere on our planet is observed in the Arabian  Sea where seasonally reversing monsoon winds drive fast-  flowing, vertically extensive currents, complex eddy fields,  broad-scale, open ocean upwelling, coastal upwelling and  pronounced mixed-layer deepening.  Cycles of production in  this region are seasonal oscillations.  During the southwest  monsoon season (June-September inclusive), primary  productivity is maximal owing to strong winds which not only  cause the uplift of deep water rich in nutrient, but also  deliver aeolian dust to the surface layer of this tropical  ocean.  During the northeast monsoon (October-November  inclusive) and intermonsoon periods, primary productivity is  markedly reduced.  Biomass of zooplankton and secondary  productivity are also elevated during the southwest monsoon  season.  Based upon earlier studies off Somalia, the  epipelagic zooplankton off Oman is hypothesized to undergo  significant changes in species composition from one monsoon  season to another, with biomass during the southwest monsoon  dominated by rapidly growing meso- and macrozooplanktonic  grazers such as Calanoides and Eucalanus.  These grazers  exist in reduced abundance at subsurface depths during other  seasons.  The seasonal appearance of relatively large, fast  growing grazers determines, to a  large extent, the grazing  impact of the zooplanktonic community on the phytoplankton  assemblage that develops in the Arabian Sea during the  southwest monsoon (upwelling).  The grazing impact in turn  modulates the flux of carbon to depth and is an important  factor in the spatial and temporal patterns in carbon  deposition in this region.  In the Arabian Sea off Oman,  carbon fluxes driven by large, seasonal changes in the  grazing community of the upwelling area can be studied in  combination with investigation of the grazing contribution  to carbon fluxes associated with the perennially  oligotrophi c region of the central Arabian Sea.  A steep  gradient in oxygen concentration located at approximately  150 meters acts to restrict most epipelagic grazers to a  surface layer above this depth.  The role of the epipelagic  meso- and macrozooplanktonic grazers will be studied using:  multiple opening/closing nets (MOCNESS) to determine  distribution and abundance with particular attention to the  oxic-suboxic interface  and incubation experiments to  determine ingestion, fecal pellet production, and growth  rates",
