 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317303  Boston       The proposal concerns the maize storage proteins  (zeins), that are stored within ER membranes as spherical  aggregates called protein bodies.  A molecular chaperon has  been isolated and characterized that accumulates during  kernel development and may play a critical role in the  ordered deposition of the proteins within protein bodies.  This molecular chaperon is BiP, and is a 75 kD polypeptide  that is found  within the ER and the protein bodies.  Although the exact role of this protein is not known, BiP  homologues are found in both prokayotes and eukaryotes.  The  goals of the proposal are to characterize the interactions  between BiP and target proteins during translocation to the  ER of normal and mutant endosperm;  to investigate the  molecular basis of altered protein body morphology in  developing endosperm of fl2,De-B30 and Mc mutants;  and to  determine if post translational modifications are correlated  with BiP function in plants.  %%%  The studies outlined in this proposal will increase our  knowledge of the processes regulating transport and  accumulation of the important storage reserves. They are  also essential for devising new strategies for introducing  new gene products to improve plant growth and quality.  ***",
