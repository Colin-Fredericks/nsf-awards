Despite the debate over the causes of sociality, it has been widely accepted that the size of a social group is limited by intragroup competition over access to feeding sites.  In this regard, the size, abundance and dispersion patterns of resource patches on which a species feeds are believed to set a limit on the number of animals able to feed as a group due to intra group feeding competition.      This project will study the relationship of food distribution and group size in an extreme situation - this animal, the black uakari monkey, reportedly lives in groups of about 100 in a very remote part of Amazonia.  It will undoubtedly result in very interesting findings, especially as the species has never been studied before, and is considered endangered.    The project will result in expert training of a new scientist.  ***  p:\\anthro\\jfried\\9318784.abs",
