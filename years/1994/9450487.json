 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450487  CUNY Research Foundation  New York, NY  Shapiro, Norman and Carl Berkowitz    \"Science Summer Camp and Academic Year Follow-Up Program\"    This proposal for Summer Science Camp builds upon a successful  model and is designed to provide 300 (100 each year) academically  talented minority 7th and 8th graders with the necessary support  and enrichment to successfully pass the entrance examination for  the New York City's specialized science high schools (Stuyvesant  High School, Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High  School).  This is achieved through a four-week summer preparatory  period followed by a one Saturday a month campus program.  The  four-week summer residential component serves as the foundation for  the introduction of the world of science, mathematics and  technology.  Through the development of a peer network, students  are introduced to academic excellence.  To reach the project goals,  students are introduced to more advanced concepts in science,  mathematics and technology.  In the summer, students are prepared  to take challenging courses at the high school level and are  introduced to the skills necessary for the New york City  specialized science high school.  This project introduces the  necessary support systems and familiarizes the students with career  opportunities in mathematics, science and engineering.  Students  are also introduced to the special opportunities of the specialized  high schools and other special high school programs.  Following the  summer component is a City College of New York Academic year on-  campus program.  This phase will include academic activities,  special lectures, sharing time where each student receives the  support of peers and mentors.  In addition the principal staff will  meet with the participating student's school principal and guidance  counselor, informing them of the students program participation in  order to ensure that the student receives the necessary school  support.  Meetings will also be held w ith parents on-campus.   Students will also be provided with advisement on attending the New  York City specialized science high schools and other special high  school programs.  The project objectives include:  1) increasing  the number of minority students that apply into the three New York  City specialized science and technology high schools; 2)  encouraging highly able youngsters to develop their math, science  and verbal skills in order to increase their prospects for  admission into New York City special science and technology high  schools; 3) strengthening participants positive attitudes toward  science, mathematics, and technology subjects; 4) increasing the  pool of participants considering careers in science, mathematics  and engineering; 5) providing personal, career, academic and  financial-aid counseling; and 6) introducing and testing new  enrichment curriculum for wider application.  The project  evaluation will be directed to determine the extent that the  project goals and objectives are achieved by the individual  participants.",
