Such properties include one-  dimensional edge states, Wigner crystallization, and single-charge  carrier tunneling.  The properties of the collective ground states  of 2DES and size-quantized systems of few electrons, their  excitations, edge states, and the quantum phase transitions will be  studied experimenrally at very low temperatures and very high  magnetic fields via magnetotransport, thermal activation, nonlinear  transport, as well as by resonant and single particle tunneling  experiments.    Non-technical abstract:  Ultra-thin layers of semiconductors can  have significant potential applications in future high performance  semiconductor devices.  Such materials systems also allow the  investigation of unique electronic phenomena which are particularly  strikingly exhibited at very low temperatures close to absolute  zero and in very high magnetic fields.  The \"quantum Hall effect\"  is one of the remarkable phenomena which exhibits highly unusual  phenomena such as fractional electronic charge and highly ordered  assemblies of electrons.  The proposed experiments are designed to  understand the broad theoretical concepts that underlie thses  unique properties.  In another experiment the transport of single  electrons will be studied in specially designed ultrasmall  semiconductor dots which are initially unoccupied by electrons.   The approach is to measure the changes in electronic current as  electrons are sequentially transferred into such a quantum dot.   This process will be extended to ultralow temperatures and high  magnetic fields and compared with recent theoretical predictions.  ***",
