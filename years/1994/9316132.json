 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316132  Nelson         Following the successful completion in the summer of 1992 of  a pilot study (INDEPTH I) of deep seismic profiling in Tibet, the   next phase of the study (INDEPTH II) involves the acquisition and  analysis of some 200 km of deep seismic reflection profile,  together with complementary wide-angle and off-line (sparse 3-D)  reflection data, and surface geological information, along a  traverse extending across the northern Tethyan Himalaya, Indus-  Tsangpo suture zone, and Gangdese batholith in southern Tibet.  The  acquired data will provide new and possibly fundamental insight  into the mechanism by which continental crust is deformed and  thickened within the Himalaya/Tibet plateau collision zone-the type  example of active continent/continent collision on Earth.           The project will be undertaken collaboratively with the  Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources of China (MGMR) on the  principle of equal cost sharing, and will use an MGMR seismic  reflection crew for data acquisition and to provide the seismic  source for wide-angle and off-line recording.  On the U.S. side,  the  program will involve direct grants to Cornell and Syracuse  Universities for overall project coordination and data  acquisition/processing, and to Stanford University for wide-  angle/off-line recording.  Investigators from Columbia University  and the State University of New York at Albany will also be  involved in data interpretation, coordination with MGMR, and  acquisition of surface geological data along the transect.  ***",
