 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Elston and  his collaborators will conduct one season of archaeological  survey in the Pigeon Mountain Basin, Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region, Peoples Republic of China. This region is characterized  by a dry desertic environment quite similar in apparent ecology  to areas within the United States Great Basin. The team will  conduct systematic survey of several square kilometers, record  and map sites, make extensive surface collections and conduct  limited test excavations in a sample of spring mounds as well as  other likely localities. They will use these data to begin a  reconstruction of the culture history of the region and to  examine the changing pattern of human adaptation in relation to  environmental features. In particular they will focus on water  utilization.     Preliminary evidence indicates that the Pigeon Mountain Basin was  inhabited by hunter and gatherer groups at the end of the last  Ice Age and that at some later time a transition to agriculture  occurred. The team will examine changes in cultural adaptation  over this transition. Because one major goal of the research is  to compare adaptive patterns in desertic China and the Western  U.S., a Chinese archaeologist will also travel to the U.S. and  conduct field research in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in  Oregon and analyze the materials collected.    The goal of this work is to understand how humans at a relatively  simple level of technological development adapt to extreme  environmental conditions. A great deal of work has been conducted  in the Western U.S. and the culture history of this area is  reasonably well known. From these data archaeologists have  attempted to draw broad ranging conclusions about human  adaptation, but without at least one more case for comparison, it  is impossible to know whether conclusions from one region can be  generalized. The work planned by Dr. Elston and his colleagues  will help to answer this question. The research is als o important  because it will provide data of interest to many archaeologists  and because it will strengthen scientific ties between the PRC  and the U.S.",
