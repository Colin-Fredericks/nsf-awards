The vessel supports an  extensive undergraduate aquatic science education program, a newly  developed educational opportunity for prospective elementary school  teachers, and workshops for in-service teachers.  The D.J. ANGUS  also supports a major informal science education initiative  spanning much of the east shore of Lake Michigan.  The D.J. ANGUS  promotes both formal and informal science education through  investigative hands-on activities.  The vessel was intentionally  equipped with \"low tech\" instruments until the success of the  program was documented. During the 7 years of operation the program  has grown to a point of maximum capacity in which approximately  3,5OO participants are served each year. In addition to serving a  maximum number of participants, the program has spread from its  original location in Grand Haven, Michigan, to include many other  sites along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The increasing requests  for the program, plus the annual surveys of participants, indicate  that the program has achieved success at its current stage of  development and is now ready to proceed to the next level.  This  additional instrumentation provided by this award increases both  the formal and informal instructional capabilities of the vessel D.  J. ANGUS. This equipment increases the science content, improves  the experience, and expands the scope of the aquatic sciences  program.",
