 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an important process in the                  manufacture of microelectronic and optical devices.  It is                      used to deposit layers of epitaxial semiconductors, compound                    semiconductors, conductors, and insulators.  Although the                       thickness of the deposited film varies according to the                         application, the films must be produced with controllable                       properties (purity, composition, texture, thickness, etc.).                     The tolerance limits on the properties are very stringent in                    electronic and optical material processing.  As the devices                     become smaller in size, the requirements become even more                       stringent.  In particular, the uniformity of film thickness is                  critical in maintaining the same performance characteristics                    across each substrate and from sample to sample.  Because the                   film uniformity is governed by the access of the precursor                      gases to the substrate, a clear understanding of the governing                  transport processes is essential to achieve uniformity of the                   deposition thickness and composition over large areas.                                                                                                          The currently available three-dimensional computational models                  for CVD reactors are based on simplifications with regard to                    the transport processes and chemical kinetics and are of                        limited use.  The objective of this research is to develop a                    complete model based on the full three-dimensional unsteady                     form of the governing equations for CVD reactor flows.  Due to                  the use of efficient and accurate numerical procedures, the                     model will require only a few minutes to run a workstation.                     Therefore, the model can be used in a routine manner for                        design, research and optimization.  It will lead to better                      understanding of the transport phenomena and reactions in CVD                   processes and will aid in the design of reactors capable of                     producing uniform film thickness and composition over large                     areas.",
