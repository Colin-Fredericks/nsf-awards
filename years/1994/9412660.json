 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral  Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the determinants  of  the adoption by American corporations of specific programs to  reduce  the  conflict between work and family obligations.   Data  will  be  collected from existing reference sources  and  through  telephone interviews with corporate human resource departments in  order to carry out an event history analysis of the factors  that  trigger the establishment of corporate family programs.        As  the  proportion of married women in the work force  has  increased dramatically, the problems of juggling family and  work  obligations have increased.  Some corporations have responded  by  establishing on-site day care, flexible work schedules, and other  family  programs, while others have done very little along  these  lines.   There is a pressing need to understand what factors  are  most  likely  to  lead to the establishment of  corporate  family  programs, a need this project will help to fill.  In addition  to  the  scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this  award  will  materially assist a highly promising student in  completing  research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to  the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.",
