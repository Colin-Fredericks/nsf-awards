 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator examines the interplay between topology and  computation.  In particular, issues in robot motion planning and  computation with inexact data are studied in depth.  Robots  maneuver about in a configurations space of allowed  configurations.  The robot controller must have an internal model  of its configuration space.  As the robot learns more about the  external world, its configuration space will change.  Often these  changes are of a fundamentally topological nature: a new obstacle  appears; a new connection is found; a passage is too narrow to  enter.  Before one can design algorithms for robot motion, one  must understand these topological changes and the manner of their  occurrence.  Algorithms for problems of a topological nature will  also be studied.  Problems such as \"compute the degree of a map  from one manifold to another,\" or \"how many components are there  in the complement of a polyhedron?\" are of a fundamentally  topological type and of interest in the field of computer graphics  and combinatorial geometry.  These problems are well understood  from a theoretical and ideal perspective, but in practice there  are several difficulties.  Real world data comes with errors.  These errors raise such issues as, How do we model data with  errors? How does the presence of undetected errors affect the  reliability of the algorithm?  What is meant by general position  in the presence of errors?       Both robot motion planning and computational geometry with  real world data, and real world data comes with errors.  Operating  an exact, digital machine with vague and uncertain data in a  fundamental problem in robot control.  The word \"robot\" is used  here very generally.  It could be anything from a parts arranger  on an assembly line, to a mobile, self-contained exploratory  vehicle.  An understanding of the control issues dealt with in  this project would have myriad consequences in any industry using  such robots.  The robots would be more reliable, flexible, and  a utonomous.",
