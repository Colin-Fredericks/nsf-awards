 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program, continues research by Robert Parr in the related areas   of density functional theory (DFT), and the theoretical formulation of   Ralph Pearson's concept of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB).  In one   aspect of this work the Kohn-Sham orbitals are determined directly from a   given electron density.  A major goal is the development of an improved   exchange-correlation DFT functional.  To this end, a mathematical   analysis of analytic properties of local and non-local functionals, such   as cusp conditions and coordinate scaling conditions, will be carried   out.    Density functional theory provides an alternative to ab initio solution   of the Schroedinger equation for the computation of the electronic   structure of mater. The history of DFT dates back to work by Thomas,   Fermi, and Dirac in the 1920's in the earliest days of quantum theory.    In the past two decades, DFT calculations have been widely applied to   predict the electronic properties of  metals and other crystals, but only   in recent years have DFT calculations become sufficiently accurate to   permit general application to molecules.  This advance, made possible by   the development of new exchange-correlation functionals, reduces   computation time for large molecules by at least a factor of ten.  The   present project, with its emphasis on analysis of fundamental   mathematical aspects,  is just one of several ongoing research projects   which seek to develop even more accurate functionals.  Many scientists   anticipate that new DFT methods will one day replace the much more   expensive ab initio calculations in about 80% of all applications of   molecular quantum theory.  If true, this will constitute a major advance   in our ability to design new materials.",
