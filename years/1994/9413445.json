The research activity to be supported includes:             Yale Core Research             (i)     NMR in Highly Polarized Samples, Polyhydrides and Catalysts           (ii)    Structure Determination in Media with Magnetic Field Induced Order           (iii)   NMR Studies of the Structured of RNA and Protein-RNA Complexes           (iv)    Determination of the Structures of RNA's and Ribonucleoproteins by NMR           (v)     NMR Studies of Quinone Orientation in Biological Membranes           (vi)    A Comparison of Amorphous Alumina and Mesoporous Molecular Sieves             Research by Outside Users (Academic and Industrial)             (i)     Solids NMR Studies of Biological Systems Using a 750 MHz Spectrometer           (ii)    NMR Studies of DNA and Proteins           (iii)   Probing Structure in Low-Dimensional Conductors           (iv)    The Study of Acid and Basic Catalysts           (v)     Intermolecular Coherence Transfer           (vi)    Nucleophilic Substitution Mechanisms of Transition Metal Complexes in Zeolites           (vii)   High Field Optically Pumped NMR of Thin Film Materials      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
