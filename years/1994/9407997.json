 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407997  Wright    Because of the very large concentrations of salt in  seawater, marine animals live under constant salinity  stress. Marine invertebrates generally cope with this stress  by maintaining in their cells a combination of inorganic  solutes that together balance the large osmotic  concentration of full strength sea water. Estaurine  invertebrates face an added challenge. As a consequence of  the daily change in tides, the estaurine environment can  cyclically shift from full strength sea water to freshwater.  Animals living in the intertidal habitats can, therefore, be  exposed to changes in ambient osmolarity that can have a  profound impact on their physiology. In particular, when  exposed to reduced osmolarity (i.e., dilute sea water), the  cells and tissues of estaurine animals typically swell. It  is widely believed that the response of cells to this type  of stress includes a loss of solute that induces an  osmotically-obligated loss of water and hence a reduction in  volume back toward normal levels. Indeed, this has been  shown to be the case for many mammalian cells. For an  estaurine animal faced with large daily shifts in  osmolarity, any loss of solute must be met by an equal gain  in solute when the tide shifts and ambient osmolarity  returns to normal. Although these cyclic losses and gains of  cell solute could represent a substantial energy cost to the  animal, the actual extent of the energetic stress associated  with exposure to cycles is unknown. The present work will  examine the influence of cyclic changes in salinity on (i)  the extent of osmostically-induced changes in cell size;  (ii) the accompanying changes in cell solute concentration;  and (iii) the cellular mechanism of the regulatory response  to these changes. The experiments will focus on the response  to salinity stress of bivalve gills, a tissue uniquely  suited to measurement of cell volume using both direct  optical and direct radiotracer methods. This combination of  techniques will permit measu rement of the extent of volume  regulation in intact animals as well as in isolated tissues.  The results of the proposed studies will lead to the first  assessment of the impact of cell volume regulation on the  energy budget of an estaurine animal.",
