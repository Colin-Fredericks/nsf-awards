Theoretically, it can  integrate findings about motor performance from such fields as  experimental psychology, human factors, and neurophysiology.   Practically, it can benefit robotics, medicine, and the training of  perceptual-motor skills.  Despite the need for an understanding of  limb-movement control, little is currently known about how such  movements are chosen and performed by normal adult humans.  This  research project will help fill this void by extending and  evaluating Rosenbaum's recent model of motor control.  The aim of  the model is to describe the computations underlying the selection  of coordinated motion patterns among the limb segments, especially  in reaching tasks.    The central idea in the model is that there are stored posture  representations in human memory.   When a spatial target is  selected as an object to be reached, each stored posture is  evaluated for the contribution it can make to the task.  Weights  are assigned to the stored postures based on the evaluations they  receive, and a single target posture is found by taking a weighted  sum of the stored postures (using their weights and treating the  postures as vectors in joint space).  Movement occurs from the  starting posture to the target posture by reducing the distance  between the starting angle and target angle of each joint.  The  model allows for the selection of movements when infinitely many  movements permit an object to be reached, it explains how joints  can compensate automatically for reduced mobility of other joints,  and it accounts for a large number of facts concerning practice,  speed-accuracy tradeoffs, performance errors, and movement  kinematics.    The research will evaluate and extend the model through further  computational work and behavioral experiments.  The computational  work will examine such issues as the use of more joints and joints  other than tho se that have been modelled so far, the hierarchical  versus nonhierarchical nature of posture space, the necessity for  evaluating all stored postures, and obstacle avoidance.  The  behavioral experiments will test predictions of the model and  provide data about human reaching that can inform the model's  future development.    ***",
