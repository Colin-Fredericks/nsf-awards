This is accomplished by acquiring a developed  and proven computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM)  hardware/software package which can be directly incorporated into  the two-semester capstone aircraft design sequence in the Aerospace  Engineering program.  Initially, this system is being employed for  manufacturing wind tunnel models in the Aircraft Preliminary Design  course and for designing, analyzing, and manufacturing proof-of-  concept structural components in the Aircraft Detail Design course.  Solid modeling and rapid prototyping employing stereolithography  have been successfully introduced and DFM/CADAM is the next logical  step.  This exposure demonstrates one of the ways that increased  attention to the practical realities of modern manufacturing within  engineering education can assist in making industry more efficient  and productive.",
