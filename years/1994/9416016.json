The  molecular mechanism that mediates this depolarization is  unknown although there is evidence that the plasma membrane  H+-ATPase is inhibited and anion channels are activated.  The proposed work is an electrophysiological investigation  of the changes in ion transport at the plasma membrane that  participate in the transduction of blue light into growth  inhibition.  The growing cells of etiolated Arabidopsis  hypocotyls will be studied with the patch clamp technique to  characterize the ion channels that undergo a change in  activity after a pulse of blue light.  The participation of  anion-selective channels will be given particular attention.  The effect of blue light on the activity of the H+-ATPase  will be determined both electrophysiologically and  biochemically.  Mutants in Arabidopsis that do not display  blue-light inhibited growth will be studied in addition to  the wild-type.  Well defined energies and wavelengths of  blue light will be used to construct fluence rate response  curves for the magnitudes and kinetics of the electrical  responses of the different genotypes.  At least one double  mutant, blu1 hy4, will be constructed and similarly studied.  The results will demonstrate if and how the genetic lesions  affect these early blue-light induced changes in membrane  transport.  This combination of electrophysiology,  biochemistry and genetics is expected to reveal some  important features of a transduction chain that links blue-  light receptors to a growth control mechanism.  %%%  Seedlings grown in the dark undergo a suite of developmental  changes upon illumination, resulting in a green plant that  is competent to perform photosynthesis.  One aspects of this  important developmental process is the inhibition of stem  elongation by bright blue light .  A pulse of blue light  inhibits stem  growth after a few seconds.  This means a  receptor that absorbs blue light is closely connected to a  mechanism that controls the growth rate of the stem.  The  events that occur between the activation of the blue light  receptor and the beginning of the growth response  are said  to transduce the blue light into growth inhibition.  Collectively these events are called a transduction chain.  All that is currently known about this transduction chain is  that the transport across the cells outer membrane of ions  is altered just before the growth rate slows.  The proposed  work is focused on elucidating at the molecular level the  details of how blue light alters the activities of ion pumps  and channels in the membrane and how this then affects the  seedlings growth rate .  The electrophysiological technique  of patch clamping will be used for many of the experiments,  all of which will be performed on the Arabidopsis plant   In  addition, genetic techniques to take advantage of the  existence of mutants in Arabidopsis which do not display  blue light inhibited growth will be sued, as will some  biochemical techniques.  Taken together, these experiments  will reveal certain aspects of how light controls plant  growth and development and how ion channels and pumps  participate in the transduction of environmental signals.  ***",
