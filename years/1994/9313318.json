Current techniques to measure process  stream temperatures during a typical manufacturing operation (in  both industrial and academic settings) are either ignored, misused,  or highly deficient, and there is a great need to advance the  science and technology behind the in situ measurement of an  important process stream variable such as the polymer temperature.   In terms of the manufacturing process, temperature is the most  important process parameter as it directly influences the  processability, properties, and performance of the plastic product.   A primary objective of the research work is to develop a reliable  methodology for applying infrared pyrometers to the measurement of  polymer temperature during the manufacture of plastics resins and  plastic articles, whereby such a measurement could then be used to  optimize the manufacturing operation.  The methodology will provide  for an non-invasive procedure to obtain bulk temperature  information as well as detailed temperature information about the  process stream.  Several key advantages that IR pyrometers have  over conventional thermometry techniques are:  response times on  the order of milliseconds, capacity for in situ real-time  measurements, and potential for detecting subsurface temperatures  in a non-invasive fashion.  The research plan will utilize  commercially available instrumentation installed on an injection  molding machine, an extruder, and in a calibration apparatus so  that data will be collected and analyzed data from both complex and  controlled temperature environments.  Collaborations with  industrial partners will provide a forum for where and how the  findings can be applied to the optimization of plastics processing  and manufacturing.       The research project may lead to improved control of polymer  processes, such as injection molding and  extrusion, which will  allow high quality, faster processing and more predictable  properties for the products of these processes.",
