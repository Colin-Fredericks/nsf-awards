 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410859    Kon       The investigator and his colleagues study wavelets and their  applications to neural network theory and processing of visual  images.   It has been shown recently that wavelets are useful as  activation functions in neural networks, permitting faster  adaptation to required tasks than do sigmoidal activation  functions, in common use up to now.  The success of wavelet  methods has already been impressively demonstrated in important  optimization problems using radial basis functions.  The work of  this project develops better theoretical underpinnings for the  construction of neural nets that learn efficiently, and studies  minimal complexities of neural nets that emulate \"intelligent\"  tasks, e.g., recognition of visual images.  The investigators  also  study the construction of wavelet-based algorithms for image  compression.  They examine the optimization of signal  compression,  aiming at an improved theoretical understanding of how such  signal  compression works from the standpoint of the mapping between  functions and their wavelet transforms.       Applications of the mathematics proposed here are closely  related to the creation of \"intelligent\" systems using neural  network technology.  This technology in many ways emulates the  operation of biological nervous systems.  The present work is  based on indications that the actions of biological neurons have  in some cases been too well emulated in artificial neural  systems.  It has been shown in the work of Girosi and Poggio and others  that  attaining desired behavior in neural networks can be better  achieved with networks that have \"localized activation  functions,\"  i.e., ones for which output eventually decreases with very large  inputs.  An additional issue related to effecting proper  input-output behavior using neural networks is knowledge of the  basic complexity of certain desired tasks, and how neural  networks  can best achieve this level of complexity.  Such tasks (e.g., the  visual recognition of object s) can already be performed by  biological neural networks, and have a complexity that can be  defined and studied in a relatively precise way, to determine how  complicated artificial neural networks need to be in order to  emulate the behaviors of the biological networks.  In addition,  the work on signal compression using wavelets has a two-fold  impact.  The first involves the improvement of techniques for  compression, e.g., storage of large quantities of video, audio or  other data on compact media (such as compact discs, hard disks,  or  random access memory).  The second is related to the fact that if  such data are compressed to smaller sizes, certain kinds of  information may be extracted from them more easily.  For example,  it is easier to find evidence of an irregular heartbeat (or  precursors to arhythmia) using a computer if the cardiological  data have been compressed in a way that allows them to be more  easily manipulated.  These and other applications have made the  data compression issues that are studied here an area with high  priority in mathematical signal processing.",
