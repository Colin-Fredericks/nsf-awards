 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320062  Plous  Animal research has played a central role in psychology, yet its  applied value and ethical propriety has recently come under attack.   The purpose of the present proposal is to conduct a large-scale  survey of professional and student opinion concerning the use of  animals in psychological research and education.  The investigation  will focus mainly on the following six questions:  (1)  How  widespread is support for animal research within the professional  community?  (2)  How strongly do psychology students support animal  research?  (3)  Which findings from animal research are seen as  most useful?  (4)  What objections are most common among critics of  animal experimentation?  (5)  Does support for animal research  differ among demographic subpopulations?  (6)  Do students and  faculty support the use of animals in education?  The primary  research approach will be to survey 5000 randomly selected  psychologists from the American Psychological Association, as well  as 2000 students drawn from a national sample of colleges and  universities.  Results from this survey are intended to illuminate  several questions critical to the infrastructure of science and  education within psychology, including questions of funding,  research priorities, government and institutional regulations,  ideal curricula, and differences in opinion between students and  psychology faculty.  Results will be reported at meetings and in  appropriate professional journals.  ***",
