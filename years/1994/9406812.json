The  parameters of emphasis are the electrical resistivity and the  thermoelectric power, since these can be compared rather easily  with theoretical calculations, and will therefore provide a good  test of theory.  The systems under study include the liquid  semimetallic alloys aluminum-calcium and aluminum-barium, the pure  liquid metals silicon and germanium, three of the liquid heavy  trivalent rare-earth metals, and the unusual \"heavy Fermion  system\", cesium-copper, in liquid form.  These studies will further  the understanding of these interesting classes of liquids, and may  also uncover materials of interest for thermoelectric power  generation.    Non-technical abstract:  It is proposed to measure the electronic  properties of conducting liquids:  liquid metals, liquid alloys,  liquid semimetals and liquid semiconductors.  In each of the  systems to be studied, the interaction between the conducting  electrons and the liquid ions is strong, making these properties  more difficult to understand theoretically.  It is anticipated that  these experimental studies will provide strong tests of the current  theories; an evaluation of the properties for possible applications  in thermoelectric power generation will also be made.  ***",
