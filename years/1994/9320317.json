The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular: (1) Nonlinear Digital Video Signal Processing, (2) Joint Source-Channel Coding for Video Transmission, (3) Video Transmission over High Speed Computer Networks, and (4) Transport Network Protocols for Video in Multi-media Applications.      Digital video will be playing an important role in consumer electronics opening new application areas by exploiting the technologies of communications and computer networks.  The research will accomplish several goals.  Firstly, new nonlinear algorithms will be developed for the filtering, interpolation, format conversion, multi-resolution representation, and prediction of video processes needed in high-definition television and in its interaction with existing video systems.  The need of nonlinear signal processing arises since linear signal processing techniques are known to blur image and video details inhibiting the main goal of digital video -- high resolution.  Secondly, joint source channel coding schemes will be developed for robust video delivery.  Digital transmission systems suffer from a threshold effect in signal quality, while broadcast systems that cater to the most distant user are inefficient.  The goal is to design efficient video transmission schemes with a graceful degradation in performance.  Thirdly, the work on the interface and communications aspects of digital video over computer networks wi ll be emphasized, in particular, the research focus will be on  two important problems: packet loss and buffer overflows and underflows. Both these problems result in degradation of video quality.  This research will assess this loss in quality and design algorithms to minimize this loss. Finally, in order to handle video data streams more efficiently, new transport network protocols which are compatible with standard network software will be developed.   ***             video equipment which will be dedicated to support res                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      $         $         $              G                             ?             ?
