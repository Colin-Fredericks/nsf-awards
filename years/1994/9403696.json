 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal #94-03696    The Oceanographic Instrumentation program funds the acquisition of shared-used scientific instrumentation aboard research vessels and other oceanographic facilities that are primarily used by NSF-funded investigators.  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) provides funding for instrumentation upgrades for the submersible ALVIN which is owned by the Navy and operated by WHOI in support of oceanographic research.  Funding for operation of the ALVIN is supported by NSF, NOAA and ONR.    Instrumentation to be acquired or upgraded includes a new 3-chip CCD camera and a new 1-chip CCD camera, HMI and Quartz-iodide lighting systems, a laser ranging system, an EXACT high precision navigation system, computer upgrades for improved post-dive data processing, and new video recording equipment in order to record data from all camera systems and provide more efficient post-processing of video data.  In addition, the award provides funding for the PI to develop specifications and seek bids for an improved long-baseline navigation package for the ALVIN. Additional funding will be considered for the long-baseline navigation system if the PI is able to find a commercially available system.      Joint funding for this award is being provided by the NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation program, the NSF Biological Oceanography Program and NOAA.  ONR participated in the review process and may provide funding to support any future acquisition of a long-baseline navigation system if a suitable system is found.",
