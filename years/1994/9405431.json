 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405431  Xue    The climate in the Sahel area of Africa has been dominated by  drought since the late 1960's.  A number of studies have shown that  the land surface-atmosphere interaction in the sub-Sahara region is  very strong and that the land surface feedback may have played a  role in the Sahel drought.  However, in most of these studies only  simple surface models were used and the results were never verified  against observational data.  Two comprehensive surface field  measurements (HAPEX-Sahel and SEBEX)  were conducted in the Sahel  during the past five years.  These data sets will be used to  validate a simplified version of the Simple Biosphere Model (SSiB)  and to create vegetation data sets for GCM boundary conditions.  In  the calibration study, special attention will be given to the  realistic simulation of co-existing vegetation covers, which is one  of the manifestations of surface heterogeneity.  The sensitivity of  the land-surface scheme to vegetation and soil parameter values  will be investigated.  This calibration will help us to improve the  simulation of the hydrological cycle  and the surface energy  budget.   The coupled biosphere-atmosphere model will be used to study the  roles of the surface processes and atmospheric dynamics in  determining the variation in the climate and hydrology of the  Sahel.  To understand the mechanisms of land surface feedback, we  will divide the vegetation and soil parameters into several groups.   The effects of each group and their combination on the simulated  climate anomaly in the Sahel will be examined.    The effect of heterogeneity will also be investigated.  Based on  the results of the above proposed studies, two multi-year numerical  integrations will be conducted.  The long term integration will  allow more stringent statistical significance testing of the  results.  The results from the control run will be used to analyze   The simulation of the annual cycle of water and energy balances in  the sub-Sahara area.  the anomaly  run, in which the land surface in  the Sahel is assigned as a desertification area, will be used to  assess the effects of the desertification on the regional and  global climate and hydrology during  all seasons.  Since this July  25, 1994 sensitivity study is based upon comprehensive  observational  data, its successful completion will help us in  realistically assessing the consequences of the desertification in  the regional as well as the global climate, in particular the Sahel  drought.",
