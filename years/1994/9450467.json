Specifically, the proposed program will serve 48 underrepresented  minority middle school students per year for three years and will  consist of three components:  1) A four-week summer residential  program at CSUR; 2) Academic year follow-up; and 3) Project  assessment and evaluation of both the summer program and academic  year follow-up activities.  This is the second submission of this  proposal.  Suggestions made by the reviewers for enhancing the  proposal have been carefully considered and the proposal has been  revised to reflect their comments.  The summer program will provide  students experience in the following areas: 1) Integrated  coursework in algebra and geometry; 2) Engineering concepts and  laboratory activities; 3) Computer literacy; 4) Computer aided  design; 5) Refinement/development of oral and written communication  skills; and 60 Career exploration.    The successful implementation of integrated math, science, and  laboratory experiences will be assured through the use of  Mathematics Applications Curriculum for Science, Engineering and  Technology (MACSET) activities.  These unique hands-on experiences  approach problem solving using practical applications found in  everyday life, such as electrical appliances.  The academic year  follow-up activities will be directly linked with the proven CSUF  Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) Program.  MESA  is a statewide program that addresses the need to increase the  number of underrepresented minorities pursuing college degrees in  math, engineering and science.  The CSUF MESA Program has several  components already in place that will provide academic year support  to summer program participants.  These areas in clude:  1) In-school  MESA clubs; 2) Saturday Academies; 3) Academic advising; 4) Career  speakers, mentoring, and role models; and 5) Field trips to  industry and universities.  ***",
