 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451475  Chandrasekhar  The University of Missouri will add modern spectroscopy experiments  to the Optics Laboratory for the upper division Light and Modern  Optics course. The equipment will also be used for demonstration  purposes in Modern Physics and for Undergraduate Research. Atomic  Molecular and Solid State Spectra will be studied.  Two modern  spectrometers will be set up to perform Raman and  fluorescence/photoluminescence studies at room and low  temperatures. The spectrometers will be set up so that the four  experiments can be performed with minimal or no change in the  alignment. This feature is critical in a limited time laboratory  class.  A Fabry Perot triple pass interferometer which lacks a few  components will be completed and will be used to perform Brillouin  scattering and laser mode studies.  A Fourier transform  spectrometer will be set up to study the vibrational modes in  liquids and solids, and will be a complementary tool to the Raman  and Fabry Perot spectrometers.  All the above instruments will be  computer controlled. At present our Optics laboratory lacks all of  the above instruments, and we are able only to perform experiments  where data is taken manually, so that intensity measurements and  comparison with theory is not possible. The instrumentation above  will provide a closer link between the theory studied in class and  the experiments done in the lab.",
