 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321548  BUSS  The webs woven by orb-web spiders can be viewed as silken lines that record a series of spider movements.  Thus webs, which persist, have been a classic system for studies of behavior and the inheritance of particular patterns of web weaving.  However, a controversy still exists about whether all the orb-weavers are related in a single lineage or whether there are two lineages exhibiting this basic behavior with numerous modifications and losses within each.  This project will use DNA sequencing to address the relationships of orb-web spiders that have previously been based solely on morphological and behavioral evidence.  The resulting molecular based phylogeny or pattern of relationships can then be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin and diversification of web design.  %%%  Knowledge of spider relationships may be clarified by this project.  This information can be of value in conservation of biodiversity as well as in designing programs for natural control of pest insects with diminished use of pesticides.  ***",
