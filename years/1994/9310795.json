It involves   philosophic and scientific examination of the desirability of  various carcinogen identification procedures.  The focus of the  project is on substances that have been introduced into commerce as  products or into the environment as by-products of production  without having been subjected to extensive toxicity testing, where  a governmental burden of proof must be satisfied before they could  be removed from commerce.  The desirability of imperfect  institutional procedures for identifying carcinogens is a complex  function of their accuracy, their rate, their costs, and the social  costs of evidentiary mistakes.  The philosophical research in the  project will assess the social costs of mistakes and their relative  importance and develop a philosophic rationale and a model to  assess the desirability of different procedures.  The investigation  will consider ways to vary relevant parameters so as to  contextualize the ethical questions.  For instance, costs of  mistakes may be a function of size of exposed population, its age,  or whether it can consent to the risk.  Costs may include social as  well as biological costs, factors such as perceptions of risk and  social distrust.  Scientific research, augmenting the  philosophical, will evaluate the accuracy, rate, and costs of the  identification procedures, and will be incorporated into the  overall evaluation and model.  It will use identified carcinogens  as a reference class, comparing standard hazard identification  procedures with alternatives that are being currently used,  developed, or considered.  Results from the research will be  published in journals and reported at conferences and professional  meetings.  ***",
