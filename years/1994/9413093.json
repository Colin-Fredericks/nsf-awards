The goals include helping defense firms understand the opportunities for diversification, and assisting a limited number of firms to actually embark on a business course of diversification. Some of these firms will be incorporated into an on-site incubator.  This project will be coordinated closely with the National Institutes of Health, the Colorado Advanced Technology Institute, and the Colorado research universities.  It will build on established relationships with a number of target companies, including Martin Marietta.  ***The objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated, national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable, military systems and the most competitive commercial products.  TRP programs are structured to expand high quality employment opportunities in commercial  and dual-use US. industries and demonstrably enhance US. competitiveness.  This is accomplished through the application of defense and commercial resources to develop dual-use technologies, manufacturing and technology assistance to small firms, and education and training programs that enhance US. manufacturing skills and target displaced defense industry workers.  This specific project will enable a number of defense-based companies in Colorado to enter the biomedical product arena, thereby allowing them to diversify their product base into the non-defense  sector.***",
