The project aims to conduct atomistic studies of  grain boundaries and interphases and interaction of these  interfaces with point defects.    The researchers will carry out calculations for model hcp, bcc,  and hcp/bcc systems using empirical many-body potentials of the  EAM type.  The construction of these potentials is an integral  part of the proposed research.  The principal goal is to analyze  differences between grain and interphase boundaries, particularly  with respect to the atomic transport in these interfaces.  The  interphases studied will be chosen so that they emulate as  closely as possible the interphases in Zr/Zr-Nb systems which  have been extensively studied at CNEA.  The Argentine group will  conduct the computer simulations and develop or select of the  interatomic potentials.  The U.S. side will provide the computer  codes for the atomistic modelling of grain boundaries and the  graphical programs necessary to interpret atomistic calculations.   Both sides will benefit from collaboration on the interpretation  and analysis of data, encompassing the construction of  interatomic potentials and their testing and the computer  modeling of interfaces.  ***",
