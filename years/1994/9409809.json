 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines problems in circuit complexity,  using classical analytic methods.  The project is centered  around three basic  questions, the first and last of which  are specifically geared towards basic,  long-unresolved  issues that have hindered progress in the area.  (1) Do simple  operations (such as shifts, or products) on hard functions preserve hardness?  (3) In what ways can hardness be used for learning functions in a complexity  class? (2) What are the analytic properties that are common to  constant depth  circuits with various sets of symmetric gates?   Already partial answers have  yielded the following:  (a) a non-trivial, complexity bounds   involving constant depth circuits and more significantly,   the analytic patterns underlying such  bounds; (b) general methods for using hard functions to obtain   large classes of pseudorandom generators and training sets   for learning; and (c) conversion of  lower bounds on circuit complexity into upper bounds on the complexity of  learning, and vice versa.  The analytic techniques used, are partly  multivariate generalizations of univariate approximation methods, partly from  coding theory  and partly from spectral analysis.  The techniques   developed are of independent interest to approximation theorists, and   solve, in particular, a number of problems involving general Boolean  functions, and combinatorics over the multidimensional unit-cube.",
