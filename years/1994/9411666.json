 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411666  Wenk    This US-Poland Research project between Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wenk of  the University of California-Berkeley, and Dr. Jan Pospiech of  the Krupowski Institute for Metals Research of the Polish Academy  of Sciences, is a \"Texture Analysis with Discrete Methods.\"   Interdisciplinary research between PAN Krakow and UC Berkeley  coordinated efforts to obtain quantitative information of  orientation characteristics of polycrystalline materials,  particularly those with low crystal and sample symmetry which are  not only typical in geology but in ceramics and polymer science  as well.  They showed that discrete methods have distinct  advantages to obtain the orientation distribution (OD) from a  minimum amount of experimental pole figure data.  Discrete  methods are also useful to obtain misorientation functions (MOD)  and other orientation characteristics describing correlations  between orientations.  This has been illustrated for copper,  quartz and calcite.  The researchers now propose to conclude this  project by generalizing computer programs for analysis of  individual orientation measurements and adding elements of the  component method for compact representation of texture data, all  using a discrete approach rather than the harmonic method which  easily introduces artifacts.  Programs will be made available to  the texture communities for testing and application to benefit a  larger constituency than the laboratories of the principal  investigators.     This project in geological sciences fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in Poland and the United States to combine complementary  talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  ***",
