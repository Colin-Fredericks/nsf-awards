 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402101   Lindeman  The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS) on  behalf of its member institutions, is encouraging participation  in the data network for all higher education institutions in  Indiana and their constituents, including public libraries,  hospitals, governmental agencies, extension centers, and  businesses with research and educational needs for connectivity.  Additionally, IHETS is working with the Indiana Department of  Education to provide experimentation opportunities for schools  via linkage with the Department's dial-access system, IDEAnet.    This proposal requests partial funding for participation in  NSFNET through a connection with CICNET, the regional network  attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as partial start-  up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating  support to facilitate the fullest possible participation.  The  educational institutions that will participate include: Indiana  Institute of Technology, Oakland City College, Vincennes  University Technology Center, and the Allen County Public  Library.    The network initially consists of a redundant T1 backbone linking  nodes at four of the larger campuses, 56 kbs DDS end nodes, and  connection to CICNET and NSFNET via Indiana University.  Phase 3  will extend to the new component of IHETS formed in 1992, the  Partnership for Statewide Education.  The new component of IHETS  will be critical in assuring that students enrolled in all  courses have access to information resources and student services  approximately those commonly available to their peers at  traditional campuses.    The Allen County public Library will serve as a model and test  site for various forms of connectivity for public libraries.",
