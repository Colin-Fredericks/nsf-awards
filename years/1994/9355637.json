 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355637  Hanson    The Children's Museum is requesting $910,088 from the National  Science Foundation to create an exhibition to go in an Urban  Environmental Center to be built on a barge anchored in Fort Point  Channel, a 500-foot-wide Boston Harbor waterway in front of the  Museum.  Our goal is to create exhibits which broaden public access  to the process of science while extending each person's awareness  of an engagement in this particular waterfront environment.    Barge exhibits are focused on water, which has universal appeal to  children and is the central feature of our location; atmosphere --  birds, sun, solar radiation, shadow, light refraction and  diffraction, heat, wind, and clouds; built environment --  architecture, engineering, buildings, technology -- and their  relationship to living things.  We will provide a wide menu of  entry-level approaches to the environment that are not given in  school.  The exhibits will take a visitor from where s/he is at the  beginning of the visit to a new level of curiosity and concern.    Through observation and direct experimentation, children will see  what varies with the tides, what flows into the Channel from street  run-off, where different creatures nest, what is emitted into the  atmosphere from cars and buildings, and many other things.  Some  exhibits invite a playful experience, involving the senses and  whole body; others offer a more focused exploration to uncover  principles of a phenomenon.  All encourage practice in such  scientific processes as observing, collecting, recording, and  comparing data.",
