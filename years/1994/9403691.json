The physical motivation for  much of the analysis arises from problems in theoretical chemistry.  Over the past five years experimental techniques have been developed  in chemistry to the point where real time dynamical data related to  molecular interactions and dynamics can be obtained, which has  resulted in the area of research known as  ``femtochemistry''.  As a  result, we are at a point where dynamical systems research can play a  role in the interpretation of this new experimental data.  Many of the  questions of interest are global and geometrical in nature.  For  example, answers to questions related to intramolecular and  intermolecular energy transfer depend on the geometry and dynamics  associated with surfaces of various dimensions and shapes in phase  space.  There is a need for applied mathematical research in this area  since most of the work of theoretical chemists in this area has been  carried out with low dimensional models.  Since most realistic models  of molecules are higher dimensional, it is important to develop  mathematical techniques that apply to high dimensional systems as well  as understand higher dimensional dynamical phenomena in general. One  result of this research will be the development of mathematical  methods for understanding intramolecular and intermolecular energy  transfer in more realistic molecular systems.

Over the past 5 years experimental techniques have been developed in  chemistry to the point where real time dynamical data related to  molecular interactions and dynamics can be obtained, which has  resulted in the area of research known as  ``femtochemistry''.  As a  result, we are at a point w here dynamical systems research can play a  role in the interpretation of this new experimental data.  Many of the  questions of interest are global and geometrical in nature.  For  example, answers to questions related to intramolecular and  intermolecular energy transfer depend on the geometry and dynamics  associated with invariant manifolds that arise near resonances in  phase space, and these invariant manifolds form the ``network'' in  phase space which governs energy transfer issues.  Near such regions  the invariant manifold geometry is much more complicated than the  standard ``invariant tori'' picture and new methods need to be  developed. Also, one often encounters singular perturbation phenomena  near such resonance regions which forces one to treat ``elliptic'' and  ``hyperbolic'' phenomena simultaneously.  One promising method for  such problems is the so-called ``energy-phase'' method developed by  Haller and Wiggins, largely in the context of two-degree-of-freedom  systems, which enables one to join together the ``elliptic'' and  ``hyperbolic''  phenomena that arises near resonances. We will extend  this method to multi-degree-of-freedom systems.  At the same time we  will be interested in understanding mechanisms that give rise to  complicated ``chaotic'' behavior that are ``intrinsically high  dimensional'', i.e. behavior that is not just a ``scaled up''  version  of typical low dimensional behavior.  One result of this research will  be the development of mathematical methods for understanding  intramolecular and intermolecular energy transfer in more realistic  molecular systems.",
