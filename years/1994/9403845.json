 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hamers  The use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study chemical  reactions has been hampered by the inability to a priori identify  adsorbed molecules and molecular fragments.  The goal of this work  is to overcome this limitation by first studying a homologous  series of unsaturated hydrocarbons, their decomposition products,  and some functionalized derivatives of these molecules to develop  an empirical basis set for molecular identification, and then  applying this knowledge to study the reaction chemistry of these  hydrocarbons on surfaces of Pd, platinum, and nickel both in the  absence and in the presence of \"modifiers\" such as sulfur,  chlorine, and silicon.  Studies will be performed using a unique  scanning tunneling microscope system which can image surfaces at 77  Kelvin in ultrahigh vacuum, in conjunction with other techniques  including infrared spectroscopy, Auger, and low-energy electron  diffraction.  STM will be used to provide atomic-resolution  analysis of the identity and spatial location of molecules and  molecular fragments and to directly observe the influence of steps,  defects, and chemical inhomogeneities on the reactions of small  unsaturated hydrocarbons on metal surfaces, while FTIR will provide  information on the chemical functionalities present on the surface.  A statistical analysis of this spatial information will be used to  quantitatively describe the surface lateral chemical composition  and to identify spatial correlations between the positions of  various surface species.  By studying the adsorption and  decomposition of small hydrocarbons on metals, the adsorption of  chemical modifiers, and co-adsorption of molecules in the presence  of modifiers, we will achieve new insight into the nature of  heterogeneous catalysis at transition metal surfaces.   %%%  The explosive growth of scanning tunneling microscopy as an  atomic-resolution tool for probing the geometry and electronic  properties of surfaces brings with it exciting new opportunities to   probe materials chemistry at the atomic level.  However, the use of  STM to study chemical reactions has been hampered by the inability  to a priori identify adsorbed molecules and molecular fragments.  The goal of this work is to overcome this limitation by first  studying a homologous series of unsaturated hydrocarbons, their  decomposition products, and some functionalized derivatives of  these molecules to develop an empirical basis set for molecular  identification, and then applying this knowledge to study the  reaction chemistry of these hydrocarbons on surfaces of Pd,  platinum, and nickel both in the absence and in the presence of  \"modifiers\" such as sulfur, chlorine, and silicon.  These studies  will provide a fundamental basis of knowledge about the appearance  of various molecular fragments in the STM which can then be applied  to study the reaction chemistry of a wide range of molecular  functionalities, and will provide insight into how promoters and  poisons modify the reactivity of metals toward hydrocarbon species.",
