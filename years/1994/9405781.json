 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chen  9405781  The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of  regulation of heme-regulated eIF-2a kinase (HRI) at the molecular  structural level.  HRI is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis.   It is activated in heme-deficiency of reticulocytes.  HRI is  expressed in erythroid cells and the physiological role of HRI is  to maintain the balanced synthesis of heme and globin chains.  The  specific aims are (1) Regulation of HRI by phosphorylation; (2)  Molecular mechanisms in the regulation of HRI by heme; (3)  Determination of HRI structure by X-ray crystallography.  The methods to be employed are recombinant DNA techniques,  polymerase chain reaction, synthesis of oligodeoxynucleodtides,  high pressure liquid chromatography, amino acid microsequencing, in  vitro transcription and translation, protein kinase assays, gel  electrophoresis, deoxynucleotide sequencing, expression of HRI and  other proteins using recombinant baculovirus, immunoprecipitation,  Western Blot analysis, and x-ray crstallography.  HRI is a key regulator of protein synthesis, a process which is  essential for the regulation of cellular processes.  %%%  Protein synthesis is vital for cell growth, differentiation, viral  infection, and stress responses.  Regulation of protein synthesis  by the phosphorylation of the a-subunit of eukaryotic initiation  factor 2 (eIF-2a) is employed by a variety of cells under these  conditions.  Phosphorylation of eIF-2a results in the inhibition of  protein synthesis globally.  Two distinct eIF-2a kinases, which  phosphorylate specifically the eIF-2a in mammalian cells, have been  identified and molecularly cloned.  The double-stranded RNA  dependent eIF-2a kinase is induced by interferon and its activity  is regulated by double-stranded RNA which is often introduced by  viral infections.  The heme-regulated eIF-2a kinase (HRI) is  activated in heme-deficiency of immature erythroid cells and its  activity is inhibited by heme.  Our recent studies indicate that  HRI is p resent in erythroid cells only.  Since heme is the  prothetic group of hemoglobin which is the principal protein in  erythroid cells, the major physiological role of HRI is in the  regulation of balanced synthesis of heme and hemoglobin which  carries oxygens in our blood stream.  This research project is focused on the structure and function  study of HRI.  We will study the molecular mechanism of regulation  of HRI by heme and identify the heme-binding domain of HRI.  Since  activation of HRI is accompanied by the phosphorylation of HRI,  regulation of HRI by phosphorylation will also be studied.  For a  more detailed understanding of the regulation of HRI, it is  essential to obtain the overall structure of this kinase by X-ray  crystallography.  The crystal structure of HRI is not only  important for our understanding of protein kinases, but also  important for the understanding of heme-binding to enzymes.  Since  regulation of protein synthesis is closely related to oncogenic  transformation, further structure-function study of HRI should  advance our understanding of protein phosphorylation in the  regulation of cellular processes, in particular cell growth and  differentiation.",
