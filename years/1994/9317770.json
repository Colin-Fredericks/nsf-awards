Coppens of the State University of  New York at Buffalo will engage in crystallographic research  using the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven  National Laboratory and also perform experiments using advanced  conventional facilities.  The research consists of several  parts: application of anomalous scattering of X-rays to  selectively identify site ocupancy, to determine the oxidation  states of atoms in solids and to identify spectroscopic  transitions; to study the response of crystals to external  perturbations, such as laser-induced molecular excitation; and  the analysis of modulated and composite solids, which are  aperiodic in at least one direction.  Very low temperature  single crystal techniques are to be used in the analysis of  charge densities in crystals, and in the investigation of the  temperature-dependence of the structure of low-dimensional  conducting solids.  Area detectors are to be applied to charge  density studies and other fields after new software development  aimed at maximizing accuracy of the area-detector intensity  data.    X-ray diffraction by single crystals has been used for many  years to study the structure of organic and inorganic  materials.  The conventional techniques are based on the use of  x-ray tubes, which emit monochromatic radiation of relatively  low intensity, thereby limiting their use to large size  crystals and strong scatterers.  X-radiation emitted by  synchrotrons has a continuous range of wavelengths, a low  spatial divergence, is polarized, and is much brighter than the  radiation emitted from conventional x-ray tubes.  These  properties allow the determination of the structures of very  small crystals, not heretofore possible with conventional  techniques, in a much shorter time and with greater accuracy.  The new methods are, however, partly still in the development  stage.  The research to be done in this project i s directed  toward improvement of the new technique and the solution of new  crystallographic problems in physics and materials science.  ***",
