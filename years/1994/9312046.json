During a seven month visit Professor Granick will conduct research on the viscoelastic effects on polymer phase separation processes specifically on the nucleation and growth mechanism.   Recent work in solutions has concerned a single polymer system, polystyrene in dioctylphthalate (DOP) in which the scattering effects are large.  In such phenomena, not enough attention has been paid to the possible importance of nucleation.  Little is known about systems away from the critical composition.  The researchers will undertake joint measurement of turbidity and viscoelastic effects at various hydrostatic pressures.  This will involve investigation of polymer polymer shear induced demixing under extremely well defined conditions of shear rate, pressure, and polymer microstructure.    Results of the research are expected to lay the groundwork for new directions in nonequilibrium structure and phases of liquids research.  It will also contribute to a greatly expanded teaching curriculum.  Professor Granick is a leading researcher in the area of dynamics of macromolecules on surfaces.  Professor Hashimato has a reputation as being one of the best experimental polymer scientist s in Japan and has also developed a worldwide reputation in his area.  Professor Hashimoto has spent many years developing the unique specialized equipment that will be used in the research.  It is the intent of the researchers that they will continue their collaboration for many years through the exchange of graduate students in each other's laboratories.  This project is supported by the NSF CGP (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program.                         h)          0*0*0*",
