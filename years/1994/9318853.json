 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study of molecules adsorbed on a solid surface is supported by the   NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program.  The molecule-phonon   interaction is treated quantum mechanically using a Hamiltonian operator   that can include multiple phonons, as well as the hindered translational,   rotational, and vibrational modes of the molecule, and all possible   interactions of these degrees of freedom.  Both weak (one phonon) and   strong (multi-phonon) interactions can be described.  The nature of the   trapped state with regard to desorption, relaxation, and hot atom   chemistry is treated.  The effect of varying the component of beam energy   parallel to the surface is also studied.    Computer models are used in this research to study the motion of   molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces.  The goal is to gain fundamental   knowledge of the principles of surface chemistry, which in turn relates   to chemical processes of great practical importance such as heterogeneous   catalysis.  Computer modeling is a widely used theoretical tool for the   study of such processes.  The special role of this research project is to   test the validity of various mathematical and physical approximations   commonly employed in these computations.  In particular, the laws of   quantum mechanics, rather than classical mechanics, are applied, and the   interaction of the molecule with one or more phonons (quantized lattice   vibrations) are treated.",
