 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant project investigates the properties of a non-  selective ion channel (channels are functionally important  proteins located in the cell membrane).  The non-selective  channel plays an important part in slow excitation of brain  cells induced by brain chemicals.  The overall summation of  the excitatory state of each of the brain cells in each  specialized nucleus (region) of the brain determines the  tone of the brain.  In spite of its widespread nature and  its functional importance, the non-selective channel has  long been ignored, and little is known about its properties.  To investigate this channel in brain neurons has been  difficult because of the lack of a suitable cell type.  Recently, the laboratory of the principal investigator has  found that cultured neurons from the ventral tegmental area  (a brain region playing an important part in the  pathogenesis of schizophrenia) are an excellent cell type  for this purpose, since this channel is consistently  activated by four excitayory chemicals:  (1) neurotensin,  (2) neurokinin B,  (3)  metabotropic glutamate agonist,  (4)  and muscarine  Thus, it is now feasible to conduct a  systematic investigation of this channel.  The specific  projects examine:  (1)  whether each one of these brain  chemicals acts on its own receptor,  (2)  the permeability  of the channel to various ions,  (3)  the signal  transduction mechanism (details of the events leading to a  slow excitation of the neuron).  (4)  the pharmacology of  this channel, and  (5)  the single channel properties of  this channel.  Preliminary results suggest that this non-  selective channel has unusual characteristics:  (1)  It is  different from a Ca-activated non-specific cation channel.  (2)  The channel activiation is independent of G proteins  (an important protein for many types of signal  transduction).  (3)  Yet, it does not seem to be a ligand-  gated channel (usual channel for very quick excitation),  since the latency of activation is very long.",
