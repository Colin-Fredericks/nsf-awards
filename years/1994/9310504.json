It draws upon the theories of Bourdieu and Passeron to  explain the interactive processes by which schools differentiate  learning opportunities through the knowledge associated with their  informal curricular outcomes.  The researchers will study 12  randomly-selected desegregated public high schools in six southern  cities over a retrospective 25 year period, employing both  qualitative and quantitative methods, including content analysis of  school yearbooks, validated with school site observations,  accreditation reports, and interviews.  %%%  The results of this research will contribute to sociological  theories of education, and they will strengthen the knowledge base  for policy decisions concerning school tracking and support for  various kinds of extracurricular activities.    ***",
