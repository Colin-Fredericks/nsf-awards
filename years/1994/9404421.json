The goals are:  (1) to establish the  conditions for successful growth; (2) to determine the atomic  structure of the bulk and of the surface of the films; and (3) to  determine the strains and the equilibrium phase of the films.  Some  of the immediate projects are:  stabilization of metastable phases  (e.g. face center cubic cobalt, face center and body center  manganese, etc.); growth and characterization of shear-strained  iltrathin films; and expitaxy of metals (particularly magnetic  metals) on semiconductors.  Interaction with theorists doing first-  principle total-energy calculations of both equilibrium and  pseudomorphic phases will be pursued.    Non-technical abstract:  For a number of electronic, magnetic and  optical applications, modern technology requires the use of thinner  crystalline films, some only five to ten atomic layers thick.  In  order to understand the properties of these ultrathin films, the  first piece of information that one seeks is the atomic structure,  i.e. the arrangement of the atoms on the surface and in the  interior of the films.  The present project has three main goals:   (1) to establish procedures for preparing ultrathin films of  scientifically and technologically interesting materials; (2) to  determine the atomic structure of the surface and of the interior  of the films; and (3) to determine the state of strains in the  films.  Many chemical and physical properties of ultrathin films  depend on the atomic structure and the strains, and it is expected  that this project could lead to the production of films with novel  and useful properties for electronic and magnetic applications.  ***",
