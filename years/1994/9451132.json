The network will contain laboratory exercises  designed for three levels of activity.  Level I contains exercises  designed for minimal equipment and budget.  Level II is consistent  with curricula placing a high value on hands-on laboratory  experiences.  Level III will be advanced work leading to  independent studies or team research efforts.  The exercises are  written for standard cell biology laboratories or for inquiry-based  education.  The network serves as a source of computer simulations  as well as data.  The data may be in the form of graphs, tables, or  images.  The network also serves as a communications device to link  teachers of cell biology from high schools, colleges and  universities.  It will also allow for instructor input and revision  of existing exercises.",
