The first objective  of this project is to perform a benchmark study for Ladder Logic  Diagrams (LLDs), SFCs, and Petri nets in terms of their design  efficiency, cost, adaptability, and maintainability on a flexible  manufacturing system.  The second objective is to perform design  recovery from LLDs  to SFCs and Petri nets.           The research results will advance the knowledge, tools, and  methodologies for designing and optimizing discrete-event  controllers in large industrial automation projects.  Current  industrial automated manufacturing systems work with a number of  inputs and outputs varying from perhaps ten to several thousands  and have communication capacity.  Traditional discrete-event  control design approaches such as LLDs prove entirely ineffective  on large-scale problems.",
