 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303929  Low    One of the most rapid defense responses of a plant to an invading  pathogen is the oxidative burst, where, within 5 minutes of the  encounter of the plant cell with a pathogen-derived elicitor  molecule there is the sudden release of hydrogen peroxide and  other oxidative species.  The oxidative burst is possibly the  plant's first line of defense against infection, and appears to  result from one of the simplest and most topologically localized  signal transduction pathways.  The overall goal of this research  is to identify and characterize the second messengers and  signaling intermediates that communicate the association of an  elicitor molecule with its cell surface receptor to the oxidase  complex that produces oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide.   Intermediate goals are to:  1) identify purified elicitors that  activate the oxidative burst pathway without stimulating other  signaling pathways that lead to delocalized defense responses  (e.g. production of phytoalexins or PR proteins),  2) identify  second messengers that are activated by such elicitors, 3) rank  the second messengers chronologically in order of their  appearance, and 4) show linkage or connectivity between adjacent  pairs of identified second messengers using messenger-specific  inhibitors, activators, etc.  %%%  One of the most rapid defense responses of a plant cell to  an invading pathogen is the \"oxidative burst,\" the sudden release  of hydrogen peroxide and other oxidative chemical species.   The oxidative burst probably represents the first line of a  plant's defense against infection.  The goal of this research is  to work out the chain of biochemical events between the detection  of a pathogen, as signaled by the arrival of a pathogen-specific  chemical on a specific plant cell receptor, through the resulting  signal transduction pathways, to the production of oxidative  chemicals.  The results of this research will contribute  substantially to our understanding of this important cellular  signa ling pathway in plants and should provide considerable  information on where and how the defense responses of plants can  be genetically manipulated.  ***",
