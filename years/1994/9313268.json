The collaborators intend to work on the hydrolysis of  phosphate esters using a combination of ab initio  quantum theory, molecular dynamics, and molecular  modeling.  The goal of the study is to elucidate the  molecular mechanisms as well as determine the most  effective mediators which enhance or inhibit phosphate  bond hydrolysis.    The importance of the phosphate bond can hardly be  overestimated.  Its critical role in biological  systems in constantly upgraded: it is not only  relevant to the process of ATP synthesis and  hydrolysis, but also there is increasing evidence of  it being involved in all sorts of processes through  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and as a trigger  mechanism in multiple second phenomena. The proposed  work will be conducted as a collaborative effort  through mutual contacts, visits, a student exchange  program, and electronic communication.  The long term  goal of the project is to advance our understanding of  a crucial biological process as a source of bioenergy.  ***",
