 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark Ediger is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations   of the glass transition in supercooled organic liquids such as   o-terphenyl, glycerol and trinaphthylbenzene.  Time resolved optical   spectroscopy on dilute solutions of rigid probes will be used.    Measurements of pattern photobleaching of the optical probes will be used   to determine how the rotational and translational motions decouple near   the glass transition temperature.  These experiments are motivated by   results from a number of laboratories which indicate that translational   motion has a significantly weaker temperature dependence than rotational   motion as the glass transition is approached.  The extent to which   decoupling is observed for probes of different sizes will clarify the   nature of the cooperative motion in supercooled liquids.    In the last 25 years, physical chemists have made significant progress in   the molecular interpretation of the static and dynamic properties of the   liquid state. The relationship between intermolecular potentials and   liquid structure is now well understood, and the role that solvent   friction plays in molecular reorientation and chemical reactions is also   understood for liquids of low viscosity.  Nevertheless, the properties of   supercooled liquids, and the molecular motions which occur near the glass   transition temperature, are still not well understood.  The experiments   being conducted by Ediger are designed to shed light on the anomalous   rotational and translational motions which occur in viscous supercooled   liquids in the region near the glass transition temperature.",
