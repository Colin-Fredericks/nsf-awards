Adequate  levels of Mevalonic acid are required for sustained cell growth.   In addition to the need for cell growth, however, an unknown  Isoprenoid metabolite of mevalonic acid is required acutely for DNA  replication in mammalian cells.  The long term goals of this  research are to identify and elucidate the mechanisms by which  isoprenoids regulate cell proliferation.  Preliminary experiments  identified a new, cell cycle-regulated protein that may contain a  novel isoprenoid modification, isopentenyladenine.  The expression  of this unique protein (named i6A26) correlates with isoprenoid-  mediated regulation of DNA synthesis.  Interestingly,  isopentenyladenine, which is derived from mevalonic acid, is a  potent growth hormone in plants, a member of the group of plant  hormones known as cytokinins.  The function of isopentenyladenine  in mammalian cells is unknown.  The goals of this project are:  1)  to purify i6A26 using conventional biochemical techniques, obtain  partial amino acid sequence of the protein, and to compare the  amino acid sequence of i6A26 with known protein which may help to  identify this unique, cell cycle-regulated protein. 2) to prepare  antibodies that recognize peptide domains in i6A26 and  immunoprecipitate i6A26. 3)  to perform precursor incorporation  experiments using radiolabeled mevalonic acid and adenine to  characterize the modification in i6A26.  Reagents produced and the  results obtained will be used in future studies to address the  mechanism by which i6A26 expression is regulated and the role of  this unique protein in controlling cell proliferation.  %%%  Isopentenyladenine is a chemical variant of one of the nucleotide  bases that make up nucleic acids.  This modified base is found in  transfer RNAs isolated from a wide variety of cells.  In plants,   isopentenyladenine is also a member of an important class of  hormones known as cytokinins.  Cytokinins regulate cell division,  gene expression, and differentiation in various plant tissues.  In  mammalian cells, an isoprenoid molecule derived from the same  metabolic precursor as the isopentenyl portion of the plant hormone  is acutely required for transit of the cell cycle.  The identity of  this isoprenoid is unknown.  Since isopentenyladenine affects cell  division in plants it would be very interesting determine whether  isopentenyladenine is involved in regulation of mammalian cell  proliferation. In preliminary work, this laboratory has identified  a cell cycle-regulated protein in mammalian cells that appears to  contain isopentenyladenine.  If this is borne out by further work,  it would represent a previously unknown type of protein  modification.  It also may lead to clarification of the role of the  required, but previously uncharacterized, isoprenoid molecule  necessary for mammalian cell division.  Since the exact mechanism  of action of this chemical as a plant hormone is not yet understood  the results of this research could also shed light on the mode of  action of this important class of plant hormones.  ***",
