 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400233  Lu       This award supports mathematical research on the development  of structural stability for parabolic partial differential  equations and related problems.  The structural stability of  dynamical systems is one of the fundamental problems in the  theory of dynamical systems.  One of the main problems currently  facing researchers in the area concerns infinite dimensional  dynamical systems on locally non-compact spaces.  While much  progress has been made, those systems generated by parabolic  equations define only semiflows since backwards solutions may not  exist and the phase spaces are not locally compact.  This work  will first focus on structural stability for scalar equations  with periodic boundary conditions.  In particular efforts will be  made to understand stability in a neighborhood of an attractor  and to study the quasiperiodic and almost periodic scalar  parabolic equations.  Involved in this work is the skew product  flow, the lap number and Floquet theory.  Other studies of  Floquet theory for time dependent parabolic equations and smooth  conjugacy for parabolic equations will also be carried out.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematicalmodeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematicalanalysis is not so much to create the equations as it  is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, for mathematical  models to adequately describe reality, the qualitative properties  of solutions should not change significantly when the model is  subjected to small, allowable perturbations.  An attempt to  formalize this point of view leads to the concept of structural  stability.  ***",
