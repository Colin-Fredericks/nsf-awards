A formal collection transfer agreement between the Oregon institutions was signed in February, 1993 and follows from discussions begun in 1991 when the University of Oregon collections were deemed not to fit the long range priorities of its biology department.  The consolidation plan involves housing the integrated Oregon collections in mobile compactors on one floor of the Oregon State herbarium as well as deaccessioning the duplicates (except for types and complementary material)  estimated at 13,000 specimens  and donating them along with older herbarium cases and duplicate books to Boise State University.  The combined collections represent an invaluable teaching and research resource representing the flora of Oregon. %%% The Oregon State University Herbarium will accept and incorporate an important historical and regional research collection of 123,000 plants that is being orphaned by the University of Oregon Herbarium because the collection no longer fits the long range priorities of its biology department.  The integrated Oregon collections will be housed in mobile compactors on one floor of the Oregon State herbarium, with unneeded duplicate material, estimated at 13,000 specimens, donated to Boise State University.  The combined collections represent an invaluable teaching and research resource representing the flora of Oregon.",
