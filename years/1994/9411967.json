Just as molecular genetics has made  great strides since the introduction of electronic databases  cataloguing the sequences of genes from animals used in  research, neuroscience would be advanced if appropriate  databases were made available to researchers.  In this  proposal, Dr. Gwen Jacobs outlined a series of workshops in  which neurobiologists and information scientists will gather  to determine how to institute electronic databases of  individually identifiable nerve cells.  Databases for  several different research organisms are now possible, and  might include detailed structural, physiological,  neurochemical, and genetic information about each cell.  The  databases would advance studies of  brain cell function, or  the behavior of neural networks.  This electronically stored  information could be made available over internet to aid  both researchers and educators.  ***",
