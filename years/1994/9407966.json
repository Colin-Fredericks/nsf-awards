 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Anne B. Myers of the University of Rochester will   investigate the dynamics of electronic states and electronic coherences   of small molecules in the condensed phase.  Specifically, electronic   dephasing and solvation are to be studied using ground-state resonance   Raman spectroscopy and three-pulse photon echo measurements.  The systems   to be studied include carbon disulfide in a variety of polar and   non-polar liquid solvents, the triatomic iodine ion in polar solvents,   and azulene in glassy polymers.  From the electronic absorption spectra,   Raman excitation profiles, and the absolute Raman quantum yields as a   function of the excitation frequency broadening processes that are fast   and slow on the Raman time scale will be deduced.  The three-pulse photon   echo experiment provides similar information for comparison to the Raman   results.    These investigations will provide insight to the processes that are   responsible for the broadening of electronic absorptions in condensed   media and to  processes that affect chemical reaction rates in condensed   phases.  Efforts to develop practical optical memories based on   persistent spectral hole burning in solids will be aided by a better   understanding brought about by these researches.",
