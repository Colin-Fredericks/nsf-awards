 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  study  seeks  to  understand  how  variations  in  climatic  conditions alter the reproductive cycles in three populations  of  white-crowned  sparrows  living  in  diverse  habitats  within  a  relatively  small area of western Washington state. The  research  will  integrate  field  and laboratory  studies  on  reproductive  function.  Comparisons  between  populations  will  be  made   of  behavior   and   reproductive  state  in   the   springtime   and  experimental  manipulations of environmental  cues  suspected  of  signaling environmental change will be performed. The long  range  goal  of  the project is to determine the extent and function  of  pathways in the brain of these animals for environmental  signals  that   regulate   changes  in  appearance  and   behavior.   Such  information  is critical to understand, in general,  how  animals  react  to  their  habitat  to aid us in  the  future  in  solving  problems  associated with global warming and habitat destruction.  Understanding  the  mechanisms  by  which  vertebrates  transform  environmental  information into morphological, physiological  and  behavioral adjustments may help us evaluate the extent  to  which  species  are  able  to adapt and how we may fare  in  a  changing  environment.",
