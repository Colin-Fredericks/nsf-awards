The planning effort will focus on four major areas.  These areas include: 1) the Academic Program; 2) Student  Development; 3) Research & Faculty Development; and 4) the  Infrastructure.    The major objectives of the planning period will be to:   1.  Review and revise procedures for assessing the quality       of SEM programs, identifying specific strengths and       weaknesses.   2.  Determine activities and resources needed to elevate       SEM programs to a higher level of excellence.   3.  Analyze strengths and weaknesses related to recruitment       and retention, and determine activities to enhance       these areas.   4.  Analyze research capabilities and determine research-       related needs, particularly with respect to the       training of students.   5.  Determine tracking procedures and infrastructure       mechanisms needed to ensure adequate feedback on SEM       graduates, including enrollment in graduate programs,       progress in graduate school and employment data.   6.  Assess and develop appropriate mechanisms to enhance       and facilitate cooperative endeavors with industry,       government and graduate institutions.   7.  Determine components of an effective infrastructure       that will support current enhancements and facilitate       future growth.",
