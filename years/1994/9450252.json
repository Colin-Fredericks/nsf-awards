 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450252  Rousso    Girls Incorporated, a national youth-serving organization, is  undertaking a three year project to modify its highly successful  Operation SMART program, designed to address the underrepresenta-  tion of girls and women in science and mathematics, so that it is  accessible to girls and young women with diverse disabilities.    Recognizing that girls with disabilities face a double set of  barriers based on disability and gender to mathematics and science  experiences, courses and careers, the overall project goals is to  provide girls with disabilities with access to needed skills,  attitudes, and opportunities so that they will choose and can  persist in science and mathematics courses in school, and pursue  mathematics and science careers and interests in adult life.  A  secondary goal is to provide nondisabled girls with further  encouragement for scientific pursuits through exposure to an  enriched curriculum and a mainstreamed learning environment.    The project objectives are to:         Develop basic principles for incorporating the needs and  experiences of girls with diverse disabilities into science and  mathematics curricula;         Revise the materials and manuals of Operation SMART so they  are inclusive of girls with disabilities;         Assist other science and mathematics programs and curricula to  become inclusive of girls with disabilities.    Through field testing in several sites throughout the country, and  consultation with experts in the field, the project is developing  a science curriculum on a specific set of topics from the ground up  to understand the basic principles of inclusion as it relates to  science, and the contributions of the experience of disability to  scientific exploration and learning.  These principles will then be  used to alter existing SMART curricula and materials, and have  significant input into materials now in process so that they are  truly inclusive, with the needs and experience of girls with  disabilities being thoroug hly integrated into the work rather than  an add-on.  Finally, the project will generalize from the process  of revising SMART to develop guidelines for modifying other science  and mathematics curricula so they can be used in mainstreamed  settings.    Several products will be developed through this project including  a new curriculum, a set of modified SMART materials, a set of  guidelines for inclusion, and an annotated bibliography on  inclusive mathematics and science curricula.  These will be broadly  disseminated using the extensive Girls Incorporated networks.",
