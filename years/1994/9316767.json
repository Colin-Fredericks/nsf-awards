 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this investigation is to understand the role of  snow in sea ice development processes and air-ice-ocean heat  exchange interactions in the seasonal and perennial sea ice zones  of the Ross Sea, the Amundsen Sea, and the Bellingshausen Sea.   Observations and measurements of the characteristics of sea ice and  snow will be combined with numerical models of sea-ice flooding and  the entrainment of snow into the ice cover in order to gain an  understanding of the sea-ice heat and mass balance, and to quantify  the energy exchange within the antarctic sea-ice cover.    The snow measurement program, using the RVIB Nathaniel B.  Palmer, will include depth, grain size and morphology, density,  temperature, thermal conductivity, water content, and stable  isotope ratio.  The ice measurement program will include thickness,  salinity, temperature, density, brine content, and included gas  volume, as well as such structural properties as the fraction of  frazil, platelet, and congelation ice in the seasonal antarctic  pack ice.  Differences in ice types are the result of differences  in the environment in which the ice forms: frazil ice is formed in  supercooled sea water, normally through wind or wave-induced  turbulence, while platelet and congelation ice is formed under  quiescent conditions.  The fraction of frazil ice is an important  variable in the energy budget of the upper ocean, and contributes  significantly to the stabilization of the surface layers.    The numerical models will involve the thermodynamics of phase  changes from liquid water to ice, along with the resulting energy  transfer, brine expulsion, and the modulating effect of a snow  cover.  The results are expected to have broad relevance and  application to understanding the effects of sea-ice processes in  global change, and atmospheric, oceanographic, and remote sensing  investigations of the Southern Ocean.",
