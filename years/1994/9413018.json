 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413018  Williams    With this grant from The National Science Foundation, Dr. Sloan  Williams will develop models which will allow her to reconstruct  forms of prehistoric social organization using DNA data obtained  from the analysis of ancient bone. In the course of  archaeological fieldwork in southern Peru, Dr. Williams and her  collaborators have excavated a series of cemeteries which contain  well preserved human skeletal remains. The graves also yielded  numerous burial goods which provide information on the social and  occupational status of the associated individuals. Using current  biochemical techniques it is possible to extract and analyze DNA  from these bones and with the data thus collected determine the  degree of relatedness among individuals. On this basis it should  be possible to reconstruct biological affinity and relate this to  social and occupational organization.    DNA analysis has provided a valuable research tool in many areas  of science and is permitting researchers not only to answer old  questions with greater precision, but also to expand the  boundaries of potential inquiry. Because ancient bone sometimes  preserves DNA it may permit archaeologists also to venture into  new realms. Dr. Williams is breaking new ground in this  direction. Her research is important not only for what it may  reveal about Peruvian prehistory, but also because the techniques  she develops may be useful in a wide range of archaeological  situations.",
