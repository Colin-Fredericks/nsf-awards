 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 576  Huray  High Performance Computational Network Expansion Plan    South Carolina EPSCoR will establish a High Performance  Computational Network Expansion Plan to provide computational  tools, training, and programming support to a broad array of  junior faculty at several of the State's senior institutions,  including Clemson University, the Medical University of South  Carolina, the University of South Carolina, South Carolina State  University, the College of Charleston, and USC-Aiken.  Effective  access to the South Carolina Supercomputer Network will be  provided to computational researchers, graduate and undergraduate  students, and South Carolina's industrial sector.  The project  will provide research opportunities to junior faculty and will  expand the South Carolina Supercomputer Network through the  purchase and linking of onsite workstations.  In support of this  project, the participating institutions will appoint six graduate  fellowships in high performance computational science.  Systemic  and potential long-term impacts include the transfer of new  knowledge to non-competitive faculty and the coalescing of the  educational agendas of South Carolina's leading institutions of  higher education with those of the state's industrial sector.",
