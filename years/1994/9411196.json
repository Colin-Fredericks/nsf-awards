This research will test  empirically several hypotheses about the institutional  constraints on ECJ decision making and the level of member  states' support required for the ECJ to render \"pro\" decisions  that are not mere dead letters.  This grant provides funds for  travel to field research locations that are necessary to  construct a dataset of all common market cases adjudicated by the  ECJ from 1958-1992.  The dataset will allow systematic empirical  investigation of decision making in the European Parliament.  The  dataset will include the different decisions of the Parliament,  their history (whether they came out of committee, or were  proposed on the floor), their support basis (the coalition that  made them successful), and their ultimate fate (whether they were  accepted by the other European institutions, and whether they  became European law).  This research will contribute to an  understanding of European integration that goes beyond what has  been provided by current relevant theories of neo-functionalism  and intergovernmentalism.",
