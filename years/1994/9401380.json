 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401380  Bercovici       The proposed work is in three directions. The first is in  basic operator theory. The theory of dual algebras will be  applied to study pairs of commuting operators. These techniques  were most successful in the case of single operators. The second  direction is related to the study of interpolation and lifting  problems associated with the concept of structured singular  value. These issues are interesting as problems in operator  theory but they also have applications for control theory. The  third direction is a development of earlier work in the framework  of Voiculescu's free harmonic analysis. The convolution theory in  this analysis still has many aspects which are not well  understood. For instance, the domain of attraction to the  semicircle distribution in the central limit theorem is not  known. Problems on large deviations have not been studied in this  context.       This project lies at the interface of several branches of  mathematics (operator theory, probability, function theory). Much  of the project involves a better understanding and new results in  these disciplines. Further, parts of the project have a  significant interaction with control theory and systems theory,  and the results might have an impact on calculations related to  the control of large systems.  ***",
