 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  ATM 9420833  Waliser, Duane  SUNY, Stonybrook  Title: Relationship between Clouds, SST and Surface Fluxes on  Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales Over the Western Pacific    The goal of this proposal is to contribute to the clarification of  the role of clouds on the surface radiation and latent heat flux in  the western Pacific over climatologically significant space and  time scales.  The data available until recently have not allowed us  to estimate unambiguously the magnitude and variability of the  dominant mechanisms at work in air-sea interactions in the tropical  regions.  There are, for instance, competing theories regarding the  mechanism responsible for the maintenance of tropical sea surface  temperatures at their observed temperature in the western Pacific.    Our proposal has three objectives.  First, we will compute cloud  and surface (shortwave radiation and latent heat) fluxes from  satellite observations using techniques we have developed or  adapted from other investigators.  Second, we will intercompare our  satellite results with surface and aircraft observations to ensure  the quality of the satellite-derived surface fluxes.  Third, and  this is the heart of our proposal, we will investigate the effect  of clouds on surface fluxes (including SST) over climatologically  significant space and time scales.    Our approach uses satellite data extensively to provide the large  scale framework, and it also builds upon the availability of TOGA-  COARE data to validate our satellite data and perform some process-  oriented studies.  The investigation will, however, extend the  results from the TOGA-COARE IOP to longer time periods in order to  explore seasonal and interannual variability.    Results from this research are expected to lead to a better  understanding of some of the mechanisms controlling air-sea  interactions and, thus, should help in the development of new  parameterizations for a hierarchy of numerical models aimed at  simulating the coupled atmosphere-o cean system over seasonal to  interannual time scales in the tropical regions.",
