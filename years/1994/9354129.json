The results of  this assessment, along with the examination of exemplary programs  at other institutions, will lead to the development of a broad-  based, long-term plan to guide the College as it builds its  capability to recruit, educate and graduate significantly more  minority students in science and engineering fields.    Important partners in the planning process will be  representatives from business and industry, professional  organizations, community colleges and the New York City public  schools. Although the experiences and needs of all minority  students will be considered in the planning process, particular  attention will be focused on Hispanic students.",
