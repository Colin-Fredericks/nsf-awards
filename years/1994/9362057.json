 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362057  Bochner  There is a growing recognition of the need to care for our ocean environments and to prevent or at least minimize chemical pollution introduced by man.  Marine bacteria play a key role by initiating the recycling metabolic good chain of the oceans.  However, our knowledge of these organisms, their diversity, taxonomy, and metabolic capabilities, is still at a rudimentary level.  In this project, Biolog, Inc. proposes to develop a simple and rapid instrumented system for characterizing and identifying a broad range of heterotrophic, mesophilic marine bacteria or mixed populations of marine microorganisms.  The system will be composed of microplate test kits which can be read and analyzed by an existing computer-controlled reading instrument.  A second goal of this proposed research program is to collect and analyze data on the metabolic capabilities of microbial populations indigenous to ocean environments.  The fundamental scientific insights gained in the proposed study should aid in the development of strategies for preserving, enhancing, and/or directing the metabolism of marine bacteria for preservation or reclamaton of marine habitat.  The instrumented test kit system will be marketed to marine and fishery organizations and research institutes and to commercial fish and shellfish farming operations.",
