 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307995  Oriani    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Richard A. Oriani, Corrosion Research  Center, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, to pursue with Dr. Su-Il Pyun,  Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of  Science and Technology (KAIST), for 24 months, a program of cooperative  research on the properties and mechanism of formation of passivating oxidic  films on aluminum and on tungsten.  Two important measurements, namely, (1)  the kinetics of passivation and (2) the mechanical stress generated during  film formation will be made in various electrolyte compositions and with  various potential-time conditions.    Oxidic films produced upon metal surfaces during corrosion of metals strongly  reduce the rate of subsequent corrosion.  This corrosion resistance in the  case of aluminum and tungsten results from the formation of a thin passivating  oxidic film.  It is known that the formation kinetics and film characteristics  vary with the electrolyte solution chemistry and the electrical potential at  which the film is generated.  Results of this research may produce a better  understanding of corrosion and passivation processes that prevent further  corrosion.  The collaborators are highly respected researchers in the field of  the proposal.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the  project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).   This project adds an international cooperative dimension to the PI's research  under NSF Grant No. DMR-9111673.  ***",
