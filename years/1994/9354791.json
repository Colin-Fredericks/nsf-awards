Our main objective is to  provide an environment for presenting and communicating abstract  computer science concepts in a more efficient, visual and  interactive manner.  We plan to redesign the sophomore formal  languages and automata theory course at Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute to use interactive and visual software tools we have  developed and will continue to develop.  These tools allow students  to experiment with concepts in formal languages and automata,  receiving immediate feedback.  We will evaluate the usage of these  tools in two ways: in a lecture format with computer  demonstrations, and in a lecture/lab format.  The material to be  developed includes manuscripts for the lecture and lab presentation  formats, problem sets, and software tools.  This material will be  disseminated through computer science education conferences,  journals, and newsgroups on the Internet.  In addition, a one day  workshop will be held during the second year for evaluation and  dissemination of our methods and tools.  ***",
