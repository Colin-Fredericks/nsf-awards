 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406415  Tassiulas       Research will be conducted on congestion control strategies  for providing network performance guarantees on end-to-end loss and  delay.  The goal is the analysis of networks with general topology  and multiclass traffic, and the design of simple and effective  congestion control strategies.  The study will also consider  certain specialized topologies (ring with spatial reuse) as well.   The focus of the research will be particularly on the interaction  at the network level, of localized control schemes acting at the  link or single node level.  Both deterministic and stochastic  arrival models will be considered.  Rigorous analytical techniques  and simulations will be employed for the analysis and evaluation of  the congestion control algorithms.  Special attention will be given  to the inherent practical constraints of high speed networks and  the limitations they pose on possible congestion control  strategies.  The impact of the proposed research will be the  provision of new congestion control schemes, of guidelines for the  design and evaluation of congestion control strategies and of  enhanced knowledge, and understanding of the impact of distributed  control strategies on network level performance.  ***",
