 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457456  Goodman      Dr. Goodman will carry out research to seek to explore the question  of which physical processes are most important in determining the  structure and evolution of interstellar clouds in our Galaxy.   These  \"clouds\", as they are known, are just local density enhancements in  the lower-density interstellar medium (ISM), but they are  nonetheless the object of intense study, primarily because they are  the birthplaces of new stars in our Galaxy.  Without a clear  physical picture of these clouds, it is very difficult, if not  impossible, to develop and refine a physically realistic scenario  for the star formation process itself.    Dr. Goodman, in carrying out the research, will specifically seek  to explore the relationship between magnetic fields, density  structure, and velocity structure in the interstellar medium (ISM).    Prior research carried out by Dr. Goodman and collaborators has  shown that the magnetic and kinetic energies measured in the  gaseous ISM are usually similar, so it is reasonable to hypothesize  that the magnetic fields pervading the gas and velocity structure  in the gas are related.    One of the biggest pieces missing from the picture of the  interaction between magnetic fields and gas in the ISM is a clear  view of magnetic field structure in the dense gas where stars form.    The observation of the polarization of optical and near-infrared  background starlight can be used to map field structure in  low-density gas, but Dr. Goodman's recent research has shown that  this technique cannot trace the field accurately in denser gas.   Dr. Goodman and collaborators will therefore carry out far-infrared  and sub-millimeter wavelength observations of the polarized  emission from magnetically aligned dust in dense regions of the  ISM.  The results of the research should provide a clearer view of  the field structure there.  The observations will be carried out  through several international collaborations, one of which will  seek to use the new infrared  satellite observatory (ISO).  Velocity  structure of the ISM will be investigated with new spectral-line  mapping of gas in the interstellar medium and through theoretical  modeling of new and existing data.  Dr. Goodman's current students  and research assistants will be primarily working on this line of  inquiry.  Early results of the research have shown that \"dense  cores\", which are the dense knots of gas associated with the  formation of individual stars, may represent \"eddies\" in a more  turbulent/wavelike velocity field which characterizes the  lower-density surrounding ISM.  The new studies will focus on  relating the velocity structure deduced from spectral-line mapping  to realistic views of the magnetic field in the ISM obtained from  far-infrared and sub-mm polarimetry.    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  The award will enhance the career of the  faculty member by providing flexible support for research and  educational activities.  Cooperation with industry and institutions  that support research and education is encouraged.",
