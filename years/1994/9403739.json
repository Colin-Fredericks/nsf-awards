 "awd_abstract_narration": "ZHUANG  9403739    This project is preliminary work in support of proposed research   on the redox chemistry and availability of iron to phytoplankton  which will be submitted to NSF.  The ability to reliably quantify  Fe(II) in aerosols, rainwater, and seawater is one of the most  important elements in further understanding the biogeochemical  cycling of iron in both atmospheric and aqueous environments. We  have developed a high performance liquid chromatographic method  that has enabled us to determine ultratrace amounts of iron(II) in  aerosols, rainwater, seawater {Yi et al., 1992}.  The Fe(II)  concentration in remote marine aerosols and rainwater has been  determined for the first time {Zhuang et al.,1992a}.  This novel  method is the first to use HPLC to separate and determine the iron  redox species.  While many experts in this field have noted that  these previous studies have contributed new knowledge on iron  chemistry in the atmosphere and in seawater, others have argued  that because Fe(II) in seawater is known to be thermodynamically  unstable and difficult to measure, our new method may be  inaccurate.  Despite publication in the peer-reviewed journals, the  methodology continues to be the subject of some controversy.   Development of this new method for the measurement of Fe(II) is  still exploratory, and it will potentially have great impact on  environmental chemistry, specifically, on chemical oceanography.   We propose to verify and refine this highly sensitive and specific  method.  We will focus on addressing the questions raised by  reviewers in our previous proposal and further clarify our new  findings.    The objectives of this study are: 1) to rigorously verify and  refine as needed our newly developed method using HPLC with a  UV/visible detector to determine Fe(II) in aerosols, rainwater, and  seawater, 2) to demonstrate the capability of the method to measure  Fe(II) in surface seawater collected from a variety of coastal  environments, 3) to determine directly the  residence time of Fe(II)  in artificial and natural surface seawater collected in coastal  waters.",
