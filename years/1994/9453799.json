The film, planned as a PBS special, will document the engineering and technology behind the construction of the telescope as well as examining and explaining the science of radio astronomy.  Ancillary educational material, including a 20 minute version of the video, will be developed and distributed for use in informal education setting through the American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.  In addition images and information about the Green Bank Telescope and the science of radio astronomy will be made available through an electronic bulletin board service such as GOPHER or MOSAIC.  Teaching materials also will be developed for use in the secondary school curriculum and an \"Across Space and Time\" undergraduate curriculum developed at Cornell University will be made available to faculty at other colleges and universities.  In addition, the film and related material will serve as the centerpiece for short courses for college teachers at Green Bank under the National Chautauqua Short Course Program.     The PI and major content developer is Martha Haynes, Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University associated with the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research.  The film is being produced by PhotoSynthesis Production of Ithaca, New York.  David Gluck is co-producer, director, and cinematographer and Deborah Hoard is co-producer and writer.  A twelve person advisory committee of astronomers, teachers, and informal science educators will guide development of the project.",
