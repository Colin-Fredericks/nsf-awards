 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Howard Hu  CTS-9410022    This project is an experimental and numerical investigation for motion and interactions of rigid particles in non-Newtonian fluids.  The experiments will be performed with particles of different shapes in sedimentation and suspension systems of polymer solutions.  The numerical simulation will be based on a finite element package which handles the unsteady and non-linear coupling of the motion between fluid and solid particles.  The effects of non-Newtonian properties of shear-rate dependent viscosity, normal stress differences and elasticity of fluids on the motions and interactions of particles will be examined, and the mechanisms that control the behavior of particles in those non-Newtonian fluids will be identified.  Five topics are outlined in this study:  (1) stable orientation of long particles sediments in non-Newtonian fluids; (2) particle-wall interactions and wall effects on particle motion; (3) equilibrium position and migration of sedimenting and suspended particles; (4) interactions between particles and flow induced structures; (5) flow of fiber suspensions.    Results of  these project will contributed to the fundamental knowledge of dynamics of non-Newtonian fluids, and to the modeling of flows of polymeric liquids with suspended particles.  They will find through the use of polymer solutions.  ***",
