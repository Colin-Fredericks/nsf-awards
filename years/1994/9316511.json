 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316511  Guest  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program  (\"Anzflux\") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here concerns the dynamics of the forcing of the sea ice  cover and the upper ocean by the atmosphere.  Measurements and  analyses will include the wind stress and atmospheric heat fluxes,  and upward and downward components of short and long wave  radiation.  An on-board rawinsonde system will obtain daily  profiles wind, temperature, humidity, and pressure through the  troposphere, and an acoustic sounder will continuously monitor the  structure of the lower atmosphere.  Satellite data and imagery will  be used to determine the regional and mesoscale context of the  point measurements from the ship.  The major goal of this component  of Anzflux is to provide for the continuity of heat exchange  measurements through the ocean/ice interface into the atmosphere.    These measurements, in conjunction with the other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***",
