 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ross            A basic probability identity is established and applied  to obtain new simulation estimators concerning (a) system  reliability, (b) a multi-valued system, and (c) the probability  distribution of the time until a given pattern occurs when data  is generated by a stationary Markov chain.  It has been shown  that the variance of this new estimator is often of the order  a-squared when the usual estimator's variance is of order a and a  is small.  The investigator will indicate how this estimator can  be combined with standard variance reduction techniques.  Additional studies of the estimator, as well as on variations of  it are proposed as are additional applications. The research also  concerns how the identity can be used to provide approximations  and bounds in applied probability.  General bounds as well as  specific applications are indicated and proposed for further  study.            Many problems involving chance phenomena are too  complex for one to obtain analytical solutions.  In such cases a  combination of a probabilistic analysis and a computer simulation  leading to statistical estimators of the quantities of interest  is often a potent method of attack.  The investigator has  indicated how a basic probability identity can be effectively  employed in obtaining efficient simulation estimators.  The  purpose of this research is to study its usefulness, both in the  simulation and the probabilistic analysis phase, in a variety of  applications.  The investigator has also indicated extensions of  the identity along with potential areas of applications. ***",
