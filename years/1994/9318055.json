The aim of this  project is to investigate the molecular basis for dormancy/breaking dormancy  using complementary molecular and genetic approaches.    Research on seed dormancy has been approached mainly by studying breaking of  dormancy which complicates interpretation by confounding breaking of dormancy  with germination.  The molecular and genetic approaches described herein are  distinct in that they focus primarily on maintenance of dormancy.  The  hypothesis to be tested states that specific genes or their products which  are expressed in dormant embryos maintain seed in the dormant state.  The  expression of these genes is repressed during afterripening of dormant  embryos which facilitates subsequent germination.    Using in vivo and in vitro translation procedures, about 10 polypeptides have  been identified that occur in dormant but not afterripened embryos soon after  imbibition.  A dormancy-specific recombinant library has been developed and  sixteen putative dormancy-specific positive clones, whose expression is  modulated by afterripening, have been selected.  These clones will be further  characterized as to their general expression and nucleic acid sequence.  To  complement this approach it is proposed that molecular markers be identified  for major genes associated with the dormancy trait and simultaneously  evaluate/refine the tentative genetic model explaining dormancy in A. fatua.   In addition, to confirm any genetic modelbased on F2 populations derived for  bulk segregant analysis and to better understand the inheritance of dormancy  it is proposed that advanced-generation, F2-derived lines that vary in their  degree of dormancy be developed and genetically evaluated.    This molecular and genetic approach should provide significant information  toward understanding the physiological basis for this arrested stage of  plant  development.   ***",
