 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319164  Watson    Under the direction of Dr. Patty Jo Watson, Ms. Ertug-Yaras will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will study  current subsistence practices in a traditional Turkish village  located in the Cappadocia region, south-east of Ankara. Ms.  Ertug-Yaras is an archaeologist interested in understanding the  past and she will examine present and recent practices to glean  information relevant to this goal. The economy of the village is  based on agriculture, basically field cropping and gardening, as  well as the husbandry of sheep, goats and cattle. Although the  economy is integrated into the regional, national and even  international systems, preliminaries studies indicate that local  knowledge about pre-market oriented techniques still exists. Ms.  Ertug-Yaras will collect basic social and demographic data. She  will also observe and document current subsistence activities and  especially focus on the gathering of wild plants which still play  an important economic role. Use of animals and herd management  strategies will also be examined. Finally extensive structured  interviews will be conducted to record strategies which are no  longer employed. The results will then be applied to an  archaeological site in the region.    The domestication of animals such as goats and sheep and plants  such as barley and wheat occurred just over 10,000 years ago in  the Near East and sites in Turkey and adjacent regions document  this process. This Neolithic revolution marks a major turning  point in human prehistory and it laid the groundwork for the  development of complex societies. While many relevant sites have  been excavated, archaeological material does not speak for itself  and can be difficult to interpret. Studies of present day peoples  who appear to engage in some of the same activities provide an  extremely useful interpretive context. The Ms. Ertug-Yaras has  been fortunate enough to locate a region in which both early  archaeological sites and a range of traditiona l activities are  present.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of value to archaeologists who work in many parts of the  Near East. It holds the potential to shed new light on the  origins of complex society and will assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
