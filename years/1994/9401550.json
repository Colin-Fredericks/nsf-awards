Analogous but more intricate  problems can be studied in the context of one-dimensional formal  groups.  The resulting algebraic objects also arise as  generalized cohomology rings in algebraic topology.  In  particular, the theory of subgroups and isogenies of deformations  of formal groups over a finite field is closely connected with  the Morava K-theory and completed E(n) cohomology of ring spectra  with higher commutativity properties.  Neil Strickland, the  postdoctoral associate, aims to prove a number of conjectures  making this connection more precise.       This research is part of algebraic topology, which  studies certain features of higher dimensional shapes, such as  how many holes they have, how the holes are linked together or  twisted around each other and so on.  These problems are  meaningful even though physical space has only three dimensions.   For example, if one quantity depends on seven others, then one  can imagine drawing a graph of the functional relationship in an  abstract eight-dimensional space.  It is possible and useful to  study the properties of this graph, even though it cannot be  realized physically.  Because it is so hard to visualize such a  space, it is helpful to convert questions about it into algebraic  problems. Broadly speaking, there are two methods of conversion,  appropriate to different types of questions.  In geometry, the  basic algebraic operation is to measure distances and angles.  In  topology, one might say that the basic operation is to count  holes (although it is not so easy to say what precisely is meant  by a three-dimensional hole in a six-dimensional object).   An interesting feature of the subject is that certain  topological questions give rise in an unexpected way to algebraic  problems which have previously been addressed in apparently  unrelated are as of mathematics, such as number theory.  The  current project aims to clarify one quite spectacular example of  this phenomenon, and to extend the relevant algebraic knowledge  so as to cover a wider family of topological situations.  ***",
