 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411030  Heinekey  University of Washington  Dr. Michael Heinekey, Chemistry Department, University of Washington, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the study of the high temperature pairwise proton tunnelling which occurs in polyhydride metal complexes. A series of new dihydride and polyhydride of a variety of metals will be prepared. By altering the metal and ancillary ligands stable dihydrogen, dihydrogen-hydride, and polyhydride complexes which show large hydrogen-hydrogen spin couplings will be obtained. An analysis of the temperature dependency of the couplings which occur in these complexes will reveal whether  hydrogen exchange occurs by a quantum mechanical tunnelling mechanism. A significant portion of the study will involve the study of hydrides into which deuterium or tritium has been incorporated. Tritium nmr will be used to characterize the behavior of some of these systems.    Hydrogen molecules may be activated by allowing them to interact with metal atoms. This behavior has tremendous utility and used in laboratory and industrial chemistry to increase the ability of hydrogen to undergo many reactions, including virtually all \"hydrogenation\" reactions. One specific example is the process in which unsaturated fats are converted into saturated ones. In another respect, the interactions between hydrogen and metals has become an important topic with the increased interest in hydrogen as a clean fuel. In this project the fundamental ways in which hydrogen becomes attached to a metal will be investigated and the details of how hydrogen atoms interchange with each other under the influence of a metal will be determined.",
