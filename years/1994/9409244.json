 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal research planning grant Dr. Mary Berry will explore the   dynamics of cross-relaxation up-conversion in bridged binuclear complexes   of lanthanide ions isolated in a molecular beam.  Several bridged   complexes will be studied to determine whether up-conversion in condensed   phases will actually occur and to investigate their suitability for   volatilization.  The apparatus used in these studies includes a molecular   beam instrument with heated nozzle sources as well as equipment for   performing ring-down spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence   experiments.  If successful, these experiments will provide a better   understanding of cross relaxation up-conversion than is obtained from   condensed phase studies.    In this project fairly large molecular entities called binuclear   complexes will be examined in an environment called a molecular beam.    Under these conditions each complex is isolated from other molecules, and   therefore the outcome of stimulating the complexes with light depends   only on the nature of these complexes, and not on the species in their   immediate surroundings.  Interpretation of the processes involved in   transferring energy gained from absorbing the light is simplified   relative to examining those processes in condensed phases, since   complications arising from interactions between the complexes and the   host crystal, for example, are eliminated.",
