 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411713  Botez  The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of  Wisconsin, Madison, will purchase high resolution spectral- and  laser near-field measurement equipment, which will be dedicated to  research.  The equipment will be used for several research projects  including in particular the development of high-power, single-  frequency phase-locked diode-laser arrays.    Phase-locked diode-laser arrays have demonstrated high diffraction-  limited powers:  1-1.5W.  However, the devices do not have a  single-frequency output, which prevents their use in many  applications.  Furthermore, at the present time, their number of  elements is limited to 20, which in turn limits the amount of  coherent power.    The proposed research consists of developing phase-locked  antiguided arrays with distributed feedback as well as implementing  novel concepts for creating 40-80-element single-spatial-mode  arrays.  The goals are:  single-frequency, diffraction-limited-beam  operation to 1W with linewidths 50kHz, and spatially coherent  powers of 3W.    The requested funds are for purchasing a high-resolution grating  spectrometer with a CCD camera as well as a vibrating mirror for  spectral near-field imaging of array modes.  This will enable the  study of the modal structure of novel devices as well as  optimization for high-power single-mode operation.  ***",
