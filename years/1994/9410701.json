 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410701  Chung    In spite of  the many interesting properties of  intermetallics that make them attractive as high temperature  materials, they share one common disadvantage:  brittle  behavior in room temperature air.  There have been numerous  studies in the last ten years to explore different ways to  ductilize this class of materials.  Recent studies suggest  that intermetallic alloys  such as Nickel-Aluminide (Ni3Al)   are intrinsically ductile, and their brittleness is a result  of hydrogen embrittlement (the hydrogen produced by  reactions between water vapor in air and fresh intermetallic  surfaces exposed during deformation).  However, other  intermetallics  such as Nickel-Iron  (Ni3Fe)  do not appear  to exhibit any moisture-induced embrittlement.  It is  hypothesized that if the water dissociation reaction to  produce hydrogen is quenched in some way by the presence of  oxygen, there will be no hydrogen embrittlement, and the  material will show improved ductility.  To test this  hypothesis, detailed surface science investigations of the  interactions between water vapor and clean surfaces of  intermetallic alloys, with and without the presence of  oxygen, are planned.  Using single crystals of the  intermetallic alloy nickel-aluminum-titanium,  Ni3(Al,Ti),  the room temperature sticking probability of water vapor on  various crystal faces will be measured and compared with  oxygen.  Vibration spectroscopy and thermal desorption are  used to determine on which crystal face the adsorbed water  dissociates to form hydrogen and if such dissociation is  affected by co-adsorbed oxygen.  To understand why Ni3Fe  polycrystals do not suffer moisture-induced embrittlement,  similar studies are performed to determine if oxygen out  competes water vapor for available adsorption sites and if  co-adsorption of water vapor and oxygen results in the  formation of surface hydroxyls instead of hydrogen.  %%%  These studies provide the basic framework to understand and  possibly control moisture-induc ed embrittlement in this  important class of materials.  ***",
