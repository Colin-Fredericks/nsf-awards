 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research pertains to the participation of the mist chamber  method for measuring tropospheric sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the 1994  NSF-sponsored intercomparison (GASIE).  The intercomparison will be  coordinated by the University of Delaware, and is tentatively  planned for September and October of 1994 in Lewes, Delaware.  Two  researcher from the University of New Hampshire will operate the  mist chamber method during the GASIE intercomparison.  The mist  chamber method appears desirable for field deployment in  atmospheric chemistry measurement programs in remote regions  because it is quite sensitive  a detection limit of approximately  20 pptr (v) , appears to be free from matrix interferences is  relatively small in size and weight, plus offers modest  implementation costs.  The reliability of the mist chamber method  for  measuring SO2 will be further tested by participation in the  rigorous double-blind GASIE intercomparison.  This participation is  an essential next step in the validation of the method prior to its  future use in large field measurement programs.",
