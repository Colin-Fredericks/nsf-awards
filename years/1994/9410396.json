 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410396  France  A significant reason for the rare use of formal specification  techniques (FSTs) in the software development industry is a lack  of understanding of how FSTs can be incorporated into current  industrial-strength software development processes.  Current  industrial software development environments tend to favor the  use of informal Structured Specification Methods(SSMs) and Object-  Oriented Methods(OOMs) because of their use of relatively simple,  intuitive notations and concepts.  Lack of understanding of how  FSTs can be effectively applied in the context of practical  development processes based on SSMs and OOMs often leads to the  perception that the use of one precludes the other.  This  research is concerned with bridging the gap between FSTs and the  less formal SSMs and OOMs.  The research program has three  components:  the technical component is concerned with how  integration of formal and informal techniques is accomplished,  the organizational component is concerned with when, how, and  under what circumstances integrated specification techniques can  be applied, and the experimental component is concerned with  evaluating the techniques, supporting tools and processes through  experimental application.  ***",
