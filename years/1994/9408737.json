This transport is energy -dependent and TonB-  dependent, involving two biochemical stages: binding and  internalization.  The research program will elucidate the  molecular mechanism comprising: Ferric enterobactin binding  to we will identify specific residues of  the receptor  protein that recognize and bind the  siderophore on the  external surface of the bacterial cell, using site-specific  and random mutagenesis of the FepA structural gene and  biochemical assays of FepA function, and, FepA structure and  conformation; we will characterize FepA structure with  nitroxide spin labels attached to cysteine residues that  have been introduced by directed mutagenesis, and monitor  structural changes that occur within the receptor during  ligand binding and transport.  Biochemical, molecular  genetics, and immunological techniques will be utilized,  including random and site-specific mutagenesis, kinetic  analysis of  binding and transport, covalent modification in  vivo and in vitro with nitroxide spin labels, and ESR  spectroscopy.  The proposed investigations will determine  the protein structure tha the involved in siderophore  recognition by the bacterial cell.  This goal has not been  accomplished for any tonB dependent receptor protein in any  organism.  Since all gram negative bacteria obtain iron with  mechanistically similar transport systems, the results of  theses studies will establish fundamental principles that  are applicable to numerous trainsport systems in many  different organisms.  ESR analysis of spin labeled FepA will  augment our general knowledge of membrane protein structure,  and provide specific information about the dynamic of  conformational changes that occur in TonB-dependent  receptors during their interaction with ligands.  Besides  the knowledge gained abo ut the siderophore transport, these  experiments  will generate a methodological foundation for  comparable investigations of any bacterial cell envelope  protein.  %%%  The proposed research will study how iron passes through a  membrane.  We will use the  bacterial outer membrane as a  prototype for this process, and determine how a protein  within this membrane, called FepA, recognize, binds, and  internalizes the molecules of ion that it encounters in the  environment.  We will use both genetic techniques and physic-  chemical methods to answer these question.  The proposed  experiments are deigned to identify any movement that occurs  in the membrane protein during the iron transport process  into the cell.  By studying this process in bacteria, we  hope to define a method that will lead to the understanding  of how iron transport occurs in other organisms, as well.  ***",
