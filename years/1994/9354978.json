 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics of the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) proposes a Graduate Research Traineeship  (GRT) Program in \"Integrating High Performance Computing into  Research on the Physics of Complex Materials\" (henceforth ICPCM).   The program will train five graduate students to the Ph.D. level  in physics and will prepare them for careers in industry,  research laboratories, and teaching in colleges and universities.   The fields represented in ICPCM -advanced computation, materials  science, and complex systems - are all critical and emerging  areas of science, engineering, and technology.  Further, ICPCM is  a natural area in which to train students, for the combination of  skills required to master this area provides excellent  preparation for a variety of later careers.  The UIUC provides an  ideal environment for such a ICPCM program, for it combines  internationally recognized research strengths across the whole  range of materials with equally distinguished strengths in  computation and computational physics.    The ensuing proposal details the scientific focus of the  proposal, describes the commitment of the Physics Department to  provide additional courses, supplemental training, and new  workstation and laboratory space, and outlines plans for summer  school and other activities, including providing advanced  training for students and faculty at historically minority  institutions to facilitate the transition to graduate programs  for talented minority students.",
