 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316365  Cohlberg     Research will be conducted on the pathway and mechanisms  of assembly of mammalian neurofilaments from their  constituent proteins and the role of phosphorylation in  regulating the assembly process and the properties of the  filaments.  The goals are to: 1, gain information about the  arrangement of the three proteins in neurofilaments (NF),  their structural roles, and the pathway by which they  assemble into filaments and by which they become  incorporated in preexisting filaments; 2, investigate the  role of phosphorylation in regulating assembly and in  molecular conformation of the proteins; and 3, gain  information  on the protein kinase enzymes which regulate  neurofilament phosphorylation.  The first phase of the  project will center on the role of certain mixed tetramer  assembly intermediates, one containing both NF-L and NF-M  and another containing NF-L and NF-H.  The presence of these  species is detected by polyacrylamide \"native gel\"  electrophoresis.  The arrangement of polypeptide chains in  the complex will be investigated  by electron microscopy of  rotary shadowed protein preparations and by experiments  examining the ability of chemically cross-linked proteins to  form the tetrameric complexes.  Proteins produced by  recombinant DNA techniques will be used to determine the  nature of the specific chemical interactions which determine  the rules by which the three proteins combine.  NF proteins  contain three domains -- a central rod domain which forms  the body of the filament, a head domain important in the  assembly of the rods, and tail domains which project from  the filament.  By cutting the DNA from the genes for the  proteins into fragments encoding the individual domains and  then pasting the fragments together in various combinations,  and then expressing the resultant DNAs in bacteria, once can  swap domains and produce a modular protein with domains  derived from different members of the NF triplet.  Determining the ability of these modular  proteins to combine  with each other should help to determine the roles of  different domains in the specific interactions which  determine the arrangement of the three NF proteins in  filaments.  The effect of phosphorylation of the head  domains of NF-M and NF-H on assembly will be determined by  adding phosphates with the use of enzymes known to  phosphorylate these domains and then conducting  centrifugation experiments to examine the ability of the  phosphorylated proteins to form pelletable filaments.   The  effect of tail domain phosphorylation on protein  conformation will be investigated by using kinase and  phosphatase enzymes to prepare NF in different states of  phosphorylation and then to measure their circular dichroism  and infrared spectra.  Protein kinases which catalyze NF  phosphorylation will be identified from neuronal extracts.  The action of the enzyme, glycogen synthase kinase 3, shown  in previous work to phosphorylate NF in vitro, will be  further characterized.  %%%  Neurofilaments (NF) are those members of the family of  \"intermediate filaments\" which form part of the cytoskeleton  in neurons of the central nervous system.  They are found  primarily running longitudinally down the axon along with  microtubules, and they are thought to be responsible for  promoting the radial growth of axons, establishing axonal  diameter, and maintaining the structural integrity of the  axon and its resistance to compressive forces.  The are  composed of three \"NF triplet\" proteins, termed NF-H (high),  NF-M (middle), and NF-L (low) according to their molecular  weights.  These proteins are synthesized in the cell body  and move down the axon in a process termed \"slow axonal  transport,\" eventually leaving the moving phase and becoming  incorporated into the stationary filament network.  As they  move down the axon, phosphate groups are added, primarily to  the carboxyl-terminal \"tail\" domains which project from the  filaments.  A number of diseases of motor neurons involve  abnormal  NF, and overexpression of either NF-L or NF-H in  mice leads to pathology very similar to amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (\"Lou Gherig's disease\").  In addition, in this  and other neuropathologies, abnormally phosphorylated NF  accumulate in different parts of the neuron.  In addition to  the obvious relevance to health and the normal function of  CNS neurons, these biochemical studies of NF can be expected  to lead to insights into \"general principles\" of  cytoskeletal assembly in other intermediate filament  systems.  The mechanism of self-assembly of biological  polymers is of particular interest in the area of  biomolecular materials, materials science, and materials and  nanofabrication engineering, since the underlying  principles, and even the biological polymers themselves,  have potential for adaptation and commercial exploitation as  \"smart\" materials for a variety of uses.  ***",
