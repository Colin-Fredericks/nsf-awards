 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project  in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the   Chemistry Division, Prof. R.E. Miller of the University of North Carolina   at Chapel Hill will continue a research program on problems of the   dynamics of energy transfer, specifically those present in weakly bound   molecular complexes and in molecule-surface interactions.  For the weakly   bound complexes there will be spectroscopic characterization to determine   the details of photodissociation dynamics and the associated potential   energy surfaces, as well as the state-to-state probing of the fragments   resulting from phtodissociation.  These experiments are extended into the   realm of gas-surface scattering, especially that of scattering of   non-linear molecules and the vibrational and rotational energies   transferred in this process.    The dynamics of chemical reactions stands at the forefront of   contemporary research in physical chemistry. The purpose is to obtain a   detailed understanding of  reaction processes at the molecular level.    Systems that are investigated include stable molecules, weakly bound   complexes composed of stable molecules, and molecules interacting with   solid surfaces in a scattering process.  Gas phase molecules or complexes   elevated to high electronic, vibrational or rotational states of energy   by photoexcitation often dissociate into fragments having characteristic   energy distributions in the electronic, vibrational, rotational, and   translational degrees of freedom.  Since there are usually several   possible paths along which a dissociation process is allowed to occur, it   is important to understand the details of these processes to allow   correct modeling of the overall reaction phenomenon.  Similar reasons   guide the research in scattering of molecules by solid surfaces,   especially those that play a role in catalytic reactions.",
