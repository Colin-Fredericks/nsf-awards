The  importance of mechanical forces on plant responses to the  environment have historically been greatly under-appreciated  and relatively little attention is given to this  environmental stimulus in basic plant research.  However,  numerous observations point to the fundamental importance of  mechano-stimulation in plants both for pattern formation and  for adaptive responses to the environment.  Although  physiological studies of these effects have been carried out  in a number of species, molecular and genetic  characterization of the mechanosensory pathway(s) involved  have not been described.  Such an analysis would develop an  understanding of not only mechanosensory signaling, but also  of  how this pathway intersects with and integrates with  transduction pathways from other environmental stimuli.  This laboratory has previously discovered both a rapid  molecular response -- induction of the TCH (\"touch\") genes -  - and morphogenetic effects of mechano-stimulation in  Arabidopsis.  More recently, it has been shown with  transgenic aqueorin-containing seedlings that, like tabacco,  Arabidopsis also responds to mechano-stimulation with an  immediate and brief elevatimn of cytosolic  Ca2+ .  That  Ca2+ may act as 2nd messenger in transducing mechanical  stimuli into nuclear gene activation events is supported by  the observations that exogenously added Ca2+ can induce TCH  gene expression in cultured cells and that three of the five  identified TCH genes encode proteins with predicted CA2+ -  binding domains, one being calmodulin.  It is also possible  that either or both of these molecular mechano-responses  (Ca2+ elevation and TCH gene activation) may regulate  subsequent developmental events, e.g. inhibition of  elongation and delay of flowering.  Two classes of  transgenic Arabidopsis plants have been created, each of  which translates one of these early m echano-responses into a  light emission response.  One class, containing a  TCH4:luciferase (Luc) gene fusion, monitors TCH4 gene  activation; the other, containing a constitutively expressed  CaMV 35S:aqueorin gene fusion, monitors cytosolic CA2+  elevation.  A low-light imaging system has been set up, and  experimental conditions determined, to permit identification  of mechanosensory mutants with aberrant luminescent  phenotypes.  Such mutants will allow the specific targeting  of the early signaling events in mechanoperception, whereas  mutants identified on the basis of altered morphogenetic  responses to mechano-stimulation may often be defective in  executing basic developmental responses (e.g. cell  elongation) common to many signaling pathways.  Mechanosensory mutants identified in these screens will be  subjected to genetic and physiological analysis to begin  establishing maps of signaling circuitry within the cell,  while efforts to map and clone the genes are undertaken to  initiate a molecular characterization of the mechanosensory  pathway.  %%%       This research aims to expand our understanding of  how  organisms sense and respond to physical (also referred to as  \"mechanical) stimulation in a process known as  \"mechanosensing\".  Although the property of mechanosensing  is usually associated with the specialized sensory cells  involved in hearing, balance, proprioception and touch, it  is in fact a general property exhibited by cells when they  are touched, rubbed, flexed, stretched, compressed or  vibrated.  Such stimulation can arise both externally, as in  the flexing of plants and trees by wind and rain, or  internally, as in the rhythmic pulsing of blood against the  walls of the vascular system, and can profoundly influence  the growth, development and functioning of plants and  animals alike.  In humans and other mammals, mechanosensing  is critically involved in the bone-building processes  elicited by the compressive force of gravity on the  skeleton; in the normal and  pathological (e.g.  atherosclerotic) responses of the vascular lining to the  sheer forces generated by flowing blood; in the production  of surfactant by stretching lung cells, which eases the work  of lung expansion; in modifying the structure and properties  of skeletal muscle in response to stretching, or the  enlargement of an over-worked heart (cardiac hypertrophy) in  response to elevated blood pressure; and in the relaxation  of smooth muscle lining a distending bladder.  As for  plants, horticulturalists and farmers have long appreciated  that wind-induced flexing decreases both the size and yield  of crop plants, and that mechanostimulation in general slows  the development of plants.  It has been shown further that  mechanical perturbation affects a plant's responses to many  other environmental stimuli, such as gravity, light, cold  and drought stress.  Even a plant's differentiation into its  characteristic form can be altered by imposing external  physical constraints on the developing plant.  This research  program utilizes the model genetic organism, Arabidopsis ( a  small mustard plant), to dissect the mechanosensory process.  It has been engineered so as to have a novel phenotype  whereby it emits light in response to mechanostimulatory  treatments.  This easily assayable response should enable  the rapid identification of plants which have mutations in  components of the mechanosensory pathway, and will permit  the molecular characterization of the cell machinery  responsible for this cellular property.  Apparent  similarities so far uncovered in the mechanosensory  processes of plant and animal cells suggest that the fuller  knowledge of mechanosensing gained from this investigation  may well have biomedical as well as agricultural benefits.  ***",
