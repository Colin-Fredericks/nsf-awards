 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  high end computing and scientific visualization facility  will  be  acquired with Academic Research Infrastructure Program  funds  to  support  a  broad spectrum of research and research  training  initiatives in science and engineering. The facility will contain  an  eight-processor  Silicon Graphics Power Challenge  XL  server  with  1  GB  of  memory, a 20 GB internal disk,  a  tape  /CD-ROM  jukebox  and  4  high  end  Silicon  Graphics  workstations.  The  satellite  visualization clusters will be located in the  College  of  Engineering  and  College of Arts  and  Sciences.  The  Power  Challenge  XL will be the principal cycle server for large  scale  simulations  and  parallel  algorithm  development  and  can   be  upgraded to 16 processors in the future. The three main areas  of  research include: 1) the modeling of advanced materials including  the  growth,  structure, and dynamics of  polymer  blends,  metal  surfaces, intermetallics, alloys and disordered magnets;  2)  the  reaction  dynamics  of  atomic  and molecular  systems  including  electonic processes in the collisions of atoms with electrons and  ions,  photoprocesses in atoms, and gas-phase  reaction  dynamics  and  molecular  spectroscopy;  3)  computational  fluid  dynamics  involving  turbulent reactive flows typical of those involved  in  the manufacturing of various materials.    A    state-of-the-art   eight-processor   computer   with    four  workstations will be acquired for a new computing facility, which  will feature three satellite visualization clusters. The facility  will  be  used primarily by faculty in the Departments of Physics  and  Chemistry and by faculty in the College of Engineering.  The  research  will focus on modeling of advanced materials,  reaction  dynamics of atomic and molecular systems and computational  fluid  dynamics.",
