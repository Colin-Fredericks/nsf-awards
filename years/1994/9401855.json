 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401855  Smith       This award supports mathematical research focusing on  applications of harmonic analysis to problems in the theory of  hyperbolic differential equations.  Work includes the development  of estimates for the wave group with Dirichlet conditions on  manifolds similar to that obtained with the additional condition  that the boundaries be concave.  Estimates fail on manifolds with  convex boundaries although in these instances there exist  multiply reflected geodesics producing gliding rays which travel  along the boundary.  It is therefore of interest to find  worst case example where the estimates fail and try to obtain  newer estimates for this situation.  Work will also be done on  the Hardy space for Fourier integral operators.  Efforts will go  into analyzing a new function space on which the algebra of  Fourier integral operators of order zero act continuously.   Certain operators associated with oscillatory problems are not  bounded on the standard Hardy spaces will remain bounded on the  new spaces. One of the first tasks is to obtain an alternate  characterization of the space.  Finally, work will be done  constructing frames for square integrable functions which  diagonalize the wave group.         Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics best  exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are  examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing a continuous decomposition. More recently the  wavelet theory added new dimensions to some of the more classical  approaches to harmonic analysis.***",
