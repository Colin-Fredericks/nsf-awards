 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322738  Kustin    The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project  between Dr. Kenneth Kustin of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos  Orban of Eotvos University, Budapest, is to examine oscillating  chemical reactions in three major areas.  First, a number of  systems involving bromite ion, formaldehyde, molecular oxygen and  both homogeneous and heterogeneous transition metal-catalyzed  reactions will be studied for possible new oscillating reactions.   Second, mechanistic studies will be performed on several  oscillatory systems and related subsystems including permanganate  reactions and sulfur-containing reactions.  Finally, research  will be carried out on reactions in which spatial patterns and  chemical waves occur.  These studies will probe Turning patterns,  the effects of magnetic fields on chemical waves and the design  of new chemical systems that show pattern formation.  The  combined results are expected to lead to new advances in basic  chemical kinetics and, potentially, to applications in biological  and industrial processes.    This project in chemical dynamics fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.   ***",
