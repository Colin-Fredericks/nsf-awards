 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454707  Shacklett    The NSF Networking Infrastructure for Education Planning Grant will provide a process model  for integrating a networking infrastructure into the Morse High School Center for Technology  and Pacific Rim Studies magnet. The infrastructure will support Morse High School's effort to  implement reform concepts contained in the master plan for high schools in California: Second  to None: A Vision of the New California High School. The project centers on the development  of an interdisciplinary career path curriculum supported by multimedia technology. The goal of  the proposed educational reform is that every high school graduate will have the knowledge and  skills needed to make the choice of entering a career path in the work force or to continue in  post secondary education.    Statement of Objectives    By the end of the planning grant period, October 1994 through September 1995, the project will  have developed a process model for implementing Second to None that includes the following  components:           a process for developing an interdisciplinary curriculum for one of the five magnet       career paths           a process for delivering staff development for teachers and other staff functioning in       a Second to None teaching and learning environment           a process for involving industry as full partners in the Second to None teaching and       learning environment           a process for integrating a networking infrastructure that will support and enhance       student learning, staff development, industry and parent/community involvement, and       administration/classroom management.    Methods to be Employed     In developing the career path curriculum, Morse will be working with the Education Committee  of the San Diego Biomedical Industry Council (BIC), an association of 60 pharmaceutical,  biotechnology and biomedical device companies in S.D. County. The BIC will provide an  industry team to join with an interdisciplinary school team in developing a c urriculum centered  on producing a product related to the industry. Students from various disciplines (industrial  technology, marketing, math, science, English, social studies) will be recruited for the new  biomedical career path to design, produce and market a product. The curriculum will be based  on the four areas of research and development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and marketing.  In developing the curriculum, project planners will develop new teaching and learning strategies  which are supported by state-of-the-art technology.      Significance of the protect     The project will result in a process model that can be used by other schools which are  integrating technology and implementing educational reforms to improve the learning experience  and outcomes for students. The model can be followed by interested individuals, schools, and  other organizations through monthly progress updates posted to the World Wide Web of the  Internet. The project will also produce a course catalog describing how courses incorporate  career paths and use technology.",
