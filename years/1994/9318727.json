The third characteristic of this radiation,  its polarization, has not been measured as precisely.  The  amplitude of the linear polarization and its angular  coherence length are extremely sensitive to both the source  of anisotropy (density perturbations or gravitational waves)  and the ionization history of the universe.  The predicted  polarization amplitude is 10% of the size of the COBE/DMR  anisotropy signals at 7, or T/T110-6.  This grant will  support o perform the first measurements optimized for this  angular scale and smaller.   It will use new receiver  technology with 100 times more sensitivity than previous  polarization experiments, as well as a novel instrument  design.  It is expected to reach a factor of about 100 below  present upper limits at this scale.  An improved upper  limit, or detection of polarization will help to:      determine whether the large-scale anisotrophies were    generated by density perturbations or by gravitational    waves    determine if recombination was instantaneous    determine the redshift of reionization    study the correlation of anisotropy with polarization    constrain possible alternative sources of polarization of    the CMBR such as axions, cosmic strings, and textures              The project will measure CMBR polarization, first  at large angular scales (7) and later at smaller scales (1).  Two novel polarimeters optimized specifically for both  measurements are being constructed.  They will operate at  two different millimeter wavelengths to reject foreground  emission from synchrotron radiation and feature strictly-  controlled systematic effects and the high sensitivity  required to reach the expected signal level.        ***",
