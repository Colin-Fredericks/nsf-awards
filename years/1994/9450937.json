 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has improved the psychobiology laboratory at the  institution, and is affecting upper division courses in both the  psychology and biology departments. Equipment includes an  18-channel computerized locomotor-activity monitor for rodents.  Monitoring of locomotor activity is an extremely convenient  procedure for the study of the temporal organization of behavior.  As part of ongoing courses, psychology students monitor locomotor  activity to learn about the sensory and neural mechanisms of  circadian rhythmicity. Biology students monitor activity to learn  about the endocrine control of estrous cyclicity. This new,  computerized equipment also allows all students more individualized  experience in the laboratory and provides a  continuous recording  of animal activity over time. Overall, the project will provide a  significant improvement in the training of students in  psychobiology and will serve as a model for other institutions  involved in undergraduate teaching of psychology and biology.",
