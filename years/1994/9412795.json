The theme of exploring the  formation of planetary systems and the conditions for life and  intelligence in space will be used as a platform to introduce high  school students and teachers to areas of planetary science that are  pushing the limits of ground-based and space-based astronomical  technology.  Discussions of how astronomers are using the  telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and in space to search for evidence  of planet formation in other solar systems will:    (i) open up a new awareness of the forefront of astronomical  research in Hawaii and supported by NSF and     (ii) will provide an exciting basis for young students to consider  careers in astronomy and finally     (iii) will provide a wealth of new teaching materials to science  educators at the high school level.      One of the primary goals is to make the TOPS theme a means by which  new educational materials are introduced to high school teachers so  that they could better bring stimulating science into the classroom  at the ages when students are first beginning to think about  potential careers.  The workshop consists of lectures, equipment  demonstrations, science experiment demonstrations, joint and  separate student-teacher activities, computer demonstrations,  discussion groups about careers and job opportunities, a tour of  the Mauna Kea Observatory facilities, and a nighttime observing  session.",
