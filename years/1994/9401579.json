 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401579  Stein        The work of all investigators supported by this grant  revolves around central issues of harmonic analysis and partial  differential equations with applications to mathematical physics,  geometry, fluid mechanics.  Investigations into areas of Fourier  analysis related to oscillatory integrals, the Heisenberg group,  Hardy-space theory, the theory of para-products and several  complex variables will be carried out.  Among the problems to be  investigated are the asymptotic formula for the energy of the  ground state of a large atom, nodal domains for eigenfunctions of  Laplacians, Navier-Stokes equations, Szego-limit theorems for  eigenvalues and the behavior of Bergman and Szego projections.        Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  Harmonic analysis combines  those elements of mathematics best exemplifying the ideas of  synthesis.  One seeks to decompose complex problems into  fundamental components.  These components are then analyzed for  their basic characteristics.  Finally, the solution is  reconstructed through a recombination of the components.  The  Fourier series and Fourier transform are examples of tools used  in this context; one discrete , the other representing a  continuous decomposition. More recently the wavelet theory added  new dimensions to some of the more classical approaches to  harmonic analysis.  ***",
