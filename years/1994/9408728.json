Based on an extensive program of  contemporary (1965-70) fieldwork in 1002 communities across the U.S.,  and an equally extensive collection of written sources from the  seventeenth century through the present, DARE includes words, phrases,  and pronunciations that vary from one part of the country to another or  from one social group to another. The Dictionary provides full  historical treatment, with pronunciations, variant forms, etymologies,  regional labels, social and usage labels, definitions, dated quotations,  and cross-references, as appropriate. A unique feature of DARE is the  inclusion (within the text) of maps showing the regional distribution of  words, phrases, and forms. Volume I, containing introductory matter and  the letters A-C, was published in 1985 to the acclaim of scholars,  reviewers, and the public as well. Volume II (D-H) was published in  1991, and Volume III (I-O) is scheduled to appear in 1996. Three more  volumes, the last of which will also contain the bibliography, a  cumulative index, contrastive regional and social maps, and a summary of  all responses collected in the fieldwork, will complete the project.  Volumes will appear at approximately five-year intervals. DARE will not  only provide a full record of regional American English, but will also  furnish, both in the Dictionary text and in the raw materials, the  resources to stimulate much further linguistic research.    ***",
