 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316934  Herzberg  The three dimensional structures of proteins involved in phosphoryl  group transfer reactions will be determined by X-ray  crystallography and the reaction mechanism will be investigated  using a combination of crystallographic and site-directed  mutagenesis approaches.  The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar  phosphotransferase system (PTS) studied during the previous funding  period will be investigated further.  The project will also include  another enzyme, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which shows  sequence homology  to Enzyme I of the PTS.  The PTS is a multi-  enzyme system that regulates sugar transport across the membrane by  a phosphoryl group transfer chain.  The crystal structures of two  of the PTS components, HPr and the IIA domain of the glucose  permease, have been determined by us during the last two years, and  much learned about the nature of the phosphoryl transfer reaction  between them at the atomic level.  The proposed work will draw on  these findings and test our understanding by engineering altered  phosphorylation specificity of the glucose IIA domain.  The  designed mutants will be analyzed biochemically, as well as by X-  ray crystallography, to understand the reasons for success or  failure.  The second part of the studies of the PTS is the  structure determination by MIR methods of the first protein in the  phosphotransfer chain, Enzyme I, which has been recently  crystallized.  This will provide a complete structural basis for  future investigations of the soluble proteins of the system.  The  structure determination will be followed by inhibitor binding  studies to elucidate the mechanism of phosphorylation by  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and of phosphoryl transfer to HPr.  The  third part is the completion of the structural comparison between  the high and low salt forms of HPr, and the structure refinement of  the HPr mutant H15A.  This work is important for resolving a  current controversy related to the question whether phosphorylation  of HPr i s associated with a conformational transition of the  backbone.  Our data shows that this is not the case.  In addition  to work on the PTS, the scope of the project has been expanded to  include PPDK, a multi-domain enzyme that catalyses the inter-  conversion of PEP and ATP.  Its sequence homology to Enzyme I stems  from the common substrate, PEP.  PPDK catalyses a total of three  phosphoryl group transfers, one of which involves a pyrophosphate  intermediate, an unprecedented intermediate in enzymatic phosphoryl  transfer reactions.  The structure determination of the Clostridium  symbiosum enzyme will facilitate inhibitor binding studies and  mutagenesis work that probe the various mechanistic aspects of this  complex enzyme.  The nature of the conformational transition  associated with the phosphoryl group transfers, which is proposed  to be substantial, will be revealed by these structural studies.  %%%  The goal of the proposed studies is to gain better understanding of  the nature of regulation by protein phosphorylations, reactions  which are central to a wide range of biological processes.  A  combination of X-ray crystallography and protein engineering  techniques will be used to elucidate the three dimensional  structure of the proteins, and to probe their function by binding  studies in the crystals, and by site-directed mutagenesis  approaches.  Two systems that utilize multi-phosphotransfer  reactions have been selected:  (a) A phosphoryl transfer chain that  mediates sugar uptake across the membrane in bacteria.  The three  soluble proteins involved, Enzyme I, HPr and Enzyme IIA will be  investigated. (b) The enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase that  catalyses the inter-conversion of two high energy compounds, ATP  and PEP, in some bacteria and plants.  ***",
