 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Infrastructure equipment proposal requests funds  to establish a Core Facility for DNA sequencing by purchasing (1) an  Applied Biosystems model 373 automated DNA sequencer, (2) GeneAmp PCR  System 9600 thermal cycler, (3) Tektronix Phaser 200e printer, (d~)  Genescan 672 software kit, (5) Genotyper software and (6) Sequence  Navigator Software (7) Power Mac 8100. The Applied Biosvstems model 373  DNA sequence is a state-of-the-art instrument for many primer based DNA  analyses including DNA sequencing, sizing and quantitation. The machine  will be used by research faculty at the University of Alaska Fairbanks  and will augment productivity of our molecular genetics sequencing  group in addition to graduate and undergraduate teaching. The molecular  genetics sequencing group (MGS) has seven core and seven affiliate  faculty. All projects within the MGS use some form of primer based DNA  analysis. The development of a Core Facility for DNA Sequencing will  have a major impact on research productivity. Because manual sequencing  of DNA is highly labor intensive, molecular biologists, who use DNA  sequencing, have generally limited themselves to relatively few ongoing  research projects and even fewer collaborations with colleagues whose  important biological questions might be elucidated by sequence  analyses. Development of a Core Facility for DNA Sequencing can only  reduce the labor expenditure of technician time and thus allow for  larger numbers of cross-disciplinary and international collaborative  projects.    The MGS core faculty include three molecular systematizes and four  molecular biologists. The seven affiliate faculty members have a wide  range of research interests including physiology, wildlife biology and  marine sciences. The common denominators among all members of the MGS  faculty is that they work on biological research projects in the Arctic  or Subarctic and acquisition of DNA sequence or size information is a  significant component of their research  programs. Research excellence  is evident from the past and ongoing research activities of the  individual investigators within the MGS group. Development of the Core  Facility for DNA Sequencing will foster continued growth and research  excellence by enhancing existing research projects and providing  additional opportunities for new projects. Below we describe the use,  application, and overall impact of a Core Facility for DNA Sequencing.",
