 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450703  Moore  Massive reform can start with small steps, particularly when the  politics of change are so complex.  Change in the chemistry  curriculum must meet the needs of science and engineering  departments whose students we serve, as well as the needs of the  chemistry major going into industry or graduate school, and the  liberal arts conscripts to chemistry courses.  In order to make  inroads toward change we must find a path that makes possible a  curriculum that can be modified continually, is usable in a variety  of institutions, can accommodate the increasingly diverse group of  students we need to serve, and encourages participation of faculty  and students alike.  The in- and out-of-classroom experience must  incorporate new technologies to aid the students in accessing,  organizing, filtering and assimilating scientific information.  We  must revise our model of curriculum across the rapidly blurring  boundaries of the subdisciplines of chemistry, and the disciplines  of all sciences.  We propose to develop self-contained modules, at all levels of the  chemistry curriculum, that can be used for 2-4 weeks in a lecture  or laboratory course,  The instructional tools developed for the  module will include software, videos, interactive CD's and other  resource material that can replace or greatly augment traditional  texts and problem to interest the students and will be developed in  an interdisciplinary manner.  Core concepts from the essential  chemistry \"tool kit\" will be included in each module and an  instructor could select a variety of modules in order to cover the  same core concepts.  This is more than a repacking of chemistry, it  is the beginning of ongoing systemic change that allows for all  faculty, innovative or traditional, to use new approaches and  contexts in their classrooms.  A consortium of schools, predominantly from California -- the  University of California, the California State University, the two-  year Colleges, private institutions -- as well as three   institutions from Atlanta, Georgia will serve as the working  partners to establish the design and testing of the modules.",
