 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451301  Peterson  Economics courses at Furman University seek to acquaint students  with the \"economic way of thinking.\" We want majors to understand  the thought processes involved in specifying an economic theory,  deriving implications from that theory, and testing the theory  using data from the real world. We hope that by the end of their  undergraduate education they will be able to view theoretical  arguments critically and begin to generate and test some simple  theories of their own. We want our students (majors and non-majors)  to know why economic thinking is important and to appreciate the  dynamic relationship between economic behavior and economic  institutions. Historically, lecture and textbook assignments,  supplemented with data and anecdotes from journals, magazines, and  newspapers, have been the principal classroom tools. Recent  technological developments have facilitated the use of a more  \"active\" set of teaching tools in economics which include data  viewing, transformation, and analysis; model creation, comparative  statics, and sensitivity analysis; and macro- and microeconomic  simulations. A computer laboratory with twenty-six workstations and  software for data analysis, mathematical modeling, and economic  simulations will be used to implement the full range of these  active-learning techniques. When combined with the appropriate  laboratory exercises in the principles, theory, econometrics, and  topics courses, the laboratory will help our students develop \"the  economic way of thinking\" and it will enable us to achieve our  curricular goals.",
