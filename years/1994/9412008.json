This instrument is urgently needed to sustain rapid progress in the development of high resolution x-ray microscopy.  X-ray microscopy is now a pivotal core technology to the use of in-vitro analysis of sub-cellar features of biological structures each as human chromosomes, and to the development of x-ray assayiny techniques for computer chip manufacture.  We have established at the Laser Plasma Laboratory (LPL) at CREOL, the only university development program in the these technologies that is based on the promising use of compact laser plasma sources.  Six faculty members and over 15 graduate and undergraduate students are associated with this program.  In the past year, our success in establishing a dedicated laser plasma x-ray microscopy facility has resulted in the wide recognition of the potential this technology, and broad interest expressed by a large number of researchers, in this country and abroad, in partnering with us to bring this technology to the threshold for commercial development.  Moreover, to encourage the latter, we are now collaborating with a number of American companies who wish to exploit this technology.  ***",
