 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313645  Kleinman  This proposal concerns a numerical and methodological first  principles approach to the calculation of the electronic structure  of large unit-cell systems both at zero and finite temperature with  a view to finding heats of formation, surface energies, surface  magnetism, elastic constants and so on. Specific systems for study  include 1) Boron carbides 2) Ge-GaAs interfaces 3) Rh(001) surfaces  4) NaK alloys and 5) Gd(001) surfaces. Work also continues with the  development of better pseudopotentials and better density  functionals for exchange and correlation - with a specific view to  improving descriptions of f-electron states.  %%%  The work described here is at the cutting edge of the general area  of calculating materials propoerties from a first-principles  atomistic approach. Metallic and semiconducting systems will be  studied as well as the more problematic heavy-metals. The proposal  concerns not only sophisticated \"number crunching\" to get at  specific properties of interest such as surface magnetism, melting  points of alloys, elastic constants etc., but also the basics of  how to do ever more reliable and yet faster calculations. This work  is in the top league of computational materials science in this  country.  ***",
