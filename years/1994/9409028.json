 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coe    With National Science Foundation support, the Yale Peabody Museum  of Natural History will computerize the catalogue records of its  Mesoamerican and South American archaeological collections. The  collections have been acquired over a period of more than 130  years and constitute a significant body of material of great  temporal depth and spatial breadth. They have been crucial in  solving important culture-history questions and continue to  provide a valuable resource for the study of pre-Conquest,  complex cultures. The collections include material acquired  through systematic excavations from the Andean area in the south  to the Valley of Mexico in the north. Currently these collections  are recorded in 66,000 catalogue entries in handwritten, bound  ledgers. This paper-based format makes access to crucial  descriptive data difficult and novel searches of the data are  impossible. With NSF support, this information will be entered  into Peabody Museum's computerized relational database system.  This will permit quick and efficient access and significantly  enhance the research potential of the collection. The system will  also make the data available over Internet, greatly increasing  opportunities for use.    Museum collections contain valuable information which permit  researchers to examine many scientific questions. The Peabody  materials can shed new light on how complex societies develop and  are maintained. They can illuminate principles of social  organization and change in technologically simple societies and  increase our understanding of human - environment interactions.  This grant is important because it will significantly increase  the research potential of the collections.",
