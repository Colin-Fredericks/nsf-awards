She will determine the carbon isotopic ratios of amino acids  extracted from the bone collagen of seven Native American  skeletons. All are well dated and derive from secure archaeological  contexts. For 6, it is known whether or not corn formed part of the  diet and these will serve as partial controls. The seventh is an  unknown of archaeological interest.    For some time paleoanthropologists have realized that the diet of  an individual is reflected in the chemical composition of the  skeleton and this archaeological tool has been used to great  advantage. Attention has focussed on the introduction of corn into  prehistoric Native American diet in part because it is amenable to  such analysis but also because archaeologists have postulated that  the growth of complexity in such societies may be directly tied to  corn cultivation. In the Midwest, where corn has a distinctive  carbon isotope signature this approach has worked relatively well.  In the drier West however other plants also have cornlike carbon  isotope ratios and the procedure has proven more difficult to  apply. Ms. Coltrain will deal with this by analyzing the isotopic  ratios of individual amino acids rather than use bulk collagen as  is normally done. She believes that on this micro-level it should  be possible to a pattern which is unique to corn.    This research is important for several reasons. The technique being  developed should be useable in a wide range or archaeological  situations. It will also shed new light on the prehistory of the   U.S. West and contribute to the training of a promising young  scientist.  ***",
