 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various aspects of machine learning have been under  empirical  investigation for quite some time.  And, more  recently, theoretical studies  have become popular.  This  research contributes towards the goal of  understanding  how a computer can be programmed to learn by isolating  features  of incremental learning algorithms that  theoretically enhance their learning  potential.  In addition  to pursuing lines of research that have already been  established with a firm base, investigations of other topics  in machine  learning are initiated; for example,  investigating learning algorithms with  a limited ability to  remember observed data and other information.    Inductive  inference is in some sense the dual of program  testing. For the inference  problem, one must generalize from  a finite set of examples to an entire  function or concept.  The testing problem requires the formulation of a finite  test set that distinguishes a given function from all the  others in a given  class.  The program testing problem is  more difficult than the program  equivalence problem, hence  it is highly unsolvable. Consequently, practitioners  are  doomed to ad hoc techniques. However, it is possible to  discuss testing  strategies that give an indication of how  confident we are that the program  being tested is reliable.    In another vein, the complexity of certain problems  is studied.  Some of the earlier work in recursive graph theory  has now  been applied to the complexity of NP-hard problems.  This work is extended  to problems in P.   The complexity of Boolean functions is also  investigated.",
