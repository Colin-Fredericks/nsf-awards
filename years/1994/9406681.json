 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406681  Braiman  Miniature waveguide sensors will be used to detect IR absorbance  changes associated with voltage-induced conformational  transitions in membrane proteins.  The motivation for  miniaturization of the sensors is to permit in situ observation  of IR spectra from membranes of intact individual cells.  This,  in turn, will allow IR spectroscopy to be performed as a function  of cell membrane potential, which can be controlled by using a  whole-cell voltage clamp.  Sensitive voltage-dependent IR  difference spectra should thus reveal how the living cell's  membrane components responds to transient shifts in transmembrane  voltage.  A particular goal of this approach is to allow  investigation of a variety of ion channel proteins expressed at  high levels in single frog oocytes.  These IR spectroscopic  studies of biomembranes will depend heavily on the development of  evanescent-wave sensors based on thin-film dielectric waveguides.   A living cell's plasma membrane will be held in contact with a  thin film of Ge deposited on ZnS or CaF2 substrate.  A portion of  IR light passing through the waveguide is carried in an  evanescent wave that can be absorbed by molecules in the  membrane.  The wavelength dependence of this absorption will  provide information about the vibrational modes, and thus the  structures, of the lipid and protein molecules in the membrane.    %%%  Miniaturized biomembrane sensors based on waveguides that conduct  infrared light will be developed.  These waveguide sensors,  consisting of thin films of infrared-transparent materials will  conduct and concentrate infrared light into a small tapered  region where the waveguide can be held in close contact with the  membrane of a single cell, such as a 1-mm-dia. frog egg cell.   Although most of the infrared light passing through the waveguide  will be confined to the interior of the germanium film, a  significant fraction of the light energy will be conducted in a  micron-thick region outside the waveguide.  This s o-called  evanescent wave must therefore pass through the membrane of the  cell.  Selective absorption of different infrared wavelengths by  the cell membrane's components will be the basis for  spectroscopic analysis of their chemical structures.  A  particular goal is a basic understanding of how various ion-  channel proteins (responsible, e.g., for neuronal signaling)  change in structure in response to the varying transmembrane  voltages found in living cells.  However, this research should  also advance our national technical capabilities in the sensitive  chemical analysis of a wide variety of tiny samples, which may be  of importance for such varied tasks as environmental monitoring  and industrial process control.  ***",
