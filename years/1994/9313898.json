 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313898  Willsky    This three-year awards supports ongoing U.S.-France cooperative  research in image and signal processing among investigators from  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of  California at Davis, and INRIA/Rocquencourt and Rennes (French  National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics).  The U.S. and French teams are led by Alan Willsky,  MIT, and Albert Benveniste, INRIA.  The objective of their  research is to investigate various problems in geometric  modeling, nonlinear systems, and image processing.  They will  study (1) multiresolution statistical signal and image  processing; (2) failure and event detection; (3) new approaches  to nonlinear parameter systems; and (4) discrete event systems.    The U.S. and French investigators have considerable expertise on  all these topics.  The project takes advantage in particular of  substantial French advances in nonlinear systems modeling and  different, but complementary, approaches to problems in discrete  event systems.  The French are also considered world experts in  systems described by partial differential equations.  The  collaboration will advance understanding on analysis and design  of circuits for signal processing applications.  ***",
