This project develops a model for the incorporation of  advanced instrumentation and discovery-based teaching methods into  these courses which have traditionally been taught without the  benefit of modern instrumentation. The proposed improvements will  impact most heavily five different morphology/anatomy courses with  a total enrollment of about 200 undergraduates. The project will  also benefit other courses in general botany, plant physiology and  plant ecology. This instrumentation will also be used by  undergraduates to conduct independent research projects and in  their capstone research experiences. The main focus of the  improvement will be the incorporation of modern instrumentation,  image processing, and computers into the existing discovery based  lab experience. Undergraduate majors, non-majors and pre-service  teachers will be stimulated and challenged to operate advanced  instrumentation and develop problem solving skills using the same  techniques and equipment as research plant scientists.",
