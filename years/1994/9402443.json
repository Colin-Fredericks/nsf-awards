 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402443  Jayaraman    This project will explore, characterize and attempt to rationalize  pressure-induced phase transitions in some select rare earth  containing oxide materials using mainly Raman and infrared  spectroscopy to pressures up to 50 giga pascals.  Pressure-induced  phase transitions including amorphization are observed in these  systems.  It is hoped to establish criteria for pressure-induced  amorphization by investigating the detailed behavior of some select  molybdates at high pressure and elevated temperature.  In one of  the rare earth oxides it is hoped to achieve metallization at  pressures near 40 giga pascals and test the exciting possibility of  high Tc superconductivity.  Pressure induced transitions in certain  perovskite oxides will be investigated.  The stability of the  perovskite structure at high pressure and temperature will be  examined.  The results will be significant to materials science as  well as to earth science.     % % % %    High pressure is a route to transform materials into novel states,  of interest to science and technology.  The most spectacular  example in this context is the well known conversion of graphite to  diamond under high pressure and temperature.  Current advances in  pressure generation techniques using the diamond cell make it  possible to subject materials to hitherto inaccessble regions of  simultaneous high pressure and temperature.  New pressure-induced  phase transitions with new material properties are distinct  possibilities, such as driving many insulators into metallic state,  and in some cases even into superconductors.  Surprisingly many  oxide systems turn into a new type of glasses at high pressure.   The present project will focus on several oxide systems which bear  the promise of yielding new material states of interest to  technological applications and to basic science.  ***",
