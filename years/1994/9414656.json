The research project will focus on  the mechanical behavior of non-traditional  materials such as superconductors,  piezoelectric ceramics, shape memory alloys,  and fiber optics.  Applications of these  materials are found in ground and aerial  vehicles, telecommunications, electronic  packaging, and medical instrumentation.    This research visit will promote collaborative  work among U.S. and Japanese researchers  interested in narrowing the gap that exists  among theory, experiment, and actual design and  fabrication of devices and structures.  The  laboratory at Tohoku University is widely  recognized for work on the mechanical behavior  of materials subjected to strong magnetic and  electric fields.  In addition to working at  Tohoku, the PI will visit Japanese industries,  technical institutes, and research  universities.  The visit is expected to promote  not only further U.S.-Japan collaboration, but  interaction with researchers in other  countries.  ***",
