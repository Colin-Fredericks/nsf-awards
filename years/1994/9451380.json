 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate education in the biological sciences at Iowa  State University is undergoing a dramatic change.  Beginning in  the 1993-94 academic year, a new core curriculum in biology is  being implemented, consisting of two years of integrated  instruction for all life sciences majors at Iowa State. A key  component of the second year of the biology core will be a  genetics and molecular biology laboratory course, which will  provide an important opportunity to capture the interest of  undergraduates for research opportunities both during their  undergraduate careers and beyond.   We have designed for this laboratory, a series of challenging,  project-oriented exercises that encompass both genetic  approaches to mutant characterization and the most advanced  methods in molecular biology. The project begins with the  isolation of yeast mutants perturbed in pyrimidine metabolism,  focusing on the identification of mutants in the uracil  biosynthetic gene, URA3. Students will characterize URA3  mutants by complementation analyses, and use molecular methods  to clone a wild-type URA3 gene. A computer exercise will  initially be conducted to familiarize students with the  molecular manipulations carried out in the laboratory. Students  will then proceed to amplify a wild-type copy of the URA3 gene  from genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction, to clone  this gene in a plasmid vector that can function both in E. coli  and yeast, and to characterize putative recombinants by agarose  gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization analysis. In the  final exercise, students will complement their URA3 mutants by  transforming them with the cloned, wild-type URA3 gene.   The equipment requested provides for growing and transforming  yeast, as well as DNA amplification, purification and analysis.  Iowa State University will provide an equal match for the  funding from the foundation.",
