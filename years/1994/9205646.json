 "awd_abstract_narration": "9205646  Kesler  This is a study of several important features of greenstone  gold deposits, the largest hypogene gold deposits in the  world.  Research will be on the Porcupine district, Ontario,  where high-grade gold ore is well developed and where we  have collected over 400 barren veins from an area of 2000  km2 surrounding the deposits.  Work will involve study of  the structural setting of high-grade ore, fluid inclusion  petrography and microthermometry of ore and barren veins,  and inclusion gas, stable isotope and radiogenic isotope  analyses of barren and high-grade veins.  The research will  include analysis of inclusions in gold and related minerals,  and an attempt to obtain isotopic ages on minerals from  different pasts of sheeted veins to determine the period  over which the deposits formed.  The results are expected to  provide insights into the source of the gold-forming fluid  and its relation to the evolution of Archean greenstone  terrains, as well as structural and geochemical parameters  that could guide exploration for these deposits.",
