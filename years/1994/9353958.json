 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353958  Lim  In the past few years, object-oriented technology has become  one of the dominant technologies in the computing industry.  In  a recent survey, it was reported that over 75% of the Fortune  100 companies have adopted object technology to some degree for  their computing needs.  This is in response to the increasing  software maintenance cost and backlog that is so prevalent in  the software industry.  Because object-orientation is becoming  one of the primary means for problem solving, the need to teach  object-orientation in undergraduate curriculum is growing.    The purpose of this project is to provide a two-week summer  workshop for faculty who are from institutions which lack  computing facilities to teach object-orientation and thus do  not have any formal training in this area.  The objectives are  to introduce (1) object-orientated analysis and design, (2)  object-oriented programming, (3) object oriented databases, (4)  integrating object-orientation into computer  science/information system curriculum, and (5) teaching object-  orientation to undergraduates.  The workshop includes lectures  and laboratory sessions in which participants have hands-on  exercises on each of the above main topics.  Participants  also  plan  a course or course unit utilizing object-oriented  technology at their institutions during the subsequent academic  year.  The tools used in the workshop include inexpensive or  free software that are easily obtainable by most universities  and colleges.  ***",
