 "awd_abstract_narration": "-  The proposer will investigate various questions relating to the  existence, stability, regularity, large-time behavior, and numerical  approximation of solutions of systems of certain partial differential  equations arising in the theory of viscous, compressible fluid flow.  Discontinuous solutions are of particular interest, and play a unifying  role in the project. A fairly well-developed theory has been attained  in previous work for flows in one space dimension and for flows which  are spherically symmetric.  More recent research has extended some of  these results to general multidimensional flows.  A great deal of work  remains to be done for multidimensional flows, however, and this will  occupy the greater part of the project. It is also proposed to continue  work on various issues remaining for one-dimensional flows, especially  the rigorous mathematical analysis of viscous contact discontinuities.    The proposer will study various mathematical questions concerning  important models of compressible fluid flow.  These models arise in a  broad range of applications, from supersonic flight to dynamic  meteorology, among many others.  While the main purpose for  constructing these models is to achieve a predictive capability, they  are far too complicated to be \"solved\" in any explicit sense.  On the  other hand, adequate approximate solutions can often be generated  by computer methods. However, the intelligent design of such methods  depends crucially on a rigorous understanding of why solutions do  exist, in what sense, and in what ways they are sensitive to noise in  the data.  The primary goal of this project is therefore to provide  such a rigorous mathematical analysis for these models; a secondary  objective is to apply these mathematical insights to the intelligent  design and analysis of algorithms for generating approximate  solutions.",
