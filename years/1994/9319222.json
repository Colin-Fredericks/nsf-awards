There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  This component will conduct a set of  process-oriented experiments designed to elucidate the controls  of phytoplankton productivity, growth and accumulation as well as  the mechanisms which control bacterial abundance and productivity  in Antarctic waters.  Specifically, the relative photosynthetic  and nutrient (nitrate, ammonium) characteristics of diatom- vs.  Phaeocystis-dominated assemblages will be examined to test if  Phaeocystis simply grows faster under spring conditions in the  Ross Sea.  Phytoplankton and bacterial biomass, productivity and  their interactions will be measured to elucidate the complex  physical-chemical-biological interactions which occur.   Substantial understanding of the mechanisms controlling  phytoplankton growth and productivity in spring, the implications  and short-term fate of high productivity in spring, and the  transition from spring to midsummer conditions will result from  this research.  Finally, because the Antarctic is the ocean's  largest high-nutrient, low biomass system, and hence has the  greatest potential for sequestering carbon dioxide, knowledge of  the dynamics of the Ross Sea phytoplankton will also increase our  understanding of the carb on cycle of the Southern Ocean.",
