The pilot phase will allow the investigators to (1) test the  hypothetical database form on at least three software products and  test the utility of formal options by discussing them with  potential users; (2) interview potential users (news reporters,  scholars, scientists, and secondary and university educators) to  determine what questions they will want answered and to establish  criteria for inclusion of material in database; (3) identify issue  areas and broaden database coverage to give capacity for including  all or almost all Northwest environmental issues; and (4) identify,  for software tests, a small number of summary review publications  on particular environmental issues from many different disciplines;  begin development of thesaurus and index of ordinary language and  technical terms from these. The goal is to develop a user friendly  database for people who want to make sound social judgments about  environmental issues in the Northwest.  The database should be  useful to humanities teachers and scholars, students and teachers  and the media, by giving them access to not only what other  commentators are saying but also to reviews and other summaries  about scientific aspects of these issues.  It will be useful to  scientists as well as others making social comment on science by  giving them better access to ethical perspectives and ethical  scholarship.  As information comes increasingly over computerized  networks, the development of user-friendly sources and resources  must have high priority.  This pilot provides a test of ways to  develop these sources, as well as a test of a unique resources for  U.S. citizens and scholars interested in important issues of  science and environmental policy.  ***",
