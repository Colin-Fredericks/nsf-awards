 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yashinsky  9312786    This award will support a cooperative research  project between Mr. Yashinsky, Office of  Earthquake Engineering, California Department  of Transportation (Caltrans) in Sacramento and  Dr. Kazuhiko Kawashima, Earthquake Disaster  Prevention Department, Public Works Research  Institute (PWRI) in Tsukuba, Japan.  During a  six month visit Mr. Yashinsky will conduct  research on a comparison of U.S. and Japanese  bridge foundations with emphasis on  construction techniques and seismic behavior.   He will identify how the geology, soil and  bridge characteristics relate to the choice of  a foundation.  This will be followed by an  examination of the construction techniques used  for each type of foundation.  He will then  review how the Japanese model the stiffness of  different foundations, how they input the  ground motion, techniques they use to determine  the seismic demand and capacity of the various  foundation types and how they account for  incoherence and multiple support excitation.   The collaborators will then model the different  foundations using current Caltrans computer  codes and compare their performance with  Caltrans' foundations.    The research findings could result in U.S.  bridges with a greatly  improved response to  earthquakes.  Also, the many innovative  construction techniques used for foundations in  Japan could benefit the U.S. construction  industry.  Mr. Yashinsky's expertise lies in  the area of major seismic  redesign/rehabilitation programs for bridges.   Both Dr. Kawashima and his Institute (PWRI) are  world leaders in the area of foundation design  of seismically resistant bridges.  It is  anticipated that this collaboration will  benefit both countries and will continue  informally after this project is completed.   This project is supported by the NSF-CGP  (Center for Global Partnership) Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
