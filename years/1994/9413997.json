 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Laboratory (TJL) is a national resource for  mammalian genetics research.  Its threefold mission is to 1)  Perform basic research in mammalian genetics, 2) maintain  and distribute vital genetic resources, and 3) educate  students and scientists in these areas.  Funding is  requested to obtain advanced research tools and computing  hardware that will both enhance the Laboratory's ability to  perform scientific research, and to collect and distribute  data on the mouse at an unprecedented level of resolution  and comprehensiveness.    The Laboratory currently serves as a mouse informatics  center for scientific community, compiling and preparing  genome databases available via electronic communication.  Additionally, 15,000 phone inquires concerning a wide range  of topics on mice are fielded each year by the scientific  staff.  Recently, The Laboratory has become a repository for  'induced' mutants created by modern transgenic technologies,  addition to its responsibility as a curator and provider of  genetics resources.    It is in the best interests of the scientific community for  The Laboratory to adopt the most modern and efficient  strategies to obtain, preserve and communicate the explosion  of biological data from mammalian genetics  research.  This  proposal seeks to upgrade the capabilities of TJL towards  this end through an integrated approach to basic research  and data dissemination.  The research tools requested  include a variety of instruments that have the ability to  generate and record digital biological information of the  large number of unique inbred and mutant stains of mice  maintained at TJL.  These include microscope imaging system,  a lab animal body composition analyzer, and an EEG machine.  This equipment would benefit the research of scientists at  TJL, and produce data that can be constructed on site.  To  store, organize, and disseminate this information to the  scientific community, a high capacity data storage component  is requested.  The enhanced  data storage and throughput  capabilities will be a critical addition to the ongoing work  and new initiatives of the TJL Informatics groups, and will  ultimately benefit the worldwide community by enabling the  provision of detailed biological data through enhanced  databases accessible through the Internet.",
