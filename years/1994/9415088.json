 "awd_abstract_narration": "Originally constructed thirty years ago for teaching, approximately one-half of the Physics  building now is used for research and research training.  The building is structurally sound and  has been well maintained, but it requires renovation and modernization to outfit it for the needs  of researchers.  Seventeen faculty and approximately seventy-five graduate and undergraduate  students working in the  specialty areas of Molecular Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, and  Cloud and Aerosol Science research will be beneficiaries of the Facilities award.  NSF support  will address five areas of specific need:  reconfiguration of space to provide larger laboratories;  upgrade of electrical systems; addition or replacement (as appropriate) of central HVAC service  to all labs; addition of central utility systems for exhaust and equipment cooling; and substantial  improvement to safety systems.  As Missouri's officially designated technological university,  over 90% of its 5,200 students major in engineering or science.  The Physics renovation project  will be important to continued efforts to both increase student enrollment, including attracting  women and minorities to the program, and enhance the quality of research and research training  activity.",
