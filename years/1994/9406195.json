 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406195  Kay  Throughout Tertiary time, Kamchatka has collected fragments  of continental crust (terranes) that formed as oceanic  island arcs and plateaus in the Bering Sea and the Pacific  Ocean.  Accretion of the fragments has resulted in a  subcontinental mass.  The process is thought by many to be  the main mechanism of present day continental growth.  Kamchatka is a particularly good site to study this type of  continental growth due to its youth, due to the availability  of information on similar but as yet unaccreted oceanic  fragments (especially, the Aleutian islands) and due to  widespread post-accretion magmatism that records conditions  at depth.  This investigation focuses on alkaline basaltic  magmas that originate in mantle that lies under the  Kamchatka terranes.  Existing trace element data on these  magmas lack typical signatures (e.g. high Ba/La, La/Ta  ratios), and support delamination models that call fro  wholesale replacement of mantle lithosphere by underlying  Oceanic Island Basalt (OIB)-like asthenosphere.  Isotope  analyses (Pb, Sr, Nd) as well as additional trace element  analyses will permit identification of mas reservoirs and  quantification of mas fluxes related to fundamental  processes of crustal growth and consolidation.",
