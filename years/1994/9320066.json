It will be used for several projects, including in particular: design of fully differential current-mode circuits that do not need common-mode feedback; design of analog IC's for radiation detection systems; research of superconducting technologies for the design of extremely high-speed oversampling analog-to-digital converters.     The test and measurement equipment to be purchased includes a distortion analyzer, a semiconductor parameter analyzer and a color plotter.  The distortion analyzer will be used in the design of fully differential current-mode circuits and the design of analog IC's for radiation detection systems.  It is essential for obtaining precise values of low-level noise and distortion present in analog integrated circuits.  The semiconductor parameter analyzer will also be used in these projects to obtain measurement of the characteristics of individual devices and subcircuits (e.g., a differential pair).  Such measurements are needed to determine the effects of individual device parameters on the performance of an overall large circuit.  The color plotter is to be used on all three of the projects in order to check the circuit layouts for errors before submitting the chip to the foundry.  This is particularly important for analog circuits which generally cannot be fully checked using tools optimized for checking digital circuits.  ***            E  B  TERMINALHLP           @ j       9320066  Green     The equipment purchased will be dedicated to support research in analog and digital VLSI.
