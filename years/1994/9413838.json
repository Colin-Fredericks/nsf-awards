 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9413838  Herbert Giescher    The School of Ceramic Engineering and Sciences will purchase powder and porosity characterization equipment dedicated to supporting research and education at Alfred University.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, including:  particle size characterization as a means of studying and controlling the precipitation, synthesis, and application of advanced submicron, nano-sized, ceramic powders; processing properties of concentrated powder dispersions; and the analysis of pore structure and porosity of consolidated compacts before and during the sintering process.  The instrumentation will also be used to enhance the educational program through several hands-on laboratory classes.    Future research interest is moving towards smaller particle sizes.  Preparation and processing of those materials is very important for the development of the next generation of advanced ceramic materials.  The requested instrumentation will be necessary for future research activities within the school, for collaboration with other universities, and will be essential for an adequate education of students at the New York State College of Ceramics.",
