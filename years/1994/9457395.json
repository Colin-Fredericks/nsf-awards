 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, aggressive instruction scheduling  techniques  for instruction-level parallel (ILP) processors are  investigated. ILP processors, such as superscalar and VLIW  processors, are  used effectively in both general purpose and  scientific computer systems. For  general purpose systems, the  high frequency of branch instructions creates the  need for  aggressive global scheduling techniques that support  speculatively  and conditionally executed instructions. For  scientific systems, cyclic  scheduling techniques such as software  pipelining have been developed to  aggressively schedule inner  loops. The four areas that are explored in this  project are: (1) Investigate issues associated with the software pipelining  technique and Modulo scheduling. These include scheduling while  loops, handling  loops with cross- iter\\-ation dependencies and  removing the uniform initiation  interval restriction; (2) Formalize an operation-level intermediate program  representation that allows the application of well-known local  scheduling  techniques to achieve globally scheduled code. This  approach has been  successfully applied to Modulo Scheduling and is extended to acyclic  scheduling; (3) Develop a task granularity adjustment methodology, similar in  concept to vectorization, for software pipelining in a  superscalar/VLIW based  multiple processor system; and (4) Analyze the control architectures for  superscalar  implementations of existing processors by studying the hardware  and compiler design complexities associated with scheduling multi-way  branching and partial predication architectures.",
