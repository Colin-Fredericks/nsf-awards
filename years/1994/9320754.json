 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expert judgments are key inputs in important decision-making   problems, and the elicitation and modeling of such judgments are   formalized in methodologies such as decision analysis, risk   analysis, and expert systems.  As problems grow in complexity   (e.g., multi-systems modeling for regional and global  environmental change), with many variables of interest, assessing  and modeling expert knowledge about relationships among variables  becomes more crucial.  Up to this point, conditional  distributions have provided the only formal, rigorous, and fully   general way to represent an expert's knowledge about a set of   interrelated random variables.  However, this approach becomes   unwieldy and infeasible unless the number of variables is very   small, and it may pose cognitive problems.  An alternative   approach involves representing joint distributions in terms of   copulas, which are functions of the marginal distributions and   encode the dependence among the variables.  The overall goal of   the proposed research is to develop procedures for dependence   assessment in practical expert-knowledge encoding situations.  In   this one-year pilot project, the researchers will focus primarily  on the mathematical development and dependence assessments.  They  will also begin an investigation into the behavioral issues  involved in the elicitation of expert  knowledge via marginal  distributions and dependence measures (as  compared to marginal  and conditional distributions).  This initial work will provide  the basis for the future development of sound assessment  procedures and implementable protocols as well as an analytical  framework for using those assessments.",
