 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451210  Shieh  A discovery-oriented multidisciplinary engineering laboratory  course entitled: Discovery-Oriented Multidisciplinary Engineering  Laboratory is being developed in this project. The  course  serves  two main purposes. First, it will be offered at the freshman level  as a means to retain the students currently in the engineering  program and encourage the transfer of non-engineering students who  are seeking scientific and technical literacy into the engineering  program. Second, it will be offered to minority high school  students and primary, middle and high school science teachers as a  major vehicle to increase the presence of minority in engineering  professions and recruit top high school students to engineering  schools.  Unlike traditional laboratory courses offered at the  freshman level, this course is not designed to have students  performing experiments for the sole purpose of proving theories  which may be irrelevant to their engineering studies. Instead, the  course  encourages students to gain hand-on experience by having  them  assemble laboratory apparatus and design the experiments,  utilize the experimental data to \"discover\" the underlying  principles/ theories, and eventually establish realistic links  between practice and theory. The proposed experimental focus areas  are  of a multidisciplinary nature, having practical relevancy, and  crossing traditional departmental boundaries.  The  equipment/instrumentation is adequate for accommodating up to 20  students in the class. Results and experience obtained from the  development and implementation of this course will be disseminated  through the NSF- sponsored Gateway Coalition,  conference/seminar/workshop presentations, and journal/newsletter  publications.",
