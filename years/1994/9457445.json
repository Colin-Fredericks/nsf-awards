 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457445  Walker    One of the major goals of both ground and space based observational  astronomy is the identification and study of protostellar objects.  A study of protostars will provide insight into the initial  conditions required for star formation, protostellar evolution, and  the formation of solar systems like our own.    Over the next five years the following research, which will involve  the participation of students, will be carried out:    1) conduct a vigorous observational search for protostellar objects  using telescopes operating at submillimeter wavelengths,      2) write the radiative transfer computer codes needed to interpret  the complex spectroscopic line profiles obtained by observing  candidate objects, and     3) construct the low-noise submillimeter wavelength heterodyne  receivers needed to successfully detect infall and other  motions associated with material around protostars. Two graduate  students will be working on thesis projects related to these goals.    The research program at the University of Arizona has an  established laboratory for the development of state-of-the-art  submillimeter wavelength receiver systems.  Receivers for the  Arizona/Max-Planck-Institute fur Radioastronomie (MPifR)  submillimeter telescope operating in the 1300, 870, 610, 450, and  350 micron wavelength atmospheric windows will be constructed.  A dual-channel (610/370 micron wavelength), low-noise receiver will  be constructed for use on a 1.7m submillimeter wavelength telescope  at the South Pole.  The receiver will be used to observe the  distribution of atomic carbon in the Milky Way and other galaxies  visible from the South Pole.  There will be participation in the  analysis and interpretation of the huge astronomical data base that  will be generated by making the observations.    New technology will be used to construct a high performance,  heterodyne array instrument which will consist of a 5 by 5 array of  receivers. This instrument will increase the scientific throughput   of the telescope by at least a factor of 25. Projects which were  previously unthinkable due to limited telescope time will become  tractable.    %%%    This award is to recognize an outstanding young faculty member in  science and engineering.  This award will enhance his career by  providing flexible support for research and educational activities.   Cooperation with industry and institutions that support research  and education is encouraged.",
