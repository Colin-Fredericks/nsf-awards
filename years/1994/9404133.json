 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404133  Kushner  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has set the  goal to achieve industry wide ).18um feature sizes in  microelectronics devices by 2001 for wafer sizes as large as  40cm.  These goals place extremely tight and tolerances on  the uniformities of ion and radical fluxes to the surface  are governed by the uniformity of their generation and the  uniformity of potential gradients or flow fields which drive  them to the substrate.  These fluxes and gradients are  highly sensitive to electrode topography which perturbs the  plasma. Examples of electrode topography are the wafer  itself, protruding clips from wafer holders bolt holes, and  discontinuities in electrode materials on otherwise smooth  surfaces.  Plasma properties can even be influenced by  metals or or dielectrics placed under the wafer.  The  researchers  propose to perform a program of computer  modeling to assess how electrode topography affects the  uniformity of ion and radical fluxes to the substrate in  plasma processing reactors, and propose methods to remediate  or capitalize on those effects.  In this effort we will  build upon and further develop existing 2-dimensional hybird  models of plasma etching and deposition reactors.  The  consequences of electrode topography on plasma properties  will be assessed with regard to etching trench profiles,  dust particle traps, and differential wafer charging.",
