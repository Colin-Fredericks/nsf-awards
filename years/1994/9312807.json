 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312807  Basar       This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive time-domain  based theory for the analysis and synthesis of performance-robust  minimax controllers for linear and nonlinear systems subject to  deterministic and/or partially stochastic disturbances.   Performance-robustness is a property that is imposed on top of  minimaxity, which requires the selected controller to be least  sensitive to modeling inaccuracies due to neglected fast dynamics  and/or weak coupling of subsystems.  Emphasis in this research  program will be placed on nonlinear models, nonquadratic  performance indices, decentralized measurement schemes, and  multiple objectives.         The general approach to be adopted is that of dynamic or  differential game theory, which provides the most natural setting  for these worst-case design problems.  Research efforts along the  lines described in the proposal should lead to major advances in  the methodology and design of performance-robust worst-case  controllers for various types of systems, as well as to some new  fundamental results in the theory of dynamic games.  They should  also contribute toward making the theory and the emerging design  tools more accessible to undergraduate and first-year graduate  students in an engineering curriculum.   ***",
