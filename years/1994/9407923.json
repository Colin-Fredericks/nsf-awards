 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407923  Sladek     This is a Research Planning Grant.  The long term goal of  this research is to determine the origins of nuclear  receptors and thereby shed light on how this important  family of transcription factors enables a cell to respond to  outside stimuli.  The short term goal of the planning  activities is to characterize and clone from yeast a  putative nuclear receptor.  There are two specific aims:  1,  to purify a factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that binds  specifically to a known nuclear receptor response element,  using conventional and affinity chromatography along with an  electrophoretic mobility shift assay to purify sufficient  amounts of the protein for partial amino acid sequencing;  and 2, to clone the corresponding gene from a S. cerevisiae  genomic library, using oligonucleotides derived from the  partial amino acid sequence.  %%%  Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins which control  whether or not specific genes are transcribed (active) or  not.  Many transcription factors act in response to external  \"signals\" (such as hormones) and represent an important part  of the mechanism whereby an organism responds to such  \"signals\" by turning specific genes on or off.  This project  is based on the hypothesis that there exist, in yeast,  transcription factors which are dependent on lipophilic  ligands.  Such factors exist in higher organisms, and  represent those transcription factors which are responsive  to certain lipophilic hormones (e.g., steroids) and other  lipophilic signalling molecules that control development,  differentiation, and hormone-dependent gene expression.  The  idea that similar factors exist in yeast is based in part on  theoretical arguments and in part by preliminary data.  If,  as is hoped, such factors can be identified in yeast, it  will then be possible to use genetic manipulations, which  are powerful and well-developed in yeast, to study them  further.  ***",
