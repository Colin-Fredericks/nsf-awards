 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404722  HART-MAYER       International attention has focused on the crisis of  deforestation in Southeast Asia, and highlighted efforts to  conserve ancient rain forests in the wake of commercial logging,  new settlements, and agricultural land clearing along the  region's forest frontiers.  The Indonesian state and timber  companies are responding to calls for a more sustainable forest  use by superimposing timber plantations on landscapes that  indigenous communities have long managed according to distinctive  agroforestry traditions.  The Indonesian government asserts that  timber plantations protect ecological values by reducing pressure  to log natural forests, generate rural development through  plantation employment, and promote urban development around wood  processing facilities.  Environmentalists counter that timber  plantations destroy the biological diversity of native ecosystems  and displace, emiserate, and victimize both local communities and  migrants brought in for plantation work.  This study will  investigate the complex transformations taking place in the  vicinity of expanding plantations, their effects on local  populations' own uses of land and forest resources, and the  changing ecological conditions of the land and forests  themselves. The research will involve intensive interviews with  villagers, community leaders, business people, and other affected  individuals located around and within an Indonesian timber  plantation. A survey of past and present land uses will also be  conducted and detailed maps will be constructed in the field  using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) to identify  locations accurately. The GPS will also be used to construct  vegetation and land use transects to describe village  agroforestry strategies.       This research will contribute to both theoretical and  practical understandings of the tension between commercial  interests, state policy, and indigenous populations over the  preservation of biological sensitive regions.  It wi ll add to our  theoretical understanding of political ecology, social  institutions, and frontier development. It will further provide  valuable insights into the specific situation in Indonesia, one  of the world's most important tropical forest regions.  As a  doctoral dissertation research improvement award, this project  will also provide strong support to enable a promising student to  establish an independent research career.",
