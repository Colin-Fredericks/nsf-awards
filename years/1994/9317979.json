 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award represents participation of the United States  Antarctic Program (USAP) in the Cape Roberts Project  (CRP), a  multi-national program of scientific drilling in the southwestern  Ross Sea region of Antarctica.  The USAP will join the national  Antarctic research programs of New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and  the United Kingdom in sponsoring this project.  The New Zealand  Antarctic Program (NZAP) is the lead organization and is joined  by the Italian and US Antarctic Programs as major equal partners.   Germany and the United Kingdom are minor sponsors of the CRP.   This award supports the scientific management activities  associated with participation of US investigators in the CRP and  along with this award is a commitment for logistical resources  from the USAP in support of the project.     The CRP was conceived to address several diverse issues in  geosciences related to the Cretaceous to Paleogene (100-36  million years ago) history of the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica  as well as early development of the southern ocean.  Four holes  are planned to investigate a 1500 meter sequence of the western  Victoria Basin.  Drilling is expected to be accomplished over two  years.  It would be done from land-fast sea ice early in the  Austral summer and the drill system is expected to produce about  95% core recovery.    The scientific objectives of the project include: 1) establishing  the history of the extensional plate fragmentation of the western  Ross Sea part of the West Antarctic Rift System; 2) determining  the subsidence and emergence histories of the Victoria Land Basin  and the Transantarctic Mountains; 3) determining the erosional  and depositional budgets associated with rift margin uplift and  basin development; 4) recovering the first late Cretaceous to  Paleogene succession from the southwest Pacific close to  Antarctica and attempting to recover paleoclimatic and  paleoceanographic records for the region; 5) investigating  relationships between uplift of the Transantarctic M ountains and  climatic changes in the region; 6) determining the presence or  absence of terrestrial or marine glaciation in the succession;  and 7) documenting the impact of tectonic, sedimentologic,  paleoclimatic, and eustatic oscillations on biotic evolution,  biogeography, and marine circulation between 100 and 36 million  years ago.  This interdisciplinary research plan will provide  valuable new data for Earth systems modeling, and it will  reinforce global science agendas of projects such as the Ocean  Drilling Program and the International Geosphere-Biosphere  Program.",
