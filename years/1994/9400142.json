 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400142  Fisher  The presence of microscopic quenched disorder often changes  qualitatively the macroscopic behavior of condensed matter systems.   The effects of disorder are revealed even more dramatically at low  temperatures when they dominate over thermal fluctuations.  At low  temperatures, though, it is often necessary to disentangle the  subtle interplay between disorder and quantum fluctuations.   Particularly challenging are those quantum systems in which the  interactions are so strong that a simple description in terms of a  reference non-interacting model are inappropriate.  This  theoretical research will focus on the behavior of such strongly  correlated and disordered systems.  In particular, the following  problems will be studied:  (1) Transport in interacting one-  dimensional electron gases (Luttinger liquids) and edge states in  the fractional quantum Hall effect; (2) The quantum phase  transition between plateaus in disordered fractional and integer  quantum Hall fluids and the closely related superconductor-  insulator transition in disordered superconductors; (3) The  crossovers to the two-dimensional thin film limit and non-  equilibrium fluctuations and noise in the mixed state of the  cuprate superconductors; (4) The mesoscopic superconductivity  associated with small superconducting systems and with normal  mesoscopic systems in contact with superconductors.  %%%  This theoretical research will focus on a number of related  problems at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics.  They  all have the common theme of competition between physical disorder  and disorder induced by the quantum nature of the systems being  studied.  While the primary focus is on fundamental condensed  matter physics, the results have potential for a broad impact on  materials.  The systems to be studied include the new high  temperature superconductors and the the two-dimensional electron  gas (as found at semiconductor interfaces in strong magnetic  fields).  ***",
