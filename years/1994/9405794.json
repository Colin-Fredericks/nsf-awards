 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Mirkin  This project focuses on the role of DNA triplexes in DNA  replication. We will study homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences with  varying extents of mirror symmetry that form intramolecular H-DNA  triplexes in vitro. We have recently shown that these sequences  cause purified DNA polymerase to terminate in double- or  single-stranded DNA templates. Termination sites precisely match  triplex junctions defined by chemical probing. Therefore, we  suggest that the formation of triplexes prior or during DNA  polymerization is responsible for premature termination of DNA  synthesis. We have also found that certain orientations and  positions of these sequences severely affect the maintenance of  bacterial plasmids in vivo. The specific aim of this project is to  prove that the formation of triplexes inhibits DNA replication both  in vitro and in vivo. We will study the influence of DNA triplexes  on DNA synthesis in the reconstituted replication system of  bacteriophage T7 and analyze the effects of accessory replication  proteins, including single-stranded DNA-binding protein and  helicase-primase, on triplex-caused termination. We will  characterize the formation of H-like DNA structures in E.coli cells  by chemical modification of intracellular DNA followed by sequence  level detection of modified bases using Maxam-Gilbert sequencing.  We will measure the repression caused by cloned triplex-forming DNA  sequences of the replication of the pBluescript plasmid in E.coli   cells by assaying the rate of replication by the incorporation of  radiolabeled precursors into DNA. We will then visualize the fine  pattern of replication fork movement by two-dimensional gel  electrophoresis. The long term goal of this work is to reveal the  mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of triplexes on DNA synthesis  in vitro and to understand the role of these structures in the  regulation of DNA replication in vivo.  %%%  DNA usually exists as a matched pair of long molecules in a  structure called double- stranded or duplex DNA. However, particular  DNA segments may form an unusual structure where three, rather than  two, DNA strands interact with each other. This structure is called  triplex DNA. We have found that the purified cellular machinery  necessary to duplicate DNA can not efficiently pass through triplex  structures within DNA, leading to a block replication. Such an  effect could be used to selectively inhibit the multiplication of  particular DNAs such as bacteria or viruses. This aims to elucidate  the inhibitory effects of triplexes on DNA replication, both in  test tubes and in living cells.  ***",
