 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313280  Gabrielse    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Gerald Gabrielse,  Department of Physics, Harvard University, to pursue with Dr.  Wonho Jhe, Department of Physics, Seoul National University,  Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on  antiproton studies and mass spectroscopy.  In this research,  antiprotons produced in LEAR, the high energy accelerator at  CERN, Geneva Switzerland, are trapped and stored in thermal  equilibrium at 4.2  K.  Subsequently, the inertial masses,  magnetic moments, and other properties of antiprotons and protons  may be compared.    The collaborators are highly respected researchers in the field  of the proposal.  In addition, Dr. Jhe has available to his  research group, in Korea, facilities for producing negative  hydrogen ions which can be loaded into the antiproton trap and  used in comparisons of antiproton and proton properties.  The use  of negative hydrogen ions rather than protons in these  experiments will greatly reduce a number of large experimental  errors.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-  Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of  mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This  project adds an international cooperative dimension to the PI's  research under NSF Grant No. PHY-9122373.    ***",
