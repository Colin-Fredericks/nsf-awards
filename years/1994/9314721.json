Rutgers University, New Brunswick  Title:    Atmospheric Controls on Northern Hemisphere Cryosphere            Variability     This award supports comprehensive study of relationships between  atmospheric variability and fluctuations in the snow and sea ice  covers the Northern Hemisphere.  The primary thrust of the work is  to provide a hemispheric synthesis of the sensitivity of the  cryosphere to regional changes in the atmospheric circulation, and  to diagnose this sensitivity with respect to associated  interactions between precipitation, temperature, winds and the  modes of large-scale teleconnection patterns.  The PIs will  identify those regions of the cryosphere warranting focused  monitoring for potential climate change, and possible future  responses of the cryosphere to changes in circulation regimes.  As  part of these efforts, they will perform a series of  intercomparisons between observed snow cover patterns and those  simulated by different GCMs under present and project future  climatic conditions.    The study will address at least six basic questions: 1) What are  the relationships between variations in northern hemisphere sea ice  extent and terrestrial snow cover? 2) What areas of the  cryosphere exhibit strong or weak responses to atmospheric  circulation changes and why? 3) Which areas contribute most  strongly to northern hemisphere cryosphere variability? 4) What are  the responses of the cryosphere to the modes of Large-scale  teleconnections patterns, and how do these compare with parallel  anomalies in synoptic activity, temperature and precipitation?   5) How well do different GCMs depict the present day distribution  and variability of snow cover, and are changes in the cryosphere  projected by GCMs in response to enhance CO2 warming reasonable  from the viewpoint of modeled circulation changes? 6) Can the  cryosphere be used as a robust indicator of climate change?    For the snow and sea ice analyses, gridded NOAA charts  of Northern  Hemisphere snow extent and Navy/NOAA ice concentration data will be  combined with available station records of snow depth, snow fall,  precipitation and surface temperature.  For atmospheric analyses,  the PIs will use once to twice-daily NMC surface and upper-air  fields from the early 1960s to present, used to calculate grid-  point and regional time series of the frequency, position and  strength of cyclones and anticyclones, storm tracks, and other  indices of synoptic activity (e.g, positive vorticity advection),  as well as temperature.  Rawinsonde data from an existing archive  will be used to analyze patterns of moisture flux convergence and  their associations with snow cover and precipitation variations at  high northern latitudes.  Output from different GCMs will be  obtained for doubled CO2 (equilibrium) runs, transient runs (in  which CO2 is continually increased), as well as for runs using  identical present-day boundary conditions.    The research is a collaborative effort between University of  Colorado  (Drs. Mark Serreze and Roger G. Barry) and Rutgers University (Dr.  David Robinson).  The work is important because it seeks to clarify  the role of the cryosphere in climate variability.",
