Consequently, understanding the processes that produce  and maintain genetic variation in natural populations is a  requisite for understanding how, and at what rate, organisms  evolve.  In addition, understanding how genetic variation is  maintained in natural populations may contribute to the  development of strategies for conserving genetic diversity in  natural ecosystems.  Over the last thirty years, numerous  investigations have indicated that natural populations of  organisms harbor extensive amounts of genetic variation.   Nevertheless, although theoretical investigations have indicated  that there are more than a dozen processes that could maintain  these levels of genetic variation in natural populations, very  few definitive examples of any of these processes exist.   Consequently, understanding of why organisms are so genetically  variable is at best rudimentary.  The purpose of this research is  to address this issue using flower color variation in the annual  morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, as a model system.  In  particular, the goal of this project is to determine why genetic  variation for flower color persists in natural populations of  this species.  Through a series of field and laboratory  experiments, the evolutionary forces that act on a gene that  influences the intensity of pigmentation (the W locus) at all  stages of the life cycle will be assessed.  From these  assessments, a determination will be made of which, if any, of  the theoretically described processes for maintaining genetic  variation operate on this character.***",
