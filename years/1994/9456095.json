 "awd_abstract_narration": "9566095  Keynes  The University of Minnesota proposes to develop a new model for planning curriculum and  instructing its science and engineering calculus students which will fundamentally change  calculus instruction and subsequent course work at the University. This model will allow  incorporation of nearly all of the key aspects of a successful calculus reform effort, as well as  enabling significant opportunities for inclusion of interdisciplinary materials. The new structure  will attempt to reconfigure the large lecture/recitation format in many public research  universities in a cost-effective way to allow increased personal interaction between faculty and  students and encourage more student centered pedagogy and the use of varying technology as  the curriculum progresses. This curriculum will become the standard format for engineering and  science calculus instruction at Minnesota, and will be developed as a model program for other  public research institutions.",
