 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400145  Fratkin       This project is a multidisciplinary approach studying both  the human causes and consequences of changing land use patterns  and food production in arid northeastern Africa.  Due to  prolonged drought, population growth, and political insecurity,  formerly nomadic populations are settling in or near growing  towns, transforming traditional land use practices from low  density nomadic pastoralism to high density dry land and  irrigation agriculture, commercial ranching, or urban migration.       It is not clear, however, what consequences this  sedentarization process is having on human well-being and the  ability of these marginal lands to sustain these populations.  Land resources in these regions are marginal with low rainfall  and patchy productivity, while human populations are rapidly  expanding at rates of 3% annually.  Similar situations to that of  northern Kenya is found in the semi-arid lands of the Sahel, Mid  East, and Central Asia.       This study involves a cultural anthropologist, demographer,  and medical doctor, each of whom has extensive experience in N.  Kenya.  They will compare six closely related but economically  distinct Rendille communities (pastoral, agro-pastoral, and  irrigation agricultural communities), to determine through  empirical observation levels of \"well-being\", defined in terms of  nutritional and health indices of women and children, demographic  change (fertility, mortality, and morbidity), and socio-economic  status (levels of market integration, employment, land tenure,  and political security).         The research is important because it is one of the few  projects that attempts to measure social and health consequences  of changing land use patterns in arid lands, and hopefully can  act as a model for related studies in other regions of the world.",
