Robin Overstreet and William Hawkins, Gulf Coast Research  Laboratory, and Professor Peter Lin Sun, Taiwan National Pingtung  Institute of Agriculture.  This proposal requests funds for  travel and graduate student support to carry out cooperative  research to determine if there are identifiable biomarkers in  tilapia for indication different levels of pollution.  If  successful and reliable biomarkers in fish for pollution  monitoring are found, they can be a quick indication of the  condition of aquatic environments.  The study plans to test a new  technique by adapting parasitological methods to the field of  biomonitoring.  Taiwan is important for this research since   there are relatively abundant accessible warmwater fish (tilapia)  living in the different levels of polluted environments.   Dr. Peter Sun has noted that the tilapia in the grossly affected  area are showing pathological alterations.  The project can  contribute significantly in human resource development by  inclusion of graduate student work in systems which are very  different from those in the U.S.  This project is jointly  supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council  (NSC).",
