 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   focusses on the application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)   and optical imaging to characterizing the heterogeneity of carbon fiber   surfaces and the SECM-controlled modification of these surfaces to   produce regions which have been functionalized.  These microfabricated   surfaces will then be used to make unusual redox enzyme-based sensors   which will be broadly evaluated.  Professor David Wipf and his students   at Mississippi State University, working in collaboration with Professor   Werner Kuhr and his students at the University of California at   Riverside, will pursue these goals during the tenure of this thirty-four   month continuing grant.    Chemical modification of the surface of electrodes can enable unique   applications of these devices as molecularly selective sensors of target   analytes.  Carbon electrodes, particularly carbon fiber microelectrodes,   offer a rich synthetic platform on which to build a wide variety of   molecularly specific electrochemical sensors.  This research is aimed at   understanding the heterogeneity of surfaces of carbon fibers to be used   in these applications and the development of protocols for the spatially   resolved attachment of redox enzymes to these surfaces.  This research   should lead to the development of new analytical probes of broad   biotechnological importance.",
