This project will enhance the scientific knowledge of  middle school girls by providing them with hands-on, highly  motivating science activities in conjunction with appropriate  technical education and support networks.  It is specifically  designed to encourage girls who already show an aptitude in science  to continue exploring science through extracurricular activities  and pre-college science courses.  The primary vehicle for this  project will be a four-week day camp.  The participants will be  engaged in both course work and field research.  During this time  they will also be taking field trips to visit women scientists in  both industry and academia. Through this project participants will  strengthen their self-awareness and self-esteem as well as their  knowledge of career opportunities in the scientific world.  Along  with the four-week camp, there will be follow-up activities which  engage the participants in sharing their gained knowledge with  family and friends, informal meetings with female career  scientists, and internships within the Museum.  This project  provides for the development of curriculum and implementation of  three successive camps that will be subjected to frequent  evaluation by staff scientists and educators at the Science Museum  of Minnesota.  Major Scientific Disciplines:  Ecology,  Environmental Science.  Program:  Formal and Informal Science  Education.  Instructional Grade Levels:  Grades 7 and 8.",
