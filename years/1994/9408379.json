Previous literature  has shown that these cycles are highly influential in determining  the \"level\" of migration: peak migration rates of young adults  tend to be lower for large cohorts and during recessionary  economic times because of competitive labor markets and depressed  job opportunities.  This study suggests that demographic and  economic cycles may also influence the \"timing\" of migration.  It  builds on studies that have shown that individuals born into  large cohorts or those facing difficult economic conditions in  their early childhood frequently postpone their entry into the  labor force.  The first part of the research uses 1948-1988  Current Population Survey data to investigate (1) the effect of a  cohort's location in the demographic cycle on the timing of its  peak migration, and (2) the effect of economic conditions and  trends at a given time on the timing of peak migration rates.  The second part of the research will explore how regional  demographic and economic cycles, through their effect on the  level and timing of migration influence lifetime migration  expectancy or migraproduction.  Using regional data on cohort  size and economic conditions over time, migration age-schedules  and migraproduction rates are estimated for the nine U.S. census  regions.       The findings from the first part of the study will  contribute to the theoretical literature on the influence of both  demographic and macroeconomic conditions on behavior.  Findings  from the second part of the study will refine our understanding  of macroeconomic influences on spatial population flows.  Overall, this study will make an important contribution to the  linkage of demographic and economic cycles to individual behavior  which, in turn, will provide new policy insights into the causes  and consequences of migration  within the U.S.  ***",
