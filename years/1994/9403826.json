 "awd_abstract_narration": "The statistical analysis of time series and random fields is  vital in many diverse scientific disciplines.  The general goal  of this project is to develop methods of inference for the  analysis of time series and random fields that do not rely on  unrealistic or unverifiable model assumptions.  Typical  inferential methods in the data-dependent setting rest upon  strong assumptions.  In contrast, bootstrap resampling or  computer-intensive methods offer viable approaches to obtaining  valid distributional approximations while assuming very little  about the stochastic mechanism generating the data.  Many  important questions need to be addressed in order for these  modern approaches to be applied safely in practice.  The main  issues we wish to tackle include the following: finding general  conditions for asymptotic validity of computer-intensive methods,  especially subsampling, in the presence of nonstationarity;  higher-order comparison of block-resampling and subsampling;  developing computationally efficient and accurate estimates of  standard error, and the corresponding improvement on confidence  regions for parameters of interest; optimal choice of design  parameters, such as block size, as well as practical guidelines  for implementation; assessing goodness of fit in time series  settings; and finally interval estimation with lattice or  non-lattice random field data.    Addressing these general problems fruitfully will have many  practical applications.  Applications of statistical methods for  time series and spatial data are well-known and numerous,  especially in the fields of physics, engineering, acoustics,  geostatistics, medicine, econometrics, ecology, forestry,  seismology and others.  The general purpose of this research  proposal is to develop inferential methods for dependent data  that does not rely on strong model assumptions. These methods are  computer-intensive, very generally applicable, flexible, and  offer solutions to problems when there are no alternatives;  how ever, further mathematical study of these procedures is needed  in order to fully under their potential and limitations.",
