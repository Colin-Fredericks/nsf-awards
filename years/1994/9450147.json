 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Renee Diehl's research involves the study of structures,  dynamics and phase transitions in overlayers of alkali metals on  metal and graphite surfaces.  The main technique to be employed in  this study is He-atom scattering (HAS), and experiments will be  carried out in the laboratory of Professor R. B. Doak on a state-  of-the-art apparatus.  The main purposes of these experiments are  to study the He-atom interaction with alkali surfaces, to study the  dynamics of the alkali metal bond to metal surfaces as a function  of alkali metal coverage, and to study the lattice dynamics of  thick alkali metal films.  The goal is to increase the  understanding of simple metal adsorbates, simple metal surfaces and  how He atoms couple to them.  Exploratory experiments will also be  carried out using low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) on graphite  interacalation in the laboratory of Professor I. Tsong.  These  experiments should provide new information on the microscopic  process and kinetics of alkali metal intercalation into graphite.    Interactive activities to be carried out include:  teaching a  graduate level course in surface physics; initiating and organzing  a high-profile seminar program which will bring women scientists  and engineers from all over the US to speak at Arizona State  University; and planning a women in physics colloquim series aimed  at increasing the visibility of women physicists, particularly ones  who are in their early careers and who will benefit most from the  exposure.  Lunchtime meetings of women in physics and related  disciplines will be initiated in order to discuss research  interests and issues such as climate, families, and employment  prospects.",
