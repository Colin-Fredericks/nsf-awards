 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310065  Scroggs    The brain receives input about the environment from signals  coming in through  the sensory systems.  The brain also has  mechanisms that modulate those  afferent input systems, and  one example of such phenomena is the suppression  of pain  signals during emergencies that activate the \"fight or flight\"  responses.   Suppression of pain information may be achieved  by nerve cells in the brain  releasing neurotransmitters such  as serotonin and norepinephrine to bathe cells  down in the  spinal cord where the nerves enter that carry pain  information.  It is  not understood how these substances may  selectively inhibit pain without also  inhibiting other  important sensory inputs that use the same transmitter   molecules.  This work uses anatomical tracing techniques to  identify the source  of input (skin, joints, muscles) and the  central targets in the spinal cord of single  neurons, and  electrophysiology and pharmacology to determine how the   important transmembrane channels in these identified  individual nerve cells are  affected by these transmitters.   Discovery of how various types of sensory  neurons have  differential sensitivity to these two neurotransmitters will  advance  our understanding of how the brain controls its own  input, and so will have an  impact on all sensory  neuroscience, in addition to providing a basis for potential   applications toward developing medicines with selective  effects on different  sensory pathways.  ***",
