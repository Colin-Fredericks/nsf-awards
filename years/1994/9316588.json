 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is developing a new and significantly better method  for the design of a wide variety of digital filters.  The new  method is based on a successive approximation algorithm called  Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS).  One form of IRLS,  Lawson's algorithm, has been used before but not extensively  because of slow and inconsistent convergence.  Initial results with  the new method using a second order IRLS with a form of path-  following or homotopy modification have produced a robust,  quadratically converging, efficient, versatile filter design  technique.  The method finds general L^p approximations with 1<=p.   It also allows different criteria in different bands for the design  of mixed criteria optimal filters.  The new method solves, not only  the standard filter design problems, but many that the Parks-  McClellan Remez algorithm or windowed least wquares will not.   Initial results on designing with constrained L^p criteria, complex  approximation, and two dimensions show great promise.    Robust convergence is crucial for the practical success of any  iterative algorithm.  We feel that we have a potential breakthrough  on that issue.  This research is doing a theoretical analysis of  the convergence for the more general optimization criteria,  developing a practical adaptive filter design program, and  presenting it in a form accessible to the practicing engineer.    The algorithm will be applied to three filter design problems: a)  the constrained least-squares and, more generally, the constrained  L^p approximation problem.  This is often what people really want  when they use a straight Chebyshev or window design.  b) The  important problems of complex approximation which is important in  equalization adaptive filter design.  c) The multidimensional  filter design and image processing problems.  This new approach  shows excellent promise and a possible great improvement over  present techniques.",
