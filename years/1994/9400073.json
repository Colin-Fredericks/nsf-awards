They are attempting to  understand the relationship of the mosaic structure of landscapes  to the ecology of individuals, and to translate these effects to  the population and community levels.  The Colorado State group  has strengths in simulation modeling while the Oslo group  emphasizes analytical, mathematical models.  They will integrate  these approaches to address common questions about how  environmental heterogeneity affects ecological systems and about  how these effects vary with spatial scale.    Questions about the effects of scale and of explicit spatial  heterogeneity on ecological systems have become a centerpiece of  contemporary ecology.  This collaboration will evaluate two  methodological approaches to these questions by applying them  jointly to independently gathered empirical data from the  different systems being studied by the two groups.  The result  should be a contribution to predictive theory that will have  significant applications in preserving biodiversity and  threatened ecosystems.  ***",
