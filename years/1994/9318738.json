 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318738  Goldman    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Ronald N. Goldman,  Professor of Computer Science, Rice University, to conduct with  Dr. Hassan Said, Department of Computer Science, Universiti Sains  Malaysia, Penang, a U.S.-Southeast Asian workshop on computer  aided geometric design (CAGD).  This award will support the  participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers and eight others  from Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand.  Nine Malaysian  participants are supported from other sources.    CAGD is becoming increasingly important in manufacturing and is  an area of great interest to computer scientists and engineers.   At the same time, countries in the ASEAN (Association of  Southeast Asian Nations) region have taken a prominent position  in this field.  The workshop will provide an opportunity for U.S.  participants to exchange scientific information with ASEAN  scientists/engineers and to keep abreast of trends and directions  of computer science and engineering in that region.     This project is relevant to the objectives of the East Asia and  Pacific Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and East Asian scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and  benefit.  ***",
