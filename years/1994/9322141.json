The objective of the program is to provide a ten-week  high-quality research environment for students who are  underrepresented in science careers (minorities, women, and the  disabled) and/or have limited access to research facilities and  training at the schools they are attending.  Using the research  facilities of the Bureau of Sociological Research and under the  close guidance of faculty supervisors, students will initiate and  carry out research projects from formulating a problem to writing  a final report.  Students will participate in morning seminars  where they will learn research methods and share their ongoing  research with each other.  Afternoons will be spent engaging in  individual projects and learning to use appropriate research  technologies.  The students' papers will be presented at the  Nebraska Undergraduate Symposium held each fall and submitted for  presentation at a professional meeting, such as the Midwest  Sociological Society and the Mid-South Sociological Society.      This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
