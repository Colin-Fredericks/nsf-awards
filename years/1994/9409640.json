 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of  the interrelated dynamics of human capital formation and changes  in the wage structure.  Wage inequality in the U.S. has been  rising for the past twenty years.  This project asks whether  inequality will continue to rise or whether increased education  and job training will reduce the returns to a more long-run  levels.    The project consists of three empirical tasks:  (1) Detecting and  estimating responses of investments in post-secondary education,  measured by enrollments, and in job training to changes in rates  of return to human capital as measured by skill differentials in  wages.  (2) Estimating the effects of the accumulation human  capital measured by educational attainment on skill wage  differentials.  (3) Enrollment responses and attainment effects  are separated by a lag to be estimated statistically.  The  econometric analysis will utilize micro-data from the Current  Population Survey, the National Longitudinal Survey, and the  National Center for Education Statistics, as well as special  surveys of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Educational  Testing Service.",
