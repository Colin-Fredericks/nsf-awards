The joint research  project focuses on scientific preparations for  the High Energy Transient Experiment (HETE), a  dedicated, international, multiwavelength  astrophysics satellite scheduled for launch in  December 1994.  In the United States, HETE is  supported by NASA.  The partner nations are  France, Italy, and Japan.      This award supports the non-hardware tasks  associated with the experiment, which will be  carried out with scientists at established  optical and radio facilities throughout Japan,  as well as with scientists at RIKEN working on  satellite data analysis.  In the pre-launch  period, discussions and collaborative planning  will take place with theoretical  astrophysicists at various universities.  In  the post-launch period, discussions will be  held with Japanese astronomers interested in  transient sources.  Joint data analyses and  joint papers will also be prepared.  In  addition to the principal investigator, two  postdoctoral research associates from MIT will  spend time in Japan conducting data analysis.  ***",
