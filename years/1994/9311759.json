 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311759  Brinch Hansen  The goal of this project is to develop a new programming  methodology for computational science based on programming  paradigms for multicomputers.  The research is guided by a  precisely defined paradigm concept:  A programming paradigm is  defined as a class of algorithms that have the same control  structure.  For every paradigm, a general program is developed  that implements the common control structure on a multicomputer.  From the general program, two or more model programs are derived  that illustrate the use of the paradigm to solve specific  problems.  The general problem includes a few unspecified data  types and procedures that vary from one application to another.  A model program is obtained by replacing these data types and  procedures with the corresponding data types and procedures from  a sequential program that solves the same problem.  The essence  of the programming methodology is that a model program has a  parallel component that implements a paradigm and a sequential  component for a specific application.  The clear separation of  the issues of parallelism and the details of application is  essential for writing model programs that are easy to understand.  So far, only a fraction of the possible paradigms have been  studied.  This project would follow up a preliminary  investigation of regular computations with a study of irregular  computations that require dynamic load balancing.  ***",
