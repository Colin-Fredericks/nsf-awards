 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds in partial support of a  symposium to be held on the campus of Indiana University,  Bloomington, from October 27 - 30, 1994.  The symposium is  entitled, \"Origins and evolution of animal body plans\".  The  problem of the origin of animal body plans and their  modification in evolution has become a topic of considerable  excitement.  Evidence from paleontology on the pattern and  history of the Cambrian radiation provides one new source of  data and insight.  Molecular phylogeny is now beginning to  make an important impact on understanding these events as  well.  Finally, the explosive recent progress in  developmental genetics has revealed both important  mechanisms subject to evolution and genes that play major  regulatory roles in development of a wide diversity of  animals.  The interface between paleontologists,  developmental biologists, molecular biologists, and  evolutionary biologists has become striking, and has begun  to resolve major problems in when and how animal body plans  appeared and how they have been modified in evolutionary  time.  The meeting is the eighth in an annual series  presented under the auspices of the Indiana Institute for  Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana University.  Previous topics have included \"The genetic and molecular  analysis of development\", \"Proteins as machines\", and  \"Biological regulation by protein modification\".  The  objectives of the organizing committee are to bring together  an international group of the leaders in the disciplines  that are contributing to major aspects of the central theme  to present the current ideas contributed by their  disciplines.  Previous experience has shown that integrative  conferences can produce new syntheses in science.  The  timing is appropriate to achieve this kind of interaction on  this topic.  Although existing meetings deal with some  aspects of these subjects, no one meeting has attempted to  fully integrate all of the approaches.  There is no society  devoted to the  evolution of development, and equivalent  results cannot be met through existing society meetings.",
