 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand the  cell signaling that occurs between Arabidopsis pollen  (and/or pollen tubes) and the pistil.  This proposal  initiates an investigation of the molecules essential for  pollen-stigma communication.  Previous analyses of male-  sterile cer6-2 Arabidopsis plants showed they produce pollen  lacking a normal extracellular coating.  While this coating  is essential for communication with the stigma, it is not  clear which of its components (lipids, proteins, small  molecules) play a critical role in communication.  This  proposal is aimed at characterizing further the signaling  component(s).  These experiments rely on recently developed  methods for obtaining large quantities of pollen and for  extracting the pollen coating.  When the extracted wild type  pollen coat is dried and added to the cer6-2 pollen, it  restores fertility, providing a bioassay; this bioassay will  allow initial purification of the active pollen coat  components.  Specifically, the coating from wild type grains  will be fractionated and each fraction will be added  separately to the mutant cer6-2 pollen.  Restoration of  fertility will identify the active fraction(s).  Recent  experiments have shown that the Arabidopsis pollen coating  contains only a few proteins.  One or more of these proteins  may play a significant role i interaction with the stigma,  including adhesion of pollen to the stigmatic cells or  communication with the stigma.  The fractions prepared for  the bioassay experiments will also be used to characterize  the protein components.",
