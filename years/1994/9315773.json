 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315773  Lau    This research addresses fundamental materials science issues  surrounding the concept of utilizing the photoelastic effect for  control and stabilization of stresses in metallic stressor films,  which can also serve as electrodes.  The objectives are to  introduce controllable and stable strains into semiconductor  systems by means of metal-semiconductor and metal-metal  reactions, and to provide the materials science basis for  tailoring films to make wave guides on binary and ternary  substrates such as InP, GaAs, and GaInAs. Two approaches are  being pursued:  (l) Introduction of stable strain by  metal-substrate reactions. This approach relies on the volume  change in the structure due to the reaction between the metallic  stressor layer and the substrate; the reaction product is also  metallic in conductivity; (2) Introduction of strain by  metal-metal interactions.  The stressor is formed by reacting two  deposited metallic layers on the substrate to form a strained  epitaxial layer.  These approaches and the basic studies of  materials science issues associated with the chemical and  physical processes are expected to provide the basis for  simplifying and improving planarized photonic devices.  %%%  Light guiding is commonly experienced when we shine light onto a  stream of water and observe that the light follows the water  stream.  This phenomenon is very important for high speed and  large volume communication.  This project investigates innovative  and efficient ways to make improved and simplified lightguides in  the basic materials used in telecommunications, information  processing, and computing.",
