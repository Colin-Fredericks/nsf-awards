 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the construction of a research  resource at the Aladdin Synchrotron, University of Wisconsin-  Madison, dedicated to time-resolved fluorescence  spectroscopy of biological systems.  The specific aims are  to (1) build a frequency domain fluorometer that exploits  the time structure of the Aladdin Synchrotron light source  especially its picosecond resolution and broad excitation  wavelength capabilities; (2) establish a preparative  biological sample laboratory in conjunction with the  fluorescence facility; (3) train students in the principles  of frequency domain methods using synchrotron radiation, and  to operate the facility; and (4) conduct core research on  the dynamics of biological systems.  To accomplish these  goals, we will draw upon our prior experiences (1)  establishment of a synchrotron radiation facility at  Frascati (Italy), (2) development of frequency domain  fluorescence instrumentation exploiting the harmonic content  of pulsed sources, (3) design and construction of a  microwave superheterodyning fluorometer and (4)  establishment and operation of an international luminescence  center (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics), which  provides biological scientists with a state-of-the-art  fluorescence laboratory coupled with a functional  biochemistry laboratory.  Fluorescence time-resolved  experiments are invaluable in exploring the dynamics of  biological systems such as protein and nucleic acid  biopolymers, or cellular organelles.. The uniqueness of the  Aladdin Synchrotron source in terms of time resolution,  brightness, continuous excitation wavelengths (ultraviolet  and visible), phase stability, and pulse-to-pulse amplitude  stability, makes it the best choice in the United State for  a synchrotron radiation laboratory.  After the initial  construction period, the Fluorescence Synchrotron Radiation  Laboratory will become a research resource for the life  sciences community.  Preliminary experiments at Aladdin have  fully demonstrated the feas ibility of frequency domain  measurements in the multibunch mode and have confirmed our  predictions in terms of signal stability and signal  intensity which are crucial characteristics for the study of  complex biological systems.",
