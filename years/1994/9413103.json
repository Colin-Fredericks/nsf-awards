The objective of the  research is to undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility  of using a comprehensive design methodology to redesign workplaces  to accommodate the needs of the physically challenged person.   Should the results from the preliminary study show some promise, a  more detailed and comprehensive investigation will be undertaken.   The ultimate aim is to develop tools which can be used in the  workplaces that clearly recognize the needs of the disabled  persons.         The outcome of the research has immediate applications.  It  can be used to design workplaces that ensure efficiency and safety  not just for the disabled but for the general workforce.  The  results are also useful for developing solutions to implement  workplace, equipment and job changes.  Through this type of  research, workplace data necessary to obtain better understanding  of the needs of the physically impaired persons at workplaces can  be generated.",
