 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317256  ESTES    This project will be devoted to the continuing development of  mathematical and computer models for human memory and  classification performance.  The objectives are twofold.  One  function of the models, analogous to that of the gene model in  genetics, is to help us understand what goes on in the memory  system when it is impaired by aging or brain damage or when it  gives rise to super-normal or \"expert\" performance, and to  provide an essential framework for relating experimental results  on cognitive functioning to mechanisms revealed by research in  neural science.  The second role of the models is that of   \"learning machines\" that can serve as components of intelligent  systems for accomplishing complex tasks like speech recognition,  language comprehension, medical diagnosis, and coping with the  vast quantities of data returned from spacecraft.    Estes has developed two types of models under his long-term NSF  support, one based on symbol processing, as in traditional  artificial intelligence, and one based on structures and  processes suggested by work on neural networks.  In this  research, Estes will test and refine both models further in  relation to several major outstanding problems:  How is it  possible to gain rapid access to the large amount of information  stored in human long-term memory?  How can people learn many  difficult categorizations simultaneously with little  interference, e. g., learning several languages or several  computer operating systems?  How do people make decisions among  alternatives that differ in their constellations of associated  values and uncertainties of outcomes?  How do the hypothesized  short- and long-term memory systems of the computational models  relate to the neural systems of the hippocampus and frontal  cortex that are currently being studied.    ***",
