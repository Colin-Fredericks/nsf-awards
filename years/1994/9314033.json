One approach is the photolysis of transition  and main group organometallic reagents adsorbed on  porous  Vycor glass and tetramethylorthosilicate-methanol-water  (TMOS/CH3OH/H20) xerogels followed by thermal consolidation  to a nonporous glass.  Deposition changes the refractive  index, and standard photolithographic  techniques offer a  means of patterning refractive index gradients, magnetic  impregnates, and regions of porosity within the host glass.  However, there is little information on the nature of the  species deposited, their properties, or their effect on the  host matrix.  In this work, a number of techniques will be  used to determine the nature and properties of the deposits.  These techniques include electronic and diffuse reflectance  fourtier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Mossbauer,  electron spin resonance, and other spectroscopic techniques.  Specifically, it is proposed to determine the criteria for  the deposition of transparent, magnetically-ordered iron in  the different glasses, and through a comparison of the  results in the different matrices, probe the effect of the  host matrix. Cluster precursors and applied magnetic fields  will be examined as means to enhance magnetic ordering  without necessarily increasing impregnate aggregation.  Similar experiments will be conducted using  trimetholtin  iodide (CH3)3SnI, except in this case, the goal will be to  determine how tin prevents consolidation of Si-based  glasses.  Because porosity offers access into an optical  network, this work will examine polymer diffusion as a way  to carry reagents that are unable to withstand glass  consolidation temperatures, typically >1000C, into an  optical network in glass.  The photo deposition of Cr-,  Er,  Nd- organometallics will be examined as a means to deposit  laser ac tive species, and tailor optical and magnetic  properties.  To determine the generality of the technique,  photo deposition in Al-, Se and Te-based glasses will be  examined.  The nature of the species deposited and their  properties will be compared to those obtained in Sibased  glasses to better understand the role of the host matrix.   %%%  This research is concerned with the study of methodologies  capable of incorporating and patterning new materials in  transparent media such as glasses needed for new optical  technologies.
