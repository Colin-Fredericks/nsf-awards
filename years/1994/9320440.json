It involves implementing a custom VLSI-based model of a well-documented network of biological neurons and comparing the electrical signals resident in this network with those of its biological counterpart.     (2) A Multichannel Sensor for Extracellular Potentials: The objective of this project is the development and evaluation of a multipolar nerve cuff electrode that can not only sense impulses from outside of a nerve bundle, but discern their point of origin within the fiber.  In the final phase of this study, the electrodes will be installed and tested on a preparation of lateral eye and optic nerve of Limulus, the horseshoe crab.    (3) An Intelligent Signal Detection System: The main objective of this project is to study and develop a generic, modular and expandable software/hardware platform interfaceable with the existing monitoring systems where many visions can be developed, tested, evaluated and integrated.  ***                  <o\\  #    CONTROL HLP           @ j N H   WIN     COM           :X  T     BOOTLOG TXT           EX  k     9320440  Wolpert      This award will provide funds to purchase a high-performance workstation and laboratory  bench equipment to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,   .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                $         $         $         $              G                                                                                  Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                      e   e                        6    Wolpert/Maine    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
