 "awd_abstract_narration": "The composition of seed oils varies widely between taxa and could   either be the result of relaxation from selection or selection   for or against certain compositions given the particular   circumstances of the seeds of a species.  Preliminary analyses   show clearly that there is a latitudinal shift in the proportion  of saturated vs. unsaturated fat in seeds; on average, tropical   species have 2 to more than 4 times the saturated vs. unsaturated   fat content of temperate species.  The work proposed here seeks   to determine whether the adaptive significance of this difference   lies in selection for lower oil solidification temperatures in   cool germinating temperate species.  Both phylogenetic and   experimental methods are employed to strengthen the investigation.    Two groups of plants are employed: the Viguiera complex  (Asteraceae) and the tribe Cyclantherae (Cucurbitaceae).  For selected species in each, oil solidification temperature  and composition are determined and then mapped on phylogenies  to determine the pattern of evolution of these traits.  The   phylogeny of the Viguiera complex is known, and that of the   Cyclantherae will be determined from DNA sequence data.  Experiments will be conducted to determine the degree of  plasticity of oil solidification temperature in response  to growing temperature.  Finally, the performance of seeds  germinating at different temperatures will be assessed and  checked to see if it is in accordance with the hypothesis.",
