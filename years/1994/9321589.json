Much research has already been done with these fascinating insects and a well substantiated phylogeny will allow testing of several hypotheses concerning reproductive strategies, host plant associations and mimicry.  %%%  These tropical butterflies represent an important model system for studying patterns of mimicry in predator avoidance and other important areas of behavioral ecology. Sound knowledge of the relationships among species in this group of butterflies will enhance understanding of mimicry, host plant associations and other features of their biology.  Studying such model systems can contribute to our understanding of insect groups and their shifts in host plant associations, thereby shedding light on mechanisms of host shifts such as those that occur when new insect pests of crops begin posing economic problems.  ***",
