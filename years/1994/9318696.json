 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Missouri-St. Louis in the purchase of a 300 MHz NMR.  This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas including the following:  Chemistry   of Diplatinum Complexes Bridged by Dppc or Dppm Ligands, Metallaboranes   Derived from Pentaborane(9) and Hexaborane(10), Silicon Oligomers and   Polymers; Synthesis of Heavy-Metal X-ray Contrast Agents, Dioxirane   Chemistry, and the Preparation and Reactions of Chiral 1-Hydroxy   Phosphonates and Phosphonamides.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of   molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize   specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the   dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.   Access to   state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are   carrying out frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are   useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
