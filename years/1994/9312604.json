 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop an innovative and unified  methodology for designing self-repairable ultra-large integated  (ULSI) circuits and multi-chip module (MCM) chips.  This research  will exploit the combinatorial optimization capabilities offered by  adaptive circuits consisting of simple threshold devices  interconnected programmable resistive networks for the purpose of  adding a self-repair capability to hardware devices.  The proposed  research will be conducted in three phases.  In the first phase,  theoretical models for both regular array logic and unstructured  random logic repar problems will be developed, and entensive  simulations will be performed to measure the performance of the  adaptive self-repair circuits.  In the second phase, adaptive  circuits will be designed using CMOS technology, and experimental  chips willbe fabricated and tested as \"proofs. of concept.\"  In the  third phase, software will be developed to allow the proposed  adaptive bult-in-self-repar circuits to be automatically  synthesized by VLSI/CAD software and invorporated within macro  blocks.  This project initiates a new area of research that is a  natural sequel to the on-going works in the fields of Built-In-  Self-Testing (BIST) and Design for Testability (DFT).",
