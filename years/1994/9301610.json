 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301610  Thatte  Static and dynamic typing are often seen as opposing choices in  the design of high-level programming languages.  In recent years,  there has been growing interest in overcoming this dichotomy.  Much existing work in this area has been focused on static type  analysis of dynamically typed languages where flexibility is  emphasized over static type safety.  The goal of this project is  emphasized over static type safety.  The goal of this project is  to continue research on an approach suitable for extending  statically type-safe languages with limited dynamic typing to  support important features such as persistent objects.  The  project is investigating the use of techniques such as set  constraint resolution, partial evaluation and abstract  interpretation to design type systems that support maximal static  detection of dynamic type errors with minimal dynamic tagging and  checking.  ***",
