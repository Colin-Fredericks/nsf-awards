 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314825  Mukherjee  The purpose of this research is to investigate the  phenomenon of superplasticity in an important class of  structural ceramics, i.e., nitride ceramics.  This is a  collaborative investigation leading to a comprehensive  framework connecting powder consolidation and formation of  micrograined high density nitride ceramics to fabrication  processes based on superplasticity.  A major theme of the  research is the understanding of the mechanisms of  superplasticity in submicron non-oxide ceramic materials.  Scientific paradigms relevant to superplastic response in  non-oxide ceramics are developed by focusing the research on  pure and doped aluminum nitride (AIN) and silicon nitride  (SiN) and without fluxing additives. Both of these important  nitride ceramics will be consolidated by a Plasma Activated  Sintering (PAS) process very recently pioneered in Japan and  demonstrated to achieve high densities in very short  sintering times.  %%%  In this increasingly energy-conscious industrial age,  ceramics are in the forefront as materials destined for use  as high temperature structural materials.  They have the  potential for finding their place in gas turbine engines in  propulsion systems and also in terrestrial power plants.  Superplasticity brings the additional attractive feature of  being a near net-shape forming process, with significant  saving in materials and machining costs.",
