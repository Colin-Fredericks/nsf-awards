Michnet  is the midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that  will provide operations and network information services.  It  will give West Shore Community College a 56 thousand bits per  second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.",
