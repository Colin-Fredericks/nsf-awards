Designed to tackle issues known to stifle the  confidence and enthusiasm of girls in science, the project is a based on research and expertise  of the Kieve Science Camp instructors and staff.  It is a one year effort to train and support 24  adult dissemination leaders (12 parents and teachers and 12 leaders from other science camps  in Maine).  They will be trained through observation and participation with campers in the Kieve  Science Camp for Girls and through a series of four seminars accompanying the camp  experience.  The seminars are designed to help teachers and parents return to their communities  prepared to be advocates for gender equity and experiential education in science.    This project uses a collaborative learning environment to provide professional development for  teachers, to teach the Kieve Science Camp for Girls model to other camp staff, and to cultivate  local actions on behalf of girls in Maine Schools.  The Kieve Science Camp for girls is a  residential experience for 120 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders from six rural and resource-poor  communities in Maine focusing on experiential educations.  in addition challenges requiring  cooperation and risk-taking are encouraged.  The goal of the camp is to effect a positive  attitudinal shift, helping girls see that science is fun, and developing their confidence to  participate fully in the world of science and technology.  The carefully-selected female  instructors and staff support the importance of the role models.  ***",
