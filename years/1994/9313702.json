An objective is to identify equilibrium and deformation-induced  defects in a variety of compounds.  Equilibrium (thermal) defect  formation enthalpies and defect concentrations are determined from  measured site fractions of probe-defect complexes using a  methodology developed during previous studies.  Deformation-induced  defects are compared to thermal defects and the concentrations  estimated from site fractions of probe atoms using PAC and  Mossbauer techniques.  A second objective is to examine the  microstructural evolution of materials subjected to high energy  mechanical milling.  Defects in volume sites and probe sites at  grain boundaries and surfaces are monitored.  The effect of the  defects on destabilizing equilibrium phases is assessed.  %%%       The material defects under study here affect phase stability  and diffusion in advanced materials used in a variety of  applications.  ***",
