The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Gail C. Silver to work with  Dr. Claude Helene  of the Museum National d'Historie Naturelle in Paris,  France.    This research concerns the stabilization of triple-helical  nucleic acids for control of oncogene expression.  This is  based on the recently investigated possibility of  interfering directly with gene expression by targeting  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with oligonucleotides.  The  \"anti-gene\" oligonucleotides bind in a sequence-specific  manner in the major groove of the double-stranded target to  form a triple helix, also known as a triplex.  Cancers are  often the result of over expression of certain genes or the  expression of mutated genes.  These strategies have the  potential to be used to inactivate the expression of genes  that contribute to cancer development.  If the sequence of  the oncogene is known, a complementary sequence can be made  to bind to that particular gene and thus overcome cell  proliferation.  Though the potential of triplex technology  is hard to assess, there is promise and these experiments  will help further understanding by providing a means of  stabilizing the triple helix structure. ***",
