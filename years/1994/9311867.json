 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311867  Crawford, C.  The Sevilleta Field Station serves a large number of research  scientists and students who study the extensive and ecologically  diverse region of central New Mexico.  The region incorporates  transition zones among numerous biomes, including Great Plains  Grassland, Chihuahuan Forests.  Additional biotic assemblages  within these biomes include Rio Grande \"Bosque\" (Riparian  Cottonwood Forest) and Wetlands, Subalpine Forests, and Subalpine  Grasslands.  Much of the current scientific research in the  region focuses on biotic responses to climate change at various  spatial and temporal time scale (seasonal, annual, and  long-term), biodiversity issues, and ecosystem restoration  following natural and anthropogenic disturbance.  Recently the  Sevilleta Field Research Station has completed construction of  several residences and laboratory facilities to meet the demand  for field logistical support.  Construction of a shop/storage  building and a plant lath-house is scheduled to begin in March  1993.  Additional funds have been used to provide laboratory  equipment, computer communication systems, meteorological  instruments, and a 4x4 field vehicle.    This project will support significant increase in the research  support capability of the Sevilleta Field Research Station.  The  project includes construction of a library/computer-center for  the purpose of increasing research capabilities by resident and  visiting scientists.  The library will contain books and  scientific jounals relevant to research activities in the  Sevilleta region, permitting ready access by station scientists  to current and past literature sources.  The computer-center will  consist of 20 modular desk-units, each equipped with one of a  variety of computer teminals or PC's (5 IBM-compatible PC's, 5  Apple PC's, and 10 Unix Terminals, all connected to the Sevilleta  Field Station Network).  Resident and visiting scientists and  graduate students can be assigned desk-units during their stays  a t the station, permitting readily available access to computer  networks, and providing a secure and spacious work area for data  anaylsis and manuscript preparation.  In Addition four additional  residences will be constructed.  This will bring the total field  station residence capacity to 48 persons.  ***",
