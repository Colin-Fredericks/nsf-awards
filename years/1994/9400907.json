 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400907  Miller  Computational aspects of proofs systems may be generally divided  into two kinds.  In what may be broadly called functional  programming, computation is seen as term reduction corresponding  to proof reduction (i.e., to the process of cut elimination).  On  the other hand, in what may be broadly called logic programming,  computation is expressed by goal directed, cut free proof search  in certain formal theories.  This characterization of the logic  programming paradigm is based on Miller's and Scedrov's earlier  joint work.  The proposed research is aimed at understanding the  proof systems arising from linear logic, their computational and  descriptive powers, and their semantics by means of interactive  protocols.  Game-theoretic notions, such as interactive  protocols, should contribute to the understanding of \"fine  structure\" of both semantics and computational expressiveness of  linear logic.  In the logic programming setting, such proof  systems provide primitives for handling contexts and  communications among resources.  A proposed specification  language based on this style of proof system can be used to  declaratively and naturally specify such aspects of computation  as side-effects, communications, and continuations.  ***",
