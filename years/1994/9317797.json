Funds are requested to purchase two items of equipment representing the state-of-the-art in cryotechnology.  The HPF 010 Bal-Tec High Pressure Freezing Machine provides the only means for cryofixing tissue samples up to 0.6 mm in thickness with a total volume of 1mm3 without the formation of damaging ice crystals that occur when samples are frozen at ambient pressure.  The FSU 010 Bal-Tec Freeze Substitution Unit furnishes an automated system for freeze substitution of cryofixed samples increasing the quality and reproducibility of the freeze substitution process, allowing low temperature infiltration and polymerization of resins, and reducing the chances of secondary ice crystal formation.  These instruments do not exist at Arizona State University.  The equipment will be housed in a multi-user electron microscopy facility where they will be primarily available for use by the principle investigators of this proposal, as well as by other faculty and students from three departments (botany, microbiology, and zoology).  Because a high pressure freezing machine is not available anywhere in the southwestern United States, usage by investigators from other regional institutions will be accommodated to the best of our ability. Such equipment will support the ongoing research at Arizona State University and augment our existing instrumentation.  The proposed equipment is essentia l to address timely questions in cell biology such as:  1) mechanisms controlling fungal growth and development (Roberson), 2) signal transduction during embryogenesis (Capco), 3) structural organization of extracellular matrix during fertilization and development (Chandler), 4) interactions of anti-HIV drugs (McGaughey), and 5) membrane biogenesis during photosynthesis (Hoober).  Arizona State University will match 40.3% of the total cost for this equipment.  of biological specimens for electron microscopy result in superio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !         !
