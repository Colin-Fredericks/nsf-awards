The objective of the research is  to demonstrate the separation and purification of small quantities of complex natural products  by supercritical fluid (SCF)/cosolvent extraction and crystallization. The process steps include  critical fluid comminution of raw materials, selective SCF extraction of product and closely  related compounds, purification by programmed SCF elution of extracts by HPLC, and SCF  crystallization of the active natural product(s). Techniques to be investigated in the Phase I  studies include retrograde crystallization, which relies on the inversion of temperature  dependence of solubility as pressure is increased; \"homologous\" antisolvent recrystallization, in  which the proportion of SCF in the SCF/cosolvent mixture is increased in order to decrease  extractant polarity and cause precipitation, and; \"heterologous\" antisolvent crystallization, in  which a third component is added to affect extractant polarity and cause precipitation.  Prototypical natural products to be studied are Taxol and Cephalomannine.  %%%  Successful results of the Phase I studies will find application in the crystallization/purification  of natural product therapeutics such as Taxol which are finding increased use in the health care  industry. Commercialization will be facilitated by increasing their availability while reducing  manufacturing costs.  ***",
