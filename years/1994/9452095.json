 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active volcanoes provide a uniquely exciting environment in which  students can learn how to conduct field-based geologic research.   A new course, Field Volcanology, is based in the southern Cascades,  a region containing three active volcanoes with contrasting  eruptive styles.  The course extends the traditional geology field  camp curriculum by teaching how mapping can be used in conjunction  with other skills to address specific research questions.  Through  a series of integrated projects the participants learn how to  prepare detailed geologic maps and cross sections; install  equipment in the field; collect, analyze and interpret a variety of  original data; use field criteria to evaluate different eruption  models; and assess the state of activity and potential hazards of  each volcano.  By using this environment and teaching approach we  seek to produce motivated and well-trained young scientists who  will be better prepared for a professional career in whatever  subdiscipline they choose to pursue.  The proposed five-week Field  Volcanology course builds upon two of the major strengths of the  Geology Department at Arizona State University: its internationally  recognized program in volcanology and its undergraduate and  graduate curricula that are centered upon a variety of field  courses.  It also takes advantage of some equipment purchased  through an earlier ILI grant for development of a field geophysics  course.",
