 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kassner  9413131       The research is to develop an efficient spheroidization  technology for several aluminum alloys.  Specific heating processes  and cycles, compositions, and forming operations will be developed  that allow effective production and fabrication of spheroidized  semi-solids as determined by cost and final material properties.  Traditional metal shaping processes such as casting and forging can  be dramatically improved in terms of cost and reliability using  novel semi-solids alloys.  However, this is possible only with  special processing of semi-solids to ensure a spheroidized  microstructure.  Semi-solids with a typical dendritic morphology of  the solid phase cannot be readily shaped due to cracking.  To date,  producing a spheroidized microstructure on a commercial scale has  been difficult.         The research is directed at the use of semi-solids in the  casting of aluminum alloys.  The reduction of casting temperatures  in foundries is a worthy goal.  The manufacturing process  development is a collaborative effort between an aluminum industry  and the university.  The commerical potential of the work is high.",
