 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the factors which translate what  one knows into what one does.  When humans or animals learn  something there are times when that learning is turned into  action and times when it is not.  However, when learning is  not acted upon it does not mean that the knowledge  originally has been lost.  This research uses a simple  animal model of this type of learning situation to examine  the status of learning as the performance based on that  learning changes.  Pigeons are trained to associate a light  with the delivery of food.  The learning of this association  is evidenced by the pigeons' pecking at the light.  It is  known that if the relationship between the light and the  food delivery is changed, the pigeons may stop pecking at  the light.  But it is also known that this cessation of  responding does not mean that the pigeons \"forgot\" that the  light and the food are associated.  Under some conditions  the pigeons will start pecking the light once again.  This  means that the pecking evoked by the light is not a good  indicator of the status of the pigeons' knowledge about the  light.  Therefore, the research to be conducted uses two  methods of Pavlovian conditioning, blocking tests and second  order conditioning tests, to assess the status of  associations (like that between the light and food)  independently of responding.  The use of these procedures  will help the PI to understand the conditions under which  associations are acted upon and the conditions under which  knowledge about a particular association can be changed.  Simple associations are the building blocks of learning.  Therefore, to gain a fuller understanding of behavior,  whether animal or human, one needs a clearer understanding  of the determinants of basic learning and performance  processes.  The research to be conducted under this grant  aims to broaden the understanding of behavior by examining  the relationship between what one knows and what one does.",
