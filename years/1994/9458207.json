Mutations in  membrane proteins are responsible for diseases ranging from cystic  fibrosis to cancer. In spite of their crucial importance to  biochemical processes, knowledge of membrane protein structure is  still at a rudimentary level. In order to understand how the amino  acid sequence of a membrane protein determines its  three-dimensional  structure, it is essential to know which residues in the sequence  are the key determinants of that structure. The work undertaken in  this study is designed to identify the structure determining  residues in the sequence of a particular membrane protein,  diacylglycerolkinase from Escherichia coli. The problem will be  addressed by determining what sequence changes can be made in the  protein without affecting activity, what sequence changes destroy  the ability of the protein to fold and function, and what sequence  changes alter the stability of the protein. Residues important to  the structure of the protein should be less tolerant to change than  residues that are not playing crucial roles. The information  obtained will improve the understanding of the forces that  stabilize membrane protein structure and improve the ability to  predict membrane protein structure.  %%%  Proteins are enormous molecules that are almost entirely  responsible for the smooth operation of cellular machinery. Many  thousands of different protein molecules are required to create an  organism as complex as the human body and some of our most feared  diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer are caused by  damaged protein molecules. Consequently, much effort has been  directed toward learning how particular protein molecules work. A  crucial step in developing  an understanding of any individual  protein is to determine its structure: the three dimensional  arrangement of atoms in the protein molecule. Using current  experimental approaches, however, it usually takes many years to  determine the structure of any protein. As a result, there is  little hope of obtaining a detailed understanding of the thousands  of proteins in the cell unless we can more rapidly learn their  structures. This work is directed toward understanding the  molecular rules that determine how a particular class of protein  structures is determined. This work will be used to develop more  rapid, theoretical approaches to structure determination.  ***",
