Achievement of these objectives would provide a  comparative assessment, previously unavailable, of hardening  theories in relation to texture formation in specific metals and an  analytical basis for continued subgrain formation and microshear-  band development with increasing deformation.  This study has the  potential to develop models and constitutive equations that will  enhance the understanding of large deformation processes in metals  and could lead to the development of new computational codes.  Such  codes might be useful for the prediction of the results of metal  forming and manufacturing processes.  ***",
