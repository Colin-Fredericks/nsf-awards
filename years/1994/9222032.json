 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222032 Niedzwecki  In the future severe wave conditions like wave breaking will occur closer to existing coastal structures and pier and bulkhead structures currently in distress due to neglect will face more severe loading conditions.  Methods for retrofitting deteriorated waterfront pile and bulkhead structures or strengthening newer waterfront structures are not well established and current analysis tools can not adequately account for the variabilities in deteriorated structural geometries or the uncertainties associated with the use of materials such as steel fiber reinforced concrete.  Further, an adequate model for providing accurate estimates of the wave loading in confined areas such as on the underside of waterfront structures is not currently available.  A new probabilistic discrete element analysis approach, which includes finite elements and boundary element methods, to address the geometric and material variability is pursued in this research effort in concert with the development of  a probabilistic wave force uplift model based upon fundamental concepts of fluid impulse and momentum considerations.  Parametric studies exercising the limits of the new model will be performed.  These simulations will incorporate the limited data available and predictions for hypothetical, but realistic waterfront structures.",
