 "awd_abstract_narration": "It  is a joint initiative between the Engineering Directorate and  the  Computer  Information  and  Engineering  Directorate.   This  research  involves  a  collaboration among roboticists,  computer  scientists,  biomechanicists, and  surgeons  at  Carnegie  Mellon  University and Shadyside Hospital to advance the state-of-the-art  in  medical  robotics.  Robotics and computer-based  technologies  present medicine with excellent opportunities to improve surgical  practice.  Surgical robots are particularly well suited for  such  medical fields as orthopaedics in which there is a clinical  need  for  accurate execution of biomechanics-based preoperative plans.  To  fully  realize the promise of medical robotics, advances  are  still needed to develop: (1) surgical simulators that incorporate  the  complex  biomechanics of biological systems, (2)  clinically  practical surgical cutting and registration techniques,  and  (3)  effective    methods   for   preoperative   and    intraoperative  human-computer interaction.   The interdisciplinary research team  will  create  advanced  numerical  simulation  capabilities   for  orthopaedics,  robotic techniques for surface-based  registration  and  high-speed  3-D sensing, and human-computer interfaces  that  present  biomechanical  and  intraoperative  information   in   a  clinically  meaningful  manner.  These advances  will  complement  surgeons' abilities with realistic surgical simulators  and  less  traumatic  robotic  tools for implementing surgical  plans.   The  project  targets  total  joint  replacement  surgery,  with   the  expectation  of broader impact on the emerging field  of  medical  robotics  and beyond. With high performance computing serving  as  the   glue,  the integration of these component technologies will  lead to the next generation of computer-assisted surgical robots.",
