 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benjamin Widom is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on the theory of   fluids, phase transitions and interfaces.  Work is proposed in three   specific areas of research.  In the first area of study, interfacial   structure and interfacial phase transitions will be studied in an effort   to understand the nature of the inhomogeneous region of contact between   otherwise homogeneous fluid phases.  In these studies a theoretical model   will be used which should illuminate the connection, and resolve the   differences, between two alternative and sometimes discrepant points of   view, that of free energy functional theory and that of an interface   displacement theory.  The second area of study involves the coexistence   of periodically modulated (liquid crystal) phases, and the structure and   thermodynamics of the interface between such phases.  A theoretical study   will trace the evolution of the scattering peak in the isotropic fluid in   which there is an incipient periodicity into a true delta function Bragg   peak as the fluid undergoes a second order transition to an ordered,   liquid-crystalline state.  The third area of research involves the use of   scaling theory to develop a model for the electrophoresis of charged,   long-chain polymers.  The proposed study will elucidate the interplay   between the chain length of the polymer and the applied electric field.    In the everyday world, interfaces between fluid phases are ubiquitous,   yet very little is known about the details of the structure of the   interface or the processes which are going on at the interface.  Widom's   work will provide molecular level insights on the spatial structure and   thermodynamics of those contact regions.",
