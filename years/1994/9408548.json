 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to improve our understanding  of the factors that control the gas to aerosol phase distribution  of semi-volatile organic compounds.  Results from this program will  provide modelers with tools to predict vaporization and  condensation of semi-volatiles as gas and particle concentrations  change with time.  Most of the current efforts to predict organic  partitioning have been based on equilibrium theory.  Although these  efforts have substantially advanced our understanding of the  partitioning process under ideal conditions, there are strong  indications that atmospheric equilibrium between the gas and  particle phases may not be established for most compounds of  interest over relatively short time scales (minutes to hours).       To obtain experimental data to develop and test models of  semi-volatile mass transfer between the gas and particle phases,  combustion emissions will be aged in a large 190cm3 outdoor Teflon  film environmental chamber.  Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs) will be used as example compounds, but the methodology will  be applicable to other organic semi-volatile toxics.  Net PAH loss  rates from particles and the gas phase will be monitored.  Rates of  PAH mass transfer to the from the particles will be estimated using  a new inner particle diffusion model which considers mass transfer  in a liquid organic layer surrounding the particle.  Three  different types of particles will be used.  They will be generated  from wood, diesel and coal combustion to represent particle types  which have different amounts of a \"liquid phase\" surrounding an  inner carbon core.  It is expected that the amount and type of  organic material that forms this outer layer of the particle will  strongly influence inner organic particle diffusion, enthalpies of  desorption from the surface, and ultimately rates of particle semi-  volatile uptake and loss.       By changing the concentration of semi-volatile vapors and/or  particles in the chamber, an d thereby perturbing the equilibrium  between gas and particle phase organic, these researchers will be  able to investigate rates of semi-volatile sorption (condensation)  and evolution to and from particles.  To radically alter  equilibrium conditions, some experiments will be conducted by  passing combustion emissions through a large gas stripper/denuder  to remove the gas phase semi-volatile component before particles  enter the chamber.   Semi-volatile deuterated PAH will be added to  the gas phase to observe rates of mass transfer to the particles.",
