Recent scholarship on changes in firm production  strategies, worker-management relations, and on the training of  \"skilled labor\" suggest that the positions held by Third World  women in such facilities may not be as static as previously  expected.  The proposed research investigates how women in  \"unskilled\" jobs in the \"global assembly line\" have acquired the  \"skills\" qualifying them for promotion into supervisory  positions.  Central to the study is the way that skilled labor  comes to be defined and recognized at the workplace across  industries and within several factories.  This research will  examine how new requirements for production and renovated  technologies alter the roles played by Third World workers in  multinational production facilities in situ. To do this, the  investigators will study the emergence of Mexican female  supervisors within multinational operations in Ciudad Juarez,  which is one of Mexico's largest export processing zones.  Portions of this proposal are derived from preliminary research  conducted in Mexico in 1992.  The proposed research focuses on  the use of both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews  with workers, supervisors, and managers at selected plants of  multinational firms located in Ciudad Juarez.       This project will provide important new insights into the  understanding of the ways in which multinational firms interact  with the local population in industrializing areas with an  emphasis on how gender relations both constitute part of the  structure of the organization of manufacturing and, in turn, are  redefined because of the presence of the multinational firms.  As  a doctoral dissertation research improvement award, this project  will also provide support to enable a promising student to  establish a strong indep endent research career.  ***",
