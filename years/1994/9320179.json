Specific projects to be studied are:    (1) Distributed Collaborative Systems: Communication protocols for distributed real-time multimedia collaborative applications such as remote visualization, imaging, and video conferencing will be developed in this research project.    (2) Distributed Shared Memory: Research will be performed on highly-scalable DSM synchronization and consistency algorithms and protocols for designing massive multicomputers with a high-speed network serves as the backplane.    (3) Memory-Based File Systems: In this project a new file system abstraction based on volatile storage that avoids the bottlenecks of disk storage and capitalizes on fast networks and distributed memory resources will be investigated.    (4) Active 3-D Vision: Investigation on the use of active camera control and distributed processing to improve the quality and performance of stereo reconstruction of three-dimensional objects will be performed in this research.    (5) Distributed Automated Reasoning: Under this project a reasoning system based on default logic and extended logic programming and implement it in the distributed computing environment will be developed.      These five projects tackle several most pressing issues facing current and future distributed systems. Approaches to scalable distributed multicomputers and new architectures for high-performance distributed file systems studied. In addi tion, studies will be made on other important domains of applications such as multimedia, active 3-D vision, and automated reasoning --- each of them requiring significant computational power and high bandwidth communications.  ***            INHELP EXE           @ j =     SYSTEM  INI           <o\\  #    CONTROL HLP           @ j N H   WIN     COM           :X  T     BOOTLOG TXT           EX  k     9320179  Truszczynski     This award provides funds to purchase and construct a high-speed ATM network testbed to support severa                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        q   s   V   X   D   F   ,   .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  $         $         $              G                             W             W                                      Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                      e   e                        :    Truszczynski/U.Ky    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
