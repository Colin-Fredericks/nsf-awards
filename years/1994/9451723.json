Earth System Science is the  interdisciplinary study of the earth, as a system, and its  component parts, which include the atmosphere, maritime regions,  biological and hydraulic cycles, and geographic features, their  interaction and evolution.  The overall motivation for a program of  study in Earth System Science is to expose a large segment of the  University's faculty and students to the multidisciplinary nature  of the subject while simultaneously increasing the numbers of  minority students pursuing careers in this and related areas.  A  laboratory that is used to accompany a recently developed course  entitled \"Introduction to Earth System Sciences\" is being further  developed and equipped.  This course targets (1) first and second  year students that are interested in pursuing ESS careers or are  interested in learning more about the environment in which they  live, (2) elementary and secondary education majors that will  eventually teach in our nation's classrooms, and (3) students that  need a laboratory science course to fulfill their requirements for  a bachelor's degree.  The requested equipment, coined, educational  development workstations, allows the inclusion of interactive,  multimedia based teaching modules in our developing Earth System  Science program.",
