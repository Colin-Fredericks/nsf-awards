The  initiative proposes to reform teaching and learning of science,  mathematics, and technology in the Phoenix inner city by creating  a \"seamless web\" of administrative, and instructional support  services.  Using the Maricopa Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities (CRCM) model of school clusters, built upon feeder  patters, as a basis for addressing communication and articulation  between the initial participating districts and among grade  levels.  It is anticipated that this model will assist Phoenix in  developing a continuum of K-12 programs and services designed to  prepare all students for success at the next grade level.  Over  the five year period of the award, the city will reform its  science and mathematics education delivery system for all  students from elementary school through post-secondary education.  A Council of Superintendents, created to facilitate communication  among the participating independent school districts, elected one  member to represent them as Principal Investigator with overall  responsibility for project outcomes.",
