A very talented faculty in this field has been  assembled over the past decade by several departments, acting  independently. Interdepartmental coordination of their activities  did not begin until recently.  this traineeship program will be the  catalyst for promoting the further organization of these scientists  and engineers into a nationally visible group.  Maryland can offer  graduate students special opportunities to use state-of-the-art  analytical methods (e.d. AMS, EXAFS, TIMS, INAA) in their study of  ground water problems.  The State presents an unusual diversity of  ground water environments and problems within easy reach of the  campus.  Although ground water hydrology/hydrogeology is the  fastest growing area of graduate hiring in the earth sciences, the  production of PhDs in this field has not increased in nearly two  decades.  A 1991 NRC study has stressed the need for  multidisciplinary education in this field, a concept which this  proposal addresses specifically.  Integration of fundamental  science and engineering research is a goal of the program.  The  program will be managed by the Maryland Water Resources Research  Center.",
