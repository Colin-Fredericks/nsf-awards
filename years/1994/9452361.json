 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452361  Peroni  This proposal requests $42,325 for the purchase of MacIntosh  computers, software and accessory equipment to outfit a computer  facility for introductory biology. The computers are necessary for  the addition of investigative modules to the three course  introductory series for biology majors. Computers have not been  previously integrated into introductory courses at Davidson, except  on a very limited basis. Computer facilities appropriate to  introductory biology laboratory exercises are not currently  available on campus.    The research-based modules will be integrated into all three  introductory courses. All students passing through these courses  will then have exposure to: 1) exploring theoretical concepts using  computer simulations; 2) design and execution of small group  research projects; 3) critical thinking and writing exercises. This  introductory curriculum will prepare students for a more in-depth  exposure to investigative courses at the junior and senior level,  as well as to prepare them for independent research projects and  graduate school.    The computer facility will be used by all introductory students.  The introductory courses will seat approximately 384-448 students  each year. Multiple sections of each course are offered each  semester.",
