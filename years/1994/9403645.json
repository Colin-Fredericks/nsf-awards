 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403645  McEnroe    This award is under the International Junior Investigator and  Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and  engineers to conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at  research centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique  or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Suzanne A. McEnroe of the University of  Massachusetts at Amherst to work with Dr. Trond H. Torsvik at the  Norwegian Geological Survey (NGU) on paleomagnetic exploration of  the processes of education and cooling of deep-seated metamorphic  rocks following Laurentian-Baltic plate collision in the Western  Gneiss Region, Norway.    Research on the paleomagnetism of metamorphic rocks is designed  to determine the orientation of the earth's magnetic field at the  time of formation of the protolith, at the time when new magnetic  minerals grew during low-temperature metamorphism, or at the time  when magnetic minerals cooled below the Curie temperature (580  degrees Celsius) or Neel temperature (670 degrees Celsius)  following high-temperature metamorphism.  The western gneiss  region of the Scandinavian Caledonides in Norway contains a wide  variety of rock types within the Baltic plate that were subducted  to depths up to 100 km and heated to temperatures up to 750  degrees Celsius before being rapidly \"educted\" and cooled against  overlying cooler remnants of the Laurentian plate.  The  acquisition of paleomagnetic vectors from the metamorphic rocks  is made difficult by the factors of coarse grain size and fabric  anisotropy, but numerous targets of opportunity are available in  the form of apparently isotropic eclogites and basement gabbro  masses with relict primary distributions of magnetic minerals.  Using the superb equipment at the NGU, it is intended to use this  paleomagnetic tool to enhance our unde rstanding of the  relationships between metamorphic reactions, cooling deformation,  time, and the acquisition of magnetic signatures in these deep-  seated metamorphic rocks.  The results of this research would  contribute to overall understanding of deep-seated processes,  rock-magnetic properties of these metamorphic rocks, and crustal  history in a zone of continental collision.  ***",
