These cavitation pressures set unambiguous limits to maximum drought tolerance and water transport capacity. Cavitation is also caused by freeze-thaw cycles and sets additional limits to water transport under conditions when freezing and thawing occurs in the xylem water. The proposed research will evaluate the role cavitation and whole -plant hydraulic conductance play in conferring the necessary summer drought tolerance for the cold-desert shrub Artemesia tridentata while at the same time promoting maximum stomatal conductance and xylem flow when water is available in spring but freeze-thaw cycles are common. This work will extend current efforts to characterize the integration between physically  limited hydraulic parameters of water transport and physiological-morphological responses to stress including turgor maintenance, stomatal closure, and leaf abscission. At the same time, the research will complement and perhaps help explain previous work which has extensively characterized seasonal patterns in water relations, photosynthesis and growth in this species. Genetic differentiation in hydraulic limitations to water flow will be evaluated among the three ecologically distinct subspecies vaseyana, wyomingensis, and tridentata. The patterns found in A. tridentata will be compared to the herbaceous perennial A. ludoviciana to obtain further insight into stress responses related to life history; this will also provide an evolutionary perspective becaus e woody Artemisia probably evolved from congeneric herbaceous ancestors. Field monitoring of soil and plant water relations, leaf area and phenology for two-three years under differing water regimes will be evaluated in the context of laboratory determinations of the cavitation response to freeze-thaw cycles and water stress that form the basis of predicting maximum possible flows without cavitation. Greenhouse/lab experiments will allow more precise determination of responses to soil and atmospheric drought and evaluate whether water stress is sensed in the root vs. the leaf. The ultimate outcome will be a better understanding of the adaptations of cold-desert shrubs to their unique seasonal climatic regime, and a critical evaluation of how cavitation and hydraulic conductance considerations are integrated into whole plant stress responses.  ***      ~                                                                                                                                                                                     J   P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   E   J                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     !         !           !
