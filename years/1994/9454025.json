 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Infrastructure Engineering at Texas A&M University,  in a collaborative effort with Texas A&M University -- Kingsville  (TAMU-K), proposes a Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) project  that will focus a program of doctoral study on the infrastructure  issues associated with the colonias in the border region of Texas,  New Mexico, Arizona and California.    Colonias represent both densely populated and scattered  developments along the entire U.S. border with Mexico.  They lack  the fundamental infrastructures of a developed nation, as well as  those infrastructures associated with education, health care, and  environmental protections.  In Texas, there are an estimated 1,193  colonias sites with over 500,000 residents of Hispanic origin.    The proposed GRT project will incorporate a Ph.D. Pipeline for  Hispanics.  Two of the GRTs will complete the M.S. degree under  program funding at TAMU-K, and then earn the Ph.D. at Texas A&M.   TAMU-K is the engineering institution of access for Hispanics in  South Texas, home to over one-third of the 4.5 million Texans of  Hispanic origin.    For GRTs in civil engineering infrastructures this area of focus  provides an opportunity to conduct research, develop and implement  applications technologies, and better define the relationship of  infrastructure engineering to an important societal context.",
