The courses are taught by a new faculty member in  the biology department with expertise in insect behavior and  ecology. The college has supported the initial development of  this program; however this project provides video microscopy,  insect rearing equipment, and other modern instrumentation. It  is expected that the project will improve the experimental  approach as well as the behavioral laboratory component in the  new entomology courses. Also, this equipment will support  directed entomological research performed by undergraduate  students at a small liberal arts college.  ***",
