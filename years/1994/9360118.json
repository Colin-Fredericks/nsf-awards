 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360118  Stark  It has been suggested that a hypothetical crystalline material, B-  C3N4, may be harder than diamond, provide exceptional wear and  corrosion resistance, and exhibit an extremely low coefficient of  friction.  No one yet has successfully synthesized continuous  films of crystalline carbon nitride.  Such an achievement would  represent a technical milestone.  The availability of superhard B-  C3N4 in the form of an adherent, solid lubricant coating would  permit significant advances to be made in tribology.    The innovation we propose is the synthesis of metastable,  crystalline carbon nitride films by dual ion beam assisted  deposition (DIBAD).  The DIBAD process has been used successfully  to synthesize metastable materials such as cubic boron nitride.  It also offers considerable promise for successfully growing  films of B-C3N4.  The key to successful synthesis is momentum  transfer into the films per arriving atom.  DIBAD provides a  wider window of operation than does a single ion beam evaporation  process.    In phase 1, we will demonstrate the feasibility of growing  continuous films of stoichiometric and near-stoichiometric B-C3N4  by the DIBAD process.  Deposition conditions will be defined and  the films characterized in terms of their composition,  morphology, density, structure, thermal stability, adhesion and  tribological properties.  ***",
