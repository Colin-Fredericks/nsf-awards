 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400770  Brinton   An interactive, microcomputer-based expert system will be developed for the euphausiid crustaceans, an ecologically important taxon throughout the world ocean.  The expert system will include several pathways to arrive at identifications and the information base for all of the known species.  These pathways will include:  (1) a visually oriented, interactive pictorial key, (2) a structured database pathway, permitting rapid searches based on selected character states, and (3) searches by taxon name.  There will be separated modules to differentiate Euphausiids from higher taxa and to identify species of adult Euphausiids.  The expert system will include worldwide biogeographic distribution maps for each species; electron and light micrographs, including original color micrographs wherever possible; line drawings; and behavioral sequences in the form of QuickTime movies.  It will include an illustrated glossary and a bibliography indexed by species.  It will be made available on CD-ROM for all major microcomputer operating systems, hence usable in the field or at remote field stations.  The expert system will be an original synthesis of information both unpublished and published. It will include euphausiid morphology, taxonomy, and biogeography, as well as aspects of euphausiid behavior including swimming, feeding, and bioluminescent displays.  It will be immediately useful in studies of marine biodiversity.  It will be important for GLOBEC ( Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics) studies, where multiple investigators must ensure that they are using common (and current) sources for identifications.  It will be useful to researchers who do not have comprehensive libraries.  It will incorporate unpublished information gleaned over 3 decades by 3 euphausiid experts.  The expert system will draw on the specimens and resources of Scripps Institutes Planktonic Invertebrates Collection.  Production of CD-ROM's will be done in cooperation with Expert Center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI ), University of Amsterdam.",
