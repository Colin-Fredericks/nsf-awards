This  project will improve the quality of undergraduate education in  science by replacing relatively passive learning techniques with  more active ones.  Students will be involved in a laboratory  environment which is more dynamic, less intimidating, and which  allows the individual exploration which can capture the imagination  and lead to the excitement of scientific discovery.  They will take  from these courses a greater understanding of science and a greater  appreciation of its importance in their lives.",
