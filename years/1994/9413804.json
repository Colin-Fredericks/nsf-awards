 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413804 Johnson   The term \"smart pixel\" refers  to picture elements in a display or photodetector array that may have some or all of the following attributes memory, intra-pixel processing, inter-pixel communication, and optical I/O in the form of photodetectors and modulators or emitters.  Smart pixel arrays (SPAs) evolved form passive-addressed spatial light modulators (SLMs) and displays.  These devices sport \"simple: picture elements consisting of material placed between two overlapping electrodes to modulate the amplitude, phase, or polarization of an optical wave front in response to the potential difference between the two electrodes.  SLMs and displays with simple pixels suffer form low frame and refresh rates resulting in image degradation and  ghosting, low resolution, and limited pixel functionality.  By incorporating active circuitry at  each picture element, so-called \"smart pixel\" arrays overcome many of the problems associated with their predecessors.    Industrial interest in the project is high as Kopin Corporation, Boeing, Rockwell Sciences Center, RCA Sarnoff, Boulder Nonlinear Systems, Meadowlark Optics, Physical Optics Corporation , Ford Research Laboratories and Ball Communications are already working with the NSF/ERC for Optoelectronic Computing Systems (OCS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) to design and fabricate SPAs for applications ranging from micro displays to smart cameras for the intelligent vehicle highway system.  These industries have funded, or have committed to fund approximately $322,471 per year in support of personnel and SPA fabrication cost.  In addition, Photonics Research Incorporated, science Applications Incorporated and Hughes Aircraft have contracted with the Center for another $290,995 per year to investigate silicon backplanes to drive vertical cavity surface emitting laser for parallel, free-space optical interconnects.  There are knowledge-based and technology-based issues that must be addressed to improve the quality and manufact urability of LCOS smart pixel arrays, thus insuring their eventual commercialization.    The equipment requested in this proposal will establish the first comprehensive computer-aided design, planarization, and advanced manufacturing and packaging facility for smart pixel array technology.  In particular, we propose to purchase with NSF and matching funds computer workstations with color graphics and color printers for a centralized smart pixel design laboratory, wafer polishing and metal deposition systems to planarize the processed die, and develop an automated robotic controlled packaging facility that will lead the way to a low-cost method of manufacturing SPAs.  This world class facility will be used for research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students, research associates, faculty, and industrial researchers working in the field of micro display and smart pixel array design.  Working SPAs will be cataloged in a library.  Documentation will be provided that detail the operating characteristics of the design, including response time, responsivity (when photodetectors are used) and I-V curves where appropriate.  One anticipated result of this project is the design of 1024X1180 and 2048X2048 smart pixel arrays for helmet mounted displays.  These devices will project 6 bits analog and full color data.  High density smart photodetector arrays for enhanced night vision will also be a focus of  this research.  Another major result anticipated from this project is producing planarized silicon backplanes, resulting in an optically flat surface for the liquid crystal modulator.  Finally, an advanced manufacturing and packaging facility will produce a  low-cost, robotic-controlled method for manufacturing SPAs.",
