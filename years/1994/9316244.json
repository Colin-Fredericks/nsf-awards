 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316244  Honzatko  The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of the  synthetase from E. coli reveals a folding topology of the  polypeptide chain heretofore unobserved in any other protein  structure.  yet, the synthetase has residues which correspond to  the GTP-binding residues of the p21ras protein.  Given the high  level of sequence similarity between synthetases from bacteria to  mammals, the structure of the E. coli enzyme should provide a  reasonable basis for understanding structure-function relationships  of synthetases from a wide variety of species.     Four different crystal forms of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E.  coli are under investigation.  Each of the crystal forms diffracts  to a resolution of at least 2.8A.  The four crystal forms will be  used in the study of ligand-enzyme complexes by the method of X-ray  diffraction.  The X-ray diffraction studies will probe the  conformational response of the synthetase to each substrate or  substrate analogue individually and in combination.  In addition to  the diffraction studies, a series of directed mutations will be  performed on the enzyme, in order to confirm the significance of  specific residues in catalysis, substrate binding, and/or the  structural integrity of the enzyme.  The structure of a limited  number of mutant synthetases will be determined, in order to better  understand how structural changes give rise to the altered  properties of the mutants.  Each of the structures above will be  refined, using HPCC facilities and state-of-the-art software.   %%%  The proposed investigations will reveal the structural basis for  mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition of adenylosuccinate  synthetase from Esherichia coli Adenylosuccinate synthetase governs  the first committed step in the de novo synthesis of adenine  nucleotides, converting the substrates Mg2+-GDP, and phosphate.   Adenine nucleotides support many biochemical functions, perhaps the  most important of which is the synthesis of proteins, RNA  and DNA.  ***",
