A10-week research program  for undergraduates will be conducted where basic principles of  ecology are taught, and the methods by which scientists increase  our understanding of the natural world detailed.  The program  will be comprised of three phases:  I -- Two weeks of formal  lectures detailing the scientific method, hypothesis testing and  experimental design; II -- 6 1/2 weeks of data collection and  experimentation; and III -- 1-1/2 weeks of data analysis,  interpretation and communication of results.  The goal is show  students how to \"do\" science and then give them an opportunity to  conduct original and independent field research.  Students are  sought from a diversity of backgrounds, interests and home  institutions.  The focus of the program will be on testing  hypotheses related to plant-animal interactions, population  dynamics, and conservation biology--topics that have considerable  basic/applied interest, and high heuristic value.  Students will  conduct research in a field-station setting at the Blandy  Experimental Farm, a biological field station of the University  of Virginia, and will be immersed in a community of 15 -20  graduate/post-doctoral researchers.  Field trips will focus on  issues related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the  Farm will also add to the research experience. A bio-ethics  component is included in the program consisting of weekly  lectures/discussions lead by Mr. David Bosco, Instructor of  Philosophy and Religious Studies at James Madison University.   Faculty wages, 1/2 the cost of a small truck, and fees for  laboratory space/dorm rooms are being contributed as cost share  items.  ***",
