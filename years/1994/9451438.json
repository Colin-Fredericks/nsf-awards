This graphics laboratory  supports the present computer graphics course as well as  independent study in computer graphics. The course focuses on the  foundations of modern computer graphics, with an emphasis on the  mathematics, physics, and computer science theories needed to  render raster images. Students progress from simple pixel-by-pixel  calculations to a final project involving realistic 3D images. The  predominant independent study project, known as Carl3D, is a  student-written 3D graphics environment which can create, display  and manipulate images in a wide variety of formats. Students use  the advanced features of the graphics system to create  visualization tools for other students and faculty, with a  particular emphasis on animation.",
