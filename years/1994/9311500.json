 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311500  FALKNER            The largest and most precise data base for any trace element  in the oceans is that of barium whose concentrations were measured  on the global scale as part of the GEOSECS program in the 1970's.   From that effort, it was confirmed that Ba undergoes nutrient-like  cycling in the oceans and that it behaves more like the  constituents of the hard parts of organisms (i.e. Si and  alkalinity) than those of their tissues (i.e. P and N). Work on  particulate matter has shown that the principal phase responsible   for the transport of Ba is the mineral barite (BaSO4), which is  somehow precipitated in micro environments provided by decaying  organisms and tends to accumulate in the sediments underlying zones  of high productivity.  This simple understanding of Ba cycling has  paved the way for its development as a probe for a variety of  important oceanic processes. For example, paleo-Ba distributions,  as recorded in the calcite lattices of foraminifera tests. are  being reconstructed as a constraint on changes in oceanic  circulation through glacial/interglacial transitions.  Barium to Ca  ratios in annually banding corals at select locations have been  proposed to monitor changes in upwelling conditions associated with  El Nino events.  Sedimentary Ba is thought to serve as an index of  paleo-productivity in overlying surface waters and on a more  immediate time-scale, suspended particulate barite in the water  column has been suggested to provide a measure of the net rate of  carbon export from the euphotic zone.  While considerable strides  in the development of Ba as an investigative tool have been made,  realization of its full potential requires a more  thorough  understanding of its behavior in the modern ocean.          This study will contribute dissolved Ba analyses to resolve  outstanding issues regarding Ba cycling in the oceans.  In  addition, the data generated will be used in Indian and Antarctic  Ocean modeling studies being conducted in collaboration with  French  and Belgian colleagues.",
