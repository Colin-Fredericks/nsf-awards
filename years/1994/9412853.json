The  Con ference focuses on current topics in the synthesis, processing  and utilization of fer roelectrics in a variety of applications.   Piezoelectrics, Dielectrics, Electrostrictives, Pyroelectrics, and  Photorefractives are all covered from these perspectives in Plenary  and Regular Sessions, as well as in extensive Poster Sessions.   Arrangements have been made to allow for in-depth discus sions on  critical subject areas.  It is expected that top scientists in the  field will attend, and that the Conference sessions will provide an  effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific  issues, and to consider and define the approaches and techniques  needed to ad dress them.    %%% An evaluation of the status of the  general chemistry and physics of ferroelectrics from their basic  synthesis and processing to their utilization in applications, and  recommendations by the session participants for the emphasis of  future work, and their assessment of the most important  contem porary research issues will be of great value to the  understanding and development of ferroelec tric and related  materials, and for their subsequent utilization in fields such as  microelectronics, and for their general applications as sensors and  actuators.       ***",
