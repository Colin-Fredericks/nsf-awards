 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311863  Ciesielski    This award provides funds to permit Drs. Maciej Ciesielski and Wayne Burleson,  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of  Massachusetts/Amherst, to pursue with Drs. Whangue Cho and Saeyang Yang,  Departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, respectively, Pusan  National University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research  on high performance synthesis with wave pipelining.  The objective of this  collaboration is to exchange synthesis techniques, tools, and benchmarks in an  attempt to discover appropriate methods for restructuring combinational and  sequential logic to facilitate wave-pipelining.  Their research tasks involve  studying methods of architectural and logic restructuring such that a circuit  can be optimally pipelined with minimum area overhead.    Wave pipelining is a method of high-performance circuit design which  implements pipelining in logic.  As a result, several computational signals  related to different clock cycles can propagate through the logic  simultaneously.  In the present research, the collaborators will undertake a  formal treatment of wave-pipelining in which they will describe the timing  constraints which must be met in order to safely propagate multiple signals  through a computational block.  The collaborators are recognized as experts in  the field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the  U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. scientists will benefit  from the unique research and experimental environments provided through access  to major Korean electronics industries and a nationally funded VLSI research  laboratory with which their Korean counterparts maintain close research  cooperation.  Korean participation i n the project is supported by the Korea  Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under NSF Grant No.  MIP-9208267.  ***",
