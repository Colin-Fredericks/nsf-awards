 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photochemical, photophysical, and spectroscopic properties of ion   pairs formed from cationic dyes and anionic borates will be studied. The   first question to be considered will be  whether or not the boranyl   radicals formed by one electron oxidation of borates are bound species.   This will be addressed by application of time-resolved spectroscopic   methods on picosecond and femtosecond time-scales. Since the lifetime of   boranyl radicals is too short to permit measurement of the oxidation   potential by electrochemical means, a kinetic method based on the   Rehm-Weller equation will be applied to estimate their potentials. A   series of borates will be prepared to investigate the effect of steric   crowding in the borate upon the oxidation potential. Penetrated ion pairs   will be prepared that have different encounter distances, orientation,   and free energy changes for photoinitiated electron transfer reactions.   With these various penetrated ion pairs, factors that control forward and   back electron transfer will be analyzed.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work   of Professor Gary B. Schuster at the University of Illinois. Ion pairs   will be formed from positively charged dyes and negatively charged   borates. The borates contain a total of four other carbon containing   groups ( alkyl or aryl groups) bonded to the boron atom. These ion pairs   will be irradiated with light which is absorb by the dye. An electron   will be transfer from the dye to the borate, which will in turn cause an   alkyl group to dissociate from boron in the form of a free radical (a   carbon species with one unpaired electron). The efficiency of this   reaction, which depends in part on the back-transfer of an electron to   give the starting ion pair, will be studied as a function of the   structure of the ion pair. These ion pairs have practical importance,   since they can initiate polymerization upon irradiation with visible and   infrared light. The wide co mmercial application of polymers makes these   ion pairs of commercial interest.",
