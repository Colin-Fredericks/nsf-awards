 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds two related projects:  an exploration of  the structure of the  class, P, of polynomial time computable sets, and an  exploration of the  structure and applications of the Sharply Bounded Hierarchy  within P.    Earlier work (with Steve Homer) explored scalability, an ordering  property of  sets in P, as a tool for determining the P-isomorphism degree  structure of the  class P.  This work raised more questions than it answered.  These questions  about the strength of various ordering properties on sets in P  are explored.  Is scalability, the P-isomorphism closure of  P-rankability,  actually stronger than P-rankability?  When is it harder to  order a set than to  give its census function?  In addition, when are two sets  in P with similar  densities P-isomorphic?    One can also consider the structure of the sets  within the class by considering  self-reducibility properties.  Prior work  showed a series of results of the  form, `a set is in P if it has the following  two  self-reducibility properties,` which is continued, in light of recent  work on self-reducible sets.   P is a large class, including sets recognizable  in  polynomial time, where the polynomial has a large degree. This seems to be  too  large a class to be considered feasible, so this research studies  classes  within P defined by limited polynomial time and O(log n) bits of  nondeterminism.",
