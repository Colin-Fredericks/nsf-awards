 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simon  MCB-9315948  Abstract  Turnip crinkle virus is an ideal system to study the mechanism of  RNA recombination. The genome is among the smallest viral RNA  genomes and is associated with satellite RNAs and numerous small,  subviral RNAs (Sat-RNA) which are the products of recombination  events within the genomic RNA or between the genomic and subviral  RNAs. The development of an in vitro recombination as well as a  protoplast recombination system has allowed a more complete  characterization of the elements and factors which mediate  recombination in this system. A model of recombination has resulted  from our work which suggests that coat protein helps to mediate the  recombination event by possibly positioning the templates in  proximity. In order to test this model and to continue  characterizing the event, we will: 1. Establish protoplast and in  vitro assays for recombination. 2. Conduct structural studies on  motif I (the sequences found at the right sides of all junctions of  recombinant RNA) using both mutagenesis and chemical and enzymatic  probes. 3. Determine the role of coat protein in recombination  between sat-RNA D and Sat-RNA C using gel-shift assays and 4. Assay  for binding of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to motif I.  %%%  Viruses which depend on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for  replication of their genomic and sub-genomic RNAs are subject to  high inherent mis-incorporation of nucleotides that can lead to  heterogeneous mixtures of related species. Thus, RNA recombination  is now thought to have been, and perhaps still is, a major factor  in the evolution of viruses. The discovery that the turnip crinkle  virus contained nearly the entire sequence of a satellite RNA  joined to two regions of genomic RNA by this laboratory suggested  that non-homologous recombination occurs. That fact, as well as  small genome size and the generation of recombinant molecules in a  non-random manner suggested that a detailed examination of the  sequences, structures and mechanisms inv olved in the  recombinational event would be productive. It is critical in many  ways to have a better understanding of the mechanisms used by  viruses in the evolutionary process and the information resulting  from the specific goals pursued in this work will enhance that  understanding.",
