 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315052  Wehmiller       Assessing the geochemical integrity of fossil specimens is a  critical step in resolving several long-standing conflicts in  Coastal Plain geochronology that may stem from the subtle overprint  of diagenetic alteration on the existing data.  An integrated  approach will be adopted that will utilize standard methods in  addition to newly developed techniques to identify and quantify  possible alteration with a precision previously unobtainable.   Advanced quantitative HPLC and GC techniques will be used to screen  mollusk samples used in aminostratigraphy for significant  hydrolysis and/or loss of amino acids from the shells.  Gas  chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) will be  used to assess the influence of extraneous amino acids on the  indigenous amino acid population.  Recently developed mass  spectrometric methods will be used for study of the U-series  isotopic system in coral samples.  Between 10 and 20 paired  specimens of corals attached to mollusks will provide a direct  intercalibration of U-series and amino acid chronologies.         The carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the mollusk  shells will be used for paleoenvironmental interpretation and  further assessment of potential diagenetic alteration of mollusks  used for aminostratigraphy.  Seasonal temperature ranges can be  calculated from shell  18O profiles and the mode of seasonal carbon  cycling may be inferred from the  13C records.  Two experimental  tests of models used to interpret shell isotope profiles are  included in the project.  The first will develop and improve means  of distinguishing salinity from temperature effects on the isotopic  composition.  The second is an in situ experiment relating the  13C  of the seawater and sediment porewater bicarbonate reservoir to the    13C of the shell.  Both tests address fundamental problems in using  stable isotopes for high-resolution paleoenvironmental  reconstruction.       The major scientific goals are 1) to test correla tions between  the Atlantic Coastal Plain stratigraphic record and global records  of Pleistocene sea levels, and 2) to document the geographic  temperature gradient along the Atlantic Coast during interglacial  episodes.  The project will involve collaboration with the US  Geological Survey as part of a new initiative to study continental  and coastal records of climate during the last interglacial.",
