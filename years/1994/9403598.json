The first is to understand the  structure of solutions of Riemann problems for a two-dimensional  system of conservation laws that model weak shack reflection.   The second is to elucidate the physical admissibility of  shockwave solutions of one-dimensional systems.  The reflection  of weak shack waves has been extensively studied both  experimentally and numerically, but the corresponding  two-dimensional Riemann problems for the compressible Euler  equations are intractable on a theoretical level.  This work will  consider solutions of the unsteady small disturbance equation  that arises in an asymptotic limit of the Euler system.  In the  study of one-dimensional systems of conservation laws, the  physical admissibility of shock waves is a central question.  A  recent study of stability of viscous-admissible shock waves for  quadratic conservation laws under generic two-parameter  perturbations.  These results use the theory of unfoldings of  vector fields within the framework of the fundamental wave  manifold.  In this project, work will be done to extend these  results to perturbations within the three-parameter family that  arises naturally in this context.       The study of wave phenomena and shocks is represented  mathematically by partial differential equations or systems of  such equations.  The equations reflect certain physical  (conservation) laws which govern the solutions.  The mathematical  and numerical analysis of these solutions is the basis for  studies supported by this grant.  ***",
