 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pool    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Christopher Pool  will conduct one season of fieldwork at the archaeological site  of Tres Zapotes located in Veracruz, Mexico. Although only  limited work has been done at this very important Olmec site,  evidence indicates that it was occupied for perhaps 1,500 years  and thus it documents much of Olmec prehistory. It contains at  least 25 carved stone monuments, one of which bears the second  earliest date in mesoamerica and thus sheds light on the rise of  this calendric system. Still, little is known about the site. No  topographic map has been published, the limits of the site remain  undefined and the distribution of residential occupation and  craft production loci across the site are unknown. The  relationship of the site to other settlements and to resources in  its hinterland are also poorly understood. Dr. Pool's research  will help to remedy this situation. He will conduct an extensive  survey of Tres Zapotes and produce a map of both structures and  concentrations of surface materials. Lithic, ceramic and other  cultural remains will be collected to reconstruct chronology and  to provide evidence of activities conducted.     The Olmec constitute the first complex culture in Mesoamerica  which, either directly or indirectly, gave rise to later groups  such as the Maya. Much of the basic structure of prehistoric  Mesoamerican cultures derives from this source and thus an  understanding of the development of Olmec civilization is  extremely important. Surprisingly little however is known about  the Olmec and Tres Zapotes, because of its long chronological  span and its wealth of material remains, may prove a crucial  source of data. Dr. Pool envisions this first season of field  research as the base on which a long term project will,  hopefully, be built. The data he will produce will be of  importance to a large number of archaeologists. Because he will  involve many undergraduates in the project, it will also serve to  educate st udents in science and encourage them to pursue  scientific careers.",
