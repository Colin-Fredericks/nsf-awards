Specific examples include;  telescopes, night vision lenses, high power laser optics, laser  diodes, heat spreading devices for multichip modules and coatings  for improved wear, enhanced lubricity and corrosion protection in  moving systems.  One major disadvantage of diamond films grown  using CVD methods is that they are polycrystalline and thus usually  tend to have a rough surface morphology.  This variation in surface  roughness causes scattering of light, thereby reducing the  usefulness of optics in many applications.  Polishing is one  approach by which this scattering can be reduced.  Conventional  approaches to polishing are only marginally efficient because of  the high hardness associated with diamond.  In the Phase-I effort,  Materials Modification Inc. (MMI), successfully demonstrated the  feasibility of using a non-contact polishing method for the  polishing of CVD-diamond films.  Preliminary results demonstrated  that surface roughness can be reduced from 5-10 um to a few  nanometers within a few hundred seconds.  In Phase II, MMI intends  to comprehensively study the laser polishing method by optimizing  the process parameters for large area polishing.  This experience  in processing will then be used by MMI for demonstrating the  fabrication of polished CVD diamond films for high quality diamond  windows.  ***",
