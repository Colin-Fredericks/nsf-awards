The proposed research focuses  on generating stimulus materials and pilot data that will permit  the PI to test three hypotheses in a subsequent grant  application: 1) the 'complexity-extremity' hypothesis that  outgroup members will be evaluated more extremely because  perceivers have lower cognitive complexity regarding out-groups  than in-groups; 2) the 'black sheep' hypothesis that extreme  members of ingroups (both good and bad) are evaluated more  extremely than equivalently good or bad outgroup members; 3) the  'expectancy violation' hypothesis that ingroup and outgroup  members will be evaluated more extremely to the extent that their  behavior violates perceivers' expectancies.        The research is important because it promises to provide new  insights into the question of why people evaluate the same  behavior differently when it is performed by a member of their  ingroup than when it is performed by a member of another group.   This phenomenon has implications for discriminatory treatment in  academic settings, work settings, the courtroom.  By increasing  our understanding of the nature of these prejudicial effects and  the psychological processes underlying them, the present research  will place us in a better position to reduce them.   ***",
