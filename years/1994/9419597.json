 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419597  Daniels  Graduate programs specializing in Microbial Biology have declined  in recent years, greatly reducing the opportunities for advanced  training in this important research area.  As one way to rebuild  interest in Microbial Physiology and begin to train new scientists,  we propose a three week summer course focused on the theme  \"Mechanisms of Microbial Adaptation\".  The course will contain both  lecture and laboratory components targeted to senior level graduate  students and industrial scientists not working primarily in  microbial physiology research areas.  Current topics on the  mechanisms of microbial adaptation will be surveyed in lectures by  the teaching staff together with presentations by experts in the  field.  Lectures will address: adaptive response of microorganisms  in fermentations, global response mechanisms, regulation of  microbial autotrophism, carbon metabolism in methanogens, and  biodegradation and bioconversion by microorganisms.  The  accompanying laboratory exercises will illustrate current practical  problems in the topic areas and expose students to modern  experimental techniques and conceptual approaches.  Experiments  will provide the students with skill in fermentation technology,  characterization and quantitation of proteins and metabolic  intermediates, enzyme activity measurements and basic kinetic  analyses, genetic approaches for the identification of regulated  genes, and the anaerobic techniques needed to purify oxygen-  sensitive proteins.  Laboratory sessions will prepare the students  to challenge and expand their current research and to undertake new  approaches in their experimental systems.  The inherent goal of the  course is to establish a significant interactive community of  research scientists in the field of Microbial Physiology.   Introducing students to leading scientists in an informal but  intense science setting should stimulate a sense of excitement and  community, and set the foundation for a network of younger and  exper ienced researchers.  %%%   Programs in Microbial Biology have declined in our universitites.   As a result, the ability of our research scientists is becoming  reduced to respond to environmental pollution problems with  biologically based methods, or to explore the microbial biosphere  for new products for control of insect pests and disease, or to  discover and develop novel biodegradable biomaterials.  A course in  Microbial Physiology will begin to train scientists and rebuild  interest in this area.  The three week lecture/laboratory course  will be open to university and industry applicants.  Topics on the  mechanisms of microbial adaptation will be discussed by experts in  the field.  Laboratory excercises will illustrate these topic areas  with hands-on experiments.  The goal of the course is to regain a  significant interactive community of research scientists in the  fild of Microbial Physiology.  ***",
