 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jaili Gao is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to perform computer simulations of chemical reactions   in solution.  A combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical   methodology  is being developed  which combines ab initio Hartree-Fock   and  molecular orbital techniques with statistical mechanical Monte Carlo   simulations to study chemical reactions in solution for very simple   chemical species.  Analogous calculations on more complex chemical   species will employ semiempirical Hamiltonians such as AM1 and INDO/S in   conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation techniques.  Reactions to be   studied include the decarboxylation of 3-carboxybenzisoxazoles and the   ionization of  t-butyl chloride in aqueous solution..  In addition to   studies of chemical reactions in solution, solvent effects on electronic   absorption spectra of chromophores will be examined using the same model.    Computer simulations of chemical reactions in solution provide important   molecular level insights into the factors which influence reaction rates.    In particular specific contributions which solvation and accompanying   polarization make to lowering barriers to chemical reaction can be   studied in detail.  Many of the more interesting bond breaking reactions,   however, exhibit quantum effects which cannot be modeled effectively   using empirical potentials.  Gao's approach involves the use of a   combined simulation approach which uses Monte Carlo and molecular orbital   theory to treat the quantum degrees of freedom undergoing change during   the chemical reaction.",
