 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318134  Esen  A cDNA library was constructed in a bacteriophage lambda vector,  positive clones selected, and the entire sequence of a Beta-  glucosidase allele determined.  To identify the conserved and  variable regions of the maize Beta-glucosidase gene and its protein  product, sequences of the sorghum and teosinte genes will be  determined by polymerase chain reaction based methods and compared  to that of maize.  The hydroxamic acid glucoside DIMBOA-glucoside  was purified and shown to be the major natural substrate of maize  Beta-glucosidase.  Other hydroxamic acid glucosides and natural  substrates will be identified by extracting Beta-glycosides from  maize tissues.  They will be fractionated and tested for substances  that competitively inhibit the hydrolysis of artificial substrates  (e.g., p-nitrophenol-Beta-glucopyranoside) by maize Beta-  glucosidase and yield glucose and an aglycone when incubated with  the enzyme.  The inhibitory glucosides and glycosides (i.e.,  putative substrates) will be purified by chromatography and  identified by NMR.  The hydrolysis of the identified natural  substrates will be studied by appropriate spectrophotometric and  chromatographic assays, and their kinetic constants (e.g., Km,  Vmax, Vmax/Km) will be determined.  Temporal and spatial occurrence  of DIMBOA-glucoside and other hydroxamic acid glucosides will be  studied.  The glucosides will be extracted from different organs  and plant parts sampled during ontogeny.  The extracts will be  analyzed for quantitative and qualitative changes in the  distribution of hydroxamic acid glucosides.  These changes will be  related to those of the enzyme in the same organs and parts.  In  addition, plant organs and parts will be sectioned and reacted with  the Ferric Chloride Reagent, which specifically yields a purplish  blue complex with hydroxamic acids, to determine histochemically  the organ and tissue distribution of hydroxamic acid glucosides.   Subcellular location of hydroxamic acid glucosides  will be studied  by franctionating cell components by differential contrifugation  procedures.  Determining in which tissues the enzyme occurs will be  done by infusing tissue sections with chromogenic Beta-D-glucosides  (e.g., 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl Beta-D-glucoside or 6-bromo-2-  naphthyl Beta-D-glucoside), which produce colored precipitates when  cleaved by Beta-glucosidase.  Color location can then be observed  under the light microscope.  Temporal and spatial expression of the  Glu1 gene will be studied by activity assays, immunoblotting, in  situ hybridizaiton, and Northern blotting.  ***",
