 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318279  Jansen       The phylogeny or genealogical tree for a group of organisms  provides the framework for investigating all other aspects of their  biology: direction and degree of change in morphological features,  physiological adaptations, historical biogeography, modes of  speciation, and coevolution with ecologically associated organisms.   Dr. Robert Jansen of the University of Texas is studying the  phylogeny of the sunflower family of plants, the Asteraceae, and in  particular the basal lineages of Mutisioid taxa with emphasis on  acquiring new molecular data from chloroplast and nuclear DNA.   Between 80 and 120 genera, mostly from the southern hemisphere, are  to be sampled, and the molecular data will be complemented with  traditional morphological data as well as new characters from the  study of pollen and anthers.  Chloroplast DNA data, much of it from  Dr. Jansen's laboratory over the last several years, have  revolutionized the study of phylogeny in the Asteraceae, and the  addition of nuclear DNA data and their integration with  morphological characters should lead to a rigorous phylogeny for  this large and ecologically important family of flowering plants.       The Asteraceae, the largest family of dicots in the world, are  phylogenetically well studied, due in large part to efforts by Dr.  Robert Jansen to apply modern molecular methods of DNA analysis to  these plants.  Additional research will add data from nuclear genes  and also integrate these data with accumulating knowledge of  morphology, both traditional taxonomic features and new characters  from pollen and anther studies.",
