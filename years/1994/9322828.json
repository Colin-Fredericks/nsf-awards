The  objective is to be attained through the understanding of the  underlying theoretical structure of optimal solutions and using the  results to develop practical and efficient algorithms that take  advantage of this structure.  To understand the underlying  structure, different variant forms of vehicle routing problems will  be analyzed to develop and implement different algorithms.       This research has a good potential to produce some additional  insight into the vehicle routing problem.  Such insight is critical  in developing efficient algorithms for this class of problems.   Vehicle routing problem exist in both the public and private  sectors.  Improvement in the vehicle routing can produce efficiency  in fleet management, and consequently, significant savings in  travel time and operating cost.  The importance of this problem is  well demonstrated by the support the research is receiving from a  key member of the users community of the research output, namely,  school systems.",
