 "awd_abstract_narration": "Souganidis  9403412       Work supported by this grant covers a broad range of  problems arising in the areas of hyperbolic and parabolic  nonlinear partial differential equations.  Three primary themes  will be emphasized.  First, work will be done on the kinetic  theory of conservation laws.  The goal is to obtain new  regularity and compactness results for systems of  conservationlaws, using a kinetic type formulation/approximation  for these systems.  Second, studies will be made on first- and  second-order fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic and parabolic  equations.  The emphasis is on the analysis of discontinuous  control problems, on proving convergence, on obtaining error  estimates for numerical schemes and finally, on studying several  issues regarding the regularity and uniqueness of weak solutions.   Lastly, work will be done on generalized front propagation and  phase transitions. Much of the focus will be on studying the  regularity of moving fronts past their singularities as well as  the theory of phase transitions.  The latter includes singular  limits of reaction-diffusion equations and systems, macroscopic  (hydrodynamic) limits of particle systems and large scale front  dynamics for turbulent combustion.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
