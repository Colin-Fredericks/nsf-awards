 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403804   Friedman        Prediction is one of the most widely applied statistical  procedures. The purpose is to predict (estimate) the value(s) of  one or more attributes {y(1),...,y(q)} (\"response\" variables)  associated with an object (observation), given the simultaneous  values of another set of attributes {x(1),...,x(n)} (\"predictor\"  variables) associated with the same object. The prediction rule  is derived from a set of \"training\" observations for which the  values of all attributes (predictor and response) have been  measured. When the response variables assume real (orderable)  values the prediction problem is referred to as \"regression\".  When a (single) response takes on K unorderable categorical  values the problem is called \"classification\". In this case the  response values can be viewed as a label that assigns the  observation to one of K groups or classes, each class associated  with one of the label values. The research under this proposal  addresses an important subclass of prediction problems in which  the predictor variables {x(t)} are labeled by an index t that  takes on real values in a d - dimensional Eucludean space, and it  is not unnatural to associate a distance between such variables  with the distance between their corresponding index values. In  these applications all of the predictor variables are generally  measurements of the same quanity for different values of the  index t. When t is one - dimensional, {x(t)} for varying values  of t is call a \"signal\" or \"spectrum\". Similarly, a  two-dimensional index gives rise to a \"pattern\", whereas  dimensionalities of three or higher give rise to more general  \"spatial patterns\". The goal of this research is to derive  methods that exploit the spatial nature of the predictor variable  index in more general (and more powerful) ways than have been  done (with linear methods) in the past. These new methods will be  based on adaptive (regression) splines, which have been among the  most promising extensions of linear smoot hing to nonlinear  flexible modeling, especially in higher dimensions. If  successful, the result will be a more general class of spatial  prediction procedures that will achieve higher accuracy in many  situations than present day linear methods.         The purpose of the research proposed under this grant is to  develop new, more powerful, methods for computer automated  pattern recognition. Patterns such as signals, spectra, or images  are received, and the purpose is to predict the identity of the  particular (unknown) system that produced the pattern, or some  property of that system. Examples are disease diagnosis form EKG  or EEG measurements, recognition of specific words (or speakers)  from digitized electronic patterns of spoken speech, recognition  of printed or handwritten characters from their digitized images,  or identification of objects on the ground from satellite  images.   The methods to be developed are based on learning  through experience from past successfully solved cases. The  method is presented with a series of patterns, along with the  corresponding correct answer for each one, obtained from past  experience. Using this data, the method attempts to automatically  learn rules for predicting future patterns for which the correct  answer is unknown. This research focuses on developing pattern  recognition learning methods that have greater flexibility and  adaptibility than those presently in use. If successful, this  research should produce new procedures that provide higher  prediction accuracy for many applications than has been  achieveable in the past.",
