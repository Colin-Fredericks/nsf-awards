It is hypothesized that the quality  and cost-effectiveness of medical care can be improved  significantly through the use of quality improvement teams  comprised of physicians and non-physicians, armed with (1) a  limited amount of training in continuous quality improvement  (CQI) and clinical policy analytic concepts and methods, (2)  the support of a physician and/or non-physician with  additional training and dedicated time to devote to team-  related work, and (3) access to a specific set of  microcomputer-based decision-support tools.  The final  product of the project would be a decision-design technology  that could be used by quality improvement teams in clinical  process improvement projects.  ***",
