 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317981  Feigelson  This proposal is for the development of a multi-station,  computer controlled apparatus for the growth of high  quality, single crystals of biological macromolecules  (proteins) suitable for use in structure determinations by x-  ray diffraction.  The difficulties in growing suitable  crystals  1  has been one of the major factors limiting the  number of protein structures which have been completely  determined  2 .  The determination of the molecular  structure of proteins has become an important segment of  modern biology and pharmacology and its potential has been  barely tapped  2 .  The development of the proposed  apparatus is directed toward the growth of crystals with a  high degree of internal perfection which will facilitate the  process of structure determination.    In order to growth the highest quality crystals, it is  necessary to separately control the nucleation and growth  phases during crystallization.  Previous work in our  laboratory has demonstrated that the nucleation of crystals  in protein solutions can be controlled by controlling the  temperature in a small region of the solution.  The  subsequent growth was controlled by changing the ambient  temperature around the growth cell.  This technique,  Thermonucleation. has been used to nucleate and grow  crystals of both inorganic and protein materials  3,4 .  Thermonucleation relies on the independent control of the  temperatures in both the nucleating region and the bulk of  the solution.  Its use is limited to those proteins which  have some temperature dependence of solubility within the  temperature range of approximately 0 to 35 C and thus is  applicable to a large number of proteins.    The intent of the proposed program is to develop a user  friendly, computer controlled, multi-station apparatus to  grow protein crystals using the principle of  Thermonucleation.  The growth module will be downsized from  the research instrument previously developed and will use  thermoclectric heating and cooling . The new design will  emphasize ease of crystal harvesting and changing of protein  solutions. The actual growth cell will be of a size  consistent with the small solution volumes used in protein  crystallization. Temperature sensing will be built into each  growth module. The module will also incorporate a nucleation  detection system which will allow switching from a computer  controlled nucleation program to the appropriate growth  program. Nucleation detection will be based on static light  scattering techniques  5 .    The development of the apparatus will begin with the design,  construction and testing of the growth module.  Concurrent  with this, the nucleation detector will be developed.  These  two units will be integrated into a single module.  At this  point, interfacing with the computer and computer program  development will begin.  When the single module has been  thoroughly tested under computer control using a number of  crystallizing systems multiple unit apparatus will be  constructed and tested.  Results at each stage of the  apparatus development will be used to optimize the final  apparatus.  The goal of the proposed program will be to  develop this technology into a user friendly, semi-automated  apparatus which will allow biochemical worker to  reproducibly grow high quality single crystals of proteins  for x-ray structure determinations with a minimum of  operator interaction.",
