 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401540  Smith       During the past few years the theory of operator algebras,  both selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint has evolved at a rapid pace.  Recent developments by many researchers are providing further  ties between the selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint aspects of the  theory. The proposed work focuses on the theory of tensor  products of operator algebras, complete boundedness for operator  algebras, cohomology theory, and its connection with algebraic  topology. Schur multiplier theory, the structure of derivations  and automorphisms of non-selfadjoint and selfadjoint algebras and  compact ideal perturbations in semifinite algebras will also be  studied.       Operator theory is concerned with infinite generalizations  of finite matrices. When operator multiplication and addition are  defined on a collection of operators the resulting collection is  called an operator algebra. Cohomology is a theory that examines  when local pieces can be put together to form a global object.  This project is concerned with cohomology on operator algebras.  The goal is to contribute to an old conjecture which asserts that  certain cohomologies of operator algebras are trivial. This would  mean that local objects can always be pieced together into a  global object.  ***",
