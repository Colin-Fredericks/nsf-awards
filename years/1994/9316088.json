The proposed work is in the areas of matching extension and  cyclability in graphs. Both concepts admit immediate translation  to problems involving communications networks.    Dr. Plummer will spend one month with Dr. Caccetta on joint  research on matching extension. Matching in a graph is a set of  independent edges with no two of these edges sharing a common  vertex. The concept is finding increased utilization in   mathematical applications.    The proposer will then spend two months working with the  investigators in New Zealand. This group has developed valuable  expertise on cyclic connectivity and symmetry of graphs. This   collaborative activity draws together the work in both Australia  and New Zealand with that of the American investigator.",
