 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312139  Weeks  This research planning grant will allow the investigator to  refine the theory and methods with which to examine the effect  political and economic inequalities in the world system have on  the construction of a shared understanding of environmental  problems.  The study itself will use ethnographic interviews,  analysis of written materials, and basic organizational analysis  to make two sets of comparisons:  between World Wildlife Fund  India and World Wildlife Fund U.S.; and World Wildlife Fund India  and Bhopal Gas Affected Working Women's Union.  The first pairing  allows comparison of the nature of transnationally shared  analytical and normative socio-scientific systems; the second,  study of the nature of national affiliation on construction of  environmentalism to determine whether there are analytic  categories unique to Indian environmentalism.  The goals of this  fifteen month planning grant are:  1) develop the interview  schedule; 2) refine the theoretical framework; 3) refine methods  to analyze textual and interview materials; and 4) to write a  full research proposal.  Planning activities included in this  request are:  the collection of background materials on  organizations to be studied; travel to India to work with the  Indian collaborator to plan field work in India; identifying  potential interviewees; consulation with a political scientist  and a linguist to refine the theoretical framework and  methodology.  The reserach should provide new insights on the  conditions under which a cross-culturally shared understanding of  environmentalism arises, and alternately, the conditions under  which it is thwarted.  ***",
