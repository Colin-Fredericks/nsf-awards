 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317328  Fletcher         An acceptable relative sea-level (RSL) history for the post-   glacial period in Hawaii has not yet been proposed.  Late Holocene   RSL is characterized by gradually decreasing hydroisostatic uplift.    New field evidence showing emergence documents the hydroisostatic   deformation of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and probably Maui following   the culmination of post-glacial RSL rise.  The timing of initial   emergence, its height, and it termination all appear to have an   island-specific character reflecting the influence of island   radius, distance from the volcanic center, and various site-   specific factors.  Research will focus on obtaining additional   field data to constrain these variables and produce a model of  hydroisostatic response along the Hawaii Ridge.         Pleistocene and early Holocene RSL around Oahu and Kauai  will  be documented with cores from submerged shorelines.  Wave-cut   notches and drowned reef complexes indicate former sea-level   positions at predictable depths encircling both islands.  A small,   hand-held pneumatic drill can sample early deposited carbonate   dating former RSL.  Petrographic and XRD analysis of samples will   help define geologic history.  Species-specific oxygen isotope   contents will be determined from well preserved, dated coral   samples.  Variations in the oceanic oxygen isotope chemistry during   the post-glacial transgression will be documented.  The research   will produce a detailed RSL history for Kauai and Oahu tied to   changes in the stable isotope record of meltwater history.",
