 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies examining the molecular mechanisms of plant-plant  interactions have been impeded compared to those in plant-  microbe interactions in large part because simple laboratory  based model systems are lacking.  The interaction of  parasitic Scrophulariaceae with their host plants offers one  of the best opportunities for integrating modern  biochemical, physiological, and genetic methodologies to  understand how plants communicate in the environment.  The  overall objectives of this research are to learn how plant  parasitism originates and evolves, to understand how  chemical signals initiate the development of parasitic  organs and mediate their functions, and to discern how  parasitic plants recognize and distinguish hosts, non-hosts,  and self.  These studies are focused on the defining organ  of plant parasitism, namely the haustorium.  This  specialized multi-functional structure recognizes the  distance and direction to the host, penetrates host vascular  tissue through a combination of enzymatic and invasive  growth, and forms a conductive bridge through which the  parasite robs nutrients from the host.  While well  characterized at the morphological level, almost nothing is  known about the genetic mechanisms controlling haustorium  initiation, development, or function.  The experiments in  this proposal make use of parasitic members of the  Scrophulariaceae family as model organisms to study  haustorium development because:  all stages in the evolution  of plant parasitism, ranging from complete autotrophs to  obligate non-photosynthetic heterotrophs, are represented by  contemporary species; the biochemistry of haustorium  induction and histology of haustorium ontogeny are most  advanced for this family; facultative parasitic  Scrophulariaceae are readily grown in the presence or  absence of host in both soil and axenic culture; haustoria  of these species can be synchronously induced by in vitro  treatment of seedlings with purified, host encoded  compounds; one of the best devel oped model systems for  studying plant development (Antirrhinum) is a member of this  family; and parasitic species of this family are among the  world's most devastating weed pests.  These experiments take  two complementary approaches to examine haustorium  development in parasitic Scrophulariaceae.  (1) Haustorium  specific genes are being isolated and analyzed to obtain  clues about their origin, their function in parasitic  plants, and their role in non-parasitic relatives.  Expression studies will indicate their specificity for  heterotrophic plants and in situ hybridizations will  determine their specificity for haustoria.  (2) A model  system for defining the genetic determinants of haustorium  development is being developed.  In particular, different  hemiparasitic Scrophulariaceae are being evaluated for their  amenability to genetic analyses including ease of growth in  the presence and absence of host, amenability of both  parasite and host to genetic analysis, and the fidelity of  haustorium induction in vitro.  Genetic colinearity  relationships between selected parasitic Scrophulariaceae  and Antirrhinum will be examined as a shortcut to developing  the genetics of the parasitic member.  Finally, the genomes  of parasitic species will be examined for containing  endogenous Tam-like transposable elements that can be later  incorporated into mutagenesis experiments.",
