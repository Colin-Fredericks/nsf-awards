It has forged a strong partnership between the public  schools and the City University of New York (CUNY).  The  initiative has two major thrusts: (1) the establishment of 250  Mathematics, Science, and Technology (MST) leadership schools  (Cluster Schools) over the next five years, and the expansion of  the Initiative to 250 additional schools through a paired school  strategy; (2) the undertaking of exemplary MST reforms at the  initial 250 school sites through the cooperative efforts of the  Board of Education, CUNY, business and industry, and other  stakeholders.  In addition to working with a specific set of  cluster schools and paired schools, certain essential certain  citywide elements will reach all schools.  These elements include  implementation of a citywide MST curriculum framework;  development of a technology network that links the Board of  Education, CUNY, the public schools and major NYUSI partnership  members; and models of exemplary mathematics and science  education projects.  The New York USI places strong emphasis on  grass roots MST systemic change through the cluster schools,  coupled with effective core leadership and high standards for all  participating schools.  The commitment to site-based ownership  reflects the perspective of New York State's New Compact for  Learning and the New York Statewide Systemic Initiative.",
