 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452475  Poston  This proposal is to enhance the laboratory experience for  undergraduate students in Biology and Biochemistry, utilizing the  BioQUEST Library of computer simulation/modeling and tools  including text and hypertext modules. BioQUEST modules are  structured within a framework that focuses science education on  collaborative, open-ended inquiry. The problem-posing,  problem-solving, and peer persuasion approach will permit students  in the undergraduate Evolution, Ecology and Biochemistry courses to  investigate problems, construct experiments and test potential  solutions using simulation models. These courses are currently  taught without a laboratory experience or, in the case of Ecology,  a limited field/laboratory component. Neither the Biology or  Biochemistry department has the computer equipment to integrate the  BioQUEST Library into the instructional process. Howard University  is the leading minority institution in this country and a high  percentage of its students are female. Given the projected needs  for much higher minority and female workers in scientific and  technical fields, support of this project could have a significant  impact in helping to supply the needs of the job market in coming  decades, while assisting minority and women students in attaining  their careers goals.",
