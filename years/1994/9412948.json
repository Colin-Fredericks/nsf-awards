 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Warren will use ultrafast laser pulse-shaping   techniques to produce molecules in selected quantum states.  A new pulse   shaping approach will produce easily adjustable waveforms with   femtosecond structural features.  A very rapid method of pulse shape   detection will also be developed.  These techniques will be applied to   molecular systems to try to alter relaxation rates, selectively excite   molecules in the presence of competing absorbers, or force molecules up   anharmonic ladders.  Experimentally measured molecular responses will be   used to make the target molecule itself optimize the design of the   manipulation pulse.  %%%  In these experiments Warren will be studying how to excite molecules   which are about to react so that the reactions will go along one desired   pathway rather than along one or  several undesired pathways.  This type   of ability to control the outcome of chemical reactions will have an   effect on many chemical manufacturing processes, making some possible   which previously were not, or making others more efficient and   cost-effective.",
