 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in a microbiology course required for non-majors from a  relatively large group of diverse curricula uses computer presented  case studies to understand the basic biology of microorganisms as  well as the applied aspects of microbiology used in his or her  career. The computer program presents a case study with digitized  images to provide realism. To solve a case, the student must  develop a hypothesis and test that hypothesis by interactively  seeking pertinent data from the computer. The data are obtained  when clinical tests are requested from a list of laboratory  procedures available. Students are penalized for asking for  irrelevant data because there is a \"mock\" charge for each test. The  student's final evaluation is based on a written report that gives  the reasoned arguments that led to the solution and the final  \"cost\" of solving the case.",
