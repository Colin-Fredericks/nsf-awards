 "awd_abstract_narration": "Root apices have been studied through the analysis of cell  lineage based on histological sections.  Theories of apical  organization derived from such analyses led to the view that  there existed \"ultimate initials\" at the focus of the cell  lineage, just proximal to the root cap.  As a result of  continuous mitotic activity, it was believed, the ultimate  initials produced derivative cells that formed the root.  The discovery in 1956 that these cells rarely divided in a  growing root initiated a reassessment of root development.  Collectively, these inactive \"ultimate initials\" comprise a  region called the quiescent center (QC).  Since its  discovery, plant biologists have tried to understand what  the QC cells do, why they are quiescent, and how and when  quiescence arises.  The work outlined in this proposal  addresses these questions.  The objectives of this proposal  are to use molecular, genetic, and physiological approaches  to link the known biochemistry of the root to the biophysics  which determines the cellular architecture of the root.  Specific attention will be directed to measuring the levels,  distributions and interactions between auxin, ascorbic acid  and ascorbic acid oxidase with the objective of relating  changes in these substances to properties of the quiescent  center.  Using various experimental approaches, levels of  these substances will be manipulated and the status of the  quiescent center and apical anatomy investigated.  The  significance of this effort lies in the advancement of a new  hypothesis to account for and understand the establishment  and developmental role of the quiescent center and  ultimately patterning in roots.",
