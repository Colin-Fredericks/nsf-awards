 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hakansson      Computer technology can increase student interest in science topics by allowing students   to become more involved in the analytic process of problem solving and, at the same time,   freeing  them from getting mired in highly technical procedures and repetitive   mathematical computations.  Yet despite the advantages of new technologies, including   interactive software,  teachers have found it difficult to integrate existing products into   their teaching plans.  Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)   study establish the technical basis for the creation of a new software tool  Science Analysis   Multimedia ( SAM) to facilitate turning the promise of computer technology in K-12   science instruction into reality.  SAM will consist of a shell (video playback and analysis   capabilities as well as features for data gathering, computation, and presentation) and    learning modules (video and text data organized in subtopics and groups according to   major scientific themes);  it is unique in that it is designed to function both as a content-  neutral tool and as a modular science program.  The objectives of the Phase II research   focus on  (1) developing and testing the prototype of the SAM software tool; (2)   developing and testing prototype classroom materials; (3) developing and testing model   teacher workshops; (4) assessing attitudes and achievement among various students who   use SAM; and (5) developing means of making SAM available to the broadest spectrum of   students.    The project will contribute to the creation of a software tool employing state-of-the-art   digital video technology and advanced programming techniques and combining many of   the most useful computer applications to assist teachers in the delivery of the new science   curriculum.",
