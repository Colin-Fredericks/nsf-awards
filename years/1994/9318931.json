The ability to perform  materials modifications such as deep implantations into III-  V semiconductors, and to remove residual crystal damage  without disturbing the electronic modification and  compositional mixing that were the intent of the ion  bombardment depends in an essential way on knowledge of the  processes that created the damage and the resulting  character of the irradiated material. The proposed research  focuses on these basic issues.  Our approach is to produce  ion damage in crystalline samples of electronic materials  (insulators, compound semiconductors, highTc  superconductors, and a few special metals) and to study the  damage distributions by a variety of techniques; for  example, the use of channeling RBS to deduce the track radii  and damage distributions.  We have developed a model of the  track-damage process that shows considerable promise; some  of the initial observations will test this model's validity.  %%%  The properties of electronic materials can be modified in  controlled ways by bombarding them with high energy(MeV)  ions. In some cases this irradiation is used to implant  foreign atoms deep in the material to tailor its local  electronic properties. In other cases the damage itself may  cause beneficial changes, for example, improving the current-  carrying capacity of superconductors. This research project  expects to increase our basic understanding of the damage  produced by such bombardments so that we can design, and  more efficiently realize desired modifications of electronic  materials for gaining improvements in the general  performance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used  in computing, information processing, and tele  communications.  ***",
