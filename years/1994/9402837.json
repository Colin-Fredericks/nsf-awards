 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402837  Katz  This award supports a special year in algebraic geometry at  Oklahoma State, focusing on mirror symmetry, Donaldson theory for  algebraic surfaces, and related areas.  These are areas of  algebraic geometry for which connections with different areas of  mathematics and physics are apparent and emerging.  There will be  2-4 visitors in residence for the academic year in addition to  the three permanent algebraic geometers on the faculty.  In  addition, there will be atleast 55 short term visitors; many of  these will be participants in two 3 day workshops.  The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries.  Orginally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from  algebra, but also from analysis and topology.  Moreover, it has  proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical  computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
