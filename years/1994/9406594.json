The processes through which the old institutions geared toward  centralized state control of resources into decentralized forms  of private ownership have varied in different industries and in  different regions.  This doctoral dissertation research project  will consist of a small-scale comparative study of changing  institutional structure through examination of four different  petroleum-extraction and -transportation operations in Siberia.  The initial phases of the project will include archival research  into international funding organization policies and programs.  Interviews will be conducted with officials at agencies like the  International Monetary Fund and World Bank, with project-  development officers and other officials at multinational oil  companies, and with lawyers experienced in joint ventures  involving Russia.  The doctoral student also will attend an  international seminar on petroleum and mineral law and policy.  The final phases of the project will consist of on-site visits to  the Siberian oil operation, where interviews will be conducted  with industry and local government leaders and workers, and data  will be obtained from published accounts and field observations.       This project will provide valuable new insights into  relationships among institutional and technological changes in an  important extractive industry.  In addition to generating  empirical information about four private oil operations in  Siberia, this research will enhance understandings of the impacts  of local, regional, and national policies and the intervention of  foreign multinational corporations on the development of an  important extractive activity.  As a doctoral dissertation  research improvement award, this award also will provide support  to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent  research career.",
