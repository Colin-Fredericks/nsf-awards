 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320188,  PI-Wise:  It has become increasingly obvious to science policy makers that the only way this country can maintain its leadership in science is to advance scientific talent regardless of race, gender or physical handicaps.  Too many women and minorities have been discouraged from studying science because they have found it inhospitable to their presence.  Yet, such was not always the case.  Nuclear physics and radiochemistry in the first  part of this century offer an example of how scientists can work together to promote the participation of women and minorities in the study of the most difficult of scientific areas.  Under the direction of Professor Norton Wise, Ms. Teresa Hopper is investigating the reasons for the extraordinary levels of success achieved by a relatively large number of women in the fields of nuclear physics and radiochemistry in the early decades of the twentieth century.  A number of prominent women scientists made outstanding theoretical contributions to the fields of nuclear physics and radiochemistry between 1900 and 1939; and there also existed a large number of women who received advanced degrees and performed advanced research, but whose theoretical contributions were less dramatic than those of their more prominent counterparts.  Ms. Hopper argues that the outstanding success of women in these fields is no accident or coincidence, but rather, that women's extraordinary participation in these fields in this period was brought about by the active efforts of established men and women scientists who were committed to including women in the practice of science in the early years of this century.  As a result of the cooperation of Marie Curie, Ernest Rutherford and others, a space was created in which women could succeed in scientific practice.  Ms. Hopper is analyzing women's success in these fields in terms of the existence of a social n etwork of established scientists who supported their researches; an intellectual niche that was created in domains of nuclear physics and radiochemistry; and a laboratory culture that provided an atmosphere in which they could flourish. She is investigating prominent scientists for the important theoretical contributions they made to their fields.  Less prominent scientists are also relevant because of their role in shaping the laboratory cultures into places where women could succeed in scientific practice.",
