This office will  provide daily management of the GLOBEC program including  program coordination, meeting coordination and development,  and communication of GLOBEC. INTernational  activities.       During the period of this proposal GLOBEC.  INTernational will be undertaking a series of crucial  steps  toward fulfilling its mission:     To understand the effects  of physical processes on predator-prey interactions and  population dynamics of zooplankton, and their relation to  ocean ecosystems and application to fisheries in the context  of  the global climate system and anthropogenic change.  GLOBEC.  INT will be preparing its Science Plan and  presenting it to the larger scientific community in July  1994 for approval.  With the completed and adopted Science  Plan, GLOBEC will petition IGBP for inclusion in Fall 1994.  GLOBEC will then be preparing its Implementation Plan for  full-scale program implementation.  The GLOBEC.  INTernational Secretariat will be responsible for the  successful execution of each of these steps.",
