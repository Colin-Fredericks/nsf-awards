 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454615  Bishara  The Virginia State Grant Consortium (VSGC), in collaboration with  the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), 23 community  colleges, 3 Space Grant universities, the State Department of  Education, and a broad spectrum of business and industry interests,  is planning for the development of an Advanced Technological  Education Center (TechQuest) for the Commonwealth of Virginia to  address the needs of advanced technological education.  Through the  TechQuest Planning Initiative, the Virginia Space Grant Consortium  and its partners is evaluating existing curricula at the community  colleges, planning appropriate revision and augmentation of  curricula, and developing professional enhancement activities for  community college faculty, secondary teachers and guidance  counselors to support this curricular reform for advanced  technological education. Commitment to the TechQuest initiative of  the VSGC, VCCS administration, higher education, industry, and  other partners is very strong. The planning phase for the TechQuest  Center is being led by project director (Michael N. Bishara,  D.Sc. Southwest Community College), project manager (Mary Sandy,  Director, VSGC), a steering committee, a team of technical,  academic and resource advisors, and planning teams for four  advanced technology strands.  These content strands include: core-  courses, high performance manufacturing, electronics and  environmental technology.  The goal of the planning phase is to  develop an action plan for the implementation of the TechQuest  Center through which extensive curriculum reform will be instituted  in Virginia's community colleges along with the proposing  professional development strategies to support the renovated  curriculum for advanced technological education.",
