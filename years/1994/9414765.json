 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414765  Box       The emphasis in this research is the development of a  technique that employs feedback control to collect data on process  disturbances or errors which are caused by unassignable causes and  cannot be removed by statistical process control (SPC) method.  The  technique is tailored for application by the work force to make  process adjustments to combat the effect of disturbances.  Feedback  charts that take into account the cost of being off target, cost of  adjustment, and cost of taking observations will be developed.  A  wide range of models will be investigated, their sensitivity to  model assumption analyzed, and their practical utility tested.  The  feasibility and advantages of employing more elaborate control  schemes will also be considered in the study.       The feedback process control method developed will make it  possible to put into the hands of a much larger workforce and the  statistical process community a scientific procedure that can  significantly affect manufacturing quality and productivity.",
