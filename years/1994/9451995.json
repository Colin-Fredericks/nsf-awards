 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451995  Doty  An undergraduate Intelligent Machines Laboratory (IML)  course  includes one hour lecture, two hours of tutorial and three hours of  laboratory per week. The lectures include topics on machine  intelligence related to the laboratory work. The tutorial sessions  provide guided instruction in computer-aided engineering software,  electronic circuit design, fabrication and assembly, trouble-  shooting techniques and documentation development. The IML project  addresses the need for practical electrical engineering training at  a broader level than normally possible in a single undergraduate  course. Students are required to define, analyze, synthesize and  construct solutions to a variety of interacting requirements and  integrate them into a functioning system--a simple, microcomputer  controlled, autonomous robot with electronic sensors; a robot that  can exhibit \"interesting\", intentional behavior. Effectively, the  IML serves as a capstone laboratory that provides undergraduates  realistic engineering experience in design, simulation,  fabrication, assembly, integration, testing, and operations of a  relatively complex system that requires the integration of various  subdisciplines in electrical engineering.  The Intelligent Machines  Laboratory (IML) enables Seniors or second semester Juniors to  integrate most of their undergraduate EE knowledge base into a  practical computer engineering experience. Miniature, autonomous  mobile robots have been chosen as the vehicle for conveying that  experience. It is expected the student response to the broad  spectrum demands placed on them in the IML will partially  back-drive the entire EE curriculum in a meaningful and substantive  manner.",
