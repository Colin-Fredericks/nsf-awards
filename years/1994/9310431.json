It is concerned with plans and approaches in the  preparation, crystallization and structure characterization of  novel solid-state ternary and quaternary metal telluride compounds  employing hydrothermal synthesis.  Initial studies will focus on  the preparation of precursors, largely the binary alkali-metal  polytellurides that are to be used both as reactants and  mineralizers.  In subsequent hydrothermal reactions, additional  metals or metal complexes will be selected for reaction with the  precursors, leading to the desired ternary or quaternary phases.   Recent work on the solid-state ternary transition metal tellurides  has revealed a number of unusual structural features leading to  interesting magnetic and electric behaviors exhibited by these  compounds.  Most of them adopt unique low dimensional (chain or  layer) structures.  Many contain extended metal networks with  strong metal-metal bonding.  An increasing interest in the studies  of the tellurides has been exhibited in the last few years, and a  great potential exists for synthesis of novel telluride materials  with useful properties and applications.    Most known solid-state telluride compounds have been prepared at  high temperatures, and little has been explored in the lower  temperature regime.  The need to develop low temperature synthetic  techniques is apparent.  Hydrothermal synthesis has been proved to  be an important and promising method of relatively low-temperature  synthesis and crystal growth.  It has been widely used and is  finding increasing applications in solid state chemistry and  material science.  While numerous novel molecular and extended  systems, such as zeolites, quartz, transition metal phosphates,  oxides, and main group sulfides, have been synthesized or  crystallized utilizing this technique,including the recent success  in the synthesis of several early and late transition metal  polyselenides, vi rtually no work has been conducted on the solid-  state telluride compounds.  ***",
