 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321061  Eamon  The history of science is largely the history of \"great men\" who  develop the \"great theories\" or make the most exciting discoveries.   Numerous biographies have been written about Isaac Newton, Charles  Darwin and Albert Einstein. Their papers are published; theories--  indeed, even scientific revolutions--are named after them.  While  the general public certainly knows of these great men, they hardly  ever understand the theories which they presented.  Instead, they  embrace such popular theories as astrology, creationism, and the  occult.  Legislatures in the United States pass laws to support the  presentation of creationism in the schools while whole cultures  consult astrologers about appropriate times for important events.   Even the first lady of the United States consulted one in order to  determine when her husband should hold summit conferences.  What is  the relationship of science and this popular culture?  If we are to  understand the role of science and technology in our society, we  must examine how scientific theories that we in the scientific  community accept as correct relate to theories that capture the  attention of popular culture.  It is this relationship that  Professor Eamon is examining.    Specifically, Professor Eamon is examining the relationship between  scientific and popular cultures in Italy, focusing on the life,  career, and intellectual milieu of the Italian surgeon and natural  philosopher Leonardo Fioravanti.  Fioravanti appropriated ideas and  practices from both scientific and popular cultures, and developed  an empiricist natural philosophy that reflected both.  He  popularized his \"science of experience in a series of eight widely  read books on medicine, natural philosophy, and social criticism.   By showing how Fioravanti understood (and sometimes misunderstood)  academic science and medicine, and how he integrated it with his  experiences, Professor Eamon hopes to explore the dynamics of  cultural appropriation of science and the crea tion of \"popular  science\" that mirrors in a very distorted sense the theories of the  leading scientists of his day.  ***",
