 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314422  Gold    This three-year award, which supports  U.S.-France-German  cooperative research in inorganic chemistry,  involves four  laboratories in the U.S. and Europe. The principal  investigators  are:  Avram Gold of the University of North  Carolina; James  Terner of Virginia Commonwealth University;  Raymond Weiss of the  Universite Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg,  France; and A. X.  Trautwein, Director of the Institute of  Physics, University of  Lubeck in Germany.  The objective of  their research is to study  the effects of peripheral  substituents on the molecular and  electronic structure of  synthetic, high valent iron porphyrin.   The laboratories will  contribute complementary techniques towards  characterizing the  starting complexes and the high-valent  species.  The U.S.  investigators are experts in the synthesis,  generation, and  characterizations of these compounds using NMR  and resonance  Raman spectroscopy.  This is complemented by French  expertise in  synthesis and German expertise in x-ray  crystallography and  electrochemical studies.    The project will advance  understanding of high valent iron  porphyrin, which is an  important intermediary in the catalysis of enzymatic systems.   ***",
