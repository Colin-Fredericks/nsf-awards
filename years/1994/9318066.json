 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318066  Lochmiller    Wild animal populations are known to fluctuate in size from  season to season and year to year. Scientists have offered  many explanations for such fluctuations, and most,  ultimately have attributed these fluctuations to individuals  in populations responding to environmental factors via  altered mortality and reproduction. Evidence suggests that  survival of newborns may be the single most important  mechanism influencing overall reproductive success and size  of plant-eating animal populations. Unfortunately,  difficulties associated with mortality in the wild makes  this one of the most poorly understood aspects of  animal  ecology. Studies in the PI's laboratory on the development  of immunity in wild cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) will  provide a physiological approach to the problem;  specifically, concentrating on immunological mechanisms by  which the environment influences survival. Initial studies  have implicated involvement of the immune system  in  determining the chances of survival in newborn plant-eating  animals as a result of protein malnutrition of their mothers  during pregnancy or during early juvenile life. This study  will examine that proposed mechanism in two plant-eating  rodents whose populations are known to fluctuate either  erratically (cotton rats) or cyclically (prairie vole,  Microtus ochrogaster) in numbers from year to year, using a  series of controlled laboratory feeding trials and  monitoring individuals from low and high density populations  in the wild. The ability of the immune system to develop and  provide protection against disease agents in newborn animals  when their mothers are confronted with diets deficient in  protein during pregnancy and lactation will be examined, as  well if size of populations influences immunity in the wild.  ***",
