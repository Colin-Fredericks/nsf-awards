 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414112  Wang    Economic analysis of markets relies on the examination of two key  variables, price and quantity.  In the study of financial  markets, however, the focus has been mainly on the behavior of  security prices while little attention has been paid to  quantities like trading volume.  This is because trading volume  provides no additional information about prices in conventional  representative-agent models.  But these models perform poorly in  explaining the historic security returns.  This has led  researchers to develop models with incomplete security markets  and heterogeneous investors.  In these models, the dynamic  relation between volume and returns of individual stocks depends  on differences in information among investors (e.g. some  investors have better information about future payoffs) and other  differences among heterogeneous investors.  This project develops  an equilibrium model of stock trading and pricing in an  intertemporal multi-asset setting.  The model involves  dynamically optimizing investors who trade competitively in the  market for both informational and non-informational reasons.   Their trading drives the equilibrium prices of stocks as well as  the volume of trade.  Testable implications will be derived  concerning the time series as well as cross-sectional behavior of  the joint price-volume series of individual stocks.  The second  part involves the empirical analysis of the data on the price-  volume series of individual stocks and the direct tests of the  theoretical implications.",
