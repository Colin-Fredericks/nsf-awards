 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319653  Bittman    All Multicellular organisms possess an internal clock that insures  daily rhythmicity of multiple physiological function even in an  aperiodic environment.  In higher vertebrates, these endogenous  daily or circadian rhythms are driven by the suprachiasmatic  nucleus of the hypothalamus.  This endogenous oscillator insures  that incompatible processes occur at different times, and that  metabolic, thermoregulatory, osmoregulatory, immune and  reproductive functions and arousal are properly scheduled to meet  environmental challenges.  Dr. Bittman will elucidate the role of  this central pacemaker in the timing of ovulation.  Ovulation is  triggered by a surge of pituitary luteinizing hormone which results  from the discharge in tot he hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system  of gonadotropin releasing hormone, a decapeptide synthesized in  cells of the diagonal band, medial septum, preoptic area and  anterior hypothalamus.  This release of gonadotropin-releasing  hormone is ultimately regulated by estrogen.  Dr. Bittman will  examine the function of specific cell types within the  suprachiasmatic nucleus in the regulation of the estrous cycle by  determining whether these neurons project directly to cells  elsewhere in the brain which in turn control the pituitary gland.   Using state-of-the-art neuroanatomical techniques, Dr. Bittman will  then determine whether these neurons that receive input from this  hypothalamic nucleus contain estrogen receptor or gonadotropin  releasing hormone.  In addition, he will establish whether the  signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus at specific times of day  underly the appropriate timing of ovulation.  The results from  these studies will help delineate the circadian regulation of  neuroendocrine cells which govern integrative processes.  This  research will provide basic information critical not only to  understanding how environmental factors impinge upon the nervous  system but may provide the fundamental groundwork towards  developme nt of therapeutic approaches to fertility and may have  applications to contraception.  ***",
