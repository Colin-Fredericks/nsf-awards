Jacobson, Chemistry Department, University of Houston, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Chemical Reaction Processes Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division, under the NSF/EPRI initiative on Electrochemical Synthesis, for the study of the electrochemical synthesis of highly oxidized mixed metal oxides  via oxygen intercalation. Specific objectives are to advance the understanding of fundamental aspects of oxygen intercalation in oxides and to assess the use of intercalation chemistry for the synthesis and processing of new oxide materials. Preliminary results on an electrochemically reversible La-Ni-O phase will be extended to determine the detailed kinetics for oxygen intercalation. These investigations will then be continued on ternary copper oxides, where the physical properties will be correlated with precise electrochemical control of composition. Finally, the technique will be applied to a wide range of systems and electrolyte compositions to determine its generality.  Chemical compounds which contain several metals and oxygen have a number of uses, including  as electronic and superconducting materials, ceramics, and glasses. Often the properties of these solids depends upon their exact oxygen content, which is difficult to regulate using the methods which are presently available. In this project a new technique for introducing oxygen  into a \"mixed metal oxide\" will be developed using an electrochemical method. This will permit the formation of very oxygen rich materials under quite mild conditions. It will also allow the oxygen content to be precisely controlled in order to tailor the properties of the oxide.",
