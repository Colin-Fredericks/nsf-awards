The quenched  impurities are gel structures of dilute rigid silica networks.  The  large surface area of these networks influence the equilibrium and  non-equilibrium properties of fluids that are entrained in these  gel structures.  The behavior of binary fluids in these gels are  studied by static and dynamic light scattering, as well as  calorimetry.  The combination of thermodynamic and scattering  measurements on controlled samples should add considerable to our  understanding of the effects of porous materials on liquid systems,  as well as to the broader issue of their effects on phase in other  systems.    Non-technical abstract:  This Condensed Matter Physics employs  light scattering and thermodynamic measurements to study the  effects of quenched impurities on critical phenomena and phase  separations in fluids containing two components.  The quenched  impurities are gel structures of dilute rigid silica networks.   When fluids fill the interstitices between the gel strands, their  equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties are modified by the  large surface area of the gel network.  The behavior of binary  fluids in these gels are studied by static and dynamic light  scattering, as well as calorimetry.  The combination of  thermodynamic and scattering measurements on controlled samples  should add considerable to our understanding of the effects of  porous materials on liquid systems, as well as to the broader issue  of their effects on phase in other systems.  For example, there are  many instances in nature where fluids, such as oil, are entrained  in high surface are solids, such as shale.  This fundamental study  may provide information relevant to these technologically important  systems.  ***",
