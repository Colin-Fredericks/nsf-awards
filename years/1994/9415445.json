Building on the strength of its State/Industry University Cooperative Research Center on Life Cycle Engineering in Electronic Packaging, its state-of-the-art facilities, and the participation by industry and DoD, DoC, and DoE laboratories, the project targets graduate and undergraduate students and industrial workers, with emphasis on those employed by regional small businesses.  Furthermore, through its strong ties with national societies and other academic institutions, especially those involved in the ECSEL Engineering Education Coalition, this project will undertake innovative curriculum, courseware and textbook development in the chosen technical areas.  ***",
