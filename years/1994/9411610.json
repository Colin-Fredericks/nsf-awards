 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411610  Bartynski    A technique of Auger-photoelectron coincidence spectroscopy (APECS)  with synchrotron radiation will be employed to study the core level  line shapes and Auger electron spectra in selected metals,  semiconductors and oxides.  The enhanced sensitivity of APECS will  be used to study the core level shifts, charge transfer, and  electronic structure at the clean and adsorbate covered surfaces.   With the ability of APECS to eliminate lifetime broadening, we will  probe the line shapes of 3p (4p) core levels in several 3d (4d)  transition metals for surface shifts and hidden splittings.  Site-  specific electronic properties and correlation effects in  inhomogeneous solids will also be studied by measuring core-valence  (CVV) Auger transitions coincidence with shifted core levels.   Finally, we will use the unique capabilities of APECS to explore  the photoexcitation/decay process itself.  The majority of the  research will be performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source  of Brookhaven National Laboratory.    Our group has developed Auger-photoelectron coincidence  spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation as a new experimental  probe of solids.  This is a qualitative improvement over  conventional Auger electron or photoelectron spectroscopy.  It is  more surface sensitive, it eliminates background signal, it  sharpens spectral lines, and it provides a new and unique way to  study the local electronic properties of complicated systems.  The  technique will be utilized to obtain new information about the  electronic structure and bonding at clean and adsorbate covered  semiconductor and metal surfaces.  The site-specific nature of the  technique will be used to probe the electronic properties of  different atoms in solid compounds.  The sharper spectral lines  will allow new ways to investigate magnetic effects and electronic  interactions in solids.  Finally the unique capabilities of this  technique will provide clues to the photoexcitation/decay process  itself.  The ma jority of the research will be performed at the  National Synchrotron Light Source of Brookhaven National  Laboratory.  ***",
