Each unit is  based on a \"technological challenge\" which requires the students to  work as a design team to build and present their solutions to the  challenge.  The design challenges include development of a toy, a  vehicle and an amusement park ride at sixth, seventh and eighth  grades respectively.  The materials engage students in authentic  engineering challenges which become the context for learning  mathematics, science, technology education, social sciences and  language arts concepts and skills appropriate to middle school  students.  The students, teachers and community members form  learning teams in which students assume various engineering and  marketing roles.  The products include print materials, hands-on  kits, and videos and videodisc reference materials, complemented by  software tools.  The materials are brought to schools by engineers  from industry who interact with the students and teachers as they  engage the challenges.    ***",
