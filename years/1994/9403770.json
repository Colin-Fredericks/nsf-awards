The project will explore global patterns of  collegial ties among research scientists, and  engineers specifically the ties to and from the  world's centers.  U.S. researchers' ties to  local and foreign colleagues will be compared  with the international ties of researchers in  other countries, especially in France, Japan,  and Mexico.  U.S. researchers' attraction of  ties from scientists and engineers around the  world will be compared with the ties attracted  by researchers in Japan and Western Europe.   Ties will be examined as vary overtime, across  disciplines, and across cohorts  of scientists.   Analyses use indicators of the networks of  influence and collaboration derived from the  scientific literature and a questionnaire  survey of about 1,049 scientists in the United  States, France, Japan, Mexico and other  countries (about 60% of the interviews have  been completed in previous projects).  The  questionnaire taps a researcher's education,  career, travel, assessment of contributions  made around the world, and ties with local and  foreign colleagues.  The study will also tap  scientists' and engineers' perceptions and  experiences of barriers to formation of ties  with foreign peers.  The project will  contribute to knowledge of the international  dynamics of collegial networks in science,  especially the ties to and from the centers.   The knowledge about the U.S. participation in  North American and worldwide networks may be of  use in shaping U.S. policies international  cooperation.  ***",
