 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400119  Settles       The award is for research to improve understanding of the    dynamics of the assist gas used with laser cutting to blow away    molten material and plasma, with a view to improving performance.   The technology of supersonic microjets will be transferred to the   field of laser cutting to improve cutting speed and efficiency by   maintaining supersonic flow along the entire cutting edge of the    kerf.  Melt removal is enhanced and material redeposition in the    kerf is avoided.  Significant improvements in conventional coaxial   assist-gas delivery will also be sought by improving nozzle design.  The work is primarily experimental and involves development of  appropriate nozzles and microjets, and cutting trials using actual  commercial laser equipment.       The research is expected to impact the fundamental knowledge  base related to gas dynamics as well as the efficiency of the key  manufacturing technology of laser cutting.  Improvements in assist  gas dynamics are expected to translate directly into faster,  cleaner laser cuts.  More powerful lasers now becoming available  would also benefit from the improved assist gas dynamics expected  as a result of this research.",
