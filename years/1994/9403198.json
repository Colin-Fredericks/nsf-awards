 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Randall McGuire, Mr. Brian Thomas will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze  material from the historic period site of the Hermitage  Plantation in Tennessee.  This was the home of Andrew Jackson.  The work itself will involve analyzing artifacts and faunal  remains recovered from three slave cabins which are located at  varying distances from the main plantation house. Historic  documents indicate that status differences existed not only  between \"masters\" and \"slaves\", but also among the latter group.  Differences in job were related to both social and economic  status. Social position was reflected in residential distance as  well. Given the fairly controlled context, it will be possible to  examine different classes of artifacts - ceramics, personal  belongings, faunal and floral remains - and determine how well  power and status relations are reflected in their distribution  across the site.    This research is important for several reasons. Much  anthropological archaeology is directed at the reconstruction of  past social systems and the examination of status  differentiation. Mr. Thomas' provides a context to evaluate  analytic assumptions which anthropologists widely hold and to  test the efficacy of specific techniques which are used in social  reconstruction. It will also assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.",
