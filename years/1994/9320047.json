 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chapman  9320047  Phospholipids are an integral component of all biological  membranes.  The phospholipid composition of intracellular membranes  is highly variable.  Differences in phospholipid composition  determine the specific properties of the membrane; its physical  properties and its function.  Retailoring of phospholipids, such as  deacylation or acylation of phospholipid chains in existing  membranes, may be an important mechanism that the cell has for  rapidly adjusting membrane function in response to changing  environmental conditions, such as temperature, salt concentration,  water activity, etc.  Although there has been growing interest in  the role of membrane lipid metabolism as a way to protect against  environmental stress, retailoring mechanisms of existing membrane  phospholipids has received less attention.  The aim of this  research program is to examine the role of biochemical pathway(s)  that support the incorporation of acyl moieties into existing plant  membrane phospholipids.  This is accomplished by a pathway  different from the ordinary plant biosynthetic pathway for de novo  phospholipid synthesis.  The specific aim of this research program  is to delineate the biochemical pathway(s) leading to this unusual  acyl-group incorporation into preformed cottonseed membrane  phospholipids and to identify the enzyme(s) involved in the  process.  %%%  This is a basic research project to determine how plant cells can  efficiently regulate the chemical composition of their membranes to  resist destructive changes in their environment, such as  temperature, salt concentrations, water activity, etc.  Although  the effects of environmental stress on lipid biosynthesis in  membrane formation have been a subject of research for some time to  explain the development of plant resistance, changes in  phospholipid chemistry in existing membranes has not.  Experiments  will be conducted to determine how plants can change the structure  of membrane phospholipids and identify the enzymes  involved.  This  research should significantly increase our understanding and  ability to control resistance to environmental stress in plants.  ***",
