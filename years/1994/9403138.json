Dr. LaPointe received her  doctoral degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  under the supervision of Professor Richard Schrock. Dr.  LaPointe will continue her research at the University of North  Carolina under the sponsorship of Professor Maurice Brookhart.  Her postdoctoral research will focus on the design and  synthesis of the beta-diketonate complexes of cobalt, rhodium  and iridium as catalysts for olefin oligomerization and  polymerization. Longer term she plans to investigate cationic  platinum(II) and palladium(II) perfluoroalkyl complexes as  catalysts for the polymerization of perfluoroolefins.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.",
