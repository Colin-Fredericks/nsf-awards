 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353938  Williams  As a result of the calculus reform movement good curriculum  materials which involve the use of technology, modeling, and  problem solving are now widely available for the first two  semesters of calculus.  Similar materials are also becoming  available for courses which lead into calculus like precalculus  and college algebra. In this project a coalition involving both  two- and four-year colleges and universities in Connecticut is  working to integrate the materials and approaches so that  students taking a reformed precalculus course can move into a  reformed calculus course with an expectation of continuity. It  is particularly important both two-year colleges and four-year  colleges and universities are involved in this process because  many students take precalculus at two-year colleges and then  transfer to a four-year institution for calculus.    Three different workshops are being held in each of two summers  on precalculus and algebra, first two semesters of calculus,  and calculus of several variables and differential equations  for instructors at two and four-year colleges and universities.   In addition, key faculty at 7 institutions are identifying and  evaluating materials for precalculus and calculus and  developing further materials which assure a smooth transition  of students between the identified courses.  ***",
