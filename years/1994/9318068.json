Over the past few years confocal microscopy has been used in striking ways to localize subcellular structures and to image growing cells in complex tissues, providing new insights into cell cell interactions. The investigators in this user group are interested in the formation of the complex 3 dimensional organization of the nervous system. Four of the users examine axons, growth cones or synapses in living tissues. The fifth user studies the formation of the blood brain barrier and how glia participate in this. The acquisition of a confocal microscope would greatly enhance the capabilities of the members of this group. Not only would we increase the resolution of the data we obtain, we would be able to address questions that are presently unapproachable due to the inherent limitations of our current imaging facilities.    Confocal microscopy eliminates stray light from the image focal plane. This dramatically increases the resolution compared with conventional epifluorescence microscopic techniques. This permits optical sectioning of a fairly thick biological specimen. When coupled with a computer/image analysis system, data from a series of optical sections can be assembled to form a 3 dimensional reconstruction of the fluorescent emission pattern from the specimen. Subcellular structures can be localized within or on a cell using antibodies or other fluorescent probes, even in a complex environment such as a t issue slice or an intact embryo or animal. For most of the user group, this technique will be applied to make time lapse movies of live cells in tissues or whole animals. Recently confocal microscopy has been adapted to the technique of interference reflection microscopy (IRM), permitting much larger areas of a specimen to be examined at lower illumination levels. This greatly facilitates time lapse video of IRM of live cells. It is the confocal microscope's ability to produce high resolution, time lapse images of dynamically changing structures, such as developing or aging nervous tissue, that is our major technical requirement at this time.
