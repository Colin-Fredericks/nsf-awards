 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353690  Shymansky    This Project is the result of a partnership between the  University of Iowa and the Iowa City Community School District,  whose teachers and administrators recently completed a science  self study and made a commitment to restructure their science  program.  The plan is to enhance all K-6 teachers in the district  by immersing them in inservice activities which: require them to  analyze the scientific basis of activities in the district's  current science program; allow them to examine potential  supplemental and/or replacement materials; and challenge them to  refine and revise their science program to make science more  meaningful to students.  Through the summer component of the  project three lead science teachers for each of the city's  elementary schools will be identified and prepared to provide  support and inservice opportunities for their colleagues.  During  the summer the lead teachers will have opportunities to expand  their own science knowledge, develop insights into children's  science reasoning, and improve their ability to use inquiry based  instructional strategies.  During the school year these lead  teachers will be given opportunities to mentor their colleagues  as they implement the school system's inquiry based science  units.  The Iowa City School District's stature as a leader in  the Midwest will enable this project to serve as a model for  other sites in the Midwest, to serve as an exemplary placement  for preservice elementary teacher education and to provide  leadership teams for future dissemination efforts.      The cost sharing for the project will be 50% of the National  Science Foundation support.  ***",
