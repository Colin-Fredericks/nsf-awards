Recently, a great surge of interest took place in this subject,  with an exploding literature.  This increased activity has been  stimulated by the needs of rebuilding national infrastructure as  well as increasing competitiveness of the U.S. industry in the  field of materials.  Advances in the subject may be expected to  lead to improved high strength concrete, tougher ceramics, safer  design of structures subjected to overload such as earthquakes,  design of more reliable machine parts, etc.  The symposium is  expected to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue between  scientists working in structural engineering and concrete  technology, materials science, continuum mechanics and applied  mechanics, and to stimulate new developments.",
