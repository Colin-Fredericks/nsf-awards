A  complete understanding of the genetics of any organism, therefore,  requires general knowledge about how genomes evolve.  A crucial  question is how groups of traits become genetically integrated into  a single functional unit, for example an organ, through evolution.   This study will investigate this questions using the flower of wild  radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, as a model system.  The flower is an  ideal model organ because it is made up a number of easily-measured  parts (petals, pistils, stamens, etc.) that must work together as  a functional unit for successfully reproduction.  The results of  this work will improve our understanding of how groups of  individual traits become functionally integrated into organs and  organ systems.       An additional goal of this work is to determine many of the  factors responsible for successful reproduction in wild radish.   Wild radish can be a destructive weed in small grain crops,and is  closely related to many important crop and weed species.  For  example, closely related crops include radish, broccoli, cabbage,  cauliflower,and canola.  Therefore, knowledge gained concerning  reproduction in wild radish should be applicable to control of  several noxious weeds and improved seed production and yield in  several important corps.",
