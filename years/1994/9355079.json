 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applicants to Arizona State University's graduate programs in  Chemical Engineering have expressed increasingly strong interest in  environmental topics.  A graduate training/research program is  described in the focus area of Environmentally Friendly Technology,  emphasizing Environmentally Benign Chemical Processing.  Arizona  State University's existing expertise, experience, and interest in  environmental aspects of chemical engineering provide the necessary  research and teaching base from which to pursue this new area of  graduate training.  A program in Environmentally Benign Chemical  Processing will utilize both traditional chemical engineering  training - process engineering, optimization and control - and  newer, more specialized topics including air and water quality  measurement, recycling technologies, hazardous materials handling,  and risk assessment.    Topics including point-of use abatement, sensor technology, shared  load separations, process integration for pollution prevention, and  biosynthesis will be the basis of the trainees' research  experience.  Local industry will support this effort:  Motorola has  agreed to provide seminar speakers, advise on coursework  development, and begin planning for internships in appropriate  areas within the company.  Existing and new courses and activities  will comprise the teaching component of the program.  Minority  recruiting activities through the Coalition to increase Minority  Degrees will include faculty visits to schools and applicant visits  to ASU.  A structured program of peer and faculty mentoring will  promote student retention.",
