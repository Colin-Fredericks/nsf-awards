 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to build an 11.75-T. 500-MHz rotational-echo  double-resonance (REDOR) spectrometer for solid-state 15N  NMR experiments on proteins and protein complexes.  REDOR  NMR is well suited to the characterization of binding sites  of uniformly 15N-labeled, freeze-quenched, lyophilized, non-  crystallizeable protein complexes.  In a single experiment,  REDOR measures accurate, long-range distances from 31P, 19F,  or 13C labels in substrates and inhibitors to both sidechain  nitrogens (Arg, His, and Lys signals are always well  separated) and backbone peptide nitrogens (REDOR difference  signals from the peptide backbone are sometimes resolved).  Using these distances as constraints to molecular dynamics  simulations, plausible structures for protein binding sites  can be determined.  To enhance the resolution, sensitivity,  and selectivity of the 15N experiment, we propose to build a  solid-state NMR spectrometer specifically designed for 15N  REDOR.  The spectrometer will feature four-channel  transmission-line probes tuned for 1H-19F-31C-15N.  All rare-  spin channels will permit observation with more than 100-kHz  proton decoupling, including the 19F channel.  Small-  diameter coils will provide good filing factors for 100-kD  protein samples as small as 20 mg.  Quantitative 50-MHz 15N  NMR can be performed with standard magic-angle spinning (5-8  kHz spinning speeds).  High-sensitivity, high-efficiency,  high-power transmission lines require big pipes.  We plan to  use a 2 1/2-inch outer conductor and a 3/4-inch inner  conductor for the transmission line.  This means that we  need to build the spectrometer around a wide-bore magnet.  Robert McKay, the inventor of the transmission-line, multi-  frequency, high-power, high-sensitivity probe for solids  NMR, will design and build the probes and the spectrometer.  This 500-MHz REDOR NMR spectrometer will be the only one of  its kind in the world.  It will be used to provide answers  to a variety of important scientific (and practical)  quest ions in the biological sciences:  the structures of  big, non-crystallizeable protein complexes; the architecture  of cell walls, the mechanism of cell surface cell-cell, and  DNA-protein recognition; and the structure and dynamics of  membrane proteins.",
