The  objective will be to develop an overall  linearized model to include the above mentioned  devices and to examine their relative influence  on dynamic stability.  This research is  important in determining the causes of low  frequency oscillations and voltage collapse.   Both of these are operating problems faced by  utilities in the U.S. and India.  Prof. M.A.  Pai, University of Illinois Urbana will  collaborate with Profs. D.P. Sen Gupta & L.R.  Padiyar, Indian Institute of Science,  Bangalore.  The research team is exceptional.   Pai is an internationally recognized leader in  the use of direct methods for power system  stability, Sen Gupta and Padiyar have done  state-of-the-art system studies involving FACTS  and adaptive PSS and are highly respected.    Scope:  This research will address a problem in  the area of power systems that is of importance  in the U.S. and India.  While there is much  accumulated experience in the U.S., the Indian  academic institutions are very good at keeping  up with state-of-the-art, and the power  industry there quite mature in terms of their  absorption of technology.  The results expected  from this collaboration include research  papers, course development at the University of  Illinois, and an advanced level monograph  emanating from the research.     ***",
