 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353833  Chang    The Materials World Modules are a series of materials  science and technology kits designed to supplement existing  mathematics and science curricula in high schools.  The  modules close the gap between frontiers of research and  science in classrooms, providing open-ended experiences for  both students and teachers.  Nine modules cover basic  materials systems, materials and society, and materials  conservation and the environment.  The modules provide  students with hands-on experiences in design, synthesis, and  evaluation of materials.  The concepts of mathematics and  science are reinforced in the application of materials  science and technology to product development and  manufacturing.  Each modules includes a self-contained  experimental kit, teacher and student manuals, a video tape  showing how experiments are conducted - including safety  instructions - and a software package for data analysis and  further modeling of the experiment.  The products are  developed by professors in the Materials Research Center at  Northwestern working with educators and high school science,  mathematics and technology teachers.  A central electronic  databank on materials will be maintained at the Materials  Research Center.   ***",
