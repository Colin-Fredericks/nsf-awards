 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research project is to apply feedback  control systems analysis methods to address the process of  technology innovations in organizations.  Specifically, the initial  focus of the project is to use a feedback model of costs and  benefits to quantify factors influencing the success of information  technology implementation efforts.  Information technology in  general and computer mediated communication systems in particular  have been the subject of a large research literature base in the  social and behavioral sciences, as well as human factors and  computer sciences.  One of the consistent findings from this  diverse body of research is that new information technologies  (IT's) often fail to meet the organizational, work group, and  individual expectations of increased productivity and communication  efficiency.    The proposed research utilizes a methodology which, although new in  terms of social science research, has a long tradition in systems  engineering.  This methodology combines the concepts of systems  dynamics and economic cost and benefit analysis within the  theoretical framework of both Living Systems and Sociotechnical  Systems theories.  By identifying situational, organizational,  cultural, and other factors which affect successful IT  implementation, a cost and benefits model can be derived which will  apply to the diffusions of IT's and other communications or  technology innovations across organizations.",
