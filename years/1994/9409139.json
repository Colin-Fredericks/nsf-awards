 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409139  Vogelmann  Functional significance has not been ascribed to many leaf  structural features such as palisade and spongy mesophyll.  These  tissues presumably optimize photosynthesis, possibly by maximizing  overlap between internal concentrations of light and carbon  dioxide.  The proposed research will examine the relationship  between leaf anatomy, internal gradients of light, carbon dioxide  and the distribution of photosynthetic activity within the leaf.   In most leaves, light enters from the top whereas carbon dioxide  enters primarily from the bottom where the majority of the stomata  occur.  This may create two opposing internal gradients, either one  of which may limit photosynthesis of the individual cell layers.   In turn, such internal limitations could influence photosynthetic  performance at the level of the whole-leaf.  Leaf anatomy (sun vs.  shade leaves) and the placement of variable numbers of stomates on  the lower and upper leaf surfaces (hypo- vs. amphistomy) could  influence internal limitations to light and carbon dioxide, and  affect whole-leaf photosynthetic performance.  By using  radiolabeling and microautoradiography, it is proposed to examine  more directly the interactions between light and gradients of  photosynthetic performance within the leaf.  These experiments will  comprise a first step towards understanding the importance of leaf  structure to photosynthetic performance in both agricultural and  native species.  ***",
