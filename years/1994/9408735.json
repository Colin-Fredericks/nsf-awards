 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michlovic    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Michlovic  and his colleagues will conduct archaeological excavation at the  Rustad Quarry Site which is located in southeastern North Dakota.  The site is situated in an active soil quarry and much of it has  been destroyed by quarrying work. The portion which remains  intact however, contains a large sample of well preserved  cultural materials including stone tools as well as bone -  primarily bison. Several hearths are also present and these  suggest the possibility of reconstructing specific site specific  behaviors. A date of 7240 BP (Before Present) has been obtained  and this, together with the nature of the lithic material  indicates that the Rustad site was occupied during the warm  Altithermal period. Dr. Michlovic and his students will complete  excavation of the remaining portion of the site. Specialists will  analyze the animal bone to reconstruct hunting and butchering  patterns. The lithic material will be analyzed in an attempt to  match rock with source areas. In this way group range can be  estimated. The team will also employ a series of techniques,  including soil, pollen and phytolith analysis, to reconstruct the  prehistoric landscape and environment.    This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of the prehistory of the United States. Very  few rich sites have been found which date to the Altithermal and  the results of this work will be of interest to many  archaeologists. Altithermal conditions resulted in drought over  much of the midwest and it is unclear how hunting and gathering  societies at a simple level of technology adapted to such an  environment. The Rustad Quarry data should help to address this  question. Dr. Michlovic teaches at an undergraduate institution.  Many students are involved in the work and the project will  provide a direct, hands-on scientific experience.  ***",
