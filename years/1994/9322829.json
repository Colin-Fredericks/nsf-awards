 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322829  Gleaves    The objective of this work is a dynamic model of alkane oxidation  over vanadium-phosphorus-oxide (VPO) catalysts (also called vanadyl  pyrophosphate catalysts) that explains how such components of the  catalytic system as the VPO lattice, the VPO surface, surface  adspecies, and gas-phase species interact to give products with or  without selectivity.  The model would include the mechanism of  carbon-hydrogen bond activation and of oxygen addition, the  mechanism of oxygen transport, and the roles of adspecies in  determining selectivity.  To this end, the dynamics of the partial  oxidation of alkanes catalyzed by VPO are studied using a  combination of transient response and in situ spectroscopic  techniques.  A TAP (temporal analysis of products) reactor is  specially modified to permit simultaneous product analysis and in  situ infrared or Raman spectroscopy.     The selective conversion of light alkanes to oxygenates (alcohols,  ethers, aldehydes, esters, etc.) is of great interest to the  petrochemical and energy industries.  Oxygenates are intermediates  for production of a large array of chemicals, polymers, and  plastics, and are also in great demand as gasoline additives, both  to improve octane rating and to reduce tailpipe pollutants.  They  are often produced using VPO catalysts, usually from an olefin  feedstock.  However, alkanes (paraffins) are a cheaper raw material  if the technology for their partial oxidation could be improved.   ***",
