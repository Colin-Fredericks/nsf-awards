 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental research is being pursued on transient effects  dealing with the transport of current and heat pulses in  magnetized plasmas and turbulence studies dealing with  coherent structures in fluctuating magnetic fields.  These  processes address fundamental plasma properties which are  essential for understanding transport in plasmas, and they  are of broad interest in inertial and magnetic fusion,  pulsed power, and for active experiments in space plasmas.  The proposed work will be performed in a large, controlled  laboratory plasma with excellent diagnostic capabilities.  Pulsed currents are imposed with electrodes, particle beams  and induced by magnetic antennas.  The transport of these  currents by electromagnetic waves such as kinetic Alfven  waves, whistlers and beam modes will be studied.  Heat  pulses are generated with pulsed, intense rf fields of  magnetic antennas.  The heat transport in nearly  collisionless plasmas cannot be described by classical  diffusion models but may involve double layers and non-  Maxwellian distributions.  Using directional velocity  analyzers, emissive electric field probes and vector  magnetic field probes moveable in 3 dimensions will yield a  detailed picture of fields and particles.  Magnetic  turbulence will be investigated from the thermal level to  that of the ambient field.  It is excited by current  fluctuations in particle beams forming coherent rf  structures at cyclotron harmonic frequencies or by  instabilities such as beam-generating whistlers and lower  hybrid turbulence in high-beta plasmas.  Using conditional  averaging, a special statistical technique employing digital  oscilloscopes, coherent magnetic structure can be resolved  in a turbulent field.  Fields and particles in such  \"islands\" will be mapped so as to study transport processes  on a microscopic scale.  Refined plasma diagnostic tools and  techniques will be developed.  Such detailed experiments are  expected to advance the knowledge of basic plasma  properties, have i mplications to the various uses of  plasmas, and train students in modern experimental plasma  physics.",
