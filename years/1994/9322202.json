Summer research programs will be focused on the behavior and  neuroanatomy of honey bees.  Students will have the opportunity to combine  compelling fieldwork with modern neuroanatomical techniques. Student training will  be a three-fold process.  First, lectures will be given on the structure and function of  the insect nervous system; the hormonal regulation of insect metamorphosis and neural  development; and the experimental study of animal behavior.  Second, students will  receive practical training in the safe handling of colonies of honey bees and in  observation of honey bee behavior, with ample opportunity provided to practice these  new skills.  Third, students will receive laboratory instruction in histological  techniques for the light microscopic study of the honey bee nervous system, including  many aspects of stereology.  Students will then be divided into two teams of three  students each.  These teams will then carry out a research project in which an aspect  of brain organization, nerve cell number, gene expression, or hormonal responsiveness,  etc. is studied in bees of known age and behavioral status.  The goal of this project is  to introduce students who already have an interest in behavioral biology to the value  of social insects as models for the study of the neurobiology of complex behavior,  including learning and memory. This project represents an extension of an ongoing  collaboration between two laboratories in the Department of Entomology and the  Neuroscience Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  It will be  based in the University of Illinois Bee Research Facility and in the co-PIs  laboratories in the Department of Entomology.  This unusual combination of field and  laboratory research environments coupled with the different but complementary  backgrounds of the co-PIs will provide undergraduates with a rich summer research   experience.  The program currently proposed reflects the success of a past REU Site  program centered around the same theme (offered Summer 1992), with a new  emphasis on research teamwork as a means of helping students complete meaningful  research projects.  ***",
