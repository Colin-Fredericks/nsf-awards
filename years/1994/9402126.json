These regular meetings have  attracted an international roster of participants making vital  research contributions in this core area of the mathematical  sciences.  The schedule is arranged to provide maximum  opportunities for genuine interaction on current research  activity.  Five plenary lectures on recent discoveries on  fractals, Hausdorff and packing measure for self-affine carpets,  measure properties of tree-like constructions, multifractals and  geometric properties of sums of lacunary series are scheduled.   Interspersed among these are planned a balanced number of  shorter talks.  Funds from this award are directed to support of  younger investigators, especially those who come from  underrepresented groups.  Generous cost-sharing will be provided  by the University of Virginia.       Real analysis forms the underpinning for many studies in the  mathematical sciences.  This particular research provides  a particularly valuable foundation in areas where  important applications can be expected, such as differential  equations, iterated function systems and fractal phenomena.  ***",
