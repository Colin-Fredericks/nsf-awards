 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404895  Begovic  The objective of the proposed research is to explore the  opportunities for applications which utilize a new generation of  computer-based monitoring and transient recording devices in  power systems, such as phasor measurements units (PMUs).   Their  ability to quickly assess the elements of the power system state  vector during the disturbances may be used for monitoring and  control of the system state and enhancement of its stability.   The main practical obstacle in implementation is their cost,  which restricts their widespread use.  Often times, only a small  number of measurement sites may be chosen according to certain  criteria relative to the objective of the intended application.   The intensive communication requirement also creates a practical  limit on the number of devices that may be used -- even the  modern communication networks would have difficulty with the  abundance of data generated by the PMUs.  The efficient local  processing and extraction of essential information from PMU data  before they are sent to a central location are important  objectives of the proposed research; monitoring and control  applications for tracking and enhancement of system stability  with restricted resources are also a focal point.  Recognizing  the timeliness and potential benefits of the proposed work,  Georgia Power Company and ESEERCO have committed modest, but much  needed resources and equipment in token of their support.  This  will enable the investigator to test some of the proposed  algorithms and techniques on actual data.  ***",
