 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317984  Belovsky  The dominant mechanism promoting the limitation and regulation of  natural populations often varies among sites for the same species,  and over time periods for the same population. Grasshopper  populations from the western US grasslands demonstrate this  variability. Based upon independent long-term experimental studies  with grasshoppers, the PI's have found that in Montana populations  are food limited, whereas in Nebraska populations are predator  limited. The purpose of this research is to synthesize these  studies with regard to the changing relative importance of  different biotic interactions and density independent mortality at  different sites in different years. The synthesis suggests that  predator limitation will dominate at low food abundance, whereas  food limitation will dominate at high food abundance. The PI's will  conduct a series of field experiments at the Montana and Nebraska  sites to test these hypotheses.  %%%  From the standpoint of basic research, this project will help to  determine the relative roles of different biotic and abiotic  factors on herbivore populations. In addition, grasshoppers, in  particular, are known to be pests in agricultural systems and  rangelands. This study will provide valuable information regarding  population dynamics and mechanisms to control  this widespread  group of herbivore species.  ***",
