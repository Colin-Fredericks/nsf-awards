 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311411  Weathers  Growth in research activity at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies  during the past nine years has put increasing pressure on the  analytical laboratory to process rapidly samples from a wide  variety of ecosystems whose chemical concentrations vary by  several orders-of-magnitude.  This project will upgrade  analytical capabilities by purchasing a new ion chromatograph,  total organic carbon analyzer, and high performance liquid  chromatograph.  The laboratory currently analyzes samples for  major inorganic and organic ions for approximately 14 NSF-  supported projects.  These projects are done by scientists from  this institution, as well as outside collaborators.  In addition,  the laboratory serves as the primary analytical center for  projects funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Mary  Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, the USDA, the Hudson River  Foundation and others.  Extensive graduate and undergraduate  (through an NSF site and supplementary REU grant) student  research is also done in the laboratory.    The laboratory currently operates older models of the instruments  with severely limited sample capacity.  Some are operational but  incapable of meeting the demands of the scientists because they  are either slow, have limited sensitivity, or cannot give  accurate results for sample matrices.  Currently, one (the  inductively coupled plasma spectrometer) is only intermittently  operational.  The instruments to be acquired will make the  analytical laboratory more efficient and allow data to be  downloaded directly to a PC.  ***",
