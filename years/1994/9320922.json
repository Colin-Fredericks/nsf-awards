When complete, it will allow users to trace public  attention, media coverage, congressional attention, legislative  action, and budgetary outlays in the federal government to every  major social problem that the U.S. government has faced since  World War Two.  With this dataset, the researchers will answer a  central question of American politics:  why do out political  leaders attend to certain problems while they ignore others?   This topic, generally called agenda-setting within the political  science research community, has proved surprisingly difficult to  study in a systematic manner.  By gathering information on public  opinion polls, media coverage, congressional hearings, statutes  and federal budgetary outlays, the researchers will attend to  this question.    Essentially, this is a project on the setting of governmental  priorities.  The investigators want to know whether public  concerns, as reflected in polls and in media coverage, are  translated into governmental attention, law-making, or changes in  the federal budget.  There are strong reasons to suspect that the  process is not the simple unidirectional model of flow of public  concern to government action.  Rather, governmental actions  themselves may help determine the list of problems that the  public deems important.  With the creation of this large dataset,  the investigators will sort out these questions.    By developing a topic-coding system and by applying it uniformly  throughout the project, they can show when attention ah shifted  to any of a number of new problems.  For example, they can trace  when attention has risen or fallen on the topic of environmental  controls, race relations, housing, crime, or any of a number of  topics.  With this information, they will be able to see to what  extent congressional hearings, statutes, and budgetary  allocations stem from, lead to, or are independent from media  attention and pub lic concern.  ***",
