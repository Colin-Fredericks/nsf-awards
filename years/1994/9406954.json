 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406954  Tewfik    Technical Narrative:    This is a cooperative research project between the  University of Minnesota and Bilkent University in Ankara,  Turkey.  The investigators are electrical engineers who  propose to address the signal processing issues that arise  in the design of an Audio-Visual Information Management  System (AVIMS).  Specifically, the project will advance the  technology so that users in the United States will have  interactive access to the database of the Topkapi Palace  Museum, one of the finest archaeological museums in the  world.  The database of this museum contains images of  Ottoman calligraphic documents and illuminated manuscripts,  images of objects, speech signals, and some video signals.  A major challenge in building an AVIMS for such a collection  of data is to provide users with the capability of querying  documents based on a keyword, audio or visual feature or  subject.  To render the database more accessible to a wider  audience in static and mobile settings, the investigators  (Drs. A. Tewfik from the University of Minnesota and E.  Cetin from Bilkent University) will provide tools to deliver  Ottoman manuscripts in a spoken format.  Ottoman documents  will be recorded in spoken form by experts familiar with the  archaic Ottoman script.  Users will be provided with the  capability of playing the recorded and compressed signals at  various speeds with minimal distortion.  Time-scale  modification will also be used to mask most of the random  delays that occur during the transmission of audio data over  computer networks.  Project funding will enable the two  teams to work together in both Minneapolis and Ankara.  ***",
