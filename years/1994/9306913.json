 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306913  Swensen       The Cucurbitaceae and Begoniaceae are two plant families whose  members exhibit very distinctive morphological features, yet their  phylogenetic relationships to each other and to related groups  remain unclear.  The cucurbit family is widely appreciated for its  diversity of fruit structures (compare pumpkin, luffa, cucumber,  chayote) whereas the begonias show a diversity of floral structures  and leaf forms.  Research by Drs. Swensen and Rieseberg is designed  to use DNA gene sequences from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes  for comparing members of these two families and several putative  relatives.  The new molecular data will be compared with  traditional morphological characters used in the taxonomy of these  plants, in order to determine areas of congruence and areas of  disagreement.  Where congruent, the data will allow recognition of  reliable morphological features for taxon identification and for  study of evolutionary change in characters.  Disagreements will  highlight problems of homology and possible differences in rates of  molecular evolution.  %%%       Two related families, Datiscaceae and Coriariaceae, will also  be studied.  These include plants with symbiotic associations with  nitrogen fixing actinorhizal bacteria.  The research will  investigate the evolution of this association and will provide  hypotheses as to why it occurs in some groups and not in others.   This information should prove useful in the induction of nitrogen  fixing symbioses in agriculturally important plants.",
