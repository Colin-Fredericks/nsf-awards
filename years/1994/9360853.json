 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360853  Koerber    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  seeks to take full advantage of an educationally sound computer-  based technology to build a MathMastery system based on the idea  that mastery of mathematical concepts is cumulative--that mastering  these concepts in sequence is essential to building a sound  foundation enabling the learning of higher mathematics.  For a  mathematical educational system to be comprehensive for all grade  and ability levels and span all curricular areas of a particular  subject, there must be an understanding of how each concept is  linked to others and how each concept builds on the previous ones.   Erko Technologies proposes to build a such a system which is also  responsive to individual learning styles and permits interactive  learning.     In Phase I of the MathMastery project, Erko Technologies will test  the feasibility of the construction of a comprehensive Mathematical  Concept Network that maps the interdependencies of mathematical  skills necessary for students in elementary and high school to  master, and the firm will test the importance and usefulness of the  Mathematical Concept Network as a component of mathematical  educational software.  If successful, the project will contribute  to the development of new educationally sound technology to help  more students excel in mathematics and develop the necessary  capability to pursue advanced study of mathematics and science.  ***",
