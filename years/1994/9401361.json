 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lyubeznik         A large part of the principal investigator's research on local  cohomology has been devoted to the study of a number of striking connections with  several quite diverse areas of mathematics, such as etale cohomolgy, topology of  algebraic varieties, D-modules and others.  While considerable progress on this circle of  ideas has been made recently, a lot remains to be done.  This is especially true for the  applications of D-modules to local cohomology which is a completely new area of  research.  The principal investigato will work on these questions by using methods that  have been successful in the past as well as developing some new methods.          This  research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic  geometry.  Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.   One can either study the geometry of the solution set or approach problems  algebraically by investigating certain functions on the solution set that form what is  called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close connection between  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. ***",
