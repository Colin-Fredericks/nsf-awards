 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320296  Crisman     This award is for the acquisition of equipment which will be placed within the Robotic and Vision Systems Laboratory (RVSL) to support research in computer vision and robotics.  Specifically, this equipment will be used for four projects:      (1) Deictic Primitives for General Purpose Navigation--A deictic primitive is a command such as \"approach that\" where 'that' is an area selected in a video image by the user.  Research will be performed to define a set of these primitives which can be used for general purpose navigation.     (2) Biologically-Based Shallow Water Robot Ambulation--This equipment will also be used in the development of a biologically-based robot control architecture for a shallow water walking robot.  The proposed architecture is based on central pattern generators and reflex models derived from lobster neurophysiology.     (3) Geometric Model-Free Robot Grasping--The RVSL will also explore robot mechanisms and control architectures to perform general purpose grasping where neither the position nor shape of the target object is explicitly computed by the robot system.  The proposed approach utilized a novel robot hand developed in the RVSL to reflexively grasp objects.     (4) Coordinated Multiple Robots for the Area Coverage Problem--To completely cover a search area, a typical robot must continually localize itself with respect to a prestored map.  The proposed work will investigate multiple robot solutions to this problem when a prior map of the area is unavailable.     ***               This award is for the acquisition of equipment which will be placed within the Robotic an d Vision Systems L                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        N   Q                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          $         $         $              G                                                                                  Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                   .  e.  e                        <    Cisman/Northeastern    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
