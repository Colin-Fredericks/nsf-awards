 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458102  Lockery    There is growing evidence that human behavior is strongly  influenced by genes.  Because many behavioral genes are  believed to exert their influence through the nervous  system, it is essential to understand how genes affect the  structure and function of individual neurons.  A promising  approach to this problem is to study how genes control the  behavior of simple animals.  In many ways, the tiny (1 mm  long) roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is ideal for this  investigation:  the connectivity among its 302 nerve cells  is known completely; the neural circuits for its behaviors  have been identified; over 150 genes affecting behavior have  been found; and cloning a gene to determine its function is  easier than in almost any other animal.  The main objectives  of my research, therefore, are:  (1) to make  electrophysiological recordings from identified neurons in  C. elegans to determine how behavior is produced in normal  animals, and (2) to determine how genes affect the structure  and function of the nervous system in C. elegans by  recording from identified neurons in behavioral mutants.  This research will deepen our understanding of the causes of  behavior in this increasingly important system and, because  C. elegans have homologs in mammals, it will very likely  expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of  behavior in  more complex organisms, including humans.",
