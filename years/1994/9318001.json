 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the purchase of an imaging plate  area detector system in order to measure x-ray diffraction  data from biological macromolecular crystals.  This system  would directly support the research of 3 major investigators  and 4 minor investigators.  These investigators have  immediate data collection needs for 26 different existing  crystal forms of 11 proteins and complexes.  Since these  crystals include protein kinases, protein phosphatases, DNA  methylases, DNA endonucleaes, a calcium binding protein  involved in neurite extension, a zinc amidohydrolase, and an  enzyme involved in the control of glycolysis and  gluconeogenesis, the elucidation of these crystal structures  will advance the knowledge of the DNA methylation, protein  phosphorylation, mammalian development, control of cell  growth, gene expression, and cell differentiation and  provide insights into the basic mechanism of the human  afflictions of cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.  Most of these crystals require the large active area, high  dynamic range and/or low noise that the imaging plate area  detector diffractometer provides,  In addition, the  equipment will be used in teaching an advanced course in  macromolecular crystallography offered each October at Cold  Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and in training selected  undergraduates in structural biology during the summer.  The  new instrument will let us continue to give outstanding  training to students in our advanced teaching program.",
