Novel oriented zeolite films will be combined  with optical sensors based on fluorescence dyes stabilized in the  zeolite matrix. Collisional fluorescence quenching with oxygen and  halogenated hydrocarbons will demonstrate the concept of optical  sensors with molecular sieving capabilities.  In addition, a number  of novel size-selective mass sensors will be developed: (i) sensors  with preferred sorption of non-polar organic vs. polar compounds,  and (ii) selective sensors for aliphatic and aromatic amines. The  exploration of synthetic routes for novel thin films on sensors  will also address fascinating aspects of multifunctional molecular  films, and nucleation and growth of nanoporous structures. This  work is important because there is an urgent need for new families  of selective sensors with long-term stability.  %%%  Rapidly growing demands for comprehensive monitoring in the  environmental, medical and industrial field have stimulated efforts  to develop high performance chemical sensors. While many sensors  show excellent sensitivity, their molecular selectivity and  long-term stability remain important challenges. This research  program focuses on the design of novel nanoporous thin films with  molecular recognition capabilities for stable chemical sensors.  Novel oriented zeolite films will be combined with optical sensors  based on fluorescence dyes stabilized in the zeolite matrix. In  addition, a number of novel size-selective mass sensors will be  developed.",
