The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Wade B. Worthen of Furman University to work  with Dr. Klaus Rohde at the University of New England in New  South Wales, Australia.    Their research will directly test the effects of temperature  on the speed of selection and rate of mutation using  Drosophila melanogaster flies as a model system.  There are  two aspects  to their plan, the first is selection and  mutation experiments in the lab and second, a field and  literature survey of latitudinal changes in drosophilid  diversity and generation time.  The focus of the research  will be several lab experiments selecting for various traits  in Drosophila melanogaster under different  temperature  treatments.  These experiments will determine whether  populations at higher temperatures have higher mutation  rates, shorter generation times, and more rapid responses to  selection than populations at lower temperatures.  This  research is likely to make an important contribution to the  study of biodiversity and will expand what we know about a  critical determinant of a primary global pattern ***",
