The course will provide students with  background and hands-on experience in metrology, force  measurements, sources of inaccuracy in measuring instruments,  surface texture evaluation, statistical analysis of experiments,  and modern quality control instruments. The course will include a  sequence of experiments which will be conducted in a machine-shop  environment. The lack of a well equipped metrology laboratory  hinders the effective instruction of all manufacturing related  courses, and the new equipment will significantly contribute to  their improvement.   With the new instruments, students will be  able to improve mating of parts, design fixtures for quick-gaging,  improve their design through proper tolerancing, and propose  improved machining processes based on the experience they gain.   Course activities will link exposure to metrology operations by  high school, community college, and university students.  The  difference in the educational backgrounds of the different student  groups will be analogous to the one present between formally  trained engineers and technicians. Valuable lessons will be learned  by both groups of students through this exercise.",
