Self-incompatibility, a genetic system  that prevents fertilization by self-pollen in hermaphroditic  plants, is one of a number of mechanisms that promote outcrossing  in higher plants.  It is estimated to be present in over half of  all angiosperm species.  This phenomenon has important implications  for plant breeding, and as a result its physiological and molecular  bases have been the focus of extensive research.  Self-  incompatibility also plays an important role in the evolution of  higher plants.  The loss of self-incompatibility and evolution of  selfing is thought to be a common evolutionary pattern in a number  of angiosperm families.  Yet despite an extensive literature on the  major ecological and genetic factors favoring self-vs. cross  fertilization, little is know about the specific factors involved  in the origin or loss of self-incompatibility.       The co-occurrence of two closely related annuals in the genus  Linanthus presents an opportunity to investigate the relationship  between self-incompatibility and mating system evolution.  The two  species are ecologically and morphologically similar, yet they are  distinguished by their breeding systems: Linanthus parviflorus is  self-incompatible, while an undescribed sympatric species is self-  fertilizing.  In comparing a number of ecological and genetic  aspects of the two species, the proposed research will address the  functional significance of self-incompatibility, focussing on  unique features of the phenomenon.  For instance, while a number of  mechanisms of higher plants prevents self-fertilization, self-  incompatibility is unique in that it also may prevent mating  between close relatives.  The evolutionary significance of this  will be investigated.  Another focus of the research will be the  relationship between self-incompatibility and morphological floral  characters that influence the deposition of se lf-pollen on the  stigma.  Information gained from this study will contribute to our  understanding of the factors that influence the loss of self-  incompatibility, a critical turning point in the course of mating  system evolution in higher plants.",
