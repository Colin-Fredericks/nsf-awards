During the planning year, the  Consortium is inviting representatives of other postsecondary  institutions, school districts, business and industry, and  government agencies to join with them to assess the state of  advanced technological education in the region and structure a  center that would provided needed leadership in promoting  excellence in technological education.  The planning structure  involves a three-tiered process that allows for maximum  involvement and input from participants while maintaining a  focus to ensure achievement of project objectives.  At the  conclusion of the planning process, the Consortium will have  developed a five-year plan for the Center that will include: a  mission statement, goals and objectives, activities, evaluation  process and strategies for funding the Center.  ***",
