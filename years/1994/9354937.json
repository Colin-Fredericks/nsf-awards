 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancing our understanding in a wide range of scientific and  engineering fields require the solution of the fluid equations  over a very large range of densities and physical scales.  These  problems, which are not soluble on the current generation of  computers, can be solved with the new generation of massively  parallel high performance computers using object oriented  languages and are likely to form one of the most important  scientific applications of these machines.  The MAE and  Astrophysics departments at Princeton are at the forefront of  research into the development of numerical algorithms and  computer technology to utilize the next generation of machines in  this effort.  The engineering and scientific goals are the  applications to aerodynamics (the design of airplanes, cars and  ships); to turbulence research; and to structure formation in the  universe.  Progress in these different application areas requires  a continuing research effort toward the development of algorithms  amenable to parallel processing, automatic grid adaption,  coloring schemes for domain decomposition of an arbitrary  unstructured tetrahedral  grid, and implementation of efficient  message passing algorithms to reduce the communication costs on  distributed memory architectures.  These problems are generic,  and not specific to a particular field of application.  It is  felt that a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of such  problems would greatly benefit the training of students and  enhance the effective use of high performance computing in  research.  The MAE and Astrophysics departments have collaborated  in this effort in the past, and will continue to do so in the  future.    We request support for five graduate students to be trained in  the design of algorithms for the numerical solution of partial  differential equations using massively parallel computer  platforms and the application of complex hydrocodes to  engineering and physics problems ranging from turbulence research  in aerodyna mics to the evolution of cosmological structure.",
