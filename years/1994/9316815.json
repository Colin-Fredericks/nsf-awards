The conference  will bring together karst and other scientists with hydrological,  biological, geological, chemical and geomorphological backgrounds  focusing on the role of microorganisms in both geological and  biological processes with an emphasis on karst.  Topics to be  covered include: 1) Redox Environments in Karst, 2) Role of  Microorganisms in Karst Processes, 3) Energy, Chemoautotrophy, and  Thermodynamics in Microbial Systems, 4) Sulfate/Sulfide/Carbonate  Speleogenesis, 5) microbial Mediation of Carbonate Precipitation  and 6) Comparison of Microbial Systems in Karst to those Elsewhere  and in the Fossil record.  Twelve karst and other scientists have  been invited from around the world to give keynote addresses and  chair the various sessions.  The conference will be three days in  length.  The first and third days will be devoted to keynote  addresses and invited and volunteered papers.  On the evening of  the first day there will be a post1er session and reception.  The  second day will be devoted to a field trip and workshops on field  and laboratory techniques in geomicrobiology.  Keynote speakers,  session chairs and most presenters have been personally invited to  participate in the conference.  The conference is being advertised  in several professional outlets including Geotimes, GSA Today, EOS  and The Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America.  All  abstracts will be published in the conference program.  Contributed  papers are planned to be published in a special issue of  Geomicrobiology.  Meeting summaries will be submitted to various  appropriate professional outlets.  ***",
