 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321582  Tolbert       Chemical reactions on type I polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)  are currently believed to be a key step in polar ozone destruction.   Although type I PSCs are thought to be composed of nitric  acid/water vapor (HNO3/H2O) mixtures, their exact chemical  composition and phase are still uncertain.  This research project  will use infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectroscopy to  determine the chemical composition of type I PSCs.  First, the  optical constants for NHO3/H2O mixtures will be measured over a wide  wavelength range for use in comparisons with field observations of  type I PSCs.  Laboratory studies of model type I PSC film growth  will also be performed.  These studies will use in situ FTIR  spectroscopy as a probe of the chemical composition and phase of  the condensed material during PSC nucleation and growth.       In addition to using spectroscopy to identify PSCs, new  spectroscopic experiments will study surface reactions on type I  PSCs.  The reaction of chlorine nitrate (CIONO2) with hydrochloric  acid (HCl) on type I PSCs is currently believed to be the single  most important heterogenous reaction promoting ozone loss.   Previous work has shown that this reaction depends strongly on the  relative humidity is increased.  Large angle reflectance FTIR  spectroscopy will be used to probe the surface reaction of CLONO2  with HCI on model type I PSC films.  Surface spectroscopic probes  of the condensed phase during should yield insight into the complex  mechanism of this important heterogenous reaction.       In addition to chemical reactions on PSCs, there is now  heightened interest in heterogenous chemistry on the global  stratospheric sulfate aerosol (SSA) layer. Chemical reactions on  background and volcanic SSAs may be responsible for the down ward  trend in ozone observed in the last decade.  This project will  investigate the chemical and physical properties of SSAs, composed  primarily of sulfuric acid and water vapors (H2SO4) and(H2O).  Spectroscopi c experiments will also be performed to characterize  low temperature liquid and frozen sulfuric acid films  representative of SSAs fro use in comparisons with field  observations of SSAs.  In addition, the chemical reactivity of SSAs  will be studied.  A combination of gas phase and condensed phase  detection of reactants and products will be used to obtain a more  complete picture of the condensed phase reactions.  Initial studies  will focus on the uptake and reactivity of HOx reservoir species in  sulfuric acid as a function of composition and phase of the acid.",
