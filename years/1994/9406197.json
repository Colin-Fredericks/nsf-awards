The initial results of this collaboration show that the  ultimate capacity bounds of magnetic storage media exceed existing  practice and short term projections by nearly three orders of  magnitude.  The capacity bounds of the complete storage system  reflect these ultimate bounds, but are further limited by the other  system components, including transducers, codes, and electronics.   This project analyzes these limits, and seeks design rules for  components and channels to maximize the use of the potential  capacity.  This objective is supported by three connected research  activities.  The first of these activities addresses the modeling  of storage media.  The models used to date have been idealized to  reduce their computational complexity; they have yielded valuable  qualitative results. The project is developing a quantitative  analysis requiring more realistic modeling while still being  computationally tractable.  Specifically, thermal, spatial and  dynamic effects will be included in more refined medium and channel  models.  Annealing algorithms will be incorporated to examine this  area. This will allow understanding of the fundamental limits of  this channel.  The analysis of possible implementations of a  complete storage channel from the viewpoint of its information  capacity comprises a major part of our research.  Such an analysis  accounts not only for the properties of the medium, but also for  such issues as asymmetries of storage and retrieval, electronics,  and archivability.  Initial studies focus on computing the capacity  of simplified versions of the recording channel that include the  read head.  A striking result of this work has been the development  of relations and equivalences between the ph ysical parameters of  storage media and their capacity bounds.  This has led to a  proposal of new medium design guides for ultra-high density  storage.  These results were developed for media imbedded in ideal  systems, and are expected to be reflected in similar relations in  existing and projected technological realizations.  The  equivalences will be tested experimentally, using a variety of  media, in their unique laboratory facilities.  These researchers  were the first to demonstrate experimentally that medium noise has  a repeatable component due to local medium properties.  These  experiments motivated the development of medium models for use in  magnetic recording system analysis and design, which led to the  proposal to exploit that deterministic noise component to increase  the capacity of magnetic recording systems.  Experiments form an  integral part of the research.  The research team has theorists  working closely with experimentalists.  As a result, the models and  results derived can immediately be compared to measurements of  physical systems.  The supporting studies will combine to address  the design of optimal signal processing schemes, for realizable  systems, that take full advantage of the available components.  The  design strategies will explore new methods for storing information  magnetically, and unconventional information processing techniques.   It is hoped that the results will have wide applicability to other  information systems; the approach, joining device physics with  information science, is  unparalleled in the field.  This  physically-based approach to information science will develop new  analysis techniques for complex systems, motivate the design  of  new components and systems, and design new signal processing  strategies to approach the computed capacity limits.  Through this  novel and unconstrained approach new ways to process and store  information will emerge yielding dramatic increases in storage  density.  ***",
