The introduction of new laboratory experiments  will facilitate student understanding of this technology and its  broad application in all fields of materials analysis. The  undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum will be enhanced by  incorporating the spectrophotometer into the laboratory courses of  Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis and  Instrumental Analysis for majors and Physical Science for  non-majors. In addition, this acquisition will significantly  enhance the undergraduate research capability. The  spectrophotometer will provide hands-on training for students. It  will also afford a number of capabilities which are not available  to them at present, such as, calibration, background correction,  data storage, editing, reporting and software control. Students  will use the equipment for trace element analysis of soil, water,  rocks and hair samples. Having performed these analyses the  students will be made aware of practical application of the  technique in chemical industries and research laboratories in  solving problems of environmental, biological and geological  significance. The project will provide a wide variety of student  experiences which will emphasize operation and application of the  instrument.",
