The collection is a fundamental international and national resource in teaching and research in biodiversity and biological disciplines.  The improvements coincide with a move of the collections to new, modern facilities in a Life Sciences Building that the University has renovated at a cost of $80M $120M.  The renovation has achieved a 48% increase in space for all collections.  The support will provide cabinets to replace inadequate old cases and to alleviate crowding, two ultracold freezers for housing an irreplaceable frozen tissue collection, and student assistants for packing and unpacking the collection. %%% The bird collection in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California Berkeley is internationally recognized in its importance to systematic and ecological research.  It is a fundamental resource in biodeversity studies and education.  This support will enable the collection to be moved to newly renovated facilities and rehoused in modern cabinets that will ensure its conservation for future generations of students and researchers. ***",
