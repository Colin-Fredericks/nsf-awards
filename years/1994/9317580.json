 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317580  Falconer    This is a study of the  mechanism and intermediates of the Rochow  direct synthesis reaction between silicon and methyl chloride  catalyzed by copper.  This reaction can serve as a model for  understanding the class of solid-catalyzed gas-solid reactions.   When it is run industrially in large fluidized bed reactors, it  forms dimethlydichlorosilane, the  precursor to silicone polymers,  with selectivity as high as 90%  It is very sensitive to material  properties such as surface composition, the form of the catalyst,  concentrations of promoters, and impurities; the objective of this  work is to determine which materials and properties improve  activity and selectivity.  Reaction kinetics are measured at  atmospheric pressure in a small reactor attached to an ultrahigh  vacuum system equipped for surface analysis and sample treatment.   Single-crystal silicon surfaces are used so that the planar  surfaces and the pits formed on reacted surfaces can be  characterized at various stages by scanning electron microscopy,  energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, optical  microscopy, Auger spectroscopy, chemical treatment, and  temperature-programmed desorption.  The effects of silicon-oxide  layers, silicon crystal face, zinc and tin as promotors, and  aluminum, iron, and calcium as impurities are determined.  Parallel  studies in a fluidized bed reactor will be conducted at the Elkem  Development Center in Sewickley, PA.        Silicone polymers are ubiquitous in modern technology with wide  application as sealants, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, dielectrics,  and other applications.  High-quality polymer requires a pure  monomer, in this case dichlorodimethylsilane, and it is this issue  that is addressed here.  The contamination of the monomer by other  silanes formed as byproducts in the direct synthesis reaction is  presently a problem.  This effort is coordinated with Elkem Corp.,  a major supplier of dichlorodimethlysilane.  Supplementary support  for this effort  is provided by Dow-Corning Corp., a major consumer  of dichlorodimethlysilane.",
