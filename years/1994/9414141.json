 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414141  Scharfstein  This research will study the response of pricing, markup,  investment and inventory decisions to demand fluctuations  for firms experiencing different degrees of liquidity  constraints. The study is divided into three parts. In the  first part, a model is developed that analyzes the effects  of external financing constraints on markups, capital  expenditures and inventories. The key arguments made in this  part of the study are that firms set prices to attract  customers and capture greater market share. If firms do not  have to face capital market imperfections, the markups tend  to be procyclical because it is easy to capitalize on a  state of  high customer demand to improve profit margins. If  firms face capital market imperfections, the markups tend to  be countercyclical. When the model is extended to account  for capital expenditures, we derive a general result that  shows how  borrowing firms tend to be less forward looking  and invest less in capital over the long term. The second  part of the study uses data from the supermarket industry in  the empirical application of the models. The main focus of  the empirical work is to ascertain whether firms that are  more financially vulnerable to economic downturns tend to  raise markups more than their less financially vulnerable  rivals. The third part of the study extends the basic  framework to a broader range of industries.  This project is of significant interest because the results  could improve our understanding of the interaction between  capital markets and product markets.",
