 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much economic research in the last decade has focused on the  phenomenon of knowledge spillovers, by which it is meant that the  externality that is created when one researcher's efforts  facilitate or enhance the success of someone else's efforts.   Knowledge spillovers are created in the public sector, when  universities and government labs produce basic research results  that provide the foundation for applied research in the private  sector; they are also created in the private sector when  researchers take advantage of knowledge produce by other private  agents.  These spillovers are key to understanding the process of  technological progress, how it contributes to economic growth,  and how policy levers can be used effectively to foster growth  through innovation.  The purpose of this research is to analyze  the flows of knowledge spillovers across time, technological  sectors, and geographic areas.  Relevant data is already being  assembled that will permit the testing of models of regional and  sectorial growth incorporating knowledge spillovers.  This  research is important because it will increase our understanding  of role of science and technology in fostering economic growth.   The results of this project will also be of interest to other  scholars and to science policy makers.",
