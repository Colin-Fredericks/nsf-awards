Specific Objectives of the Proposed Work  Elongation factor 1 (EF-1) is found in multiple forms in the  cytosol as EF-1, EF-1.valyl-tRNA synthetase, and EF-1a.  In rabbit  reticulocytes, all of the valyl-tRNA synthetase is associated with  about 15%  of the EF-1.  Recently, all four subunits of EF-1 have  been shown to the phosphorylated.  The   and   subunits are  phosphorylated b y casein kinase II  in vitro and in reticulocytes  and Artemia salina (1-4).  EF-1  ,  ,  , and are phosphorylated by  protein kinase C in reticulocytes treated with phorbol ester and in  vitro (1-5).  The   subunit is phosphorylated in Xenopus oocytes  and in vitro by the cell division control  kinases p34cdc2 (4,6).   The   subunit has also been shown to be modified by methylation and  addition of glycerolphosphorylethanolamine (7).  Phosphorylation of  EF-1 by protein kinase C, both in vivo and in vitro, stimulates the  rate of elongation by 2-3 fold (1,5).  In these studies, we propose to analyze, at the molecular level,  the two complexes of EF-1 with regard to structure, function, and  regulation.  The role of phosphorylation by protein kinase C and  casein kinase II on complex formation and individual subunits of  EF-1 expressed in E. coli.  The latter will enable us to determine  the effects of site-specific mutations of the individual  phosphorylation sites on GDP/GTP exchange activity and on the rate  of elongation.    The following specific aims will be carried out.  1.  Analyze the effects of phosphorylation of EF-1 valyl-tRNA  synthetase an EF-1 by protein kinase C and casein kinase II on  elongation activity and on GDP/GTP exchange activity.    2.  The  ,  , and   subunits  of EF-1 from rabbit have been cloned  and expressed in E. coli.  Site specific mutations of the  individual phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein  kinase II sites will be prepared.  3.  EF-1 will be reconstituted from the subunits expressed in E.  coli and the effects of the site-specific mutations  on activity  will be analyzed.  %%%  Elongation factor 1 (EF-1) is one of two proteins factors involved  in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. EF-1 consists of four  subunits.  EF-1  forms a ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-  tRNA and correctly positions the tRNA on the ribosome.  GTP is the  energy source for this step and is cleaved to GDP and phosphate;  the GDP remains bound to EF-1 and must be exchanged for GTP by EF-  1    for EF-1  to function again.  All four   subunits of EF-1 have been shown to be phosphorylated.   Three different protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate  EF-1; casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and the cell division  control kinase p34cdc2.  The   and   subunits by protein kinase C  and the   subunit by the cell division control kinase.  In these studies, we propose to examine phosphorylation of EF-1 by  casein kinase II and protein kinase C.  The effects of  phosphorylation on elongation activity and on GDP/GTP exchange  activity will be examined.  The subunits of EF-1 from rabbit have  been cloned and expressed in E. coli.  These subunits will be  reconstituted and the effects of phosphorylation on individual  subunits will be determined.  Site specific mutations of the  individual phosphorylation sites will be prepared.  Subunits  containing these mutations will be reconstituted and analyzed and  the effects of the site-specific mutations on activity will be  determined.  ***       .",
