 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310787  Plosser  The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to   foster research and discussion of major policy issues by  economists from academia and policy making institutions.   Economists in universities are often unfamiliar with the  constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the shaping  of policy issues and policies and economists in government are  often less aware of current research and its implications.  A  central purpose of the conference is to provide the interaction  between these groups in order to improve the economic analysis of  policy issues and policy.    The specific aims of the conference are to: 1) develop the          implications of recent research for policy; 2) bring together       economists with different approaches or conclusions to narrow the   differences; and 3) to uncover the analysis used by institutions    that set policies.  The conferences are held semi-annually at the   University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University.  About 40   participants plus faculty and graduate students from the host       institutions are invited to each conference.  Participants from     U.S. and foreign central banks and U.S. and international  agencies attend regularly.  Special care is taken to involve  promising younger scholars.  The paper and formal discussions are  edited and prepared for publication to broaden the impact of the  conference.  ***",
