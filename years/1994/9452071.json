 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have uncovered a disconcerting deficiency in the  ability of physics students to conceptualize motion concepts.  This  problem is most acute with lower level students who usually have  weak mathematical skills.  Conceptual confusion further complicates  the problems.  Too often the end result of this frustration is an  unwillingness to put forth the necessary effort.  Consequently,  introductory physics classes tend to considerably shrink the pool  of disadvantaged students who can enter engineering technology  fields or even become technically literate.  We will immerse the low-level and disadvantaged students in a lab  environment and allow them to learn physics by grappling first with  concepts and then building upon that learning so that they can  better handle algebraic solutions.  This will be done by  implementing microcomputer-based labs and adopting the Workshop  Physics model of Laws to a technical physics environment.  It is  expected that as a result of this project more educationally  disadvantaged students will be able to handle the rigors of physics  and ultimately become accomplished engineering technicians.",
