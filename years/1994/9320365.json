This activity will bring  together highly regarded experts in the field of  polymer solution hydro- and thermodynamics with  the overall objective of building international  networks between Turkish scientists and their  U.S. counterparts.  It is expected that a full-  scale collaborative research proposal will emerge  as a result of this workshop.  This project  supports the participation of approximately 10  polymer scientists from the U.S.    This workshop in materials research fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Turkey to identify critical  variables and methods of analysis in theoretical  calculations.  As Turkish graduate students will  also participate, this activity has an  educational and outreach effort that has the  potential for generating new scientific activity  and new international linkages.  ***",
