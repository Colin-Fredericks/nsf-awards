 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317273  Matthews  A combination of biophysical and genetic engineering methods will  be used to probe the mechanism of folding of dihydrofolate  reductase from Escherichia coli.  Kinetic studies of this process  reveal a variety of partially-folded forms which appear in the  millisecond time range and persist until the appearance of the  native form many seconds or minutes later.  Comparisons of the  results of optical and NMR spectroscopy provide information on the  development of secondary and tertiary structure in these transient  species.  Variations in solution conditions can provide information  into the stabilities of these intermediates and, thereby, the role  of thermodynamics in driving the folding to a successful  conclusion.  Mutational analysis pinpoints those individual amino  acids which play key roles in folding and, in combination with the  kinetic results, the step at which those roles are executed.  Taken  altogether, the information obtained by these various methods and  techniques will enhance our understanding of the mechanism by which  the amino acid sequence directs the rapid and efficient folding to  the native, functional form.  %%%  One of the outstanding problems in biochemistry is the mechanism by  which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs the rapid and  efficient folding to the native conformation.  A combination of  biophysical and genetic engineering methods will be employed to  probe the structures and stabilities of partially-folded forms  which appear during the folding of dihydrofolate reductase.   Underpinning this approach is the rationale that an understanding  of these folding intermediates will serve to elucidate the complex  mechanism involved.  Success should enhance our fundamental  knowledge of biopolymers, increase our understanding of genetic  diseases, and lead to improved methods of production of protein  products by the biotechnology industry.  ***",
