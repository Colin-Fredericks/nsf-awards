 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports an international symposium on Commonalty of  Phenomena in High Performance Composites at Rosemont, Illinois,  October 2-6, 1994.  The objective of this symposium is to examine  the state of our understanding in processing, microstructure, and  properties of high performance composites.  Composite materials  are very diverse:  different matrix materials different  reinforcements, different forms of reinforcements (fibers,  whiskers, particles), interfacial coatings, different  arrangements and distribution of reinforcements in a given  matrix, etc.  Notwithstanding such diversity, there is a myriad  of concepts, processes, methodologies of evaluation and  characterization that cut across different types of composites.  Researchers working in this areas with different composites  (polymeric, metallic, intermetallic and ceramic matrix composites  will attend.  Commonalty of phenomena in different types of  composites, such as the role of the matrix microstructure,  interface, toughening mechanisms, and fracture behavior are  discussed.  The technical papers will be peer-reviewed and  published.    Composite materials have potential applications as structural  components in a wide variety of industrial components.  Their use  has been limited by high cost and processing difficulties.  This  conference provides timely coverage of the latest research  concerning these materials.",
