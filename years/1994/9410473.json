Structural  engineers are increasingly realizing the economic benefits  of using concrete filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns in  low and medium-rise construction, and they expect the demand  for CFTs to grow significantly in the next decade.  Detailed  but efficient numerical simulation, coupled with  experimental research, is the only practical means of  understanding CFT behavior.  Yet only insufficient research  has been conducted on CFTs to date.  The subassemblies to be  studied in this project consist of steel I girders framing  into rectangular CFT beam-columns subjected to either  monotonic or cyclic loading.  The project's objectives are:  1) to develop a practical, three-dimensional, nonlinear,  fiber-based finite element formulation to represent CFT beam  columns; 2) to develop compatible nonlinear models to  represent the girder-to-column connection and panel zone  region; 3) to implement these formulations in an existing  composite frame analysis system, and to calibrate the  formulations against experimental data; and 4) to conduct  comprehensive parametric studies of individual CFT beam-  columns and composite subassemblies.  The parametric studies  will be conducted to provide the data required to improve  the accuracy and scope of current non-seismic and seismic  design specification provisions. This fiber analysis will  also facilitate investigation of new composite CFT systems,  and permit experimentalists to both predict and interpret  their test results.  ***",
