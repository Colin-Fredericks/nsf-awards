This research will focus on two important unsettled issues.  One  is whether cost shocks in the form of significant price increases  of important inputs in the production process together with the  need to hold buffer stocks can explain inventory and production  movements.  Existing work has concentrated on a small set of  manufacturing industries and solely on finished goods  inventories.  This  research focuses on examining production to  order as well as production to stock and investigates the  interaction of order backlogs and inventories.  Further, it will  examine the interaction of movements in inventories of materials  and supplies with those of finished goods.  The second issue to  be analyzed is how do credit market conditions influence  inventory movements.  This is critical for understanding how  monetary policy affects the economy.  The research focuses on  whether borrowing constraints brought about by imperfections in  the credit markets causes certain firms to have limited access to  credit which in turn influences their pattern of inventory  holding behavior.  A data base for individual firms which  combines data on financial condition with that on inventories and  sales will also be constructed and used.  ***",
