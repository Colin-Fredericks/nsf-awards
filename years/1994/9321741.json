Yet, despite increased  worldwide interest in human rights and the regular publication of  profiles of national human rights situations, we still require  more systematic knowledge as to why regimes resort to repression.   This investigation seeks to develop a theory explaining why  regimes use state terrorism against citizens, to develop the data  necessary to test that theory, and to analyze the applicability  of that theory to the repression record of the world's nations  during the last two decades.  The theory will include the factors  previous research has linked to the use of state terrorism, but  it will also include new possible causes of repression not yet  analyzed using empirical data.  The investigators will test the  applicability of the theory for (1) the entire global sample, (2)  different regions and time frames, in order to judge whether the  determinants of repression vary across time, or differ depending  on the region of the world one examines.  This should allow the  researchers to develop better \"causal\" models of repression that  take into account both the direct and indirect effects of the  factors they find to be important in their earlier analyses.   When these analyses are completed, the investigators plan to work  toward a global human rights monitoring system based on a broad  base of empirical information and designed to help them foresee  positive and negative national trends in repression.   ***",
