The meeting is scheduled to be held in May, 1994 in Xian, PRC.  The objective of the symposium is to facilitate the cooperative research on innovative lifeline protection measures against earthquake hazards between researchers in ORC, Japan and the United States to review progress to date with each countries and to form future research directions and to identify opportunities for further collaboration.  During the protocol coordination meeting in March 1993 in Washington, DC, this proposed trilateral Symposium/Workshop has been included as a high priority cooperative activity to be implemented in 1994 by both countries.  Proceedings of the symposium will be published and widely distributed in the research community of lifeline earthquake engineering. ***",
