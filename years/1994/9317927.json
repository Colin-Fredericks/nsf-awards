 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317927  Cronin  Light in nature frequently becomes linearly polarized due to  its interactions with  scattering particles in the atmosphere and under water, and  to its reflection from biological and nonliving dielectric  surfaces. Under some circumstances, these events can produce  light that is almost completely polarized, and partially  linearly polarized light is widely present in nature.  Because the interactions of light that produce partial  linear polarization are complex, the actual pattern of  polarization in any visual field is similarly complicated.  Animals have exploited the polarization of natural light for  a variety of functions, including navigation, orientation,  location of water surfaces, and enhancement of visual  contrast. In fact, it now seems that the great majority of  animal species have visual specializations for the detection  and analysis of partially linearly polarized light, and it  is probable that for many of these species polarization  vision plays a similarly significant role as color vision  plays for species like ourselves. However, the study of  polarization vision has been limited by our inability to  visualize or analyze natural fields of polarization. In this  proposal, we describe a design for a new, imaging  polarimeter that will be capable of providing complete  descriptions of the distribution of polarized light  (e-vector orientation, percent polarization, and intensity)  at single-pixel resolution throughout an extended  visual field. The instrument will be completely portable,  and usable both in terrestrial and aquatic environments. It  will obtain polarization images rapidly and will present the  data on line, using false-color displays to convey the  polarization information in a form intuitively interpretable  by a human observer. All data will be stored in numerical  form for appropriate mathematical analysis, making possible  transformations into the visual systems of animals. We  believe that such an instrument will open new windows into   the sensory worlds of other species, and will have broad  application for studies of biology, perception, and machine  vision.",
