The project aims to  study the catalytic combustion of methane and the formation  and destruction of NO using perovskite-type oxide catalysts.    Natural gas is an important fuel for stationary energy  generation.  However, Nox emissions from natural gas  combustors, particularly those that operate at high  temperatures, are of increasing environmental concern.  Development of a successful NOx control process requires a  fundamental understanding of the principles of NOx formation  and of the chemical interaction of oxygen and nitrogen  species with the catalytic surface.  This project will  combine catalytic combustion and NOx destruction in one  catalyst formulation, in order to explore the role of the  catalytic surface in forming and destroying NOx and to  identify intermediate species.  In addition to classical  techniques of catalysis research, steady state isotopic  transient kinetic analysis will be used to study the  reaction pathways, intermediates, and active catalytic  surface.  IR and NMR spectroscopic studies of adsorbed  species will help identify the intermediates on the catalyst  surface and the reaction paths that form them.  The  Argentine group has expertise in perovskite preparation and  characterization.  The U.S. group has expertise in NMR  characterization and isotopic transient kinetic analysis.  ***",
