 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312308  Higdon         The investigator develops robust spectral boundary integral  algorithms for three-dimensional transport problems in realistic  geometries.  Thw metjhods combine the high-order convergence of  spectral methods with the geometric adaptability of boundary  element methods.  Suitability for parallel computers is a central  aspect of the project.  The methods are applied to the study of  effective transport propertiues of fibrous porous media.       Boundary integral methods convert partial differential  equations, which describe a phenomenon of interest in a region,  into integral equations whose solutions are determined by certain  functions on the boundary of the region.  Spectral methods break  up  the boundary into smaller pieces, on which the functions are  approximated by polynomials of high degree.  Higher-degree  polynomials approximate the functions more accurately.  The use  of  polynomials allows for fast calculation of an approximate  solution.  For problems involving regions of complicated  geometry,  combining these ideas produces a computational method of  significant flexibility and accuracy.  The method is used to  calculate properties of fluid flow and transport in fibrous  porous  media.  Such problems arise throughout the chemical industry and  in  many fundamental biological contexts -- for example, in the pulp  and paper industry, and in the study of fluid circulation in  plants.",
