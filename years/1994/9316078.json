 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316078  Paola       Researchers in various fields have shown that cellular  computational (\"lattice gas\") models can be of great utility in  the study of complex, spatially extended systems that resist  conventional forms of analysis.  In such models the cells of a  lattice interact according to rules based on abstractions of the  physics governing a system.  This approach examines the  interactions between the parts of a system--interactions that  lead to the behavior of the system as a whole--and allows  evaluation of what aspects of the underlying detailed physics are  most import to the overall dynamics.  One main goal of the  proposed research is the development of a cellular-computational  model of braided streams that incorporates the basic physics of  free-surface flow over a movable bead.       To date such models have usually been evaluated only  qualitatively due to a lack of a quantitative method of  comparison between the models and data from real systems.  The  second main goal of this project is to develop new data-analysis  techniques base=d on recent advances in dynamical-systems  mathematics that will facilitate quantitative testing of  cellular-computational methods.  Our approach is to treat  downstream series of measurements in spatially extended systems  like the time series of dynamical systems.  Graphs of spatial  \"attractors\" that characterize the downstream development of  various geometrical variables, and discrete iterative plots that  show how the value of these variables influence the values  further downstream, both quantify the interactions between the  parts of a spatially extended system and characterize the  behavior of a system as a whole.  Analyses such as these, applied  to data from natural systems, laboratory experiments, and  computational models, will provide a more effective quantitative  test of the models that existing techniques.  In the proposed  projects such tests will be applied to the braided-stream model  mentioned above and to existing models  of aeolian and subaqueous  bedforms, using data collected form laboratory and field examples  of all three systems.  ***",
