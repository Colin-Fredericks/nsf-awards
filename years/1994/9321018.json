 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current advances in computer and information technologies suggest  a growing opportunity to combine automated systems and other  management arrangements such as self-managed groups and teams.    This project explores the possibilities of constructing an  automated computerized group decision support system (GDSS) to  help groups manage their decision-making processes more  effectively.  Ideally such a system would provide guidance for a  group, diagnose problems and opportunities and have response and  intervention capabilities.  Current theory and research provide a  body of rules and findings, but no integrative framework or model  to underpin such an effort.  This study develops a formal  representation of group decision-making processes.  Using this  representation, the project identifies cues which discriminate  between effective and ineffective decision-making processes for  different types of decision tasks.  The study also addresses the  impacts of GDSS guidance and response on group decision making  and its comparative advantages to facilitation or other \"human\"  forms of guidance.  Data to develop and test the model come from  laboratory experiments and a large set of recorded team meetings  from two organizations.  An obvious extension of this effort is a  prototype GDSS; however, the more immediate contribution of the  project is basic knowledge about group decision making using an  inclusive theory of group processes which emphasizes key content  and process variables and their interrelations.",
