The principal  challenge that remains is to understand the dynamics of the system  on microscales (<<1RE) and what we shall refer to as mesoscales (  1RE).  Attention need to be focused on those processes that  transfer the energy and momentum of the solar wind through the  magnetized plasma of the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.  In  recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that the dynamics  of the magnetosphere are patchy or bursty in nature.  Intermittency  appears to be a fundamental feature of the interactions.  Although  they are intermittent, the important processes appear to occur on  time scales that are long compared with particle gyroperiods; the  corresponding spatial scales are large compared with particle  gyroradii but small compared with magnetospheric dimensions.   Hence, this proposal focuses on processes that can be characterized  as \"mesoscale\" or intermediate in scale.  The investigators will  use spacecraft data sets and new data analysis approaches to  characterize some of the mesoscale structures including:  coupling  of the solar wind to the magnetosphere through the process of  magnetic reconnection, striations in density and field magnitude  generally interpreted as the signature of saturated mirror mode  waves; the polar cusp which appears to pulsate as successive bursts  of reconnected plasma arrive at the ionosphere; large scale field-  aligned currents (Region 1 currents) that are frequently highly  structured in ways that may arise from bursty reconnection; the  magnetotail plasma flows that are intermittent or bursty; and  magnetic signatures of thin rope-like structures that carry field-  aligned currents along their axes and contain plasma confined by  twisted magnetic fields.    The investigators will develop new models and theory with a close  tie to  observations.  The analysis will begin by using the tools of  MHD, but it is probable that full understanding will require some  aspects of plasma kinetic theory.  The intent is to develop a  framework for the interpretation of existing observations and also  to define needs for additional measurements.    The proposed work addresses processes that appear to be central to  the dynamics of the interacting solar wind/ionosphere/magnetosphere  system, and the new results will illuminate the elemental coupling  processes.  Although the problems addressed are those of the  terrestrial magnetosphere, the results are likely to have wider  significance as they will apply to the interactions of magnetized  plasmas wherever they may be: in other magnetoshperes, in the solar  corona, or in the laboratory.  ***",
