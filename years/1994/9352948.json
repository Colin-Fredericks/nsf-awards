 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352948  Cohen    The University of Utah will conduct a 5-week, commuter, Young  Scholars project in computer science for 40 students entering  grades 11 and 12.  Participants will study computer graphics/  modeling and expert systems.  Nationally known research scientists  will interact with students in both classroom and laboratory  settings.  Participants will learn to use high performance  engineering work stations and will develop expert system tools and  graphical models.  They will also study two and three dimensional  techniques, LISP and rule based programming.  They will then  develop an expert system to control an automatic robot vehicle.    Field trips to robotics and computer aided manufacturing research  labs  as well as to local computer companies will allow  participants to see how these concepts are used in the workplace.  Follow up activities include individual research investigations,    presentations at high schools and additional visits to the  university's Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific  Visualization.  ***",
