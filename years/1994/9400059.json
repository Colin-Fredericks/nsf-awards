Upon acceptance to the program, students gain  familiarity with their respective research groups and  laboratories through part-time work during the spring semester.  The central experience takes place during the summer 2.5-month  full-time work period.  Each student will then continue part-time  involvement during the following fall and spring semesters, with  the aim of completing a scientific publication or report for  presentation at the spring Rochester Symposium for Physics  Students, hosted annually by the Department of Physics and  Astronomy.       The program has been designed to integrate well with other  University initiatives toward increasing and enhancing the  participation of underrepresented groups in science.  Five of the  10 student positions will be reserved for women and minority  students.  As the ethics component of this program, a series of  seminars is planned in which University and outside scholars will  speak on historical and current issues at the intersections  science, gender, race and ethics.  The scope of this series and  the broad interpretation of \"ethics\" is intended have relevance  to a diverse group of student researchers, and to promote  discussion of the tensions, in social as well as scientific  values, that confront scientists in the present era.  ***",
