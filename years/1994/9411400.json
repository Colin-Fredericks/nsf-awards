 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lamberg-Karlovsky    Under the direction of Dr. Lamberg-Karlovsky, Ms. Meridith  Chesson will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Building  on pilot work in 1993, Ms. Chesson and her collaborators will  conduct archaeological excavation at the site of Tell el-Handaquq   South which dates to the Early Bronze Age and which is located in  the Jordan Valley. Research indicates the presence of substantial  fortification walls which encompass the entire 10 hectare site.  At lease seven towers complement the fortification system. Over  the entire site, room blocks are visible on the surface, some  with walls extending for more than 30 meters. Test excavations in  one set of room blocks revealed domestic architecture with  associated ceramic, lithic, faunal and groundstone remains. The  site therefore has the potential to shed significant new light  into household organization during the period when fortified  highly organized villages first emerged in the Near East. Ms.   Chesson will uncover a large domestic area and analyze the range  of cultural materials thus recovered. She will attempt both to  reconstruct the range of social and economic activities which  occurred within household compounds and to determine the nature,  function and importance of the household unit in Early Bronze Age  times.    Archaeologists are interested in the processes which lead to the  rise of cities and complex civilizations. While traditionally,  much attention has been focussed on temples and major public  buildings, both archaeological and ethnographic research indicate  that the household constitutes the basic level at which change  and adaptation occurs. Given clearcut evidence for the presence  of household compounds at Tel el-Handaquq and the ease with which  they can be excavated, the site provides an excellent opportunity  for examination of this issue. The project is also important  because it will both produce data of interest to many  archaeologists and assist in the training of a promising young  sci entist.",
