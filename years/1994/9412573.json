 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Professor Donna Haraway, Mr. Joseph Dumit is  producing an ethnographic study and contemporary history of  positron emission tomography (PET) functional brain imaging.  He is  combining intensive archival work and the collection of primary  oral histories with participant observation of PET centers and  popular culture content analysis.  He is focusing on  interdisciplinary interactions and the ways in which popular  theories of human nature and categories of persons interact with  the experimental production of scientific knowledge.  His thesis is  that functional brain imaging, through PET and other techniques, is  actively helping to redefine our notions of the interdisciplinary  negotiations involved in producing, distributing, and interpreting  functional images of living human brains. This study offers a  unique and much-needed contribution to understanding the  implications of the ongoing \"biologization\" of human nature in  science, medicine, popular theories, and in the legal system.  A  second objective is to make available to other researchers a basic  history of PET scanning by collecting primary sources and documents  and organizing a qualitative index to these materials.  These will  be stored in archives and made available electronically.",
