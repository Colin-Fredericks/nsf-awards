 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bryn Mawr-Spelman Summer Mathematics Program is a six-week summer research  program for freshman and sophomore women from Bryn Mawr, Spelman, and area colleges, with  the goal of identifying and encouraging talented women to pursue careers in the mathematical  sciences.  The program would build on and be modeled after a \"pre-REU\" program that has  taken place at Bryn Mawr for the past three summers and would complement the Scholars         in Mathematics Program at Spelman.  Eight students would conduct research whose primary  focus is experimentation and exploration using the computer; they would be aided by alumnae  mentors who are just beginning graduate programs in the mathematical sciences.  Other features  of the program include weekly roundtable discussions on issues in mathematics research and          teaching, employment as teaching assistants in the students' respective departments during the  academic year, travel to a national AMS-MAA meeting, encouragement to participate in an REU   or summer internship program the following summer, and mentoring and advice regarding the  decision to attend graduate school as well as the choice of an appropriate graduate program.              The Summer Program will be held for the next two years on the campus of Spelman College.   The program builds on and complements existing undergraduate programs at both Bryn Mawr  and Spelman Colleges and enhances an exchange program between the                   colleges  that began in 1984.  It is anticipated that this program would serve as a model for other early  intervention and exchange programs at the undergraduate level.",
