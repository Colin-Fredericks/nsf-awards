Peer groups of students  will be selected from adjoining school districts of Orangeburg ,  Calhoun and Bamberg counties in South Carolina which have a high  concentration of minority students.  The project will be supervised  by four faculty, four undergraduate assistants and a secretary.   The program will comprise of interactive, hands-on experiences and  demonstrations in the applications of science and technology that  will direct the students to questions such as how and why that will  ultimately introduce the learning of basic concepts.  Exploration  of the applications in various areas of science and technology will  serve as a springboard to instructions in areas such as engineering  and physics, basic mathematics (algebra and geometry) and problem  solving skills essential foundation for success in the core courses  required for science and technology programs; use of computers,  microbiology, chemistry, and improving general academic skills such  as note-taking,oral and written communications.  The methodology  been tired here is to start from the applications that interest the  students and then introduce the concepts later.  To complement the  classroom demonstration and instructions, field trips that will  also include hand-on activities will be taken to expose the  students to professionals in the various fields so that the  students can relate classroom study to careers and appreciate that  science is what we do in real life and not just what we study only  in the classroom.  Also, the participants will be encourage through  career awareness g roup discussions and demonstrations involving  minority professionals to pursue studies leading to careers in  science and technology.  The academic year follow-up component will  include school visitations by program faculty to assist in science  demonstrations and a campus weekend demonstrations and  presentations involving the participants and their peers.",
