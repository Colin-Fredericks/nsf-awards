These  standards will, in turn, lead to an industry-guided manufacturing  technology core curriculum.  The curriculum will begin in high  schools and will feed into a 2+2 Tech Prep post-secondary community  college program.  A workplace-based internship will also be an  integral part of the curriculum.  This comprehensive, innovative  proposal has strong support from both labor unions and industry.   It will help bridge the gap between secondary school technical  education and the requirements of the industrial workforce.",
