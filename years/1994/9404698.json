In addition, the synthesis of  ribosomal components is coordinated and balanced with the production of many other cell  constituents. The regulation of ribosome synthesis also impacts on virtually every other  cellular component, responding to regulatory networks which control cell growth,  proliferation, and development.  Modern genetic and biochemical methodologies have greatly increased our knowledge about many aspects  of ribosome biogenesis. These include the eukaryotic rRNA gene transcription machinery, rRNA  maturation and an emerging family of nucleolar snRNAs that likely are involved in rRNA processing  and/or ribosome assembly. Recent studies are also revealing unexpected alternative roles for ribosomal  proteins outside of the ribosome and the unexpected nucleolar localization of other known proteins. Thus,  molecular mechanisms that govern ribosome biogenesis are being elucidated, but many key elements of  how this regulation occurs and how these processes are integrated remain largely uncharacterized.  The objective of the \"Ribosome Synthesis\" meeting is to bring together researchers working on these  various aspects of ribosome synthesis and nucleolar function in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  Participation of and presentations by graduate students, postdocs, and young independent investigators will  be encouraged.  The funds requested in this proposal will enable a greater number of these individuals  to attend, especially young investigators who have not yet received independent funding.  We hope that  the integration of all aspects of ribosome synthesis will encourage the exchange of ideas, the focusing of  models, and in general the advance of the field.  %%%   Ribosome synthesis involves the regulation of numerous processes, encompass1ng transcr iption by all  three RNA polymerases, RNA processing, translation, RNA-protein interaction, and nucleo-cytoplasmic  transport.
