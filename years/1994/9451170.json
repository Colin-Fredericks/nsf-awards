The project will implement a new approach to  laboratory instruction in Horticulture 301 (Plant Physiology).  Its  goal is to achieve a better balance between presenting factual  content and allowing students to become personally engaged in the  process of scientific inquiry. The proposal seeks funds for an  array of instruments, including a gas chromatograph, a  photosynthesis measurement system, spectrophotometers,  psychrometers, electrophoresis equipment, centrifuges, incubators  and plant growth chambers. These devices will be used in a  two-stage approach to instruction. First, a \"core\" of nine lab  experiments will engage students in structured studies of plant  physiology and will teach the principles of modern techniques of  measurement. Second, after students have mastered a body of  technical skills, they will be presented with several  demonstrations of plant responses, where the underlying cause of  the phenomenon is not evident. Working in small groups, students  will observe the response, consider possible explanations and  hypothesize on the underlying mechanisms. After study plans have  been approved, students will proceed to investigate their problem.  Various approaches and outcomes will be possible, but the essence  of the structure is that it permits open-ended inquiry, where  initial results are explained, new hypotheses are constructed and  new experiments are designed.",
