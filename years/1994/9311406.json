 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311406  Bramble       The investigator and his colleague study new techniques and  methods of analysis of behavior in existing approximation methods,  and introduce and analyze new algorithms for the numerical  approximation of various problems.  Specific areas to be  considered include:  i) Preconditioned iterative methods for fast solution of resulting  algebraic equations.    ii) Finite element methods in domains with curved boundaries and  interfaces.    iii) Local behavior of finite element methods in differential and  integral equation problems with singularities.    iv) Superconvergence phenomena in differential and integral  equations.    Numerical experimentation and examples will play important roles  in the discovery and elucidation of various numerical methods.  Of  course, practical application is a motivating factor for the  problems studied here.  One of the principal aims of the studies  proposed is to develop a deeper understanding of many existing  methods, improve them or develop new ways of treating old and new  problems.  This kind of understanding is central to the design of  accurate and efficient algorithms for the use in present and  future computer environments.         The investigators are researching various questions  concerning the practical solution of problems of interest in  engineering and science.  For example, such problems give rise to  extremely large sets of equations and the investigators study  mathematical questions related to computing their solutions.  One  aim is to construct methods that are faster and more accurate than  existing ones.  A second aim is to invent and study techniques for  the solution of problems heretofore beyond the scope of even the  most powerful computers.  Some areas of application in which the  above mentioned studies are very important are Structural  Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Groundwater flow and Electromagnetic  theory.",
