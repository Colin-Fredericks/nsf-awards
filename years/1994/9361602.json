 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361602  Robinson    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the general area of analytical  chemical instrumentation and specifically in the subfield of thermal detectors. Pyroelectric  thermal detectors traditionally are based on inorganic ferroelectric single crystals or ferroelectric  organic polymer films which are oriented in an electric field. In this Phase I study pyroelectric  films will be prepared by fluorination of self assembled monolayers (SAM) of long chain  alkylthiols on gold surfaces. Dipolar SAMs are expected to be stable, robust and pyroelectric.  Pyroelectric coefficients and figures of merit will be determined as a function of alkylthiol chain  length and degree of fluorination. If SAMs can be made with pyroelectric properties better than  currently used materials, Phase II studies  will be directed towards fabricating a prototype  pyroelectric device.  %%%  Pyroelectric detectors based on fluorinated SAMs are expected to be compact, low cost, and  capable of being integrated with an amplifier onto a single silicon chip and operated at room  temperature. The low thermal mass and low dielectric constant of a free-standing monolayer  should make its sensitivity and response time better than current polymer pyroelectric materials.  ***",
