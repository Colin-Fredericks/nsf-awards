 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321461  Caporael  Most behavioral, social and biological science theories use  individuals as the basic unit of analysis and assume these units to  be more or less rationally self-interested.  The objective of Dr.  Caporael in this research is to challenge the adequacy of that  focus and assumption.  She is developing an hypothesis that humans  are adapted for small group living, resulting in adaptive  specializations for sociality that can be and have been extended  for constructing, identifying and solving problems in novel  domains.  These domains include those associated with large-scale  social organization and nonsocial objects.  This perspective  predicts a tension between social construction of knowledge, which  facilitates coordination within groups, and the negotiation of the  habitat, which requires some correspondence with reality.  In this  research, Dr. Caporael is synthesizing theory and data in  evolutionary biology, psychology, and anthropology to develop a  general theory of sociality drawing on evidence for correspondences  between group configuration and psychological functioning.   Sociality theory provides a plausible reinterpretation of  traditional topics in human evolution, as well as a plausible  interpretation for folk psychology and evolutionary folk  psychology.  Dr. Caporael is also applying the theory to familiar  topics (the Turing test, technological innovation, and scientific  organization) in Science, Technology and Society (STS) research.   The results of this study should be of great interest to  psychologists, evolutionary scientists and STS researchers.  ***",
