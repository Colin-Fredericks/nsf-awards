The project will  identify a purposive sample of neighborhoods which experienced  concentrated damage from the earthquake and explore the process  of recovery by examining existing data on damaged structures and  conducting personal interviews with both probability and  nonprobability samples of key participants in the recovery  process including tenants, apartment and commercial building  owners, housing officials, and officials from relevant federal  agencies.  The study will contribute to a better understanding of  the revival of urban neighborhoods following a major urban  disaster and suggest how federal and other government disaster  recovery and mitigation policies might be rewritten to facilitate  the retention of extensively damaged neighborhoods by removing  the unintended consequences accompanying policy implementation.  ***",
