To meet this need, the department will initiate a  senior-level undergraduate course in computational chemistry (CHM  410), which is designed to teach both basic principles and methods,  and, in some depth, how to use computational techniques to solve  chemical problems. Techniques to be addressed in the course include  molecular mechanics, semi-empirical, and ab initio methods, as well  as how to analyze a chemical problem so as to choose the  computational method best suited to an efficient solution given the  constraints of local computational power and clock time. To  successfully initiate such a course, two computer workstations  (Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo workstations or equivalent) and an  up-grade in memory to an existing Indigo workstation will be  purchased. In addition, a site license for the X-windows  modification of the program Spartan (which includes molecular  mechanics, semi-empirical, and ab initio modules) so as to allow  the efficient use of the workstations through the existing  College-funded computer laboratory, will also be obtained.",
