 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353445  Murray    Teams of elementary and secondary school teachers participate in  a series of Earthkeeping programs, in which the process of  ecological restoration is utilized to teach prairie ecology,  natural and cultural history.  The program is conducted at the  University of Wisconsin - Madison Arboretum over a period of two  years per group of teachers.  Two groups of teachers (96 teachers  total) attend two 2-week workshops, meetings and conferences, and  field days at the Arboretum with school classes.    In the initial 2-week summer workshop, 16 teachers (teams of 2  teachers each from 8 schools) conduct hands-on ecological  restoration activities -- planning, site analysis and  preparation, planting and management.  Teachers learn about the  ecology, cultural and natural history of prairies as they learn  how to reconstruct this biological community.  They also  experience activities suitable for use in the classroom and have  time to develop curriculum plans.    During the subsequent school year teachers and their students  begin to plan and plant a prairie at their school.  The 16  teachers return to the Arboretum the second summer with  additional teachers from their respective schools (4 associate  teachers per school on average).  Each team of master teachers  teach their colleagues and work with these associates to further  develop curriculum plans and activities.  The expanded teams of  master and associate teachers offer inservice sessions on prairie  ecology and prairie restoration for other teachers at their  respective schools or districts.  ***",
