 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319595  Goodenough       The research proposed would provide detailed molecular  understanding of the mechanisms of uniparental inheritance of  organelle DNA in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  Uniparental  inheritance of the plastid genome in C. reinhardtii involved two  events:  protection of the chromosome contributed to the zygote  by the mating-type plus (mt+) gamete, and nuclease destruction of  the unprotected mt- chromosome in the zygote.  A cloned gene  cluster, ezy-1 linked to both mt loci, has been shown by this lab  to be involved in destruction.  Experiments using native and/or  recombinant ezy-1 protein are designed to learn whether ezy-1  functions as the nuclease or as an activator of nuclease  activity.  Genetic and biochemical experiments will determine  whether protection is conferred directly on the mt+ chloroplast  DNA (e.g. via methylation) or via protein(s) that associate with  this DNA.  And finally, insertional mutant strains defective in  protection will be sought and analyzed.  %%%  Eukaryotic organisms are composed of cells that contain  organelles.  Of these, mitochondria (animals and plants) and  chloroplast (plants only) contain their own complements of DNA,  derived from their evolutionary origin as free-living bacteria.   During sexual reproduction, organelle DNA is invariably  transmitted to offspring via only one parent, usually via the  maternal egg.  In the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas, both  parental gametes contribute equal amounts of organelle DNA to the  zygote, but one set is then destroyed.  The lab has cloned a gene  whose protein product appears to participate in this selective  degradation of chloroplast DNA.  The project proposes to test  this inference via genetic, molecular, and cell biology  experiments, the goal being to learn how one parental set of DNA  is destroyed and the other is preserved within a single cell.  ***",
