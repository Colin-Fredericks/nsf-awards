 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416759  Sozen  This project conducts a detailed evaluation of shear  failures observed in bridge piers during the Northridge  Earthquake.  The primary objective of this study is to  develop design and strengthening criteria for similar  structures in regions of low to moderate seismicity.    It is well known that many aspects of the shear strength of  reinforced concrete elements are poorly understood.  Applicability of existing design criteria are limited to  the ranges of the variables involved in available  experience and experiments.  A reinterpretation of the  available procedures and experimental data for shear  strength are needed in the light of both positive and  negative experiences during the Northridge event.  Such a  study is needed primarily because of observations that  probable maximum unit shear stresses sustained by bridge  piers failing in shear during the Northridge Earthquake  were decisively less than measured unit shear strengths of  comparable test specimens reported in the literature.    Old as well as new hypotheses for shear strength will be  evaluated in the light of (a) existing experimental data  and (b) data from damaged and undamaged piers during the  Northridge  event.  A set of design criteria applicable to similar  structures in regions of low to moderate seismicity will be  assembled on the results of this study.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
