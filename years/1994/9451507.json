 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451507  Gries  This instructional computer laboratory will be used for a novel  sequence of courses that starts with an introductory programming  course targeted at students having no previous experience in  programming. The laboratory will be used to teach this programming  course in an interactive environment.  Another point in the  sequence will be a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering course in  system dynamics. This is an upper-level course for majors. New  equipment is needed that will enable these students to do  interesting work with dynamic simulation. The existence of a  teaching laboratory will be important when instructing the students  in the use of their software.  This sequence is the result of ideas  from the faculty in the two departments. They plan to exploit the  joint use of the facility to build bridges between the introductory  computer science courses and upper-level courses in engineering and  science. Using the systems dynamics course as a target, they will  try to facilitate a student's progress from this introductory  programming course, to our more challenging introductory course for  students with a knowledge of calculus, and finally to the systems  dynamics and other upper-level engineering courses. This joint  effort will be incorporated into the development of a text for the  programming course.  The laboratory will have a significant impact  locally at Cornell. The programming text produced should help other  colleges and universities to institute a similar approach. The  enrichments to the course and text achieved through work with  Mechanical Engineering will make the text quite different from  anything now available.",
