 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321127  Naik    Technical abstract:  The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) method will  be used to probe the magnetic anisotropies of epitaxial magnetic  multilayered films.  <100> oriented Ni-Cu and Co-Cu superlattices  will be grown using a molecular beam deposition system on a Cu  (100) seed layer deposited on hydrogen terminated Si (100)  substrates.  Reflection high energy electron diffraction and x-ray  diffraction studies will be used to determine the preferred  orientation, strains and periodicity of the superlattice.   Evolution of FMR as a function of the number of periods and also as  a function of the thickness of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers  will be studied to seek an insight into the origin of multiple  resonances observed in the multilayered structures.    Non-technical abstract:  There is much interest in the growth and  study of magnetic multilayered films due to their potential for  application in magnetic recording and reading (conventional and  magneto-optic) and also in sensor devices (magnetoresistive and  magnetostrictive).  Magnetic multilayered structures provide more  freedom to tailor desirable magnetic properties.  The proposed  research deals with the fabrication of single crystal magnetic  multilayers of Ni-Cu and Co-Cu and study of their magnetic  properties.  Magnetic properties of the superlattices will be  studied as function of the thickness of the magnetic and  nonmagnetic layers as well as the number of their repetitions.  ***",
