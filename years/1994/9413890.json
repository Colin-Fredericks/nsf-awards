 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Clark - 9413890    The goal of this research is to develop a working understanding of microwave interactions with materials that will enable targeted industrial operations to apply microwave technologies to product manufacturing.  The system to be studied will be that of sol-gel-derived silica.  A silicon alkoxide precursor mixed with water and alcohol will undergo reactions under the influence of both microwave and conventional heating techniques.  Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIRS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as well as a new technique for measuring the effects of microwave irradiation during processing -- a cavity ring-down apparatus outfitted with a microwave applicator -- the effects of microwave energy and conventional heating on molecular bond formation/dissociation of each individual component of the sol and the sol itself will be examined.  Dielectric property measurements will be performed on the sol, gel and solid components at microwave frequencies (and temperatures) over which the reactions will take place.  This approach will enable a correlation between dielectric properties, the molecular/phase changes, reaction extent and the resultant properties of the chemicals/materials during the various stages of microwave processing.    The silica system will be used because: (1) it is a well-studied material system that will allow for comparison with current standards and targeted properties; (2) it will allow for evaluation of the microwave/material interactions from liquid through solid states; and (3) it is an industrially important material for applications ranging from optical lenses and fibers to high-temperature, corrosion-resistant windows.",
