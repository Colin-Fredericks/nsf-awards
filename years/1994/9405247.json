Paleoclimatic changes can be analyzed through examination of the  responses of geomorphic systems, records of which are preserved  in stratigraphic records and other characteristics of different  landforms.  This doctoral dissertation research project will  examine environmental change during the late Quaternary Period in  the Salt Basin of western Texas.  Deposits from a number of  different sites in and near playa basins that once were lakebeds  will be gathered and analyzed using a variety of dating  procedures.  Stratigraphic sections beneath the floor of the  playa will be examined to identify materials contained within  lake sediments, thereby providing evidence of short-term climatic  shifts.  Peripheral sections beside the playas contain evidence  of aeolian activity in gypsum dune deposits.  Other features  along the playa margin, such as spits and beach ridges, permit  interpretation of deep-water lacustrine processes.  Further away  from the playas, landforms produced by wind and running water  record variability of formative environments.  Among the research  techniques that will be used to analyze materials derived from  sample sites are thermoluminescence and optically simulated  luminescence (TL/OSL) dating, radiocarbon dating, and stable  isotope rate analysis.       This research will provide valuable new insights about the  chronology of climate and landscape change in the southern Great  Plains.  In doing so, it will further the comprehensive picture  of environmental change in North America in the wake of the last  major glaciation, thereby advancing understandings of Earth  system history, a major facet of the U.S. Global Change Research  Program.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement award, this  award also will pr ovide support to enable a promising student to  establish a strong independent research career.",
