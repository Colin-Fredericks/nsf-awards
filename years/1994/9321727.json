The  Japanese portion of the project is supported by  the Research Development Corporation of Japan  (JRDC).  The principal investigators are James  L. Merz, Center Director, and Professor  Hiroyuki Sakaki, University of Tokyo.    Through an exchange of personnel, specifically  postdoctoral fellows and senior investigators,  the two groups will carry out research in four  different but related experimental areas, with  an effort in fundamental theory of quantum  transitions overlaying these four areas:  (1)  optical and far infrared transitions in quantum  wells, quantum wires, and other nanostructures,  and their infrared and photo-conductive  responses; (2) relaxation and scattering  processes involving electrons and/or holes,  both within the quantum states and between  them; (3) periodic alloys and their  fluctuations of alloy composition in quantum  wells, including their effect on optical and  electronic transitions; and (4) advanced growth  and processing technology and material science  for novel nanostructure formation, with  emphasis on the in-situ study of grown  structures and surfaces to expand the  controllability of the perfection of  nanostructures.  It is expected that the  project will generate considerable new and  important information concerning both the  growth process and the nature of the surfaces  that result from this growth process.  ***",
