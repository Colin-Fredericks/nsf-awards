 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wissmar  Streams, lakes, and wetlands are strongly influenced by the landscapes they drain.  They receive surface and subsurface waters, allochthonous carbon, sediments, nutrients, and pollutants.  The intensity of this landscape influence differs for large and small streams, lakes, or wetlands due to differences in perimeter to area ratios.  We will develop a model of landscape interactions called landscape allometry, and test this concept by examining the relationship between slough size and the amount of allochthonous insect and plant flotsam exported from the sloughs.  We will also dissect sloughs of various sizes to quantify detrital insect and plant fluxes from slough sections spanning a range of sizes; integrate the results over the entire slough; and compare integrated results with whole slough measurements.  We anticipate that landscape allometry will have broad application to other ecosystems, that it will contribute to the application of fractal geometry theory to ecology, and that it could influence management of habitats of smaller size by placing their landscape functions and greater vulnerability to disturbance into clearer perspective.  Our choice of study system also contributes to the understanding of the ecology of estuarine habitats, which are used by juvenile salmon as feeding sites during their outmigration to the ocean.",
