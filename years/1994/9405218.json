These enzymes carry out two   processes fundamental to all living systems. First, the heme group  activates either O2 or H2O2 and stores the oxidizing equivalents of  the oxygen or peroxide in the active site. Second, the oxidizing   equivalents now stored at the heme active center are used to  oxidize other molecules. These other molecules can be another  redox protein or an organic molecule. Our goal is to compare  several crystal structures of different heme enzymes in order to  understand how these enzymes catalyze cleavage of the peroxide or  O2 O-O bond. Because the heme group and its activated  oxointermediates exhibit distinct spectral properties, it is  possible to correlate the crystal structure information with the  spectral data to obtain a deeper insight into the precise mechanism  of oxygen activation and the structure of the resulting activated  intermediate. The second part of the reaction involves oxidation of  substrate by the enzyme. If the substrate is another protein, the  problem becomes one of protein-protein recognition and long-range  electron transfer through proteins. Small molecule oxidation also  involves electron transfer from the substrate to the enzyme but  in this case, we expect the enzyme to possess a more conventional  small molecule binding pocket which specifically recognizes the  substrate. Comparative crystal structure information is essential  to understand the diversity of reactions and substrates used by  various peroxidases and oxygenases.  %%%  Peroxidases and oxidases also are attracting increasing attention  by the biotechnology community. These enzymes are, in some cases,  able to oxidize toxic pollutants such as chlorinated biphenyls. One  of the more important advances in this area was our recent  structure determination of lignin peroxidases supported by NSF.  Lignin perox idase is secreted by certain fungi that are able to  degrade lignin, a complex aromatic polymer that provides the outer  coating around cellulose in woody plants. Lignin is the second most  abundant polymer on earth and presents a major problem in the paper  pulp industry since lignin degradation requires rather harsh  chemical treatments. There is considerable interest in developing  less harsh biological processes for lignin degradation. Moreover,  because of the unusual reactivity of lignin peroxidase, there is  optimism that this peroxidase can be utilized for the degradation  of toxic pollutants. Our structural work has provided the basis for  understanding how such reactions occur. Of particular importance  are recent developments in our ability to clone and overexpress  heme enzymes. This opens the way for using protein engineering to  alter the active sites of peroxidases and other heme enzymes in  order to optimize their use for degrading molecules of interest  such as toxic pollutants. The crystal structure data is essential  for such an undertaking. It also should be emphasized that over the  years, NSF has been the primary means of support for heme enzyme  crystallography.  The first two heme enzyme crystal structures  solved were cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome P450, both of  which were solved in our lab with support provided by NSF.  These  two structures alone have provided the basis for research in dozens  of other labs. and countless spin-off projects.  NSF also supported  solution of the lignin peroxidase structure.  Hence, it is not an  understatement to claim that NSF is directly responsible for a  majority of what we know today about heme enzyme structure and  function and it is very likely that there will be significant and  important practical applications of this work in the near future.   ***",
