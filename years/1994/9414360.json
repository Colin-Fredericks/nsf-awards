Both countries are exposed to the  consequences of natural disasters, and through research both have  made great strides in the mitigation of these effects.  For  several decades the two nations have conducted joint research  activities of which three workshops on multiple hazards  mitigation were of great interest and benefit to the natural  hazards research community.  The objectives of the fourth meeting  are:  to discuss the lessons learned from recent natural  disasters; to assess the currents state of knowledge; to identify  new research areas of common interest; to evaluate the decade-  long Taiwan's multiple hazard mitigation project; and to continue  building the bilateral relationship existing between the academic  and practicing communities.  The benefits from these activities  are the reduction in losses, injuries and damages, due to natural  hazards.  ***",
