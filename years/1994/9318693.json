Substantial research activities are underway to study  harmonics from a systems point of view, as well as at device  levels.  To meet the need for exchange of ideas among researchers  in this area, the International Conference on Harmonics in Power  System, ICHPS was established in 1984.  ICHPS is a biennial  conference.  The sixth conference is scheduled for September 21-  23, 1994 in Bologna, Italy.  This block travel grant will help  young faculty and established researchers from the United States  to exchange ideas and present results.  ***",
