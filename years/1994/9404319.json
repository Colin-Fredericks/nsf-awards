 "awd_abstract_narration": "A low-temperature and high-magnetic field facility is  requested for combination with existing optical and quasi-  optical measurement configurations to enable the exploration  of electrodynamics of various novel electron states of  solids. The facility is a He3 system combined with a 9T  magnetic field which is provided by a split ring magnet. A  conventional He3 system will be employed (together with  coaxial cable and wave guide access configuration) in the  radio to millimeter wave spectral range. In addition,  optical access (provided by specially designed optical  windows) will be provided for spectrometers operating at  submillimeter wave to infrared frequencies. The facility  will be used to measure the frequency dependent complex  conductivity under circumstances when the energy related to  the applied ac field hw , the thermal energy kT and the  energy associated with the magnetic field  BH can be varied  over substantial ranges. Experiments will be conducted on  interacting electron systems mainly in their broken symmetry  ground states.  %%%  This research has developed a variety of measurement  techniques which allow the exploration of electrodynamics of  solids in an extremely broad spectral range, from audio to  infrared frequencies. In this proposal, funds are requested  to acquire a low-temperature and high-magnetic field  facility in order to expand measurement in region and to a  host of phenomenon that cannot be studied previously for  metals. These facilities are used to study the properties of  various novel materials having",
