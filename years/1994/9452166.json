 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452166  Nelson  Given the increasing relevance of distributed network environments  and the social needs they serve, distributed programming skills  should become part of the undergraduate computer science  curriculum. This proposal requests hardware to form a dedicated  laboratory for distributed computing, consisting of ten networked  workstations. This will support the addition of three courses in  the regular curriculum, Computer Networks and Concurrency Control  and Recovery, and a senior level projects course. Because students  will require system level access to the equipment, this laboratory  must be isolable through a bridge from a larger departmental and  campus network to which it will be connected.  The class Computer  Networks will concentrate on low-level network programming, often  at the packet level. The Concurrency Control and Recovery will  address distributed programming at a higher level by concentrating  on the implementation of algorithms from the distributed database  tradition. The third class will be a senior projects course in  which students realize novel network services typically requiring  the execution of remote cooperating clients.",
