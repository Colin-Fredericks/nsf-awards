 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass spectrometry has become one of the most powerful  tools for measuring molecular weights of peptides and  proteins, and for determining their primary structures. Thus  mass spectrometry is of central importance to biotechnology,  biochemistry, and biological research. Fourier transform  mass spectrometry is emerging as the premier high-  performance mass spectrometer for the analysis of biological  compounds. This proposal seeks funding to advance the  development of several high-performance capabilities of  Fourier transform mass spectrometry for peptide and protein  analysis, and to make these readily available in a  commercial mass spectrometer. This project will be a joint  effort between the P.I. and Bruker Instruments, Inc., a  manufacturer of a commercial Fourier transform mass  spectrometer. The requested funds will be used to purchase a  Fourier transform mass spectrometer from Bruker Instruments.  Hardware, software, and technique developments will be  pursued jointly by the P.I. and Bruker Instruments. In  addition to the development efforts, this instrument will  also be used to support the research and training programs  of members of the Center for Metalloenzyme Studies, a NSF  supported Research Training Group at the University of  Georgia.",
