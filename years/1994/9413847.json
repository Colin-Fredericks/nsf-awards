The design will  optimize resolution, compactness, and allow for easy changes  of echelle grating/cross disperser combinations, and form  direct mode (single objects) to fiber mode (multiple objects  ).  The capabilities and versatility of this instrument will  significantly enhance the research capabilities of the  Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) Observatory and make the 2.4  telescope competitive with far larger telescopes for certain  observational problems.    Detailed studies in a  number of areas of fundamental  astronomical importance will be undertaken by the large  community of MDM astronomers.  These projects include; a)  studies of the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies in the  Local Group and beyond, b) detailed measurements of the  temporal evolution of key elements in disk and halo stars,  c) direct measurements of the kinematics of gas in the halos  of our Galaxy and external spirals, d) observations of the  detailed kinematical properties of supernova and nova shells  in our Galaxy and in external systems, e) definitive studies  of the kinematics of star clusters including the first  direct attempts to measure the degree of equipartition in  clusters, f) systematically monitoring stars in open and  globular clusters to search for spectroscopic binaries, g)  measurements of the distance to the Galactic Center via  precise kinematics observations of Cepheids along the solar  circle, and h) probing the physical conditions and chemical  composition of the diffuse interstellar medium in our  Galaxy.  The variety of topics underscores the scientific  community that will use the new spectrograph and the  versatility of the instrument itself.  ***",
