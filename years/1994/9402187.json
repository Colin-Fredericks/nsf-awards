 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402187  Khalil  It is proposed to conduct research on the design of robust output  feedback control of a class of nonlinear systems.  The class of  systems to be considered is the class of input-output  linearizable systems, which arise in many applications such as  robotics manipulators, aircraft control, and electric machines.   The design procedure starts with the design of a robust state  feedback control followed by the design of a robust observer to  recover robustness achieved with state feedback.  The performance  of such observers are usually hindered by difficulties due to  measurement noise and excessively large transient response.  A  recent result by the principal investigator has show that, for  the special case of fully linearizable systems, the undesirable  transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback  control to be globally bounded.  This proposal aims at developing  a comprehensive theory for the design of globally bounded output  feedback controllers.  Problems to be investigated include  tracking, disturbance rejection, servomechanisms, robustness,  comparison of various state estimation schemes, and study of the  effect of measurement noise.  ***",
