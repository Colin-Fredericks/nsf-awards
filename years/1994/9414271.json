 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414271  Roth  Rutgers University    New knowledge about the structures and reactions of organic radical cations will be provided as well as new insights into light-induced electron transfer reactions. A variety of radical cations will be generated in a range of media, including fluid solutions, frozen glasses, and solid supports (e.g., zeolites) by methods that include photo-induced electron transfer, chemical oxidation, and radiolysis. Their structures will be characterized by spectroscopic methods which include optical spectroscopy, ESR, and CIDNP. The experiments will supplemented by ab initio molecular orbital calculations.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Heinz D. Roth at Rutgers University. Radical cations that will be studied by Professor Roth are reactive molecules that carry one unit of positive charge and one electron that is not paired with another electron. Radical cations may under go reaction either at the unpaired electron site or at the site of positive charge. These reactions as well as others will be addressed in this research. In addition, the structures of radical cations will be determined by modern spectroscopic techniques in various environments. Theoretical calculations will supplement the experiments.",
