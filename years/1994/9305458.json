The activated receptors undergo autophosphorylation,  then phosphorylate tyrosine residues of other regulatory proteins.   Recent studies indicate that non-catalytic src-homology 2 (SH2)  domains mediate these interactions by binding to phosphotyrosine  residues located within specific amino acid sequences.  The focus  of this research is the possible role in cellular signal  transduction for Annexin I, a substrate for the EGF receptor/kinase  whose biological function is unknown.  The proposed function of  tyrosine-phosphorylation of Annexin I is to promote binding to the  SH2 domain of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-1 and perhaps other  regulatory proteins.  The model is supported by the following:  1)  the amino acid sequence around the phosphorylation site of Annexin  I matches the consensus sequence of the site to which the SH2  domain of PLC-gamma-1 is known to bind; and 2) preliminary  experiments showed that Annexin I phosphorylated on tyr-21 (P-tyr-  Annexin I) by the EGF receptor/kinase bound with high affinity to  a fusion protein containing SH2 and SH3 domains from PLC-gamma-1.   Hypothetical functions of P-tyr-Annexin I binding to regulatory  proteins include modulation of their catalytic activity or  shuttling to the plasma membrane via the calcium-dependent  phospholipid binding activity of Annexin I.  Planned experiments  will characterize the SH2/SH3 binding properties of Annexin I in  vitro.  The binding of 32P-labelled P-tyr-Annexin I to fusion  proteins containing SH2 and/or SH3 domains from PLC-gamma-1 and  other regulatory proteins will be measured to delineate the regions  which contain the binding sites, the dissociation constants of the  interactions and binding specificities will be determined.  In  vitro assays will determine whether P-tyr-Annexin I binding to PLC-  gamma-1 modulates its catalytic activity and wh ether binding to  PLC-gamma-1 changes the calcium and phospholipid binding  characteristics of P-tyr-Annexin I.  %%%  Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulate cell  replication by binding to transmembrane receptors.  The activated  receptors then act as enzymes to add phosphate groups, first to  themselves, and then to specific amino acids of other regulatory  proteins.  The focus of this research is the possible role in  cellular signal transduction for \"Annexin I\", a member of a family  of calcium-binding proteins which is also a target for addition of  phosphate group by the EGF receptor enzyme.  The calcium binding  Annexins have been identified in many cell types, and it has been  widely supposed that they are important cellular regulatory  molecules, but until now, no one has obtained convincing evidence  as to their real physiological function.  The preliminary results  on which this project is based provide the first solid clue as to  a biological function of Annexin I.  This research, thus, will help  to define the function of this class of regulatory molecules and  the interaction of regulatory proteins involved in the signal  transduction pathway by which epidermal growth factor stimulates  cell division.***",
