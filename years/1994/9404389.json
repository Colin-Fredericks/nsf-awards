 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404389  Dunster       Uniform asymptotic approximations are to be derived for a  number of special functions, which will be more general than  previous results and include explicit error bounds. The  functions to be studied will include Mathieu, Legendre,  Jacobi, and spheroidal functions, for the cases where the  parameters or the independent variables are too large. The  general theory of a coalescing turning point and simple pole  as developed by the principal; investigator will be applied  to these functions. In the case of Mathieu functions the  principal investigator will extend the asymptotic results  that were obtained earlier to larger parameter regimes, and  to use these to investigate the distribution of the  eigenvalues. In addition, it is proposed to derive new  representations for solutions of second-order linear  differential equations with a large parameter, and the  Riemann zeta function of large argument, using convergent  factorial series and exponentially-improved asymptotic  expansions.       The expansion of special functions and their properties  plays an important role in explicit solutions of many of the  equations of applied mathematics.  This project deals with  asymptotic approximation that includes error bounds. Error  bounds are especially useful in numerical computations.  Potential applications of these new results include  tunneling in wave physics, elasticity, high-frequency  scattering, and various problems in quantum mechanics.  ***",
