 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404199  Afraimovich/Chow    Depending on parameters, real systems with dissipation and energy  pumping can manifest slow nonessential changes as well as abrupt  jumps  in their dynamical behavior.  In order to explain, describe, and  predict phenomena of such a kind in a specific applied system,  people  need to know a mathematical classification of transitions from  simple  to complex behavior and a theory of evolution of stationary  (established) motions during the changes of parameters.  The  theory of  nonlocal bifurcations of strange attractors is an adequate  mathematical tool to study changes in conduct of dissipative  systems  which allows one to control and, in principal, to govern their  behavior.  Stationary motions (regimes) of real systems  correspond to  attractors in their mathematical models.  Simple regimes  correspond to  simple attractors while the complex ones correspond to so called  strange attractors.  Mathematical image of the onset to complex  behavior is a bifurcation of a rising of a strange attractor;  mathematical image of evolution of complex behavior is a  scenarium (or  a chain of bifurcations) of evolution of a strange attractor.  In  the  proposed work we are going to study bifurcations leading to  appearance  of strange attractors and to describe scenaria of their  evolution.  We  propose to apply the developed mathematical technique to such  systems  as coupled oscillators, laser systems, circuit systems of  electrical  engineering and others.   In particular, we want to study the  problem  of stochastic synchronization, i.e., similar behavior of  dissipatively  coupled dissipative individual subsystems.  The phenomenon of  stochastic synchronization is interesting, for example, for the  problem of secure communications.  It also plays a fundamental  role in  the explanation of deterministic behavior of nonequilibrium  media.  We  are going to describe mechanisms of the occurrence of stochastic  synchronization in the language of nonlocal bifurcation theory   and  strange attractors.    The problem of appearance and evolution of strange attractors  during  the changes of parameters in one-parametrical families of smooth  vector fields is very important from the mathematical point of  view.  It also plays a fundamental role in studying of specific  dissipative  systems from applications.  In the proposed work we are going to  study  the nonlocal codimension one bifurcations on the boundary of the  Morse-Smale systems which may lead to the birth of strange  attractors  and, also scenaria (i.e., chains of bifurcations) which can be  responsible for characteristics of strange attractors.  In the  first  problem, we propose to classify behavior of homoclinic and  heteroclinic trajectories at the bifurcation moment, single out  situations related to appearance of strange attractors and  describe  the arising attractors in terms of symbolic dynamics.  In the  second  problem, we want to study scenaria of appearance of new positive  Lyapunov exponents in strange attractors and investigate their  crises which are related to nontransversal intersections of  stable and  unstable manifolds.  We are going to apply expected results to  investigate some specific systems (coupled oscillators, laser  systems  and others) in the form of dissipatively coupled dissipative  individual subsystems.  We propose to describe mechanisms of  occurrence of stochastic synchronization phenomenon in such  systems.  For identical subsystems, stability of spatially-homogeneous  solutions  implies stochastic synchronization.  For different individual  subsystems, a theory of stochastical synchronization based on  bifurcations of strange attractors needs to be developed.",
