The project will support twelve students through  institutional resources and additional four from this grant.  The  program runs for eight weeks focusing on research in the areas of  algebraic geometry and knot theory.  Two faculty advisors will  coordinate the effort.  Students will work in small groups and be  expected to make presentations during the course of the program.  Interspersed will be lectures by visiting scientists.   All participants will be expected to write up the results of  their experience with the more successful preparing papers for  publication or presentation at professional meetings.       Recruiting will be done by personal visits to regional  institutions.  Efforts will be made to attract applications from  students in under represented groups.  Availability of university  resources such as a computer laboratory will add to the strength  of the activity.  ***",
