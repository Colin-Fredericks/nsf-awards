 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406658  Lillios    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Katina Lillios will  initiate the first stage of a proposed long term study which  examines the rise of social complexity during the Copper Age  (3000-2000 BC) in Portugal. Archaeological evidence indicates  that it was during this period that stratified complex societies  first emerged in Western Europe. Dr. Lillios believes that  differential access and control over scarce and valued resources  played a central role in this process and that amphibolite, a  rock which was used to make ground stone tools, constitutes such  a good. Dr. Lillios has identified outcrops of amphibolite in  Portugal and conducted preliminary petrographic and chemical  analyses which indicate that sources can be identified on the  basis of structure and composition. In this current project she  will expand on this work. Additional sourcing and analysis will  be conducted with the goal of developing methods which allow more  precise geographic characterization. Dr. Lillios will also study  ground stone objects from a series of Copper Age sites to  determine whether or not assignment of finished materials to  individual source areas is in fact possible. On this basis, in  future research projects, she should be able to reconstruct trade  routes and relate these to social and economic variation among  different settlements.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies  originally arose and how they were maintained. Evidence from many  parts of the world suggests that trade and control over scarce  and valued resources played a central role. Researchers are now  attempting to build a data base which would allow the comparison  of individual cases. Dr. Lillios' work is important in this  context. It will also provide data of interest to many  archaeologists and will assist in the career development of a  promising young scientist.",
