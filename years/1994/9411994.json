This project involves an effort to link abrasive flow  machining (AFM) research with a leading machine tool builder of the  equipment.  The project will involve the principal investigator  spending one summer at the machine tool builder.  The project  entails three major objectives:  (1) Integration of abrasive flow  machining research results into industrial applications.   Particularly, the use of the acoustic emission monitoring system.   (2) Involvement of graduate engineering students in the AFM  research projects.  This will include students from colleges and  universities.  (3) Exposure of the academic researcher to the  competitive issues facing the machine tool builders.       Expected benefits include enhanced technology of the abrasive  flow-machining systems, greater understanding of AFM and better  awareness of industry needs, and the establishment of long-term  collaborative research efforts.",
