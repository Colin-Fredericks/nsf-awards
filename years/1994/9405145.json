Illinois State Museum  Title: Long Records of Paleoclimate from Florida    Recent research on a continuous 50,000-year sediment record from  eastern North America has revealed a striking correlation between  Heinrich events (large surges in flow of ice streams feeding from  the Laurentide ice sheet into the North Atlantic) and major changes  in vegetation in peninsular Florida.  These events are expressed at  Lake Tulane, Florida, as abrupt shifts between pine-dominated and  oak-dominated communities, which likely correspond with times of  moist climate alternating with periods of extreme drought.   Those  results suggest that  the Heinrich events involved important  changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation, and thus forcing other  than internal dynamics of the ice sheet.  This award supports a  research project designed with the following objectives: (1) To  establish a higher-resolution AMS-radiocarbon chronology for the  sediments of Lake Tulane.  The record will verify whether the  vegetational shifts in Florida are indeed synchronous with Heinrich  events; (2) To reconstruct the history of lake-level fluctuations  in Lake Tulane; (3) To extend the regional and temporal records of  vegetation and climate for peninsular Florida by studying the  pollen stratigraphy of new long cores (already collected) from  several in-filled sinkholes.  These sediments appear likely to span  much more than the 50,000 years covered by the Lake Tulane record,  and thus have excellent potential to produce the first record of  changes in vegetation and climate spanning the last complete  glacial/interglacial cycle in eastern North America.",
