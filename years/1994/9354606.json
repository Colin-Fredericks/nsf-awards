 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354606  White  A major objective of undergraduate education is to produce  students who are independent learners and who can make reasoned  decisions. Traditional science courses in lecture format  present content efficiently, but a large proportion of students  do not actively engage the material and so graduate with a  superficial or incorrect understanding of many basic science  concepts. We have assembled a critical mass of faculty who have  independently initiated pilot projects introducing  problem-based active group learning in their individual courses  in biology, chemistry, physics, biochemistry and astronomy. We  now propose to expand and integrate these efforts to stimulate  active learning in introductory science courses so that our  students develop the skills of critical thinking and analysis  in order to go beyond factual knowledge to a deeper  understanding of science. The courses involved include those  for majors and non-majors, those with small and large  enrollments, and those for honors and non-honors students.  While individual approaches vary, at the heart of each course  revision is the use of realistic problems or activities to lead  groups of students to new concepts. What is unique in this  program is our coordinated effort to incorporate problem-based  learning across several science disciplines at the introductory  level. The seven faculty involved in this project actively  review each other's courses, meet frequently, and seek ways to  make interdisciplinary connections for students. The scale and  diversity of our project provide opportunities for us  individually and collectively to assess the effects of  problem-based instruction, with the University of Delaware's  Center for Teaching Effectiveness providing the structure and  support for local, regional, and national dissemination of our  findings.",
