 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454585  Newberry  The Kentucky Community College System is establishing computer  facilities at each of its fifteen widely separated community  college campuses.  These new facilities are being utilized for  statewide reform of the mathematics algebra-level and calculus  which form part of the curriculum for students in advanced  technology programs. The labs will also support development of new  two-year curricula in telecommunications and computer system  management. A system of formal courses (taught using satellite  facilities) to train faculty and staff to maintain the network  system are catalyzing Continuing Education/Community Service  programs in the use and administration of network systems and will  develop the capability to offer a new associate degree program in  network system administration. At the conclusion of this project  approximately 40% of the System's intermediate and college algebra  level mathematics courses will be taught as integrated courses in  a collaborative learning environment using technology as a learning  tool. While 15,000 students across Kentucky will directly benefit  from the revised curriculum during the actual project period, the  project will ultimately affect many thousands more students and  ordinary citizens.",
