An understanding of the  forcing of the lower-tropospheric and near-surface circulation  anomalies will be emphasized as these are critical both to the  generation of monsoon-rainfall anomalies and tropical oceanic-  circulation anomalies.    The project objectives also include diagnostic modeling/analysis of  A) the forcing of the northern-autumn (Sept. - Oct.)  circulation  anomalies over the Pacific in order to reveal potential feedback of  the anomalous Asian summer-monsoon rainfall on the subsequent El  Nino/La Nina development, and B) of the potential extratropical  forcing of interannual-variability of the Asian summer-monsoons by  Eurasian springtime snow-cover anomalies.  The research-tasks  include:         1) Estimation of the 3-dimensional diabatic heating field (and  transient eddy-flux convergence) from the global ECWMWF-analyses  data sets for this diagnostic project is based on operational-  analyses rather than GCM simulation of anomalous monsoons.         2) Linear simulations with a multi-layer global steady  primitive-equation model linearized about a zonally-varying  climatological flow -- a necessary first-step in such dynamical-  diagnostic analysis.  (Meeting this prerequisite will also allow  identification of the most consistent diabatic-heating estimate.)   A 'direct-access' adaptation of an LU decomposition method should  permit higher linear-model resolution  than previously possible.         3) Identification of the characteristic structure of the El  Nino-related heating anomalies over the tropical Pacific and Indian  oceans during March - May and June - August periods, and a  computation of their remote response over Asia.  The remote impact  of just the Pacific-basin heating anomalies will also be assessed.         4) Calculation of the 'Himalayan-Tibetan orography' - forced  anomalous circulation during all recent summers, and an examination  of its phase in the Asian lower troposphere vis-a-vis that of the  remotely-forced anomalous thermal response.  This aspect of the  proposed research may help explain the basis for the perplexing  threshold-dependence in the Monsoon-El Nino linkage.    Results of a pilot study are indicative of the potential insight  that such dynamical-diagnostic analysis can provide in improving  our understanding of the interactions (and potential feedback)  between anomalous Asian summer-monsoons and El Nino/La Nina  episodes--the two global-scale climate anomalies whose  understanding, simulations and ultimately prediction will be  central to the success of the TOGA/GOALS missions.",
