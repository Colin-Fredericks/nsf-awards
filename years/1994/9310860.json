 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310860  Bildstein, K.  Established in 1934, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is the world's  oldest refuge for migratory raptors.  The Sanctuary straddles the  eastern most ridge of the Appalachian Mountains in eastern  Pennsylvania, along an important migration corridor for 16  species of raptors.  Hawk Mountain's 56-year monitoring program  for migratory birds of prey has produced the longest and most  complete record of raptor migration in the world.  The  Sanctuary's annual counts of migrating hawks and eagles have  proved to be a critical resource in assessing long-term trends in  raptor populations in North America.  This extensive data base  played a key role in exposing organochlorine pesticides as  causative agents of declines in several species of predatory  birds earlier this century.  The Sanctuary's 890 hectares  represent the largest preserve of privately-owned and protected  secondary growth forest in the central Appalachians.  To date,  Sanctuary staff and collaborators have contributed more than 75  publications to the scientific literature.  Even so, limited  housing, laboratory space, and equipment have restricted use of  the Sanctuary's long-term record of raptor migration, and  its biotic resources by both resident staff and visiting  scientists.    This project will provide for site visit by consulting scientists  to assist Sanctuary staff in developing plans to: (1) improve the  management of the site's unique long-term data base; (2)  establish a Geographic Information System (GIS); and (3) increase  use of the site as a field laboratory for Appalachian ecology.  ***",
