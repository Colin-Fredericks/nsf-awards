 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will concentrate on three areas: (i) Theoretical  studies of recombination stochastic models incorporating  interference effects. These include characterizations of  multimarker crossover distributions and analysis of higher order  crossover interference forms. Apart from their intrinsic interest  as a class of stochastic processes, these should be helpful in  constructing genetic maps of multiple genetic markers. (ii)  Statistical studies of molecular sequences emphasizing score  based methods. These play a role in identifying distinctive  sequence features in DNA and protein sequences and in identifying  significant common segments in protein sequence comparisons.  (iii) New directions and developments in the theory of  multivariate total positivity motivated by applications related  to random walks on graphs, especially on the n-dimensional  hypercube. The general problem of deciding when a probability  distribution on the hypercube is multivariate totally positive is  fundamental in characterizing positive and negative interference  for recombination stochastic structures.   The research on recombination processes is of importance in  developing genetic maps (for example, mapping of disease genes in  relation to other easily observable markers). The studies on  majorization and stochastic comparisons can provide insights in  developing computer algorithms relevant in combinatorics and of  interest in queuing systems, branching phenomena, and birth and  death stochastic processes. Statistical studies of patterns in  biomolecular sequences can be used as benchmarks for  distinguishing chance occurrences from proper functional and  structural attributes in DNA and protein sequences.",
