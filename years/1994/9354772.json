 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354772  Prizirembel  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), with a  network of 120,000 members, including over 400 department heads  of mechanical engineering and mechanical engineering technology  programs in the country, will initiate a curriculum development  project to integrate the product realization process (PRP) and  to take into consideration the issues associated with design  into the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum.   Design, used in its broadest sense, will be used as the central  axis of integration both vertically (integrating subjects in a  time progressive manner over a number of semesters of years)  and horizontally (integrating different interdisciplinary  subjects offered at the same time period.)  Specifically, the  project will 1) identify the essential elements of PRP  activities with respect to design education, 2) identify the  paradigms and methodologies used in existing innovative  programs and curricula that have been successfully tested on  campuses, 3) develop model design courses, at various levels in  the engineering curricum, and different models of design  curricula in mechanical engineering, 4) disseminate new courses  and curriculum models that are developed in this prject to all  U.S. engineering colleges, and 5) develop an implementation  plan for engineering schools and departments to adopt and  utilize the project results. The course and curriculum models  thus developed will provide useful resource guides to the  mechanical engineering department heads and faculty members in  their own effort of course and curriculum development.  The  project results will also provide the paradigms, methodologies,  and processes for other engineering disciplines to integrate  the product realization process into their respective  engineering curriculum.  ***",
