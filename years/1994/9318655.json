 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318655  Johnson  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the  Chemistry Division, Prof. C. S. Johnson of the University of  North Carolina proposes to develop an improvement in current  NMR technique to allow the study of ultra slow translational  (diffusional) motions of molecules and molecular aggregates in  condensed media.  An existing standard commercial NMR  spectrometer will be modified to allow the use of large  magnetic field gradients and high resolution NMR in the same  experiment.  This project is exploratory in nature and is  supported through a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  %%%  The limitations of present methods of Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy make for difficulties in studying  the transport of large micelles and vesicles, restricted  diffusion in cells and porous solids, and the simultaneous  measurement of diffusion rates of various size probe particles  in tight gels and polymers.  The exploratory research to be  undertaken in this project seeks to overcome these limitations  through the combination of several new techniques and adapting  them for inclusion in a standard commercial spectrometer.  The  successful execution of this plan will bring about a major  advance of the NMR technique and will have important  consequences and great benefits to several applied areas, such  as polymer chemistry, biochemistry, and the dynamics of glassy  materials.  ***",
