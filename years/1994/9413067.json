Fragments of  nuclei after reactions with energetic pi mesons  will be measured with a reliable and efficient  detector system that requires a very time-  consuming and careful analysis.  The exposure  to the requisite pion beams will be carried out  in an optimal manner, in coordination with  skilled analysts in Pakistan.  The nuclear  excitation energy will be at levels where  traditional nuclear fission is preempted by  fast fragment production.  Nuclear targets of  middle mass will be selected to minimize the  role of fission in its traditional sense.    Scope:  The project involves Dr. R.J. Peterson,  from the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the  University of Colorado, in Boulder, and a  Pakistani team headed by Dr. Hameed Ahmed Khan,  of the Solid State Nuclear Track Detector  Laboratory in PINSTECH, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.   The proposed work is part of a U.S.-Brazil-  Pakistan collaboration in the study of pion-  induced fission.  Past collaboration has  resulted in U.S. publication using data from  Pakistan and calculations from Boulder. This  grant is the first for the P.I. for the purpose  of enhancing this collaboration, and it meets  the criteria of the Division of International  Programs.  ***",
