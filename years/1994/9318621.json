 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. S.C. Foster of the Chemistry Department of Florida State   University will conduct a series of investigations in the high resolution   infrared spectroscopy of Jahn-Teller active molecules.  A novel high   frequency modulated corona- excited supersonic jet discharge will be used   to produce the species of interest. The methoxy, thiomethoxy, and methyl   nitrene radicals will be investigated.    While there have been many investigations of the   rotation-vibration-electronic spectra of polyatomic molecules, there have   been relatively few which deal with the radicals of such molecules.  This   paucity of such investigations is generally due to the great reactivity   of these species and thus the difficulties encountered in producing   sufficient amounts of them suitable for experimental study.  In radical   species which are expected to possess axial symmetry this is often not   the case.  The radicals are distorted away from their expected symmetry   due to a special interaction between the electronic motions and some of   the vibrational modes.  This is known as the Jahn-Teller effect.  This   research is devoted to the study of Jahn-Teller active molecules with the   aim to establish a data base suitable for the development of appropriate   theoretical models.",
