 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319516  Charniak    This is the first-year award of a three-year continuing grant to  study the use of probabilities and probabilistic language models in  context-free parsing applications.  The research consists of four  parts: 1) use of probabilities in the syntactic parsing of English  through automatic generation of a probabilistic grammar by applying  standard statistical techniques to corpora that has been hand-  tagged; 2) a portion of the resources in the statistical analysis  involves the co-occurrence of words, which improves the  effectiveness of the language model thereby helping the  determination in the parse that, for example, a noun would be more  likely in a certain position than another, rather than just the  parts-of-speech results that would be obtained via a classical  parser; 3) it is anticipated that some level of semantic  generalization may be possible by grouping the words with similar  statistics in classes, as statistical parameters are smoothed; and  finally, 4) the model obtained and smoothed is rigorously tested  through an objective quality measure such as the per-word cross  entropy.  The goal is to improve upon existing trigram models,  currently in use in speech recognition, and to work towards better  language understanding systems.",
