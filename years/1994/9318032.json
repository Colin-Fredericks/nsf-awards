 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318032  Wing  The overall objective of this proposal is to acquire  instrument resources for a high throughput automated system  for plant and animal genome analysis.  This enabling  technology will be used for genetic map construction,  diversity analysis, pedigree construction, analysis of  complex traits, map-based gene cloning and genome database  development.  The requested system will support the  multidisciplinary research of seven major user research  groups and 8 additional research laboratories.    The instrument resources required for the automated system  include; a large capacity freeze dryer for sample  preparation and storage, a fluorimeter which can be used in  a 96 well format with output connected via computer for  automated sample dilution, a robot for automated liquid  handing and photometric measurement tasks, dedicated PCR  instruments for amplification of DNA markers, an automated  DNA sequencer for analysis of amplified polymorphic DNA and  for acquisition of microsatellite, cDNA and other marker  sequences, a gel image for data capture and storage, and a  UNIX Workstation for data analysis and genome informatics.    The instrument resources will be housed in the 2,500 square  foot Laboratory for Crop Genome Analysis which is located in  a new Crop Biotechnology Center at Texas A&M University.  The Crop Biotechnology Center will provide for the  maintenance and operation of the instrument resource.  The  principal investigator, Dr. Rod Wing, will oversee the  operation of the automated genome analysis system.  Day-to-  day operation and scheduling of the genome analysis system  will be carried out by a staff scientist provided through  the Crop Biotechnology Center.",
