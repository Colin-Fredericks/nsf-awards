 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318432  Button  Aquatic bacteria control the organic chemistry of natural water  systems and comprise about half the biomass of the oceans.  Yet,  because of recalcitrance to conventional procedures, the identity,  phylogenetics, biochemistry and nutritional requirements of most of  these organisms, called oligobacteria or ultramicrobacteria (UMB),  are unknown.  However, UMB cellular properties include extremely  small size and DNA content, high affinity for organic nutrients,  and resistance to growth in rich media.  Flow cytometry offers an  ideal window into these organisms not only because of the  flexibility and the variety of measurements that can be performed  by this instrumentation, but because typical cell numbers in  natural populations are ideally suited for this type of direct  analysis, natural cell populations can be preserved for analysis at  a later time, and the single-cell basis of the analysis can provide  a wealth of information on cell population structure.   Unfortunately, present flow cytometry analytical methods have been  developed only for large cells.  Techniques for treatment and  standard size curves for UMB-type cells have to be developed.  The  objective of the present research project is to develop methods for  efficient analysis of UMB by flow cytometry.  Standard curves for  cell size and for DNA per cell will be completed.  Additional  standard curves will be generated for UMB RNA and protein content.   Membrane potential will be used to probe the physiological state of  cells, and the feasibility of using oligonucleotide probes as a  taxonomic tool for oligobacteria will be examined.  The concept of  deriving three-dimensional spacing and chemotaxis information about  bacteria in mixed systems from signal-proximity analysis will be  tested under both laboratory and field conditions.  %%%  Aquatic bacteria, especially the oligobacteria or the  ultramicrobacteria (UMB), comprise almost one half the biological  material in the sea and, as such their metabolic  activity can  control the chemistry of the world's oceans.  Surprisingly,  however, very little is known about these cells except that they  are small, they contain a minimum amount of DNA, and although they  have a strong attraction to organic compounds, they only grow when  the concentration is very low.  The objective of the present  research program is to develop methods using flow cytometry to  learn about the cells directly in sea water.  Standard curves will  be developed to measure cell size and estimate their DNA, RNA, and  protein contents.  Novel methods will be used to determine which  cells are metabolizing and how many different UMB-cell types may be  present in a water sample. The feasibility will be tested in the  laboratory and in the field of analyzing cell movement under flow  cytometer conditions to determine if the aquatic bacteria exhibit  tactic behavior toward desirable nutrients.  %%%",
