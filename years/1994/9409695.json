 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409695  Yang  Efficient scheduling of computational task execution and  data movement is essential to high-performance computing on  massively parallel machines and workstation clusters.  This  research focuses on the study of graph scheduling algorithms  and the run-time schedule executing methods for mapping  program parallelism on message-passing architectures.  The  goal of optimization is to minimize the parallel time by  balancing load among a limited number of processors,  eliminating unnecessary communication and overlapping  computation with communication.    There exists two types of parallelism in a program, task  parallelism is expressed as a collection of functional tasks  with communication between them.  The dependence structure  is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Loop parallelism is  expressed as a collection of iterated computation with loop-  carried dependence. The main research topics identified in  this project are to develop scheduling algorithms for both  task and loop parallelism and run-time methods to execute  the scheduled graph, study the methods of loop  transformation to help graph scheduling algorithm to explore  more parallelism, apply these algorithms in scientific  computing such as sparse matrix factorization and iterative  methods, analyze the impact of program partitioning on  scheduling performance.    Research activities include developing and implementing  algorithms for the above problems and evaluating the  performance on parallel machines and workstation clusters,  integrating these algorithms in a scheduling tool and  distributing the implementation.  ***",
