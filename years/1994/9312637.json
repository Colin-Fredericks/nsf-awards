 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312637  Huang    This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed by   Dr. Huey Huang, Rice University, and Professor Wen-guey Wu,  National Tsing Hua University.  Membrane fusion and lysis are two  key cell destruction processes utilized by viruses and toxins.   This project proposes to use Taiwan cobra venom to understand the  processes of membrane fusion and lysis.  Taiwan cobra venom  contains two biochemical components, cytotoxin (CTX) III and V.  The former causes membrane fusion, but exhibits little hemolysis  activity, while the latter induces significant hemolysis but  exhibits little fusion activity.  The contrast between these two  closely related small peptides provides a unique means for  studying the molecular mechanisms involved in cell destruction  processes.  Dr. Huang has experience in the structural biology of  membrane active peptides and proteins and has developed  innovative approaches to the problems of studying these  molecules, and his Co-PI in Taiwan has successfully purified the  Cobra Toxin peptides, CTX III and V. It is an excellent  cooperative study and can provide a good hands-on opportunity for  students in structural biology, as well as increasing their  understanding of the ecology and behavior of Taiwan cobra.  This  project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National  Science Council (NSC).",
