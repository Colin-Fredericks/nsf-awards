 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405363  The enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain  are unique. Each complex is composed of subunits encoded in two  different genomes, the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes.  Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the last enzyme complex in the chain  provides an ideal model system in which to analyze both coordinate  and tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of these essential  respiratory genes. The long-term goal of this project is to  understand the genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling both  tissue-specific expression and developmental regulation of  mammalian genes for the mitochondrial-encoded COX subunits. We will  (1) define skeletal muscle-specific enhancer elements in the gene  for COX subunit VIII-H by means of gene fusions with either the CAT  or lacZ reporter genes (2) map the sites of DNA-protein  interactions between nuclear proteins and tissue-specific enhancers  in the COX8H gene by DNAse hypersensitivity, DNAse footprinting and  electrophoretic mobility shift assays and determine the functional  significance of these interactions by gene transactivation studies  (3) physically map the bovine genes for the tissue-specific  isoforms of COX subunit VIII and (4) nap the COX VIII isoform genes  in the mouse by inter-specific hybrid back-crosses.  %%%  These studies will constitute the first comprehensive analysis of  the transcriptional regulation of a class of genes, the tissue-  specific respiratory genes, essential for respiratory function in  contractile muscle.  The results should provide insight into the  genetic regulation of tissue-specific subunits of an essential  multi-subunit enzyme complex involved in oxidative metabolism and  provide tools to enable us to address the function of these  isoforms in future studies.  ***",
