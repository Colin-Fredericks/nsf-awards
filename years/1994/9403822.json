The objective of the workshop is to bring  together people in academia and industry with an interest in the  pharmaceutical industry to discuss and exchange ideas which, if  developed and applied, can improve the level of system automation,  productivity, and quality control in the industry.  The conference  will identify the research needs of the industry in the area of  manufacturing for the year 2000 and beyond.       One outcome of the workshop will be an identification of  critical research areas in the industry by people who are actively  involved in the industry.  Second, a thorough discussion of the  state of automation in the industry will be held.  This will help  industry attendees assess where they belong in the automation  scale.  Finally, the role of academia and industry in developing  United States competitiveness in the industry through research can  be established.  This may lead to partnerships between universities  and the industry to work together on problems of common interest.",
