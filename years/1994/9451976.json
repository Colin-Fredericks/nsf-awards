 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451976  Jacobs                               past two decades, applications of tunable pulsed lasers and  molecular beams have revolutionized the field of Physical  Chemistry. Yet both of these major technological advances are far  from commonplace in most undergraduate laboratories. This project  introduces a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser system and molecular beam  apparatus to the undergraduate Chemistry curriculum in a series of  experiments which interrogate the fast kinetics of chemical  intermediates in solution, the high-resolution nonlinear  spectroscopy of molecules and clusters in supersonic expansions,  and the dynamics of photodissociation in the gas phase. Students  will initially use the equipment to carry out structured laboratory  experiments; however, they will later have the opportunity to  utilize the apparatus in executing their own research proposals.  Throughout the year-long Physical Chemistry Laboratory course,  students will be challenged to learn exactly how instruments make  measurements, learn basic electronics, computer interfacing, and  data acquisition programming. This way, their scientific  exploration within the lab is no longer limited by their technical  expertise, but instead, they can creatively implement experiments  as their imagination guides them. Emphasis in the lab is placed on  the scientific process by which students formulate and implement  their own ideas.",
