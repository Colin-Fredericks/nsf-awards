 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417188    Bisset    Description:  This project supports Dr. Michael  Bisset, a young U.S. physicist who received his  Ph.D. in 1994 from the University of Hawaii, to  spend one year as a postdoctoral scholar at the  Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)  in Bombay, India.  During his stay at the TIFR  he will be engaged in research on collider  physics phenomenology, and in particular in the  search for particles of supersymmetry at hadron  colliders.  He will be collaborating with Dr.  D.P. Roy of the Theoretical Physics Group at  the TIFR.    Scope:  The U.S. and the Indian scientists are  interested in the same area, namely the  phenomonology of Higgs and superparticle search  at supercolliders.  While the Indian scientist  is a leading figure in the field, the U.S.  scientist has contributed significantly to the  field, during his Ph.D. studies.  The  opportunity offered for Dr. Bisset to work at  one of India's best renowned institutes, and  with scientists of international reputation is  likely to further his scientific career, and to  enhance his research capabilities.  This  opportunity should also increase the potential  for future Indo-U.S. scientific collaboration  in the field of theoretical physics.  This  project meets the objectives of the Division   of International Programs.  ***",
