The module  will begin with a case study of an inventor of solar heating  systems who is motivated both by environmental and market concerns.   Students will then be given a chance to design their own technology  that meets the criteria of environmentally sustainable development;  they will have to evaluate their design both for its ecological  soundness and from a practical economic perspective, demonstrating  how their technology could be marketed.  Afterwards, students will  analyze and compare their own design processes, focusing especially  on the role of ethical concerns in making design decisions.  To  determine its effectiveness, this module will be piloted and  evaluated in a special course on invention and design intended for  students from both engineering and the liberal arts.  It will then  be prepared for dissemination to instructors nationwide.  ***",
