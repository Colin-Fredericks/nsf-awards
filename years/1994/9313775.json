 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important class of practical parallel computers consists of  machines comprising many large grained processors.  These  processors execute  asynchronously and memory is assumed to be  distributed.  Trying to execute a  general n-thread parallel  program P on such a parallel system poses theoretical  and  practical challenges.  One must provide mechanisms for  implementing the  synchronization barriers, for load sharing and  balancing amongst the  processors, and for program executing that  respects memory locality.    The  approach used in this research is to define algorithms  and a program transformation  (compilation) T so that T(P) executes correctly and efficiently on any P.  This simulated  execution does not require any specialized hardware or operating  system mechanisms in the target machine.    Of particular interest is the case  that the parallel program is  large-grained, i.e. that in each parallel step a  substantial  block of instructions is executed on some or most of the parallel  threads.  It is assumed that the parallel program is already  optimized so as to  make the blocks of code within the parallel  step quite large.  This project  studies the most general case  of large grained parallel programs, paying  particular attention  to memory locality and to memory fault-tolerance,  employing  randomization.  A further goal is to achieve Las Vegas style  results, i.e. small expected running time and no errors.",
