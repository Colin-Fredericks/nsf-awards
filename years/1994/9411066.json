 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been known for a number of years that parental genomes are  not functionally equivalent. Later studies have identified specific  genes which are functionally non-equivalent and such genes are  considered to be \"imprinted\". The best studied cases are in mice  although indications are that imprinted genes are found in  organisms as diverse as plants and humans. The evolution of such a  genetic mechanism is largely unknown. I propose to begin such  studies by determining whether the known imprinted genes are  imprinted in other eutherians, marsupials and other amniotes,  beginning with birds. I will also analyze bison and cow sperm and  oocytes as well as pre-implantation embryos from those organisms.   The genes known to be imprinted in humans or mice will be cloned  from these taxa by the use PCR primers based on conserved gene  regions or, if necessary, by other techniques. Imprinting will be  determined in various ways and at various stages in all taxa.  Insight into the origins and evolution of gene imprinting should be  enhanced by this study.  %%%  The laws of Mendel explain most of what we observe in the  inheritance of genetic information. However, observations have been  made which cannot be explained by Mendel's laws. One such area is  that of imprinted genes; genes which are either expressed or not  depending upon which parent contributes the gene copy. Much work is  underway to determine the mechanism of imprinting but little or  none on the origin and evolution of such a mechanism. This study  should give some insight into those questions.",
