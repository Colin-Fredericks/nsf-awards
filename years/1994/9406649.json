The goal  of this research is to characterize the molecular and gene  structures and binding properties of lectins from selected  invertebrates in order to understand their evolution as self/non-  self recognition molecules, and to elucidate the molecular  mechanisms of their biological functions.  With prior NSF support  considerable progress has been made in isolation, purification, and  biochemical characterization of four distinct L-fucosyl binding  lectins, CPL-I, -II, -III, and -IV, from plasma and hemocytes of  the protochordate Clavelina picta.  Serological and primary  structure evidence suggest that C. picta lectins are related to  acute phase reactants from vertebrates, namely, human pro-clotting  factor VIIIc (F VIIIc), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum amyloid  P (SAP).  The C.picta lectin binding properties, including the fine  specificity for L-fucose-containing oligosaccharides, affinity  constants, divalent cation dependence and effect of toxic metals,  have been extensively characterized, and the amino acid residues of  the polypeptide chain involved in the interactions with the ligand  have been identified by specific chemical modification.  C. picta  lectins bind preferentially to oligosaccharides that exhibit non-  reducing terminal fucose but surprisingly, also bind  phosphocholine, galactans, sialic and muramic acids, and  proteoglycans.  Preliminary studies to identify the \"natural\"  ligands, both exogenous (environmental and colony-associated  bacterial isolates) and endogenous (tunic sulfated galactan) have  begun.  Based on experimental results thus far, it appears that C.  picta lectins are multifunctional recognition/effector mosaic  molecules, involved not only in recognition and opsonization o f  potentially pathogenic bacteria from the environment but also in  wound repair upon injury of the body wall.  Additional lectins have  now been isolated from C. picta that have been characterized as  belonging to the S-type.  Until recently, S-type lectins were  believed to be restricted to vertebrate species.  This finding  resulted not only in the isolation of S-type lectins in a variety  of invertebrate species but also in the crystallization and  resolution of the three dimensional structure of an animal lectin  for the first time.  To obtain the complete nucleotide sequence  that will allow alignment of the extensive amino acid sequence  obtained so far, a hemocyte cDNA library was constructed in the  expression vector lunizap and through PCR techniques, a nucleic  acid probe for CPL-III was developed.  The hemocyte cDNA library  was screened with this probe and positive recombinant phage clones  were isolated.  All the clones selected yield a product of similar  size when used as templates for PCR with the same primers.  These  are currently being sequenced.  Goals for the next three years are  to conduct studies in two areas:  1)  Protein and cDNA structure of  C. picta lectins:  By the end of the current funding period it is  expected that substantial nucleotide sequence of CPL-III will be in  hand, and the extent of homology to the acute phase reactants CRP,  SAP, and F VIIIc will be determined.  By the end of the new funding  period equivalent information should be available for the other  three C.picta lectins.  2)  Biological role of C.picta lectins:   Endogenous and exogenous \"natural\" ligands, i.e. tunic sulfated  galactans and polysaccharides from selected environmental bacterial  strains, will be sought and characterized.  in vitro studies of the  interactions of the characterized \"natural\" ligands or their  relevant determinants on the C.picta hemocytes will be studied, and  the inducibility of C.picta lectins by the putative natural ligands  will be examined.  %%%  The goal  of this research is to characterize the molecular  structure, properties and biological functions of certain sugar-  binding molecules (\"lectins\") from selected invertebrate animals to  understand their evolution as self/non-self recognition molecules,  and to clarify the molecular mechanisms of their biological  functions which may be important in the defense mechanisms of a  diversity of animals.  ***",
