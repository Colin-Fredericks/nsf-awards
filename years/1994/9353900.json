 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  9353900  Stanley        Most instructional materials in classical science assume a strict cause and effect relationship.  More recent research in many disciplines demonstrates that macroscopic randomness leads to macroscopic patterns.  Examples, drawn from physics, chemistry, biology and earth science, include natural patterns in nerve cells, lightning, river deltas, tree branches, galaxy formation, ruggedness of coast lines and growth of materials - to name a few.  Each discipline-related workbook incorporates hands-on activities, prediction and hypothesizing activities, laboratory experiments, computer simulations, data analysis, modeling and assessment instruments which are based on previous work in research in teaching and learning.  The materials confront students' preconceptions while introducing important concepts underlying the study of patterns in nature.  Students learn to think like scientists.  Preliminary research demonstrates that this approach is particularly attractive to women, minority students and those who have not mastered the mathematical skills necessary to comprehend the traditional presentation of scientific concepts. The projects are designed to encourage students to work in cooperative groups and to encourage teachers to provide cognitive apprenticeships - modeling the student behavior, providing scaffolding as needed and fading as the students learn the skills.  Publication of modularized student booklets, and associated software and videos is through Springer Verlag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !         !         !
