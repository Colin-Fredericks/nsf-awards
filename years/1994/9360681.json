 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360681  Graf    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  seeks to explore the feasibility of using biological materials  which have not been traditionally utilized in educational settings  for developing new problem-based laboratory experiments in the life  science curricula.  The research will explore the use of plant  biological materials, such as plant mutants, which are available  through genetic stock centers and germplasm collections, to  construct classroom experiments for biology courses.  These  experiments are intended to encourage problem-based experimental  activities for communicating biological concepts for helping  students develop critical thinking and investigation skills.  In  Phase I, the experiments will focus on biological concepts which  will provide a foundation upon which students can build to achieve  a full appreciation and understanding of the agricultural  applications of modern biotechnology.  The use of these materials  will present students with an introduction to genetics and  biotechnology, showing the connection between these disciplines and  other areas of modern biology.   A preliminary evaluation component  focusing on obtaining feedback from several practicing science  educations of the project will be initiated.  It is anticipated  that the results of this Phase I will lead to the identification  and utilization of new resources in science education and will  contribute novel aspects to future improvements in the development  of new biology curricula.     Recognizing that very few laboratory-based curricula materials have  been developed in the area of biotechnology education as it relates  to agriculture, specifically plants, and that this area will have  increasing importance and relevance for students, Edvotek seeks to  make an important contribution to the appreciation of current  biotechnology research being conducted for agricultural  applications by providing such curricula materials on the grounds  that this area will have in creasing importance and relevant for  students.  ***",
