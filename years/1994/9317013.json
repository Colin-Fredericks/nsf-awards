 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewis  9317013  Addition of uncouplers to E. coli causes a low energy shock  response that is accompanied by induction of multidrug resistance  pumps.  A Summary of the objectives aimed at identifying the  components of the response and understanding their interactions is  given below.  1.  Expression of a target gene.  Regulatory mutations in emrD, a  multidrug resistance gene, that lead to constitutive expression  will be used to determine the upstream site controlling uncoupler-  dependent expression.  2.  The signal.  Expression of emrD in an ATPase mutant in response  to an uncoupler will be measured to determine whether the signal  originates prior to, or after ATP synthesis.  Changes in pmf will  be measured in parallel to determine the quantitative requirements  for the inducing signal.  3.  The sensor.  Regulatory mutations leading to constitutive  expression of emrD will be used to clone the regulator genes.  It  is expected that one of the genes will code for the receptor that  senses uncoupling.  4.  Are other MDR's target genes of low energy shock?  Five more  putative MDR's have been found in E. coli.  the possibility that  they are also induced by uncoupling will be studied using Northern  blotting.  Significance: it is of general importance in understanding cell  metabolism to learn how the cell senses its energy status and  activates a response mechanism.  %%%  Cells obtain energy through respiration.  This is a process of  oxidation of various nutrients such as sugars by oxygen.   Respiration takes place in the cell membrane.  The energy released  in the course of respiration is stored in the form of a \"high  energy\" molecule, ATP.  A large number of toxic substances affects  the membrane and leads to an \"Energy Shock\", or loss of energy-  producing capability.  We found that the cell responds to such  toxins by inducing the synthesis of a special class of proteins,  multiple drug resistance pumps, that extrude the toxins from the  cell.  How does a cell sense the presence of t oxins?  What is the  mechanism for the induction of the multidrug resistance pumps?   These are the questions that will be studied in this project.      ***",
