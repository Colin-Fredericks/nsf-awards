 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313848  Isenberg  This action is for continued support of an experiment in which  underground instrumented pipeline segments were constructed and  installed in a zone of probable earthquake rupture in Parkfield,  California.  The overall objective is to investigate the damage  experienced by buried pipelines due to strong earthquake shaking,  and to use data measured during strong ground shaking to evaluate  analytical models for predicting this damage.    Since 1857, seven earthquakes have occurred on the San Andreas  Fault in the vicinity of Parkfield, at an average interval of 22  years.  The last earthquake was in 1966, and the United States  Geological Survey (USGS) predicts, with a 95% confidence level, a  recurrence before 1993.  The choice of the site at Parkfield was  made with assistance from USGS geologists.  This experiment is  supported in collaboration with the National Center for  Earthquake Engineering Research in Buffalo, New York, and the  Urban Earthquake Hazard Research Institute of the University of  Tokyo in Japan.    The first objective of this project is to investigate the effects  of lateral offset on pipelines, a major damage mode, and to  provide data on the relation between ground displacements and  pipeline response in order to evaluate analytical models of this  damage mode. The second objective is to investigate the damage  induced by travelling seismic waves, another important damage  mode, and to use measured data to evaluate analytical models.  Whereas the first experiment requires that the surface rupture  cross the installed pipelines, the second experiment is dependent  only on the installation being subjected to strong ground  shaking.  ***",
