 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410747  Stacchetti    Mechanism design problems arise naturally in numerous economic  situations, including the regulation of a monopolist, auctions,  government procurement, nonlinear pricing, and the provision of  public goods.  There is a vast literature in each one of these  major fields of application by now, but for the most part, the  analysis has been reduced to the case in which uncertainty is  modelled by a single parameter, and the number of goods is  restricted to two (one of the two goods is typically money).  The  technical difficulties presented by higher dimensional cases have  impeded progress, and delayed our understanding of economic  applications.  The project develops new techniques in the theory  of multidimensional mechanism design, and applies these  techniques to several important economic problems.      More specifically, the techniques for multidimensional mechanism  design developed by this project are based on the work of Rochet  and Armstrong.  For problems with a certain linear structure  (including auctions with externalities and pricing in  multiproduct monopolies) conjugate duality leads to an envelope  condition and a full characterization of incentive compatible  mechanisms.  The divergence theorem takes the place of  integration by parts, which is used in the one-dimensional case  to simplify the objective function of the principal.  In a  symmetric auction with externalities, these techniques allow one  to identify the only buyer type whose participation constraint  binds at the optimal solution.  Myerson's notion of \"regularity\",  which is so crucial in one-dimensional problems, has a more  complicated but useful analog in higher dimensions.  The  symmetric auction model with externalities of Jehiel, Moldovanu  and Stacchetti is extended by relaxing the assumption of symmetry  and considering the case where buyers experience externalities  even when the seller keeps the object.  Dynamic games are  investigated where there is a strategic motive for buying t he  objective, namely, to resell it later.  The generalized  regularity analysis alluded to above would extend Armstrong's  results on pricing and regulation to multiproduct monopolies to a  much wider range of economic environments.",
