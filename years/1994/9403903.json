 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403903  Donald    This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  investigates computational aspects of engineering design problems  that are amenable to tractable algorithmic solution.  In  particular, the focus is on determining the shape of  microelectromechanical (MEM) structures, given specifications of  their parameterized geometry and their functionality (parametric  design).  MEM structures are particularly suited for automated  parametric design because of (i) their highly specialized and  automated production process, which allows only a very limited  number of elementary structures; (ii) the rather simple geometry  and functionality of the devices; and (iii) the possibly large  number of devices produced simultaneously in one manufacturing  process.    In this exploratory research, actuator arrays for micro-  manipulation will be built based on single-crystal torsional  oscillators.  Optimization in design and fabrication will be  investigated, with the goal of determining if the generated forces  can be sufficient, for example, to move a piece of paper.  The  research will develop models for the mechanics and a theory of  manipulation, and efficient algorithms will be described for  evaluation.",
