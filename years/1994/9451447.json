This new program prepares skilled technicians to provide  rehabilitation engineering services to persons with disabilities --  from the design and manufacturing of assistive devices to working  with people with disabilities in adapting their devices to the home  and workplace. The objective of this design project will be to  require students to utilize and/or modify available technology to  design an environment which will improve the vocational  opportunities and augment the daily living capabilities of a person  with a disability. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to purchase  a wide array of assistive devices in environmental control and  computer access for students to use in an integrated,  comprehensive, design experience. Working with vocational  rehabilitation and users of assistive technology, the project  director will develop a design problem for the students to solve.  Student design projects will be evaluated and critiqued by persons  with disabilities and rehabilitation professionals. The importance  of such a project to the users of assistive technology is that by  making assistive technology accessible and by integrating it into  the user's environment, it expands the vocational potential of the  user while improving the quality of life. The importance of such a  project to the student is it expands their knowledge about all  types of assistive devices, increases their problem solving skills,  provides them with a comprehensive design experience, and provides  them with the ability and knowledge to train users of assistive  technology in the use of such equipment.",
