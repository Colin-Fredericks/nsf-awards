System performance will be  measured in terms of physical damage, system functional  performance, extent of postearthquake repair/restoration  effort and attendant down-time.      The research undertaken will: (1) enhance the existing  database on geological, soil, and topographical conditions  in the area pertinent to the Los Angeles Department of Water  & Power (LADWP) systems, as well as the database of physical  and operational characteristics of the LADWP systems, (2)  develop a database of the Northridge earthquake ground  motion and the resulting LADWP system performance, (3)  analyze and evaluate the seismic performance of the LADWP  water and electric power systems, and (4) validate,  calibrate and improve the tools, models and procedures.  The  improved procedures can then be used to better predict  lifeline performance in future earthquakes.  The  effectiveness of the retrofit measures implemented after the  San Fernando earthquake will be examined based upon analysis  and to the extent that the existing data permits.    This research will significantly enhance the quality and  quantity of the lifeline seismic performance knowledge base,  as well as the performance modeling capability, and will  allow better evaluation of the seismic performance of  lifeline systems.  In addition, the information on seismic  performance on lifelines serves as crucial input to be used  by social scientists and economists for the evaluation of  the socio-economic impact of lifeline failures.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project involving EQE  International and Princeton University.  ***",
