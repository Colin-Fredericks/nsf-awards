 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators develop and implement parallel algorithms  on the Connection Machine CM-5 for solving the protein folding  problem faster and more accurately than is currently possible.  In the inverse folding approach, the assumption that the sequence  being analyzed adopts one of the already known protein folds is  tested.  The energy, or a score, of the new sequence forced to  adopt structures of other proteins is calculated for all known  protein structures.  Structures that are not compatible with the  sequence are dismissed.  This approach is not a complete solution  to the folding problem since it is possible for a sequence to  adopt a novel, previously uncharacterized topology.  Still, the  number of examples where nonhomologous proteins adopt very similar  structures is large and still growing.  This and the extension of  the inverse folding approach to the supersecondary structure  elements provide a very general protein structure prediction  method.  The method is computationally very intensive.  The  investigators expect that the increase in performance from the use  of appropriate parallel algorithms and architecture will allow  them to reduce some approximations that are made in the current  approach, and thus increase the utility and predictive power of  the approach.       The protein folding problem, i.e. predicting a protein's  three-dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence, is a  fundamental, unsolved problem in molecular biology.  Kowledge of a  protein's three-dimensional structure is necessary to understand  its function and interactions with other agents.  Inverse folding  refers to a more tractable approach to the general problem of  protein structure prediction.  The inverse protein folding problem  is the problem of determining whether a newly sequenced protein  can fold into one of the known protein topologies.  This problem  has many applications in drug design and protein structure  prediction.  The investigators use high performance parallel  comput ing technology to increase the performance and utility of  this methodology.  The algorithms and software packages resulting  from this project will be available for commercialization and  industrial applications.",
