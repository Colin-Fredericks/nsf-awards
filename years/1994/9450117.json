 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavioral plasticity in social organization has been linked to the  evolution of the strikingly different levels of sociality exhibited  among the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps).  This research will  study this idea with comparative behavior and phylogeny of the  bumble bee subgenus Fervidobombus.  Species of Fervidobombus, by  virtue of their inter- and intraspecific phenotypic diversity in  social organization among widespread geographic populations, are  ideal for testing hypotheses concerning the role of behavioral  plasticity in social organization.  The evolution of diversity in  social traits within Fervidobombus can best be understood through  explicit reference to phylogeny.  If, for example, colony size and  social organization are local adaptations (reflecting behavioral  plasticity) to geographically varying environments, then it would  be expected that the social traits and environmental variables  would cluster together on the same branches of a phylogenetic  tree.  This hypothesis will be tested optimizing behavioral traits  onto a phylogentic tree and testing for association.  The proposed  research will lead to new comparative data on Fervidobombus social  organization and to the completion of a species phylogeny based on  nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial genome.      Interactive activities include:  (1) developing a modern graduate  level systematics course; (2) developing a systematics laboratory  for use as an interactive facility; and (3) developing a computer  facility for use as a teaching and training tool.  Additional  interactions with students and faculty include an early career  female-scientists seminar series and museum lunch.",
