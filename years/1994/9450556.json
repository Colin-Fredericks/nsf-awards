 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 556  Cha  Microwave-Induced Coal Gasification for Production of Activated  Coke and Synthesis Gas    The project's overall objective is to perform exploratory  research that supports industry for the development of an  advanced coal gasification process that utilizes Wyoming natural  resources and also to establish faculty and student exchange  programs with the industry.  To achieve these program objectives,  the program consists of two tasks.  Task 1 covers fundamental  research to investigate microwave-induced reactions involved in  coal gasification.  Task 2 provides activities to establish a  cooperative research and a co-op program for undergraduate and  graduate students with the DOW Chemical Company and the FMC  Corporation.    The experimental results obtained from Task 1, exploratory  research, will assist the industry in developing a simple, clean,  and economic process for the removal of NOx, SOx, and other  pollutants from the flue gas.  Successful development of a  microwave-induced coal gasification process will significantly  reduce the price of activated coke, and will eventually lead to  reducing the overall cost of pollution control. An efficient,  economic, and environmentally-friendly process for the production  of activated coke will improve the economy of Wyoming along with  an increase in employment in Wyoming.  Task 2 will offer three  undergraduate students and one graduate student practical  training and industrial experience that will assist them in their  search for permanent employment after graduation.  An ongoing  joint research program among the University of Wyoming, DOW, and  FMC will also result.",
