More specifically, the study has as its  objectives to:         Develop models that describe alternative roles and       responsibilities (especially as they relate to public       education and literacy) that public libraries might assume in       the NII.       Assess the impacts of these models in terms of criteria such       as (1) promotion of universal access to networked information,       (2) costs, (3) training and personnel requirements, etc.       Analyze the existing Federal public library policy system to       determine the degree to which that policy system might have to       be changed to accomplish the Administration's policy       objectives regarding public libraries in NII.       Offer policy recommendations to revise and extend the existing       public library policy system to promote proposed policy       objectives related to a new role for public libraries in the       NII.    Policy research that addresses these objectives is essential if, in  fact, the Administration's goal to \"connect every classroom, every  clinic, every library (and) every hospital in America into the  national information superhighway by the year 2000\" is to be  realized.",
