The main difficulty is due to the fact that  in these cases, stable and unstable foliations are never  transversal to each other. The new ideas and methods are taken  from the theory of hyperbolic billiards. In the second topic, we  shall study quasi-linear equations with random initial data and  random coefficients. These equations appear in some cosmological  problems. The analysis of statistical properties lead to new very  interesting problems in probability theory. The third topic deals  with some mathematical problems in the theory of quantum chaos.  This is a new direction in mathematical physics which can be very  promising.       In general, we shall deal with several basic problems in the  theory of chaos. The first one can be considered the most  important open problem in Hamiltonian dynamics and concerns the  appearance of chaotic behavior from pure deterministic laws of  motion. The second one deals with equations of continuous media  where the randomness is incorporated through initial data. It has  important applications in cosmology. The last one concerns a new  and difficult topic called quantum chaos and is of big interest  for physics and mathematics.  ***",
