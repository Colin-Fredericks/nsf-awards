 "awd_abstract_narration": "OCE93-14357  Williams            The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an Ocean  Sciences Instrumentation development project to develop a low-cost,  modular 3-D acoustic current meter for moored, upper ocean measure-  ments.  The development will be accomplished in incremental steps  building from the existing Benthic Acoustic Stress Sensor (BASS);  through a single sensor cable suspended instrument; to a self-  contained flux meter configuration; and finally to a modular,  expendable velocity sensor.  At each step, the prototype will be  tested in an experimental program.  The self-contained flux meter  will be tested in DOE's Ocean Margin Program, and the modular  velocity sensor will be tested as a Richardson number float in  association with a separate NSF project.  During at sea testing, an  acoustic vorticity meter will be deployed to measure the shear and  turbulence associated with 3-D coherent motions of the Langmuir  type.  Each prototype including the vorticity meter, will be tow or  tank tested to determine its flow distortion, wake obstruction,  vortex shedding and compass response.    Measurement of flow is a first order task in ocean studies, yet  except for several specialized studies such as turbulence in  boundary layer flows, one depends on two axis velocity measurements  from expensive (as opposed to expendable) current meters for this  flow determination.  There are now three general research areas  where 3-D current meters are needed: in near surface measurements  where coherent 3-D motions are present and where surface and  internal waves produce significant vertical flow; in transport  studies where the product of vector flow with a scalar quantity  must be averaged over time and depth and perhaps across a section;  and in vorticity resolving arrays for determining shear in the  presence of wave motions.  The most promising transitions to a 3-D  solution today are acoustic techniques and this project builds upon  experience with an acoustic vector veloc imeter to address each of  these tasks.",
