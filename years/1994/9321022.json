 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321022  Shannon  The importance of market imperfections such as externalities in  both theoretical and policy-oriented research can hardly be  overstated.  Many of the most important questions in  macroeconomics, such as determining the factors that affect long-  term growth or explaining observed differences in growth and  development rates across countries, either could not be  meaningfully posed or could not be satisfactorily answered until  market imperfections such as externalities in production and  capital accumulation or distortionary government taxing and  spending were incorporated into growth theory.  However, most of  this work addresses these issues in highly specialized models  such as representative agent models, or models with parametricly  specified time separable preferences and technologies.  If these  models are perturbed to allow for more interaction across periods  in preferences of technologies, is an entirely new analysis  necessary?  Are conclusions of this new analysis radically  different?  The purpose of this project is to obtain robust  answers to these same questions which depend as little as  possible on assumptions about preferences or production  technologies.  This is done by studying the existence,  comparative statistics, and determinacy of equilibria in general  equilibrium models with externalities and an infinite number of  commodities.  The project also develops new methods for  comparative statics analysis in problems with potential market  distortions or imperfections.",
