 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the renovation of space for the  Biochemistry Department at the Medical University of South Carolina.   Vacated space, located in the Basic Sciences Building, will be renovated into  modern research laboratories and biochemical support units.  Renovations  will include asbestos abatement, improving the HVAC system and installing  new casework and fume hoods to construct modern research laboratories,  with accompanying  shared biochemical support areas, and a transgenic  animal facility.  The project is the first step in the re-building of the  Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology into a strong central core  resource that will significantly enhance many diverse disciplines including  genetics, physiology, kinetics, immunology, pharmacology, organic chemistry,  and biophysics.  The renovation will be a vehicle in recruiting a structure- function biochemist and other faculty with expertise in  areas such as protein  biochemistry, enzymology, crystallography, and micro-sequencing synthesis.   Because of the fundamental nature of biochemistry as a discipline, the  improved research infrastructure will impact researchers at all levels of  education.  The university's proactive participation in research training  programs for postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school  teachers and students will be augmented through the re-building of its  biochemistry program.",
