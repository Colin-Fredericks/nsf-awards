 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reciprocal exchange of goods and services is a universal  characteristic of human society.  In animals, so-called  \"reciprocal altruism\" is a much-discussed yet much less  investigated issue.  Evidence accumulated over the past two  decades is based almost exclusively on observational  research.  Food sharing among capuchin monkeys (Cebus  apella) - one of the few primate species in which this  behavior is well-developed - may provide a handle on  reciprocal exchange as this behavior lends itself uniquely  to experimentation.  Available are thirteen adult subjects  (4 males and 9 females), group housed in two separate  indoor/outdoor enclosures.  Trained for temporary separation  from their group, the monkeys have shown high rates of food  transfer through a mesh partition during pair tests in which  one subject received food and the other did not.  The  proposed study employs this paradigm to determine the  voluntary character of food transfers, and the degree of  reciprocity.  Data will concern:  (1) spontaneous social  interactions, including interactions over food, in the group  context; and (2) the outcome of pair tests in which partner  combination, food type and quality, and other conditions are  systematically varied.  Behavior in the social group and in  the test situation will be compared in detail.  Results from  this study will show to what extent a non human species can  keep track of given and received favors, and develop the  sort of expectations and sense of obligation that underlie  human economic activity.  As such, the study may shed light  on the origin of a give-and-take mentality, and the  psychological mechanisms guiding its expression.",
