 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407864  Sharrock  This award addresses the general question of how plants sense the  environmental light cues that control their physiological and  developmental processes.  More specifically, the proposal tests a  model for the organization and function of a plant regulatory  photoreceptor system, the red/far red light-sensing phytochrome  family.  In this model, covalent linkage of a light-absorbing  chromophore to the diverse family of phytochrome (PHY) apoproteins  gives rise to a heterogeneous population of photoreceptors which  have differential roles in control of photomorphogenesis and may be  differentially expressed in various plant cell types.  Work from  the preceding grant has shown that five phytochrome apoproteins are  encoded by a PHY gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana and that  similar though not identical PHY gene families are present in all  flowering plants.  An understanding of the individual roles of the  phytochromes in light control of plant physiology and development  is clearly an important goal.  In the current funding period, major  emphasis is placed on analysis of the functions and the regulation  of the recently identified fourth and fifth Arabidopsis  phytochromes, PHYD and PHYE, and on the structural determinants of  phytochrome functional specificity.  The research directly  addresses basic questions concerning the organization of a plant  photoreceptor family and the mechanisms of light-activated plant  developmental responses.  Moreover, many phytochrome-controlled  responses are components of important agronomic traits such as seed  germinatiion, yield, and flowering time.  Hence, the phytochrome  receptors are likely targets for future modification in crop plants  via plant biotechnology.    ***",
