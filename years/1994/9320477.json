 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320477  Pyle    The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) is an international program of  basic research in the marine geosciences supported by the National  Science Foundation, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, a  consortium of Canada and Australia, and the European Science  Foundation (representing Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece,  Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland, and Turkey).  Scientific drilling operations began in  1985, following conversion of a state-of-the-art commercial  drilling vessel, the SEDCO/BP 471, for scientific drilling.   Renamed the JOIDES Resolution, the vessel carries fifty scientists,  students, and technicians from the member countries on each of its  two-month cruise legs.  The Resolution is a unique international  resource, representing the only scientific facility capable of  coring sedimentary and crustal material in the world's oceans.   Additionally, the ODP has developed a geochemical and geophysical  logging capability which is unsurpassed in industry or academia.   The ODP is managed through a contract between NSF and the Joint  Oceanographic Institutions, Inc. (JOI).  JOI has subcontracts with  Texas A&M University for management of scientific support and  drillship operations, and with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of  Columbia University for management of the logging program.    The first 52 legs of the program have examined the history of  global climate change in the equatorial and polar regions, the  early stages of continental rifting, fluid flow in sediments of  active margins, and the composition and alteration of the oceanic  crust.  Sediment samples cored from the Norwegian Sea, eastern  equatorial Atlantic, and Wedell Sea record synchronous change to  glacial conditions approximately 3 million years ago which marked  the beginning of northern hemisphere glaciation.  Drilling on the  Antarctic margin has traced the history of continental glaciation  back to at least the early Oligocene and possibly late Eocen e, 42  million years ago.  Drilling results in the northwest Indian Ocean  are being used to correlate the initiation of monsoon circulation  with uplift of the Himalayas.  Seismic reflection records from  rifted continental margins often record parallel, dipping  reflectors.  ODP drilling on the Norwegian margin has shown that  these reflectors are basalt flows that form during continental  rifting and gradually change in chemistry from continental to  oceanic as rifting proceeds.  Drilling along the Antilles,  Peruvian, Japanese trenches, as well as the Cascadia margin off  Canada and Oregon, has documented the importance of fluid transport  to the deformation and alteration of margin sediments.    New ODP developments in drilling and instrument technology have  allowed coring of unsedimented oceanic crust.  A 500-meter core  into the lower oceanic crust of the Indian Ocean records the  successive formation and solidification of magma chambers along the  Indian Ocean spreading center.  A major surprise was the high  magnetization of these lower crustal rocks,  which is at odds with  existing models for the formation of sea-floor magnetic anomalies.   In the eastern equatorial Pacific ODP has initiated attempts to use  mining drilling techniques to drill young ocean floor.  Although  the initial drilling results were disappointing, development of  this new technology for ocean drilling will be continued.   Deployment of down-hole instrument packages for long-term  measurement of crustal conditions and processes are an important  new objective of the program.  In recent years, close collaboration  with Global Seismic Network planning has lead to initial deployment  of long-period, digital seismometers in ODP boreholes.  Temperature   and pressure sensors have been deployed in holes drilled into an  active hydrothermal system on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and a modern  accretionary wedge on the Cascadia Margin in the Northeast Pacific.   Data from these instruments are being recovered using submersib les  and remote vehicles.  Additional experiments will be deployed in  boreholes drilled in the Atlantic Ocean in 1994.    The Ocean Drilling Program began a four year drilling program in  the Atlantic Ocean in early 1993.  The major scientific problems to  be addressed during this period include oceanographic and climate  change of the Arctic during the Neogene, the formation of rifted  continental margins, changes in equatorial circulation and  productivity, the composition of the lower crust, the history of  sea-level fluctuations during non-glacial periods of the Tertiary,  and the formation of metal-rich sulfide deposits along the Mid-  Atlantic Ridge.     Although drilling operations are supported by the six members of  the ODP, each member country independently provides support for the  research efforts of its scientists participating in the program.   This award will continue support to the Joint Oceanographic  Institutions, Inc. to provide a number of services in support of  the U.S. Scientific community involved in the ODP.  These  activities include:    (1)  Planning activities to refine the major long-range objectives       of the ODP and develop the optimal drilling strategies needed       to achieve these objectives.  These activities include support       for workshops, U.S. participation in JOIDES (Joint       Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling) panels and       committees, and U.S. participation in international       conferences on scientific ocean drilling.    (2)  Small contracts in support of site augmentation and data       syntheses.  This provides support for the  participation of       U.S. scientists on non-U.S. site surveys and  site specific       science on ships of opportunity.      (3)  Educational programs that target students at all levels:       particularly a strong graduate fellowship program that       encourages PhD candidates to conduct research related to ODP       and encourages their participation on drilling legs.    (4)  Initial operati onal support for a wireline re-entry system,       developed by the program enabling scientists to use DSDP and       ODP boreholes for downhole experiments after the drillship has       left the area.      (5)  Support for U.S. scientists participating on the shipboard       scientific team and for necessary follow-up studies related to       publication of the Initial Report for each drill leg.     (6)  Support the dissemination of ODP results.  This includes       symposia enabling scientists to discuss ODP drilling results       and to publish symposia results volumes.      (7)  Support for the administration required by the U.S. Science       Support Program, including a national advisory committee to       provide guidance and focus for U.S. science activities       associated with ODP.  ***",
