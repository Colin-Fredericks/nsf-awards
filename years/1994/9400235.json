The program of Friedlander and others holds promise in  that it introduces a new perspective and imports techniques of  algebraic topology.  Several specific avenues of research appear  ripe for further exploration: topological filtrations on  algebraic cycles and homology, duality between Lawson homology  and morphic cohomology, motivic complexes in the guise of  algebraic cycle homology, and Chern classes in the context of  algebraic cycle spaces.  In addition to this study of algebraic  cycles, Friedlander will continue his efforts to study the  geometry implicit in the cohomology of infinitesimal algebraic  groups.  Priddy plans to continue his program to study the  homotopy type of classifying spaces of groups and related  constructions.  Many of the most important questions in homotopy  theory are related to classifying spaces of finite or compact Lie  groups.  Recently there have also developed interesting and  powerful connections between topology and group theory,  especially the cohomology and modular representation  theory of finite groups.  With the solution of the Segal and  Sullivan Conjectures, this area has developed rapidly in recent  years to the point where fundamental questions are being  answered.  Perhaps the most important of these is to determine  the exact relationship between the stable and unstable homotopy  types of a classifying space, completed at a prime p, and the  p-local structure of its underlying group.       Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets of  polynomial equations (i.e., algebraic varieties) using geometric  techniques.  Partial answers to questions in algebraic geometry  have led to progress in fields ranging from complexity theory of  computer science to geometric topology to number theory.   Friedlander intends to study algebraic varieties, using methods  borrowed from algebraic  topology, as well as modern techniques of  algebraic geometry.  The use of topology involves the study of  continuously varying families of structures, which have  traditionally been considered by other means.  The hope is that  these new techniques will offer insight into deep and  long-standing problems of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology  is the study of geometric objects by means of algebraic  techniques.  Exciting new developments have led to advances in  group theory, using algebraic topology, thus reversing the  direction of the usual flow of information.  Groups are the  fundamental symmetries occurring in all sciences, including areas  involving codes, and structures in physics.  Priddy hopes that  this new approach will lead to a better understanding of the  relationship between these fields.  ***",
