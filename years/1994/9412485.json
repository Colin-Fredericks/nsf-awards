 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412485  Fackler  This award supports the participation of twenty U.S. scientists  and science educators in the first Gordon Conference on Science  Education to be held in Europe.  The subject is the impact of  new technologies on science education, with particular  reference to the visualization of concepts and molecular  structures.  The meeting is co-organized by Professors John  Fackler of Texas A & M University and W. Gerhard Pohl of Linz,  Austria.  It will take place in late September, 1994, at the  Swabian Conference Center in Irsee, Germany, with European  participants significantly outnumbering American participants.   The conference program was organized along the very successful  Gordon Research Conference procedures.  This includes bringing  together research scientists and educators for critical  examination of various initiatives in science education, in an  atmosphere that is conducive to generating joint ventures  between research scientists and educators.    Sharing of ideas world wide is as important in science  education as it is in scientific research.  The U.S. has no  monopoly on effective methodologies.  The European site of the  meeting was chosen with the specific objective of introducing  U.S. participants to the variety of novel approaches being  taken by European science educators.  The U.S. participants are  expected to gain many new contacts and ideas for strengthening  programs in science education in the U.S.  ***",
