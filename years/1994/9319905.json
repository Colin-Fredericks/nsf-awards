 "awd_abstract_narration": "Edelman  9319905        This project involves a cultural anthropologist from Yale  University in a set of interviews with representatives of peasant  organizations from six central American countries: Panama, Costa  Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  By  getting information about the concerns and experiences of members  of these peasant groups, the investigator will evaluate three  theories of collective action: the historical-structural,  resource mobilization, and new social movement theories.  The  main hypothesis to be tested is that the peasant movements were  influenced more by grass-roots concerns than by foreign donor  influences.       This research is important because emerging connections  between peasant groups, across international borders, makes a  regional perspective necessary in understanding political  developments in Central America.  This project will combine in-  depth anthropological knowledge to advance our understanding of  issues concerning peasant organizations with increased knowledge  of regional differences and similarities in this important area  of the hemisphere.  ***",
