 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320150  Sozen  This project will investigate the effect on frame response  of two parameters:  (a) high-strength concrete and (b)  column yielding. Physical data to support the currently  existing hypotheses about the effects of high strength  concrete and column yielding are lacking. Although the two  parameters are of different classes (one a material property  and the other a design option), lack of general theoretical  understanding in either case leads to the same effect of  constricting choices in earthquake-resistant design of  reinforced concrete buildings.    The proposed ten test specimens of reinforced column-girder  assemblies have been designed to capture the essential  features of reinforced concrete frames responding to  earthquake excitation primarily in the plane of the frame.  Sizes, materials, and loading rates will be selected to  reduce scale effects to a minimum within the limits of the  experimental facilities.  The experimental variables are (1)  Concrete strength, nominally 5,000 and 10, 000 psi; (2)  axial unit stress in column, 850 and 1700 psi or one half of  \"balanced load\", and (3) location of yielding, in the column  or in the girder.    The research is expected to provide:  (1) direct conclusions  about the effects of the test variables; (2) testing of the  currently available hysteresis algorithms using the data  from the investigation; (3) development, if necessary, of  new hysteresis algorithms to reflect the observed  deformations of the column, the girder, and the joint; (4)  definition of the domains of confident applicability for the  hysteresis algorithms tested or developed; (5) parametric  studies of the effects of concrete strength and column  yielding on frame response to serve as the base for  development of simple design procedures; (6) recommendations  of design procedures with defined limits of applicability.  ***",
