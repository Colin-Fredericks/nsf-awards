In general, there exists legal responsibility or  culpability only if there is a causal connection between  defendants' behavior and alleged harms.  Questions of causation  also play a central role in science and technology.  The overall  aim of the proposed research is an analysis of the importation of  causal knowledge from science and technology to the law.  The major  questions to be dealt with are:  (1) what opportunities does the  law provide for the incorporation of relevant scientific and  technological causal knowledge, and (2) are these opportunities  sufficient for the just resolution of legal controversy?  In order  to begin to answer such questions, the principal investigator will  isolate the differing ways that value judgments are built into  causal claims in the law.  The presence of such value judgments  should reflect itself in difficulties that the law has in the  utilization of scientific causal knowledge.  The analysis of these  difficulties will allow the investigator to test a proposal of  legal scholars to conceive the law as operating with an initial set  of causal paradigms which have built in both objective and  normative aspects.  The problem for this approach is to determine  the process whereby the initial set of causal paradigms gets  applied as well as expanded or modified.  The investigator does not  believe in a unique and consistent set of fundamental principles  that determines or controls this process.  This belief is motivated  by recent advances in the understanding of language, argumentation,  and science.  These advances, and changes in the law itself --  expansion in the kinds of causal claims made and the types of legal  action now permitted -- make the situation ripe for reconsideration  and analysis of the kind proposed.  This phase of the research will  result in one or more articles providing a detailed look at how   probabilistic considerations  affect the processes described  above,and how a Bayesian approach can be brought to bear on the  analysis.  ***",
