Evolutionary  theory and experimental evidence suggest that the amount of  time and energy invested in the care-taking of offspring may  strongly influence the options available to each sex.  Such  differences may have favored the expression of different  behaviors in males and females.    Among those animal species that show parental care, females  usually provide the bulk of such care, leaving males free to  increase their biological success through additional  matings.  Under such conditions, natural selection might be  expected to have favored the development of different  strategies in the two sexes.  This has led to hypotheses  about why the sexes often adopt different roles during  interactions, why behavioral conflict between mates is so  common, and what forms of behavioral resolution can be  expected in such conflicts.    These ideas can be subjected to particularly critical test  by studying species in which care-taking responsibilities  are reversed from the \"norm\".  Dr. Emlen is studying an  extreme example of such a species, in which males look after  all offspring care and females increase their biological  success by having multiple male mates.  This research will  carefully document the behavioral roles adopted by males and  females and the contexts in which different roles are  expressed.  This will increase scientific understanding of  why particular forms of behavior are favored by one sex over  the other, and of the evolutionary role of the expression of  such behaviors.",
