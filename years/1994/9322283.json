The  Institute of Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IES-REU) program  immerses students in a highly interactive, research-oriented environment.  Our major tenet is  that success in science depends on understanding the context of research, as well as the  substance and procedures of a particular discipline.  Program goals are: (1) to provide  intensive training in ecological research: (2) to broaden students' perspectives on the societal,  ethical and theoretical contexts of science: and (3) to give students direct exposure to the life  of a research scientist.  Eight students will be brought to the Institute for a twelve-week  program in each of the next three summers, building upon the strengths of  highly successful  1988-1993 programs.  The program  includes the following components: (1) Student  Research Projects; (2) Research Strategies for the Undergraduate, providing explicit training  in and reflection on the research process; (3) Research in Context, involving a diverse set of  programs and activities to broaden students' perspectives on the various contexts and  applications of science; (4) a full-day Forum on Opportunities in Ecology to expose students  to a broad range of perspectives on the role of ecology and ecologists in the modem world;  (5) Supporting Activities, for group-building, exposure to ecology, etc.; and (6) Assessment  of Student Growth, both to guide the program and to gauge the breadth and quality of impacts  on student career development and their confidence, competence and understanding of  science.  Under the guidance of a mentor scientist, each student delineates a research question  and associated hypotheses. selects appropriate methods, and develops a research plan.   Students then implement the project, ending with analysis and report writing.  Presentations in  a formal Research Symposium conclude the summer program.  Final pa pers will be collated  and published as an IES Miscellaneous Publication.  ***",
