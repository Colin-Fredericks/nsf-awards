 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450363  Northwestern Univ  Evanston, IL  Goodnight, Lynn    \"National High School Institute Engineering, Science & Mathematics  Summer Program for Young Teens\"    The National High School Institute of Northwestern University  appeals to the National Science Foundation for support of an  exciting new program.  The NHSI's Engineering and Science Program  for Young Teens, will make it possible for 50 adolesents each year  (total of 150) to participate in a five-week, academic program  aimed at nurturing their interests in engineering, science and  mathematics, free of charge.  This program will be piloted in the  summer of 1994; we seek NSF funding for 1995, 1996 and 1997.    This tuition-free program will be presented June 26-July 30 in 1994  and June 25-July 29, 1995, with other dates TBA.  Children entering  7th, 8th and 9th grades will be selected through close  communication with the Chicago Public Schoolsand the Chicago Board  of Education, with the aim of identifying talented minority  children who are economically at-risk.  Special aspects of this  program include the large pool of needy Chicago children, the  strong asset of Northwestern's resources, and the 63-year  successful tradition of the national High School Institute.    The inter-disciplinary curriculum will include classroom time, lab  sessions and research projects, career exploration activities, and  field trips.  Examples of mini-courses for the first year include  \"Forensic Science: Chemistry and Crime Solving,\" \"Astronomy and  Space Science,\" and \"Computer Programming in C.\"    The Faculty will be drawn from Northwestern University's acclaimed  McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and the College  of Arts and Sciences, assisted by eight graduate students.  The  program will be located at Northwestern University's Chicago and  Evanston campuses, with buses picking up the participants from  neghborhood locations.  Designed to encourage and support these  young teens, the program provides opportunities for f ocused  learning, peer and family involvement, and career counselling.  ***",
