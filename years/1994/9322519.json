The central model is the quantum Chern-Simons  theory with various generalizations to higher-dimensional and  non-commutative settings.  The method of Feynman diagrams gives  new invariants of knots, manifolds and new cohomology classes of  classifying spaces of diffeomorphism groups.  A non-commutative  version of the Chern-Simons theory produces cohomology classes of  moduli spaces of complex algebraic curves.  It will be applied to  algebraic construction of Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic  manifolds and to mirror symmetry.       The project applies a computational scheme developed  several decades ago in particle physics and thermodynamics  (Feynman diagrams) in various domains of modern mathematics.   Feynman graphs (visualized as spider webs) turn out to be a very  powerful tool which relates many abstract algebraic structures to  geometric and topological objects of different dimensions.  One  of the recent applications was a new series of knot invariants  (i.e. quantities distinguishing closed lines in the space without  self-intersections).  These new invariants are the first ones  which are really computable via fast working algorithms, and  they can be applicable in hydrodynamics and chemistry of long  molecules. In general, the project gives a unified view on  several parts of mathematics.  There are many strong evidences  that it leads to an understanding of so called \"mirror symmetry,\"  one of the deepest discoveries of recent years in string theory,  which is a mathematical theory treating gravitation in a quantum  mechanical setting.  ***",
