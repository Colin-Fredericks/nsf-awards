This ordering phenomenon has only  recently been discovered, and is of great basic interest since  ordering is thought to be intimately connected with the surface  processes occurring during growth, and because ordering changes  fundamental materials properties such as the band gap of the  disordered alloy.  Recent work has indicated that surface  reconstruction and the motion of steps on the surface control the  ordering process. Unfortunately, many of the observations leading  to the ordering models are indirect.  The proposed research  attempts to directly relate surface features such as reconstruction  and steps to ordering, and to simultaneously monitor optical and  electrical properties of the resulting material.  %%%  At present, detailed understanding of the surface structure  during vapor phase epitaxial crystal growth is generally poor. The  proposed research will significantly benefit our basic  understanding, control, and general ability to improve epitaxial  growth processes.   The research also has significant technological  relevance; results from this research are expected to be useful  in a variety of ways in developing and bringing advanced  electronic and photonic device concepts to fruition.  It will  likely be useful for achieving photon and carrier confinement,  and for the intentional reduction of the energy band gap for  infrared photonic devices. Ordering is also expected to lead to  enhancement of free carrier mobilities by eliminating alloy  scattering.  The research is expected to have a positive impact  on the general areas of telecommunications, information  processing; and high speed computing.  ***",
