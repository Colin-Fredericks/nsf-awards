 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360215 Bayless          The measurement of bulk density as a function of position in boreholes is of major importance for determining the characteristics of geological formations.  The best approach for measuring bulk density involves the scattering of high energy photons in the formation by Compton processes.  However, only radioactive gamma ray sources are currently available for use in both measurement while drilling (MWD) and wireline density instruments.  These involve substantial concerns with safety and environmental contamination.  We propose to perform the research necessary to develop an x ray source, termed the Double ended X ray Tube (DXT), for MWD applications.  This novel, compact source is expected to offer absolute safety and improved measurement accuracy in the highly stressing MWD environment.  The overall objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the DXT concept.  This will be accomplished by performing three tasks:   (1) design and assemble a DXT experiment for operation at high voltage; (2) perform tests to evaluate and demonstrate the DXT operating characteristics with the goal and (3) develop the conceptual design for a low cost DXT system for MWD applications.  A leading MWD logging company will participate in Task 3 and provide an overall technical review of the project.  If successful, the Phase I results will form a firm foundation for the development and demonstration of a laboratory prototype DXT system in Phase II.",
