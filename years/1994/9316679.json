Sablik of the  Instrumentation and Space Research Division of the Southwest  Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, for a one month visit  to Australia in order to conduct collaborative research with        Dr. Richard Langman at the University of Tasmania. The focus of  the research is to develop a new model for stress measurement.    Dr. Sablik will use his experience with magnetomechanical  hysteresis modeling to account for results obtained with the  rotation method, a magnetic technique originated by Dr. Langman  for measuring stress in magnetic materials, in particular in  cases of biaxial stress. The project results are expected to be  useful for measuring stresses in railroad wheels and for  measuring stresses in gas and oil pipelines. Such stress  measurements would be most beneficial to railroad and pipeline  operators in helping to detect high stress situations which might  lead to rupture, and thereby enable timely remedial action to be  taken.",
