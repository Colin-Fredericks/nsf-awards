In our first study, we will  look at how chemistry faculty members understand chemical  equllibrium, particularly as it is expressed in various qualitative  and quantitative representations, and compare this to the way of  college students represent their understanding. In our second study  we will look at how the understanding of students can be improved  by using multiple linked representations.  We have developed a  prototype interactive multitmedia environment called MultiMedia and  Mental Models in Chemistry ($M:Chem). It allows users to operate on  chemical systems and observe the results in multiple, dynamic,  synchronized windows which include a video of the reacton as it  occurs on the lab bench., verbal descriptions, molecular-level  animations, and dynamic graphs.  We will use this to see how  student understanding might be improved by promoting linkages among  multiple representations of chemical phenomena.  We will also  investigate how professors and students use it in lecture and  laboratory classrooms. Potentially, our findings will contribute to  a theory of multimendia concept formation and use, and to changes  in colloege chemistry curricula, pedagogy, and assessment.  ***",
