 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402547  Suckewer  The goal of this project is to develop a VUV laser with an output  lasing wavelength near 60 nm.  Because its photon energy (~20eV)  matches molecular bonding energies and is typical of the energy  values used in photoelectron spectroscopy, there will be several  very important applications for a source of this type in chemical  research.  Ultimately we envision the development of a practical  laboratory-size instrument with output power at a wavelength of  ~60 nm which exceeds any present source,including synchrotrons.  Our prototypes will be used in experiments conducted in  collaboration with Prof. G. Scoles and his group in the Chemistry  Department for (a) high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy at  high dilution and (b) mass spectroscopy and time-of-flight  molecular beam experiments.  This laser may also become an  important device for material science research particularly in  the study of photoelectron effects in semiconductors and for  solid state physics in general.  As has been the case with other  laser developments, success may lead to many unexpected  applications perhaps opening up new areas of physics and  chemistry.  Our proposal for the development of VUV laser in MoVII uses the  photopumping scheme of Feldman and Reader. The scheme is based on  their observation of a unique line coincidence for two different  ions of the same element, namely the MoII line at 13.65 nm which  coincides with a MoVII line.  Both line are strongly coupled to  the ground state.  This makes them a suitable pair to be  exploited for the photopumping scheme i.e. for the creation of a  population inversion and gain on the 4p56s-4p55p transitions in  MoVII at a wavelength near 60nm.  ***",
