It goal is to provide a constructive approach  to the existence and identification of Markov controls for adaptive and singular  control problems.  The mathematical tools developed extend and provide a new  approach to the solution of stochastic control problems. The focus will be on linear  programming (LP) methods which arise naturally when the objective is to optimize  a long-term average criterion. These LP methods will be extended to finite horizon  and infinite horizon discounted criteria. A direct characterization of the stationary  distributions identifies Markov controls and allows the value to be obtained as the  solution of an infinite-dimensional LP rather than as a solution to the  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation. The form of the constraints  leads to a natural approximation procedure which allows numerical computation of  nearly optimal controls.       This project is supported jointly by the Applied Mathematics Program and  the Statistics and Probability Program. Its goal is the development of a new,  constructive approach to the solution of adaptive and singular stochastic control  problems and of approximation procedures for the numerical computation of nearly  optimal controls. This research is expected to have many important applications.   Two such example are the task of managing a portfolio of stocks so as to optimize  some financial goal, and the problem of valuing options. The theory of option  pricing is well-understood when there are no transaction costs, but existing  methods are no longer appropriate when costs are part of the transaction. Other  examples of adaptive control applications range from robotic manipulators to flight  contpol systems of high-performance aircraft. All these systems have to operate  over a wide range of working conditions, leading to great variability in the system  paramete rs.  The complexity of these systems requires the implementation of  adaptive controllers. The practical implementation of the controls further requires  sophisticated numerical methods to find nearly optimal adaptive controllers.",
