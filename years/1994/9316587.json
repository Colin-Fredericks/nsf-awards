 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316587  Ingersent  This proposal concerns the physics arising out of interactions  between magnetic impurities embedded in non-magnetic materials.  Specifically, the behavior of multi-band Kondo and Anderson models  are to be studied. Marginal-Fermi-liquid behavior (a suggestion for  the normal state of the high Tc materials) is observed for multi-  band Kondo and Anderson models, but recent numerical  renormalization-group calculations show that when interaction is  allowed between impurities, Fermi-liquid behavior is recovered. The  PI proposes to expand this work to more complex and/or realistic  models and to frustrated magnetic systems coupled to multiple  bands.  %%%  This work concerns elucidation of the behavior of models which have  been put forward to describe the electronic properties of materials  containing heavy magnetic elements such as the recently discovered  high temperature superconductors. Discussion here has revolved  around what is the appropriate zeroth order description of the  electronic states of such materials. Some of the putative models,  at their simplest give certain types of unusual behaviors but the  PI has shown that as these models are made more \"realistic\", then  behavior tends to revert to the more usual descriptions with which  traditional solid state physics is more familiar. The PI will  continue this work towards ever more realistic descriptions.  ***",
