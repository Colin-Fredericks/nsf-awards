 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414585  Asada       In the design of high speed mechatronic systems, such as disk  drives, chip placement machines and three-dimensional coordinate  measurement machines, an integrated approach to the optimization of  mechanical structures, actuators and sensors together with  controllers is increasingly important.  There are significant  interplays and trade-offs between mechanical design and control  design, which must be considered carefully to optimize the total  system performance. This research will establish a novel method for  the integrated design of high speed mechatronic systems.       To overcome the difficulty of obtaining exact analytic models,  this project incorporates prototyping and experimentation into the  design process. Based on a model verified through experiments, the  design is modified, and its performance improvement is examined  through prototyping and experimentation.  This project forms a  closed-loop recursive process comprising design modification,  prototyping, and experimentation.  In each recursion, a prototype  control system is tested experimentally, the system model is  corrected and refined based on the data, design trade-offs are made  to determine an optimal design change, and the prototype is  physically modified in accordance with the determined design  change.",
