 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452436  Near                                 Seven years ago the publication of Toward a Lean and Lively  Calculus (1986) launched a significant reform of the nation's  calculus curriculum, however, comparable reform has not been  generally introduced in technical mathematics. Technical  mathematics is designed for students in associate degree programs  such as architectural construction, computer information systems,  electrical/electronics technology, energy technology, industrial  drafting, manufacturing engineering, and robotics. It is the only  college math course taken by approximately 100,000 of the nation's  community college students prior to their entry in the workplace.  This project ties in with an award to Henry Ford Community College  by Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) to  incorporate the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  Standards in the technical mathematics sequence. Henry Ford  Community College's pilot program also creates a context for  cooperation between career education faculty and mathematics  faculty in the development of applied real-life problems that are  being used as activities within the redesigned course.  Representatives from companies such as Ford Motor, AC Delco, and  Kerr Manufacturing are participating in designing Activities that  incorporate industrial applications. The activities use  computer-assisted programs such as MathCad and Geometer's Sketchpad  to encourage students to collect evidence, to problem solve, and to  work collaboratively.",
