 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451368  Philpotts  Electronic total stations are now used almost exclusively for  routine engineering surveys, but they have not yet been used widely  in geology, despite their obvious potential.  Many geological  features, such as outcrops, geological contacts, etc., are  irregular and require large numbers of surveyed points for accurate  definition.  This type of detail can now be collected rapidly and  stored directly into portable computers with electronic total  stations.  The data, which can be output as x, y, z coordinates,  can be used not only to construct geological maps directly in the  field, but also to determine the attitude of layering and the  orientation of structures.  The data can also be transferred  rapidly to geographic information systems (GIS) for computer  assisted cartography.  These instruments are also easily operated,  and require less skill and practice than did their predecessors- -  the chain and transit.  The significant increase in accuracy and  amount of data on geological maps made with a total station is  likely to open up entirely new ways of analyzing geological  structures.  The Department of Geology and Geophysics is using four  total stations which, with the one that it already owns, allow  total-station-mapping to become an integral part of its Geology  Field Course.  This four-week total immersion field school, the  only one offered by a public university in New England, typically  enrolls about twenty undergraduates, including all geology majors,  some civil engineers and natural resource majors, and some students  from other universities.  This project resulted from a feasibility  study in which two undergraduates undertook an independent mapping  project using the Department's total station. The resulting map was  so outstanding that the Department was convinced that all geology  field courses should teach the use of total stations.  To this end,  the Department is planning a technical session and a short course  on the total station in geological  mapping for the 1995  Northeastern Geological Society of America meeting, which it is  hosting.",
