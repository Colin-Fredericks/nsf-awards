For example, people seem to prefer and choose  relationship partners who confirm and validate their self-views.  This occur seven if their self-views are negative: in one study,  married people with negative self-views committed themselves to  spouses who held them in low esteem. Their behaviors, then, are  reminiscent of Groucho Marz's quip, \"I'd never join a club that  would have me as a member.\" The investigators have studied these  processes with emphasis on specifying why people with negative  self-views behave as they do. They have also considered how these  activities may make it difficult to change people's self-views.  One remaining puzzle concerns the conflicted feelings people with  negative self-views have about the evaluations they receive. On  the one hand, such persons prefer and seek unfavorable  evaluations. Nevertheless,they feel terrible when they actually  receive such evaluations! The investigators hope to find out why  people with negative self-views routinely behave in ways that  generate such ambivalence. They will also try to determine the  conditions under which they will break out of such vicious  cycles. This research is designed to provide a deeper  understanding of the feelings and thoughts that underlie the  self-defeating behaviors of people with negative self-views. As  such, it is likely to provide a perspective on these behaviors  that is ultimately useful in developing strategies of prevention.",
