Faculty in the Department of  Mathematics are extending this model of calculus reform by  undertaking tasks representing adaption, assessment, faculty and  graduate student development, components for pre-service teachers,  and dissemination.  The St. Olaf first-year calculus model is being  adapted and extended to fit a large, comprehensive university  setting including the range of difficulties implied by this (large  lecture with recitation, GTA-taught classes, honors classes in an  open-admission university, etc.).  The project includes the development of a model for GTA training  along with supporting materials and training videotapes, a model  for faculty development, including materials, suitable for  sustaining such a calculus program, and careful assessment of  student performance.  Reports on assessment and evaluation will be  useful to other comprehensive universities seeking similar reforms.   An important component addresses pre-service secondary mathematics  students: adaptation of the GTA training materials for prospective  mathematics teachers; training experiments involving pre-service  students; participation in GTA training sessions; and, observations  both in university classes and in a local high school which has  adopted the St. Olaf's model for calculus.   Dissemination plans include packaging materials for dissemination,  production of written materials, and visits and locally held  workshops.  At least one monograph will be prepared for  publication.",
