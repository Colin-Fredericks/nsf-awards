 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410068  Bentley             Establishment of the appropriate connections between neurons in the developing nervous system depends upon the ability of neurons to migrate and to extend processes accurately to distant target cells.  Effective guidance depends upon the ability of the tip of neuronal processes (the nerve growth cone) to detect guidance information and to respond by appropriate direction change, or steering.  The purpose of this research is to analyze the molecular mechanisms that underlie growth cone steering.  These studies will investigate the pathfinding of a single neuron in the methathoracic limb bud of an insect to test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the steering of neuronal growth cones.  Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies will be injected into the growth cone and their effects on pathfinding will be determined. Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase genes will then be cloned and used to alter the function of the system.  The results will be of fundamental importance in understanding the processes that are involved in establishing connections between nerve cells during development, in vertebrates as well as invertebrates.",
