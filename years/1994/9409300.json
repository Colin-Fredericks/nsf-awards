 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409300  Aldrich    This Doctoral dissertation Research Support project examines  congressional oversight of federal bureaucratic agencies.  It  aims to answer several questions, including:  To what extent do  members of Congress engage in supervision of bureaucratic  behavior themselves, as opposed to delegating oversight authority  to interest groups affected by agency decisions?  How effective  are various forms of oversight in constraining agency discretion?   The project's central hypothesis is that political influence on  bureaucratic behavior is most prevalent and effective not through  formal mechanisms such as congressional subcommittee hearings,  but through informal channels such as meetings between  bureaucrats and interest groups affected by agency rules.    The project tests this theoretical proposition by focusing on a  major health care issue:  payments by the Medicare program to  physicians treating Medicate patients.  In 1989, Congress  mandated the development of a fee schedule, a payment mechanism  which prospectively sets the amounts that Medicate pays for all  physician services.  Through a series of regression equations,  this project assesses the impact of various types of formal and  informal oversight on the setting of payment levels.  These  results are significant in that they represent one of the first  empirical examinations of congressional oversight and provide  insight into the politics of health care reform.",
