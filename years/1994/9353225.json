The program is essentially underway and  includes well over one-hundred institutions nationwide.  These  institutions designate a representative who interfaces with NCSA  for support and resources.  Under this project, the program is  extended to educational organizations.  The initial four  Educational Affiliates would be the Montana State Mathematics  Network, the Texas Education Agency, the Kansas ShareNet and one  school system.  Through working with these organization, NCSA will  learn what types of supports are necessary for educational  institutions using technology.    The goals of the program are to insure computer literacy and  integration of networking and visualization into normal school  activities, to improve science and mathematics education for all  students, and to provide opportunities for interested students and  teachers to engage in special research or exploration projects  using HPCC technology.  The project provides local first level  awareness; integrates this support with regular activities  available for teachers, students and schools; and creates a  mechanism for additional activities.    The cost sharing includes salaries of the Principal Investigators,  the space, access to NCSA responses, and space/staff for workshops,  institutes and seminars.  It is estimated at 20%",
