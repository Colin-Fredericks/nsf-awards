 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this work is to understand how the  hormonal and developmental signals which control the process  of seed maturation in plants are integrated into the larger  program of plant embryogenesis.  This investigator proposes  to continue his analysis of a key regulatory gene in this  pathway identified by the vp1 mutant of maize and its  apparent homolog, ABI3, in Arabidopsis.  The functional  complexity of VP1 suggests that interactions with other  protein factors play a central role in its function.  The  P.I. will use both biochemical and genetic approaches that  will identify and allow him to clone genes which may  interact with VP1 and ABI3.  Though VP1 and ABI3 share  significant homology, the proteins are highly divergent in  regions known to be functionally important in VP1.  The P.I.  will also determine the extent to which VP1 and ABI3  sequences are functionally interchangeable in maize cells  and in transgenic Arabidopsis.  This will also provide a  functional map of ABI3, comparable to that in hand for VP1;  it will also aid in bringing the genetics available in  Arabidopsis to bear on the maturation pathway and ABI3  function.  The P.I. also plans to analyze new mutants in the  maturation pathway identified in both maize and Arabidopsis.  He is specifically interested in identifying new mutations  that affect VP1 or ABI3 expression or function.",
