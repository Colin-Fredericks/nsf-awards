 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411162  Lau      During election campaigns voters are exposed to large amounts of  information about candidates.  In some cases voters can choose  whether to pay attention, while in other cases the information is  so ubiquitous that voters can hardly avoid it.  But in all cases,  the flow of information is dynamic, one day information of a  candidate's position on an issue is readily available, the next  day it can hardly be found.  Yet, researchers use static surveys  as the method of choice for studying campaigns.  Surveys,  however, can only capture a single point in time, relying  generally on the voters' memories of what they have seen and paid  attention to.  The elections's dynamic nature is missing.  One  important result of this mismatch is that while we can make good  predictions of the vote choice, we cannot do nearly as good a job  describing how voters come to their choice.    This Doctoral Dissertation research project is designed to  develop a better understanding of the vote decision process by  using a dynamic, computer-based methodology to trace information  acquisition and decision-making while it is occurring.  In  particular, the question of whether voters employ an \"on-line\" or  a \"memory-based\" evaluation process will be explored.   Traditional voting models all suggest a memory-based model, where  voters store information about candidates during the campaign and  search the contents of memory in order to evaluate and choose at  the \"moment-of-decision.\"  Were the model correct, then surveys  conducted near the time of decision would be an ideal methodology  for studying the vote decision because memories could be  accurately recalled.  The on-line model argues instead that  voters maintain an \"on-line tally\" representing the current  evaluation of a candidate; when the time comes to make a choice,  voters need not search memory for detailed information.  Indeed,  that information has often been forgotten.  Instead, they merely  recall the tally associated with each candi date and choose  accordingly.",
