 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414487  Fourer       This research focuses on the identification and investigation  of difficult conceptual issues that must be resolved in designing  languages, interfaces, and algorithms for a broad classes of  combinatorial optimization problems.  The research aims to identify  strategies for transferring discrete optimization technology to a  broad range of users and to design general-purpose languages and  environment that support application development in discrete  optimization.  The foundation of the research is provided by two  system design elements, the algebraic modeling language and the  algebraic toolkit, that have been used in the development of  software in statistics and continuous optimization problems.  This  work will jointly consider the issue of representation and  algorithms in developing the general-purpose software for  combinatorial optimization.       The research will have direct practical value to engineering  education and the American industry.  American industries engage  daily in resolving problems that are combinatorial in nature.  The  outcome of this research will facilitate the ease of use of  explicit models and powerful optimization technologies to resolve  these problems.  Industry will also benefit from the quality  solution that can be obtained from the use of optimization models  as against heuristic algorithms.  From the engineering education  view point, development of a general-purpose modeling software will  play a key role in the teaching of large-scale optimization.  This  will allow student to formulate, solve, and analyze realistically  large and complex models instead of dealing with textbook type  problems that are generally small and contrived.",
