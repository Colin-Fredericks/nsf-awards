The U.S. Team is  headed by Dr. John Peoples, Director of  Fermilab, and Dr. Paul D. Grannis from the  University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.  The  scientist and graduate students from Delhi  University will participate in the D0 research  program at Fermilab.  This will consist in part  in running the experiment during the data-  taking periods, taking responsibility for  operation of specific detector systems during  the run, analyzing data from the run and  preparing physics results.  The Delhi group is  expected to provide needed expertise to the  design of software systems needed for offline  computer analysis of data, design and  maintenance of the databases characterizing the  detector elements, run conditions and analysis  parameters, sorting these data into the  requisite 'streams', and serving them to  individual physicist users.  They also will be  responsible for specific projects directed at  the upgrade phase of the D0 experiment.    Scope:  This collaborative project brings  technical man-power capabilities from India, as  well as equipment provided from Indian sources,  to participate with American scientists in the  particle physics studies carried out at  Fermilab.  It meets the objectives of INT by  supporting cooperative activities.   ***",
