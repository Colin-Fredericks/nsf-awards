 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Elementary Lab Integration (ELINT) Project is a concerted  attempt to infuse renewed vigor into the introductory calculus  based physics lecture/laboratory through laboratory driven  instruction, and the addition of a third semester to the  traditionally two semester sequence.  As much as possible, concepts  will be introduced via exploratory classroom experiments or small  group lab experiments. Lecture and laboratory will be integrated to  the extent that no predetermined distinction will be made between  lecture and lab time.  To engage student interest and activity,  modern instrumentation and corresponding topics in modern physics  will be introduced early in the course and will be continued  throughout.  Within the first five weeks of the course students  will be introduced to an optical spectrometer, a digital spectrum  analyzer, fixed frequency and tuneable dye lasers, and the  ubiquitous air track.  As the course proceeds, students will learn  to use oscilloscopes, computer interfaces, nuclear detectors, and  advanced electronics.  The ELINT Project is scheduled to run for  two years using a revised version of the \"Structures and  Interactions\" model developed for the Introductory University  Physics Project (IUPP).  Data acquired for assessment of the  project will be carefully reviewed at that time to determine the  extent to which ELINT will be modified and adopted for all  (calculus and non-calculus) elementary lab sections.",
