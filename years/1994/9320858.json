The conference will focus on  the involvement of the legal profession, in various countries and  in the international arena, in developing a wide variety of  rights claims and other policy goals.  A special focus is the  transnational development of human rights claims.  Three  questions will be addressed.  First, what parts of the legal  profession engage in these activities and why do they seek to use  their legal practice to these ends?  Second, what are their  strategies and tactics and how do they differ (if at all) from  those of conventional practice?  Third, what are the conditions  that facilitate or inhibit the political uses of legal practice?     A number of social scientists across the world who have been  studying these questions will present the results of their  research at the conference.  These papers and the other  proceedings of the conference will be published as a book.  ***",
