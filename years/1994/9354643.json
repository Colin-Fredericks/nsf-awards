 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  PI-Biermann, 9354643:  A simulator for a simple computer hardware software system is being constructed for educational uses.  The simulator will enable the user to observe the details of a computation as it proceeds:  It will display the internals of a compiler as it translates higher level language code to assemble language; it will show the architecture fetch execute cycle as it executes the machine language; and it will enable the user to see the details of some of the switching circuits that implement the architecture.  The system will furthermore be able to operate in training mode to give the user instruction on the displayed mechanisms and in testing mode to query the user and evaluate his or her understanding.  This project is ongoing and the first two level of the system, compiler and architecture are operative now in the simulation mode.  The work in the coming year will add the switching circuit level and the training and testing m odes for all levels.  The purpose of the system is to provide a variety of support services in a first course in computer science that teaches the fundamentals of computer hardware software.  The systems is usable for classroom demonstrations to illustrate points during a lecture.  It is also usable for student laboratory assignments, and can be taken home and studied on personal machines.  The project will continue during 1994 on the implementation phase while constantly incorporating the most recent version into classes as they are being taught.  It is also being offered to other institutions for experimentation and evaluation.  A later phase of the project will schedule a formal evaluation of the system after is becomes more completely refined.  This project is designed to support courses that emphasize the breadth first approach to introducing computer science as recommend by the Task Force on the Core of Computer Science (Denning et al., Jan., 1989).  The simulator should be useful wherever courses are taught that follow this approach.",
