In previous studies, we have  identified an apparently unique invertebrate electrogenic  cation exchanger on the brush border membrane of gut and  kidney epithelial cells which is involved in sodium and  calcium balance and differs in physiological properties from  analogous transport proteins from vertebrates.  The present  project will extend these early studies using the  combination of membrane vesicle techniques and molecular  biology procedures to characterize the functional role of  this unique invertebrate protein in important biological  activities of crustaceans such as ion homeostasis and  moltin.  To accomplish these objectives, purified membrane  vesicles of brush border and basolateral plasma membranes  and membranes derived from specific intracellular vacuoles  that are associated with digestive and calcium regulatory  activities will be prepared from lobster (Homarus  americanus) hepatopancreas (paired diverticulum of the  posterior stomach) using standard centrifugation techniques.  Transport properties of these vesicles will be investigated  using a combination of radioisotopic and spectrophotometric  techniques.  The gene nucleotide sequence of the lobster  electrogenic cation exchanger will be determined using our  previously developed monoclonal antibody as a probe of the  genome.  From these physiological and molecular studies we  should be able to clarify the functional role(s) of this  apparently unique invertebrate transporter and compare its  gene sequence with those of analogous, but physiolgically  distinct, mammalian Na+/H+ antiporter isoforms.  ***",
