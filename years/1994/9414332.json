The purpose of this research is twofold:  (1) to design and develop a neural network based decision support  system for use in design and configuration of advanced  manufacturing cells and cell control systems, and (2) to explore an  intelligent shop floor control framework for on-line scheduling and  control of Flexible Manufacturing Systems.         This innovative new design and operation methodology will be  illustrated through an implementation exercise, at laboratory  settings, in controlling a cluster of computer workstation which  simulates the stochastic operating characteristics of shop-floor  manufacturing machinery/equipment.  The intelligent shop floor  control scheme constitutes an integrated environment with  innovative cell control techniques which will not only assure that  feasible control actions be taken but also that the continuously  improved control decisions be implemented as cell operation time  goes by.",
