The area of intelligent system  applications to power systems has been growing steadily during  the last decade.  Several interesting applications have been  developed;e.g., power system fault location,alarm processing,  restoration, security assessment, and load forecasting.  The U.S.  leads the world in this area of intelligent system application to  power systems.  This conference has active participation from  researchers in the U.S.  This grant will also enable some of the  younger faculty members in U.S. universities to present their  work to an international audience.  ***",
