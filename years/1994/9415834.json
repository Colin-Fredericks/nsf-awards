 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415834  Fainman  A hybrid optical/electronic system that uses holographic optical  elements for the inspection of machined parts is proposed.  With  this approach, a holographic optical element corresponding to the  part is generated using the database that exists in the computer-  aided design system.  The holographic optical element stores  information on the geometry of the ideal designed part, which is  later compared with the real, machined part.  The comparison is  done by an optical system interfaced with a microcomputer to obtain  digital output.  With this strategy, instead of measuring the  absolute values of the shape, the PI measures only the deviations  of the actual part surface from the designed part.  Measuring  deviations instead of absolute values may increase the measurement  resolution and accuracy by orders of magnitude.    The proposed research on the development of a CAI system will have  a significant impact on manufacturing technologies because it will  provide tools that will allow different subsystems in the  manufacturing processes to be integrated in real time.  The  proposed studies will also advance the areas of optical signal  processing and optical computing.  For example, new approaches to  encoding problems for computer holography will be introduced, and  a new method based on the optical utilization of a priori knowledge  will be developed for image processing, pattern recognition and  machine vision.    The Technology Reinvestment Project of ARPA has recently  established a Manufacturing Engineering program at UCSD; thereby  the proposed work will also have a unique impact on the education  of students at the graduate and undergraduate levels in  manufacturing engineering.  They will gain extensive first-hand  experience in the growing field of optics in general and in optical  sensing and optical signal processing in particular.  The students  background will be further enhanced through special courses and  seminars related to this subject.  The PI expects  that the unique  background of the students (i.e., optical technology and  manufacturing systems, including CAD, CAM, and robotics) will be an  important factor in the introduction and efficient integration of  advances in optical technology into different areas of U.S.  manufacturing industry.  ***",
