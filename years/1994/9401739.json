 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401739  Crabtree  This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and  Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the further  development of the chemistry of X-H sigma-bonds (X=H, N, Si and  its congeners, and M) coordinated to transition metals.  This  is a recently recognized area of organometallic chemistry for  which the underlying principles are unclear;  the goal of this  reseach is to discover general trends across several classes of  sigma-bond complexes.  Among the several goals to be pursued  are:  generation of \"stretched\" dihydrogen complexes and new  polyhydrogen species by steric crowding, demonstration of a  change in reactivity for unsymmetrically bridged metal  hydrides, and demonstration of a distinctive reactivity for  sigma-bond bound N-H complexes.  Techniques for detection and  characterization of such compounds based upon NMR spectroscopy  will be sought.  %%%  One of the most exciting recent developments in transition  metal chemistry was the discovery that molecular hydrogen can  bind to a metal complex without cleavage of the  hydrogen-hydrogen bond.  Professor Crabtree has played an  important role in the elucidation of the factors that determine  how molecular hydrogen will bind to a metal and in the  development of spectroscopic techniques for determining the  mode of binding.  This project attempts to determine the role  that such sigma-bond complexes play in transition metal  chemistry of other X-H bonds.  Ultimately the information  obtained from this work will be important in the development of  a better understanding of organometallic reaction mechanisms  and may be useful in the design of more specific catalysts for  industrially important reactions.  ***",
