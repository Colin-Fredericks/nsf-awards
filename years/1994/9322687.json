 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322687  Voorhees    The properties of many alloys of engineering significance are  related to the morphology and spatial distribution of coherent  second-phase particles.  In many cases elastic stress is present in  these two-phase systems resulting from either a difference in  lattice parameters between the minority phase particles and the  matrix, or an applied stress.  As an understanding of the factors  controlling the morphology of a particle in a stressed crystalline  solid is not at hand, it is difficult to predict the properties of  these multiphase materials.  This lack of understanding can be  traced to the limited number of studies that have investigated the  factors controlling the equilibrium shape of a coherent misfitting  particle, i.e. the shape that minimizes the total energy of the  system subject to all possible variations in particle morphology.   Nevertheless, these few studies have shown that the presence of  elastic stress can lead to qualitatively different phenomena than  in the absence of stress, such as multiple equilibrium shapes for  a given set of materials parameters, particle splitting and non  convex, hourglass-like, equilibrium shapes.    %%%%    A major goal of this project is to provide a picture of the generic  role elastic stress plays in the development of the equilibrium  morphology of a misfitting three-dimensional particle.  As the  equations which determine the equilibrium shape of a misfitting  particle are highly nonlinear, a far more complex particle shape  bifurcation structure is present in three-dimensions than observed  in previous work on the equilibrium shape of a particle in two-  dimensions.  Despite the numerical nature of the study and the  specific assumptions employed in each section of the work, a  general framework for understanding and predicting the  morphological evolution of particles in stressed solids will be  provided.  Finally, this theory will be used in concert with  experiments to investigate the effects of a nondilation al misfit on  the morphology of misfitting particles in an elastically  anisotropic system.  ***",
