 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405242  Slominski    Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor of the  biologically active neuropeptides adrenocorticotropin  (ACTH), endorphins, melanotropins (MSH) and lipotropins  (LPH).  Although the gene coding for POMC is transcribed  predominantly in the pituitary gland, its expression has  also been detected in the central nervous system and in a  variety of peripheral tissues including skin.  The PI,  therefore, hypothesizes that local (cutaneous) production of  POMC peptides is a part of a system involved in the  regulation of physiological responses of the skin.  The main  objective of the current research is to identify cutaneous  cells expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC), to correlate  POMC expression and processing with the cyclic activity of  hair follicles, to test whether corticotropin releasing  hormone (CRH) and glucocorticoids regulate production of  POMC peptides and to detect and characterize CRH receptors.  To realize this goal, molecular, biochemical,  immunocytochenical and cell biology techniques will be  utilized.  The realization of the project will support the  concept that peripheral POMC activity may be an integral  part of the biological clock regulating cyclic activity of  hair follicles and periodic changes of skin physiology.  It  is already accepted that residential cells of the skin  respond phenotypically to ACTH and MSH, that there is a skin  associated immune system and the beta-endorphin, MSH and  ACTH can act as immunomodulators.  Therefore, it appears  that local production of POMC peptides may be a part of  signals regulating physiological responses of the skin.  ***",
