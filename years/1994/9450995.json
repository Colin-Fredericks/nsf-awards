A primary goal of our revised  curriculum is to blur the boundaries found in traditional chemistry  programs. The distinction between lecture and lab is blurred in the  one-semester, discovery-based introductory course. The intermediate  and upper level courses break down the traditional divisions within  the field of chemistry, reflecting the fact that real-world  problems in chemistry are best solved using an interdisciplinary  approach. This concept is further emphasized in the Integrated Lab  sequence for junior and senior chemistry majors, which includes  independent laboratory projects from overlapping areas of  chemistry. A second goal is to teach students to visualize  molecules, understand their physical properties and predict their  chemical reactivity. These tasks are central to all disciplines of  chemistry, and will be incorporated into each student's independent  research project. The primary goals will be accomplished through  purchase of: (1) student computers on which to run molecular  modelling software; (2) an instructor workstation for high-end  computational chemistry as well as demonstration purposes; and (3)  a file server plus additional accessories to network all of the  computers. State-of-the-art molecular modelling software and  hardware requested here, only recently accessible to the  undergraduate market, are the tools we propose to use as the  unifying theme in the curriculum. The incorporation of  sophisticated computer technology into our curriculum will help  prepare students for postgraduate education or employment  opportunities in chemistry.",
