 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319525  Koike    Neuropeptides act as chemical messengers in the brain and play  vital roles in the physiology and behavior of a variety of species.  Hormones of the vasopressin/oxtyocin superfamily has been shown to  exist in may life forms including, molluscs, hydra and protozoan  suggesting that gene duplication occurred in ancestors common to   invertebrates and vertebrates.  In vertebrates, including mammals,  these hormones play a crucial role in reproduction, osmoregulation  and cardiovascular function.  Dr. Koike is interested in arginine  vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin, two members of this peptidergic  system, that are found in domestic fowls.  He has adopted the most  sophisticated technology to examine the sites and regulation of the  physiological expression of vasotocin in the brain and periphery.   Dr. Koike will clone the receptor for this peptide and then examine  the regulation of the AVT gene expression.  He will influence the  domestic fowl's physiology by a number of mechanisms including  varying the availability of water injecting gonadal hormones, and  determine how these changes affect the expression of the genes  for AVT and its receptor.  These studies will lead to a better  understanding of the physiological roles of this family of hormones  as neurotransmitters, as players in the reproductive systems and as  regulators of cardiovascular function.  Moreover, the findings will  allow comparisons of the genes for AVT and its receptor in domestic  fowl with homologous genes of other vertebrate classes and thus,  will provide basic knowledge on the manner in which members of this  hormone family and their functions have evolved.  Finally,  understanding the normal physiology of an economically and  nutritionally important species will impact on the poultry industry  which provides high quality protein at economical prices.  ***",
