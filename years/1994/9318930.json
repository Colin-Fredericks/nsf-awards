 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318930  Culbert    Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Jeffrey Baker will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  geoarchaeological research in lowland Belize. Mr. Baker wishes to  reconstruct agricultural practices of prehistoric Mayan peoples. In  particular he wants to understand cultivation techniques which were  practiced in lowland areas or \"bajos\" which are waterlogged for  portions of the year. He will employ both geological and ecological  techniques to study the nature of bajo soils, their chemistry and  their water retention characteristics. He will study the vegetation  of a number of bajo types to understand the relationship between  soil, water and vegetation. Finally he will also conduct  archaeological excavation to determine whether fields underwent  human modification and how Mayan peoples used them.    Archaeological evidence demonstrates that ancient Mayan peoples  were able to farm low-lying tropical areas and produce enough food  to support large populations. While many archaeologists believe  that this was accomplished through a system of raised fields and  that landscape was extensively modified, others disagree.  Unfortunately the basic geological and ecological data necessary to  address this question does not exist. The research which Mr. Baker  will conduct should help to remedy this problem.    This project is important for several reasons. Ancient Mayan  peoples thrived in regions which today support only small  populations. Prehistoric peoples had developed agricultural  techniques which, if reconstructed could have direct practical  benefit. The project will also further the development of an  extremely promising young scientist.  ***",
