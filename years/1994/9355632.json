 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355632  Hickox    \"Living on the Edge\" will be the name of an exhibit in three  editions that will explore multiple edges of boundaries  between land and sea, air and sea, ocean bottom and  overlying water, and differing water masses. Scientists have  become increasingly fascinated by the study of these edges  or fronts because of the new understanding it provides  regarding such basic principles as the productivity of coast  waters, migrations and feeding patterns of marine life,  upwelling and downwelling, chlorophyll dynamics, and water  quality issues, for example.  The educational objectives are  to bring an understanding of coastal ocean science and its  social implications to broad audiences in museums and  aquaria.  It will consist of eight mulit-faceted interactive  activity centers totally approximately 1500 square feet.   Two editions of the exhibit will become part of the  permanent displays at the University of Rhode Island  Graduate School of Oceanography and the Museum of Science in  Boston.  The third will be a traveling version; the  management of which will be handled by the Association of  Science and Technology Centers.  It will go to 12-15 venues  during its three-year tour schedule.  It is estimated that a  total of 2.5 million will experience this exhibit.  A suite  of materials will be developed for use by formal educators  with all three of the exhibits.  These materials will  include teacher training materials, exhibit-related modules  for on-site interpretive programs, and traveling kits for  in-class presentations.",
