The Czech Academy of  Sciences is organizing and hosting the conference, and will  cover all local costs within the Czech Republic.  Unique  features of the conference will include:  (a) coverage of the  most recent molecular methods and results for complex liquids  and interfaces, including ionic and associated liquids, colloids  and micellar solutions, self-assembly, aqueous solutions,  surfactants and adsorbents, etc., (b) latest developments in  advanced molecular simulation techniques, including parallel and  distributed systems, (c) coverage of both applied and basic  aspects, and (d) an opportunity for U.S. researchers to become  familiar with leading research in this area by groups from East  and West Europe, Japan and Australia.  The invited speakers will  include many of the international experts from these countries.   Previous conferences were held in 1983, 1986, and 1990, and  received widespread acclaim from U.S. attendees.  ***",
