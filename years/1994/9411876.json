Its purpose is to consider  whether, when and how public interventions into technical change  are justified.  It will attempt to explain the sort of public  interventions into technical change that are occurring, for example  in the environmental movement, and that might be fostered by the  growth of a new democratic \"technical public sphere.\"  The  investigator will study two types of public action for technical  change:  actions directed at the state in an attempt to influence  regulatory policies, and actions directed at technology itself in  an attempt to alter its design to favor new applications.  Both  types of intervention may be called democratic; the first, because  the intervention represents neglected social interests; the second,  because it enlarges the domain of active agency open to citizens.   The research addresses challenges to the democratic legitimacy and  technical rationality of public intervention, by providing an  account of the role of various mediations, such as government  regulation and technical professionalism, through which the demands  of self-selected social groups are transformed into technical  policy.  Using philosophical analysis and case histories, the  research will attempt to identify when public demands are able to  meet tests of legitimacy and rationality, because they are  structured around procedures that can assure the representativity  of decisions and their place in the evolutionary development of  technical practice.  Results from this research will be published  in articles and a book; the case studies will also be incorporated  into an undergraduate textbook.  ***",
