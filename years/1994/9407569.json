Pulsed-field  gradient (PFG) technology will be optimized to provide improved  sensitivity and better H2O solvent suppression by using two-and  three-gradient pulse sequences.  A family of PFG triple resonance  NMR pulse sequences will be designed which provide optimal input  for automated analysis software.  Artificial intelligence will be  applied in developing user-friendly software for analyzing these  data, including automation of the processes of resonance  assignment, compilation of experimental distance constraints, and  structure generation.  This software will accelerate the structure  determination process for small (<10 KDa) proteins.  This  technology development will be carried out on samples of isotope-  enriched protein growth factors, transcription factors, IgG binding  domains, and protease inhibitors for which prokaryotic production  expression systems are already available in the laboratory.   %%%  The technology will greatly enhance the applicability and  accessibility of NMR spectroscopy as a tool for protein engineering  and structural biology, and improve the competitiveness of the  United States in these important biotechnology areas.  It will make  amenable to NMR studies many proteins which are presently  inaccessible for various technical reasons, and accelorate the  process of molecular structure analysis.  The techniques and the  data which result from this work will provide important  infrastructure for determining the three-dimensional structures of  many different proteins by NMR, and will have important  implications in several related fields including protein  engineering, protein chemistry, protein folding and agricultural  biotechnology.  The work will have a significant impact on the  infrastructure of biophysical chemistry by enhancing the  effectiveness, informat ion content, and interpretability of NMR  technology.  ***",
