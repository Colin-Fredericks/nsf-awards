Specifically, the researchers will explore the evolution of  nuclear shape and measure the viscosity of nuclear matter as a  function of temperature in heavy ion fusion-fission reactions.   The researchers intend to determine these parameters from giant  dipole resonance.  The associated reaction mechanism will also be  studied.  Results are expected to contribute to our basic  knowledge of superheavy elements.    This project in nuclear physics fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United  States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and  share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.    ***",
