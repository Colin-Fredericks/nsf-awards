The site, and the LTER program itself, have spawned numerous additional research activities which now involve 133 projects representing 40 KSU faculty members (from 14 Departments and 4 Colleges), 23 visiting scientists, and an additional 13 studies involving intersite comparisons between LTER sites.  Konza Prairie has hosted these myriad projects for over 10 years without substantially increasing its ability to support the efforts.  The site is near its carrying capacity for facilitating research, even though many additional researchers are interested is working there.  The number of new requests for research permits has climbed dramatically over the last decade and the cumulative effect may have reached the maximum sustainable by the current facilities.  This project is designed to prepare a Master Plan for the expansion of Konza Prairie research capability including the renovation of existing facilities, and the construction of new laboratory space and living quarters for visiting scientists and students.  Concurrently, the management and operational plan and the administrative structure will be revised to accommodate the expanded opportunities.  A coalition of participants has been organized who have agreed to support the implementation of the plan once it is developed.  Currently, the coalition consists  of the faculty and students working on Konza Prairie, Kansas State University (from the Division to the Dean of Arts and Sciences and the Provost), The Nature Conservancy, and KSU Foundation. ***",
