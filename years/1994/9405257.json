The V regions of genes encoding  immunoglobulin in B cells undergo rates of somatic mutation as high  as one base per thousand per generation.  This is an extraordinary  mutation rate and corresponds to the introduction of one new  immunoglobulin mutation for every two cell divisions.  The  mechanism underlying hypermutation remains one of the major  unsolved problems of immunology.  The availability of culture  systems and cell lines that would permit the observation and study  of this phenomenon in vitro would provide a significant expansion  of our capacity to analyze this process.  Because the ileal Peyer's  patch (IPP) of cattle contains more than one hundred million B  cells and is the site of massive, developmentally regulated,  extensive, somatic mutation of Ig genes, it has been chosen as a  target tissue from which to establish in vitro systems that  somatically diversify immunoglobulin V genes.  A variety of  approaches are planned to optimize the in vitro culture of IPP B  cells, including the addition of mitogens and cytokines, culture on  outgrowths of IPP follicular \"stromal\" cells and the culture of  individual IPP follicles.  The assay for occurrence of somatic  diversification of bovine lambda V genes will employ RT-PCR and  single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) as an assay.  The  development of a system that supports the transfer of this process  of somatic immunoglobulin V gene diversification from tissue to  tissue culture well facilitate the analysis of the dell and  molecular biology of immunoglobulin gene diversification.  %%%  A major component of the mammalian immune response is the ability  to produce a vast array of antibodies that are capable of  specifically binding a wide range of foreign substances (antigens)  and facilitating their removal from the blood.  The range of  s pecificities that the antibodies of an individual can recognize is  termed the individual's antibody repertoire.  The molecular  mechanism(s) by which the vast diversity of an organism's antibody  repertoire is generated remains one of the central questions of  modern immunology.  One of the major mechanisms that generates  antibody diversity is by a rapid rate of mutation in the genes that  encode the foreign antigen-binding portions of antibody molecules.   The overall objective of this project is to develop cell culture  systems that will support the continued diversification of antibody  genes.  This research will take advantage of certain unique  properties of the development of the immune system in sheep and  cattle which suggest that this project should be feasible.  If this  research is successful, the availability of this culture system  will greatly facilitate the analysis of the cellular and molecular  mechanisms of immunoglobulin gene diversification.  The research  will be done at an undergraduate institution and will directly  involve undergraduate students in this cutting edge problem.  ***",
