 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313026  Liebhold    This award will support a cooperative research project between  Dr. Andrew W. Liebhold, Northeastern Forest Experiment Station,  U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, Morgantown, West  Virginia, and Dr. Naoto Kamata, Tohoku Research Center, Forestry  and Forest Products Research Institute in Japan.  During a six-  month visit Dr. Liebhold will conduct research in the area of  spatial models of forest insect outbreak dynamics.  The research  will develop an empirical modeling approach to forecasting forest  defoliator outbreaks.  It will model spatial as well as temporal  dynamics.  The lack of accurate insect outbreak forecasts is  perhaps the major impediment to the development of effective  integrated pest management programs.  Models will be developed   that use 20 or more years of historical defoliation maps to  forecast defoliation in the next year.  The technique will be  applied to the beech caterpillar, the gypsy moth and the pine  moth in Japan.  Historical defoliation data will be used to  quantify dependence among locations separated by various  distances and directions in spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal  dimensions.    Results of the research will lead to a superior system for  forecasting insect outbreaks.  Dr. Liebhold is an accomplished  and recognized leader in the field of forest insect population  modeling and computer simulation.  Dr. Kamata has substantial  expertise in the area of population dynamics of forest insect  defoliators.  The research should improve basic understanding of  the spatial dynamics of forest insect populations and will  provide the Japanese scientists with the tools for developing  more effective forest pest management programs.  In addition, the  collaboration should further communications between the  respective countries and will contribute to development of  spatially and temporally explicit models to predict defoliator  dynamics of concern in both countries.  This project is supported  by the NSF-CGP (Center fo r Global Partnership) Science Fellowship  Program.",
