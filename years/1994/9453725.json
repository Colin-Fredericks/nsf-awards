 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453725  Warren    Through the initiative of the Consortium for Adult Education, the Women Ventures in Science,  Engineering and Math project was created with the collaboration of the two- and four-year  colleges and universities in the Cincinnati area, along with the primary organizations for  workforce development programs for women on public assistance.  The thrust of this project is  to provide a pathway to economic self sufficiency and family stability for these minority women  through careers in the fields of science, engineering, and math (SEM).  The project focuses on  outreach, recruitment, assessment, preparation and ongoing support so that the target group can  matriculate into SEM majors and become high performance workers in a high tech work place.   The project begins with an effective marketing campaign that sells the benefits of careers in  SEM, with the outcome of 300-400 of the target group attending one of the two scheduled SEM  Career Fairs.  From this pool, 100-150 women will be selected through a holistic assessment  process to participate in one of two 240 hour  preparatory program.  The assessment will assist  the women in self discovery, identifying transferrable skills and aptitudes, and committing to a  career in SEM.    Preparatory sessions will provide the women with full exposure to the advantages/disadvantages  of SEM careers, survival skills in male dominated occupations, self motivation techniques,  academic refresher opportunities, a support system, and an individual service strategy.  Upon  completion of the 240 hour course, 50 women will matriculate into SEM majors at the two- and  four-year colleges/universities.  After the women start their educations, the collaborating  institutions will provide ongoing support and direction to ensure graduation and employment.   A College Advisory Committee has been established and will provide ongoing guidance and  direction to the project.  It is expected that once this model project is demonstrated to be  effective, the  process will be institutionalized and made part of the ongoing operation of the  organization that are responsible for the workforce development activities of women on public  assistance.  ***",
