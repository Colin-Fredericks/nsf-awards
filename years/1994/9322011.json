The  undergraduate students will work with members of the Cornell  faculty/radar astronomy, and other related topics.  The students'  research at Cornell will also provide them the opportunity to  participate in astronomical observations at a facility used by  Cornell researchers.  The students will also be encouraged to  participate in the Undergraduate Research Forum, which is held  annually at Cornell University, to present and discuss their  various research projects with other students.  The Undergraduate  Research in Observational Astronomy program will encourage  participation by students who are women and minorities and whose  own institutions do not provide this kind of research experience  for their own undergradautes.",
