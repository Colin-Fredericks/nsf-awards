 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jacobson  9316501  Dr. Jacobson and coworkers study the shape of large genomic RNAs  in the RNA coliphage system. These molecules have a dual  function: they carry the genetic information coding for viral  genes; and in addition, hydrogen bonding between distant regions  of the molecules regulate viral growth, controlling both the  expression of viral proteins and viral RNA replication. The  detailed conformation of the molecules will be studied in order  to understand the structural mechanisms used in regulation.  Electron microscopy is used as a primary tool. This method allows  one to see large structural features in the RNA and to measure  changes in the shape and relative stability of these structures  in mutant RNAs that have been created by genetic engineering. The  structural changes that are observed can be correlated with  changes in the growth patterns of mutant viruses.  The current work focuses on the conformation of genomic RNA from  coliphage QB. Dr. Jacobson's studies demonstrated for the first  time that the molecules contain two types of structural domains.  One type is unusually stable; the other is highly variable and  can switch between alternative conformations.  Both types of  structures appear to be utilized in the regulation of viral  protein synthesis. Two of the stable domains appear to suppress  translational initiation of viral proteins. In addition, stable  domains may serve as structural anchors (much like door hinges)  that limit the formation of alternative structures in the  variable regions of the molecule. In addition, computer modeling  will be used to understand RNA conformation. A new method was  developed to detect likely stable structures as well as likely  variable regions of an RNA molecule. The results obtained by  modeling are consistent with electron microscopic studies with  both native and mutant RNAs. The new approach is of general  interest and will be used by investigators in many disciplines.  %%%  Many unanswered questions remain about the rol e of RNA structure in  gene regulation in RNA coliphages.  These can now be addressed with  modern methods of analysis.  Answers to these questions will  provide fundamental insights into the properties of all large mRNA  molecules, and are therefore relevant in understanding mechanisms  governing growth, evolution, and the regulation of gene expression  in disease causing plant and animal viruses.  ***",
