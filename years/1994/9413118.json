 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413118  Silverstein  This Dissertation Improvement project examines the dynamic  relationship between the law and culture through an extended  study of a treaty rights case in which the Colville Confederated  Tribes of northeastern Washington State have been engaged since  1989.  In this ongoing case the Colville Tribes are attempting to  secure their right to gather fish from the Columbia River system  by building on the series of landmark fishing rights cases that  have come out of the pacific Northwest since the 1960s.  In  contrast to these earlier cases, the defendants in the Colville  case are not local non-Indians nor state governments, but the  Indian tribes whose rights were previously secured through this  litigation.  In turn, in addition to the significance of the  Colville's particular struggle for sovereign rights, their case  is representative of the most developed and refined legal methods  of interpreting culturally-based rights in the U.S., and also of  the kinds of changes in cultural relations that result from the  resolution of social conflicts through litigation -- the  \"legalization\" of cultural identities.  This study will take  \"language use\" as its focus in order to explore the dynamic  between law and culture form these related, but distinct  perspectives.  This study will analyze (1) the formulae by which  federal courts interpret the language of the treaty contracts  that are central focus in this case, (2) the methods by which the  court produces and interprets the testimony of tribal witnesses,  and (3) the manner in which tribal witnesses speak about the  issues and events central to this case and about the law itself.   Colville and federal methods of defining legitimate identity and  of narrating history will be compared.  Research will be  conducted on the Colville reservation where extensive recorded  interviews will be conducted with Colville witnesses, other  relevant Colville tribal members and Colville attorneys about the  central issues and events raised  in this case and about the law  more generally.  Trial transcripts and the exhibits presented in  this case will also be reviewed.",
