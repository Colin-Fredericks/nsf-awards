This part of  Antarctica is known to represent a continental interior  environment that was in a near polar position during the  Triassic.  This region was hospitable enough to support broadleaf  forests as well as large amphibians and reptiles.  However,  details of the paleoenvironments that would help differentiate  between, for example, woodland and shrub-land remain obscure.   Detailed study of Quaternary paleosols in many parts of the world  has proved very useful to understanding paleoenvironments.   Extension of these types of studies to the Triassic is feasible  at this time.  Comparison of Triassic paleosols from Antarctica  to Quaternary and recent soils from temperate regions would  improve our understanding of climatic conditions and ecological  systems and would provide important information for global  circulation climate models.  ***",
