The  model will be used to estimate the effects of various public  policy alternatives such as vouchers and neighborhood versus open  enrollment public schools.  Students are characterized by an  ability level and household income.  A student's educational   achievement is dependent on one's own ability and on the  abilities of his classmates.  The model characterizes the sorting  of students by income and ability across schools in the public  and private school sectors, taking into account financial aid  policies of private schools.  A computational model paralleling  the theoretical model is developed and used to explore properties  of the model and investigate policy predictions.  This research  is important because it will shed light on the consequences of an  educational system which incorporates a greater degree of school  choice at the primary and secondary levels.  ***  9320980  Romano  The purpose of this research is to develop and analyze a model of  school choice at the primary and secondary level that  incorporates competition between private and public schools.
