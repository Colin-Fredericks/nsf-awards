 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321103  Wang  Existing semi-parametric methods for binary choice models face  two major disadvantages: namely, computational difficulty and  multiple local maxima, especially for models with multiple  explanatory variables or large sample sizes.  Another problem is  that some existing semi-parametric methods need a very large size  to obtain the benefits promised by asymptotic theory.  These  problems are so severe that there is hardly any empirical  application of semi-parametric methods for binary choice models  available in the literature although these methods have been  developed for a while.  This project proposes a computationally  convenient semi-parametric estimation method for binary choice  models based on a semi-parametric interpretation of the EM  (Expectation and Maximization) principle and the least squares  approach.  Preliminary Monte Carlo studies show that this new  method has no problem of multiple local maxima (especially for  large sample sizes) and is computationally much less time  consuming than other estimators.    This project studies the theoretical properties of the new  estimator of binary choice models, including large sample  properties and the use of resampling methods for estimating the  variance of the estimator.  The use of optimal weighted least  squares estimators instead of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) will  be investigated as a means of improving efficiency.  Extensive  simulations will be conducted in order to compare the performance  of various semi-parametric estimators.  This method will be  applied to an important empirical economic problem, the early  retirement decision.  To facilitate the application of the  proposed method, the project will develop efficient and  convenient computer programs for the new estimator.  These  programs will be easily incorporated in standard econometric  computer packages, such as SAS, GAUSS and LIMDEP.",
