The joint research will focus on the  development of new technologies for vertical  optical interconnection of silicon (Si) devices  by III-V compound semiconductor optoelectronic  devices using active and passive optical  components.  The following research issues will  be addressed:  (1) heteroepitaxy of III-V  optoelectronic materials on Si chips; (2)  heteroepitaxy of Si on III-V optoelectronic  heterostructures devices; (3) low-damage dry-  etching of Si and III-V's; (4) metal contacts  to Si and III-V's; and (5) passive optical  components including waveguides and dielectric  mirrors.    The U.S. and Japanese research groups are  already working on projects closely related to  the broader goals of the integrated program,  and the interactions will build on and enhance  the value of these programs.  The expertise and  facilities at Hiroshima University are in  nanofabrication and optical integration, while  the North Carolina State University group is  strong in fundamental knowledge of materials  growth, device processing, and materials  characterization.  These complementary  attributes will permit the researchers to  address advanced topics in both scientific and  technological research areas that could not be  pursued by either institution separately.  This  research is important for the successful  development of new parallel processing computer  system concepts such as optically coupled three  dimensional common memory structures.  ***",
