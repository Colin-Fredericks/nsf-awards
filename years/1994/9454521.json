 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing instructional materials including print  and video, laboratory materials, and faculty guides to be used in  the education of environmental technicians.  The project is being  carried out in cooperation with the Partnership for Environmental  Technology Education (PETE) and Van Nostrand Reinhold Publishers.  The material to be generated covers eight content areas: (1)  Introduction to Environmental Technology; (2) Waster Generation,  Reduction, Treatment, and Prevention; (3) Basics of Toxicology; (4)  Basics of Industrial Hygiene; (5) Site Characterization, Sampling,  and Field Analysis; (6) Environmental and Hazardous Materials  Regulations; (7) Contingency Planning and Reporting for Emergency  Response; and (8) Safety and Emergency Response.  The primary  audiences for the modules are two-year community and technical  college students throughout the United States. Linkages are being  established, however, which will make Preserving The Legacy  accessible to secondary school students, as well as students  attending four-year colleges and universities.",
