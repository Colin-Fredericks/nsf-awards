 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311444  Cross  This proposal is concerned with the theoretical understanding of  pattern forming systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The PI  is well known for his work here and has just finished coauthoring  a long \"Reviews of Modern Physics\" article on the subject. The  techniques used by the PI are multifold - varying from linear and  non-linear stability analyses of spatially homogeneous states - to  including the effects of defects and boundaries on the pattern  evolution - to the numerical investigation of model systems.  Specifically, the PI proposes to consider instabilities and paterns  in fluid and chemical systems - such as stripe phases, convective  phases and stationary periodic chemical patterns. Further, the PI  proposes to study the less well-characterized field of patterns in  materials systems - such as deformation bands and dislocation  patterns in strained crystals.  %%%  Many fluid systems exhibit patterns when they are kept under  conditions away from equilibrium. For example, a fluid between hot  (bottom) and cold (top) plates exhibits convective patterns.  Similarly, solid materials under applied stress (eg shearing) can  develop deformation bands. Such non-equilibrium conditions occur  all the time in everyday life (eg the formation of clouds) - and  form by far the majority of cases in the processing of materials  (milling, rolling, sintering etc). Their study is important in the  understanding of material and liquid behavior. This proposal  undertakes a theoretical study of these phenomena. The PI is one of  the leading lights in this field and the work is at the cutting-  edge of what is known and understood.  ***",
