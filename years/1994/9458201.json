 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458201  Handel  A holy grail in structural biology is the ability to predict three  dimensional structure from protein sequence, and conversely, to identify  sequences that will adopt a predefined 3-dimensional fold. This requires  a thorough understanding of the hierarchy of energetic forces that  dictate protein structure. De novo protein design has been a useful  approach for investigating these forces and understanding the  sequence-structure relationship in proteins. To this end, computational  techniques are being developed in order to facilitate protein design. In  order to simplify this problem initial studies involve repacking of the  protein core rather on redesign of the total protein. This allows  investigators to limit sequence space to hydrophobic amino acids, and  energy terms to Van der Waals and solvation energies. Despite this  simplification, choosing the identity of core residues in a protein is a  complex combinatorial problem; the difficulty lies in the requirement  that the residues simultaneously satisfy conditions of high density  packing and favorable interaction energies with the protein backbone and  other side chains. The complexity of protein folding is dealt with in two  ways in this project. First the range of possible side chain orientations  is restricted by calculating rotamer libraries for the target structure  being repacked. Secondly, genetic algorithms are used to search through  the reduced but nonetheless enormous set of possible residue-rotamer  combinations. These algorithms are efficient optimization routines which  \"evolve\" highly fit sets of information depending on the selection  criterion. The information sets are combinations of side chains in  designated orientations (a structure) and the criterion is based on the  lowest Van der Waals and/or solvation energy. Experimental study of  predicted cores is of fundamental importance to increasing the  understanding of the rules of protein folding and to improve  computational strategies. Thus, repacke d proteins are subsequently  produced by recombinant methodologies, and their structures characterized  in great detail by biophysical techniques including heteronuclear  multidimensional NMR.  %%%  A holy grail in structural biology is the ability to predict three  dimensional structure from protein sequence, and conversely, to  identify sequences that will adopt a predefined 3-dimensional fold.

These studies will also use NMR methods to look  at the dynamic structures of a developmentally important transcription  factor from the helix-loop-helix family of proteins, as well as on  proteins involved in lymphocyte chemotaxis and activation. These  proteins will be investigated by using a combination of biophysical and  molecular biological techniques.",
