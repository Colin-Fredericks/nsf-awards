 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407612  Abstract  The major goals of this project are to increase the general utility  of insertional mutagenesis using inducible Ty elements in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and to gain a better  understanding of the mechanism of gene disruption by Ty.  In  addition, the techniques used are designed insofar as possible to  involve undergraduate students, to increase their understanding of  and interest in scientific research.  This study uses a plasmid-  borne Ty element controlled by an inducible promoter, GAL1, and  marked with the HIS3 gene.  Disruptions of essential genes on  several chromosomes have been isolated by inducing transposition in  a diploid strain and screening for cases in which the TyHis+  haploid progeny is non-viable.  The predicted rate for lethal  gene disruptions, if the pattern of insertions is random, is about  12% of TyHis+ insertions.  The observed rate is 0.3%, indicating a  limited number of permissible targets.  Attempts to broaden the  target region for Ty insertion will include use of mutant strains  with altered chromosome function, and transposition induction in  meiotic cells.  An alternate screening technique, to isolate  mutants resistant to alpha-mating-type pheromone, produced  insertionsof TyHis+ multimers into HML alpha, a normally silent  gene containinginformation for mating-type control.  Unlinked  suppressors which restore silencing in hml alpha ::TyHIS3 mutants  have been isolated as well.  Characterization of the suppressors,  including their interactions with genes affecting chromatin  structure, will increase understanding of the silencing mechanism  at HML alpha  and may help to define some properties of this  particular target of Ty integration.  %%%  Genetic research has given society much of the scientific knowledge  from which society has so profoundly benefited.  The production of  mutations is an essential element of genetic research.  In this  project, the investigator will attempt to broaden the usefulness of  a biologic al tool, the Ty element of yeast, in generating new  mutations.  She will also study its mechanisms of gene disruption.   The investigator, a professor at a rural community college, will  involve her students in this research, thus significantly raising  their scientific literacy and possibly inspiring some to pursue  research careers.  ***",
