The objectives of the workshop are: (1) To  summarize the current state-of-the-art in underwater  robotics; (2) To discuss application areas with potential  for immediate as well as long-term benefits and impact; (3)  To identify critical issues and challenging problems in  underwater robotics; (4) To initiate an effective mechanism  for communication and cooperation between different groups;  and (5) To provide recommendations on future research  directions in underwater robotics.    We would also like to discuss the role of federal and local  governments in addressing technical and scientific  competitiveness of the subject area.    The workshop will produce not only recommendations for  future research directions, but also exploration of  potential applications.  Research in underwater robotics can  be enhanced by establishing proper channels for  communication and technology transfer between different  groups and optimizing efficiency of available resources.",
