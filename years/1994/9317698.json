Aqueous carbon dioxide concentrations  CO2aq  in surface waters vary seasonally and across lakes from less than one-tenth to more than ten-fold of their equilibrium concentration with the atmospheric CO2 of less than 2-fold.  Neither the causes nor the consequences of the enormous range in CO2 concentrations in aquatic ecosystems is well understood.  %%%  Causes.  The surface waters of lakes can be under-or over saturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere.  The causes of severe under saturation are relatively well understood.  Excess nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the watershed allow increased primary production and carbon burial which draws down the CO2 concentration.  Although this model is reasonable, it has only been tested in a few experimentally eutrophied lakes and it is not known how generally applicable it is.  The causes of CO2 super saturation are much less well investigated and all the more intriguing because the data suggest that a majority of lakes are, in fact, super saturated much of the time.  A lake supersaturated in CO2 must be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.  Our preliminary data and review suggest that most lakes are net CO2 sources over an annual cycle and many are sources even during the summer growing season.  This net evasion of CO2 from aquatic systems implies an important and relatively unexplored linkage between the lake and its watershed.  These lakes must either import and metabolize significant amounts of terrestrially-derived organic matter or they import CO2 from soil respiration in inflowing  ground water.  Either way, the flux of CO2 from aquatic systems is a large component of a lake's carbon budgets and warrants further study. We hypothesize that the way a lake is linked to its watershed drives these extreme variations in aquati c CO2.  %%%  Consequences. Relatively small variations in atmospheric CO2 (2-fold) can have large effects on terrestrial plants, including changes in the rate of productivity, and alteration of the elemental composition of plant material.  The effects of the much larger variations in CO2 in aquatic systems are less well known, especially for phytoplankton.  We hypothesize that the more than 100-fold range in CO2 concentrations in natural aquatic systems may affect phytoplankton species composition, C:P and C:N ratios of phytoplankton and may alter profoundly the value of phytoplankton as food for consumer organisms.  %%%  Goals.  1)  To determine under what conditions lakes are sources or sinks for atmospheric CO2; 2)  To identify the sources of excess CO2 in a single lake(Mirror L) which we know outgasses CO2 during most of the year; and 3)  To investigate, using manipulative experiments, the effect this dramatic range in CO2 concentrations has on phytoplankton species composition.",
