 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Maryland,  College Park respectfully requests five traineeship positions in  the subdiscipline area of Civil Infrastructure Systems (CIS).  CIS  is an area for which the Department of Civil Engineering at the  University of Maryland, College Park has outstanding resources and  personnel.  Research in the area of bridge and building  infrastructure systems has been targeted to benefit from the  Graduate Research Traineeship program.  The research will focus on  extending useful life and retrofitting to resist natural hazards.    New structural systems, new techniques and materials that are  modified or not previously used in construction will be considered.   The research will also consider technology developed int he  aerospace, automotive and industrial sectors for transfer and use  in civil engineering and construction.  Enhanced traditional  construction materials, as wee as, new emerging construction  materials will be considered.    The University of Maryland has formal academic linkages with  several traditionally Black universities.  The Project Directors  will take advantage of this existing network to recruit trainees.   Recruitment plans include intensifying current efforts, as  well  as, developing innovative approaches.  The Project Directors have  mad extensive plans for the trainees' multidisciplinary training,  interaction with industry, training for faculty roles and  participation in international activities.",
