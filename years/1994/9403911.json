 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wool  The question of whether polymer molecules reptate or not remains as  one of the most important and controversial problems in polymer  physics.  The reptation model was proposed by P.-G. de Gennes  (1971) to describe the dynamics of linear polymer chains in the  melt.  We have designed an experiment which probes the essential  features of this model, i.e., the snakelike motion of chains due to  their confinement by the other chains, and related scaling laws.   We explore the interdiffusion of two sets of matching triblock  chains, HDH/DHD, where the chain centers are deuterated on one side  (HDH) and the chain ends (DHD) are deuterated on the other side of  the interface.  If the chains reptate, a characteristic \"ripple\"  develops in the concentration profile CD(x, t) which grows to a  maximum and then decays.  The ripple is due to the anisotropic  motion of the chains.  Our initial Ripple experiments  Nature, 365,  235, Sept 1993  using SIMS and Neutron Reflection analysis of  matching polystyrene triblocks provide strong support for  reptation.  Several critical experiments remain to complete the  investigation of the reptation model using matching triblocks.   These include (a) the effects of molecular weight at M >> Mc, (b)  the effects of Rouse dynamics at M < Mc (critical entanglement  molecular weight), (c) location of chain ends, (d) effects of  chemistry, (e) scaling behavior with time and molecular weight, (f)  quantitative comparision between computer simulation and  experiment, and others.  These experiments should provide a  definitive statement on the validity of the reptation model.  %%%  Reptation is a key concept in the motions of linear polymer chains.   A validation, or negation, of this model would have important  consequences in such areas as the healing of cracks in rubber or  plastics.",
