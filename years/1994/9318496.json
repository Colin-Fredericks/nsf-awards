 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318496  Mason    The goal of this research is to enable robotic manipulators  to make better use of dynamic phenomena.  At present, most  practical robotic manipulation is dominated by a kinematic  approach.  Typically an object is rigidly grasped by or  affixed to the end effector, and the manipulator is moved  along a specified trajectory without explicitly involving  analysis of the dynamics of the system.  A dynamic approach  to manipulation extends an arm's capabilities in several  ways.  The use of motions tuned to the dynamics increases  the speed and maximum load.  The ability to achieve object  motions within the hand effectively increases the motion  freedoms of the system.  Dynamic methods can have a broad  impact on robotic manipulation, with particular applications  in manufacturing and space construction.     The approach of this research is to explore task domains in  which impact, momentum, and dynamic forces are dominant  effects, such as in catching and throwing of objects.  While  these operations were chosen to present significant  challenges to manipulation, more than for any immediate  practical value, the ability to throw or drop objects may in  some cases extend the effective workspace of the  manipulator.  This exploration will involve construction of  simple manipulators, development of methods to analyze  dynamic manipulation tasks, and production of control and  planning systems.  What is learned here will provide  important new knowledge and approaches to dynamics of  manipulation applicable to many problem domains.",
