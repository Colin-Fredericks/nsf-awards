 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361299  Tekula    Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) can sometimes be used as a diagnostic device in  biology and medicine.  In general, LIF has difficulties in relating the fluorescence spectra  to the concentration of the emitters within the tissue, in identifying different species, and  in the possibility of destroying the molecules being probed if the wrong excitation  wavelength is chosen.  Many of the problems associated with fluorescence can be  eliminated by the use of Raman scattering.  Raman techniques allow the measurement  of multiple species even in aqueous solutions (not accessible by infra-red methods  because of water absorption). However, spontaneous Raman techniques give very weak  signals. Signal enhancement is possible by utilizing resonance Raman techniques. Both of  these methods still suffer from the fact that spatial and, to some extent, temporal  information is lost.    The research in this proposal is intended to investigate a non-invasive, real-time, high   resolution device for the detection of enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations or other  critical molecules in single biological cells. This unique device is based on stimulated  Raman scattering and can simultaneously measure the concentrations and temporal  evolution of several different molecular species.",
