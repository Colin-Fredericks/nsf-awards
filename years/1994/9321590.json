 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kareiva   9321590       With few exceptions, diseases which are spread by ticks are  maintained within wildlife populations, not human populations.  A  similar biology is seen for flea-borne diseases; for example,  plague is maintained in wild rodent populations without the  involvement of humans.  Perhaps because these diseases are  maintained in wildlife populations instead of human populations,  little work has been done on the dynamics of these diseases and the  flea or tick behaviors that influence the disease dynamics.  In  comparison, there is long history of work on the dynamics of human  infectious diseases.  Much of this work, however, assumes that  transmission of disease occurs via random mixing of infected and  susceptible individuals.  In general this is not an accurate  description of animal behavior, and it may be particularly  inappropriate for describing the transmission of diseases spread by  ectoparasites ( parasites, such as fleas and ticks that live on the  exterior of their hosts).       This research project combines both experimental and  theoretical approaches to examine the effect of ectoparasite  behavior on the dynamics of diseases spread by these parasites.   The study system for this project is a species of rodent, Neotoma  cinerea, the fleas, Orchopeas sexdentatus and Anomiopsyllus  amphibolus, and the hard tick, Ixodes angustus in Western  Washington.  The work involves observations of flea and tick  movement within the rodent populations and incorporates the  observed behaviors into theoretical models to predict the effects  on disease dynamics.  The synthesis of field data and theoretical  studies is especially important in epidemiology, because one often  wants to identify quantitative attributes, such as thresholds for  the spread of disease.  By combining field studies with theoretical  models, this work seeks to develop realistic models and estimates  of numerical values of factors that strongly influence whether the  disease is epidemic and the disease is  spatial distribution.",
