 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the difficulties associated with  requirements analysis and design by combining object-oriented analysis and design with formal  methods.    A formalization of an object-oriented diagramming method is being developed,  and a framework of rules for reasoning about the meaning of its  diagrams is being defined.  Diagrams are treated as data type definitions,  and  the rules  enable the automated checking of the consistency  of the definitions.  The  diagramming method comprises three  commonly used graphical notations that  define the Object Modeling  Techniques; (1) object models, (2) data flow diagrams,   and (3) state charts,  which have been used to perform requirements analysis.    As such, the rules defined for these notations provide a formal basis  for   requirements analysis and allow the rigorously checked  diagrams to be used as   formal specifications.  Diagram  composition rules have corresponding proof  obligations regarding  consistency.  Automated  techniques are used to determine the consistency and  completeness of a system's  requirements as depicted by the  diagrams.  A set of transformation  rules for diagrams and their corresponding  formal specifications are used to derive designs, guide the implementation process,  and validate the developed  code. A  graphics-based prototype environment is  being developed that  encapsulates the formalization process and existing  specification  and program development tools.",
