 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322040  Whitesell  Advances in high technology areas such as electrooptical  interfaces are currently limited by methods for fabrication and  processing of new materials.  For example, optical switches  require materials with alignment of the polar axis of the  composite molecules.  The synthesis of highly oriented materials  as thin films on surfaces using new synthetic methods and  techniques was recently reported.  These studies represent the  beginning of a major program leading to unique materials with  major practical applications.  In the area of alpha-amino acid  peptides there is a great potential for practical  applications of these materials in photostable, electrooptical  devices.  Furthermore, it is likely that a range of other  polymers can be fabricated in new forms as thin films on  surfaces.  Broadly stated, the goals of this program are:  1.  Fabrication:  to study in detail ways of preparing alpha-  amino acid peptides as ordered arrays on metal and non-metal  surfaces, including photolithographic techniques for the  construction of nanoscale structures; 2.  Physical  characterization:  to expand knowledge of the properties of these  peptide layers, especially as they relate to their unusual,  highly polar nature; 3.  Extensions:  to examine other polymer  systems for applicability to ordered growth on surfaces, with the  aim of preparing novel thin films heretofore never examined.  %%%  As a result of this research, methods of fabrication novel,  highly oriented thin films from alpha-amino acids will be  developed.  The films are promising candidates for the  construction of optical switches for the next generation of  electrooptical devices.",
