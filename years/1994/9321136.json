 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321136  Rabinow  Biotechnology is rapidly revolutionizing biology.  New techniques  promise to cure disease and alter genes of plants, animals, and  ultimately of humans themselves.  Fears of these humanly engineered  species have led American opponents to attempt to block sales of  genetically altered foods in supermarkets.  \"Animal rights\"  activists have also sought to halt manipulation of animal genes.   An important topic for Science and Technology Studies is to examine  the ways biotechnology has affected societies around the world.   Under the direction of Professor Rabinow, Soren Germer is examining  the recent German controversy over a patent on a transgenic mouse,  the Harvard oncomouse.  The goal of this project is to document the  social and cultural repercussions of contemporary biotechnology in  a concrete case and a specific national setting.  Two questions  frame this research:  How has the oncomouse, as a tangible product  of modern biotechnology, affected contemporary German ideas and  practices concerning the relationship between humans and animals?  and, What are the particular characteristics of the German  development and reception of recent biotechnology?  Mr. Germer is  conducting 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Munich, Germany,  with the main adversaries in the oncomouse controversy -- a group  of biotechnology critics, a group of geneticists, and various  patent lawyers -- in order to chart their conflicting beliefs and  practices.  He is exploring local competing perspectives on the  relationship between humans and animals, on science and technology,  and on culture and nature.  The way we classify, think, and treat  animals plays an important role in how we define ourselves as  humans. This dissertation contributes to the analysis of late-  modern German cultural identity as it is reshaped by the radical  changes which science presents.  ***",
