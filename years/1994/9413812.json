 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tomlin    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Russell Tomlin and  his collaborators will purchase: computing equipment needed to  develop animations and other video elicitation materials for  cognitive research; computing equipment needed to run multiple  subjects for experimental research; and video, sound and computer  equipment needed for field research and data analysis.  The  Department of Linguistics at the University of Oregon focuses on  empirical, data-oriented research in two principal inter-related  areas: descriptive linguistics and cognitive linguistics. The  equipment provided will permit the department to develop the  infrastructure needed to expand, in a significant fashion, both  empirical and experimental research. The group will develop  discourse elicitation and experimental tools suitable for the  field situations but also well-grounded in cognitive principles  of language use which can be tested in a laboratory setting. On  this basis, insights drawn from careful, cross-linguistic  description can serve to develop sound cognitive theories of  language and language use.    Large numbers of languages in many parts of the world are on the  verge of extinction as the pools of native speakers die out. The  Oregon department has focussed on collecting such rapidly  disappearing information and using it to develop broader language  theories. The proposed equipment has a visual component which  will permit investigators to present a carefully controlled  scenes which can vary in specific ways and use these as  elicitation devises to provide insight into grammar and  discursive form. The equipment will be used not only by a number  of professional linguists but also by many graduate and  undergraduate students.",
