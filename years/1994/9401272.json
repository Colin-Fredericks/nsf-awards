 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401272  Mason             This award is concerned with the theory of rational  orbifolds as part of the broader, and currently very active area,  of vertex operator algebras and their representations.  It is  closely associated to 2-dimensional conformal field theory.  The  principal investigator will examine questions of  modular-invariance of partition functions, the construction of  twisted sectors, and the general phenomena of higher genus  orbifolds.  Methods include ideas from vertex operator algebra  theory, modular forms and group theory, all of which play a role  in the so-called Moonshine.            Conformal field theory is an important physical theory  describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed  matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.   Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich  mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has  interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different  branches of mathematics, such as representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular  functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is  revealed in the study of conformal field theory.",
