 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405492  Ackers  Previous work under this grant achieved a breakthrough in this  problem by developing strategies that resolve the functional  energetics of hemoglobin tetramers in all ten states of hemesite  ligation, using non-oxygen ligands. This has opened the door to  obtalning previously-inaccessible knowledge regarding properties  of the intermediate species and their roles in the cooperative  mechanism. Work using the  2 analog cyanomet indicates that: (a)  the hemoglobin molecule acts as a three-state molecular switch to  control ligand affinity; (b) the intermediate state has a  quaternary T structure and has stored energy through  ligand-induced tertiary structure changes; (c) this free energy  of \"tertiary constraint\" pays for the early stage of  cooperativity prior to the quaternary T~R switch; (d) the T  structure can accommodate tertiary constraint in only one dimeric  half-molecule, leading to a Symmetry Rule for the quaternary  transition: T~R switching occurs when each dimeric halfmolecule  acquires ligated hemesites.  In current work, we are extending  these studies to mutant hemoglobins in order to map the  structural pathways of free energy transduction and to establish  the connections with oxygen binding. We shall use multiple  combinations of altered amino acid residues and ligated hemesites  to determine contrlbutions of local residue energies to the  quaternary T to R switch. Parallel studies will test the  correspondence between cyanomet ligation and oxygenation. This  research will use a combination of techniques, including  quantitative low temperature isoelectric focusing and high  precision binding of oxygen. The results from this research will  serve as a model forstudying \"molecular codes\" in other complex  regulatory protein assemblies.  %%%  The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular  mechanism of cooperative oxygenation in human hemoglobin. We are  attempting to decipher the rules and energetic driving forces  whereby the ten molecular for ms (each with a structurally-unique  combination of ligated and unligated heme sites) respond to the  interactions with heme-site ligands and with small regulatory  molecules including protons, chloride ions, and 2,3-  diphosphoglycerate.  ***",
