 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project of the Experimental Physical  Chemistry Program in the   Chemistry Division, Prof. D.H. Levy of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Chicago will conduct a series of investigations on the   photochemistry of molecules and weakly bound molecular complexes of   biochemical interest.   Studies of van der Waals systems involving   complexes of  amino tetrazine, proton transfer reactions in organic   dimers, and investigations of porphyrin dimers will be undertaken.    The   structures of amino acids and peptides in the gaseous phase, the charge   and energy transfer in bi-chromophoric molecules, and laser desorption of   fragile organic molecules will be investigated by spectroscopic   techniques.      The underlying goal of this research program is to obtain a better   understanding of the  properties of large biomolcules.  The relationship   between the structure and function of biomolcules is to be determined   through the spectroscopic investigations of simple amino acids, peptides   and other building blocks of  the larger  biomolecular complexes.  Not   only the structures, but also the rate at which protons can transfer from   one molecule to another, as well as the rate at which electric charge and   energy move or are localized within a complex are also important for this   understanding .  Special techniques are being developed to vaporize    weakly bound biomolecular complexes without at the same time dissociating   them into their component molecules.",
