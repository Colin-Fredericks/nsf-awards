(Illinois Institute of Technology)        The project will support the travel of four distinguished foreign engineers and scientists to come to the U.S. to participate in a symposium on thin liquid films at the AICHE annual Meeting and to visit U.S. universities to give seminars and to encourage collaboration..    Many of the key researchers in thin liquid films are from outside the U.S.  To assist U.S. workers in the field, the project brings four of the eminent engineers and scientists in the field to the U.S.  All funds are used for these participant costs.  The foreign visitors are featured at a symposium of two sessions at the 1994 AICHE Annual Meeting at San Francisco in November.  The sessions are arranged and chaired by the P.I.'s, who are leading U.S. researchers in the field of thin liquid films and the effects of these films on the stability of foams and emulsions.  The proper characterization of this stability is a key factor in much pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and other chemical processing.  Visits of the foreign researchers to U.S. universities are arranged as part of this project.",
