 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451098  Barber  In order to enhance the teaching of behavioral neuroscience in our Psychology curriculum, we propose  to acquire specific equipment items for introductory and methodology courses in Biological Psychology  and for student research in this field. The formal courses bring students up to date on basic findings,  theories, and techniques of Biological Psychology. Equipment requested for the Introductory course in  the sequence (Psychology 125) will facilitate a weekly demonstration component that provides video,  interactive computer, and hands-on experiences to enable students to visualize structure/function  relationships and to \"see\" anatomical and physiological terminology in an active context. The  Methodology course (Psychology 325) combines lectures and discussions with laboratory exercises.  Students ultimately perform a guided experiment on brain/behavior relationships, using equipment  provided by the grant. In this experiment, students examine (1) the normal physiological functioning of  brain structures implicated in learning and memory and (2) the ways these structures may affect learning  and memory. Students in the Methodology course also prepare a professional report of their experiment  and participate in co-producing a Laboratory Manual in Biological Psychology, to be used by future  student generations. Thus, they undertake a full range of scientist's activites, from the acquisition of  factual information, through the generation of new data, to dissemination of information into the  community of scientists.",
