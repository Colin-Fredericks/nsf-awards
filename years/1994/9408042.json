 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9408042  An in vivo gene-trapping technique has been developed in  Arabidopsis using the transposable elements Ac and Ds.  Our  modified Ds element (DsG) contains a Beta-glucuronidase reporter  gene that is equipped with splice acceptor signals to allow multi-  frame gene fusions (an \"exon-trap\").  When this Ds element inserts  into a chromosomal gene, the pattern of chromosomal gene expression  is mimiced by the Beta-glucuronidase reporter gene.  Because  expression depends on gene fusion, insertions that result in  reporter gene expression will also result in gene disruption.   Using a novel selection scheme, a collection of 5,000 plants will  be generated that will each carry an insertion at a different  location in the genome.  Insertions into genes will be identified  by staining the progeny of each plant for reporter gene expression:   15-20% of DsG insertions result in reporter gene expression, so  that the proposed collection should include insertions into 500-  1,000 genes.  We will use this collection to develop an exon-trap  sequencing technique to enable the rapid sequencing of a portion of  the chromosomal gene identified by each exon-trap tag.  The  chromosomal exon corresponding to each insertion will be amplified  by RACE PCR, and its sequence determined.  As many of the exons as  possible will be mapped via anchored YAC contigs and recombinant  inbred lines.  A database of DsG insertion lines will be developed,  each characterized by expression pattern, mutant phenotype and map  location, as well as partial exon sequence.  This database can be  integrated with existing genomic and cDNA sequence databases.  ***  A major goal in the characterization of the Arabidopsis genome is  to assign a function to genes identified by cDNA and genomic  sequencing, gene-finding algorithms, and map location.  Homology  searches are expected to fulfill this goal for those genes that  have similarity to sequences from other organisms.  However, a  majority of gene products will remain an onymous in these large  collections of sequenced genes.  In the proposed study, a function  will be assigned to many of these genes by determining their  patterns of expression, and by observing the mutant phenotype that  results from gene disruption.  This proposal will form the basis  for establishing a large database of insertion lines, as other  laboratories use the \"starter\" lines to generate collections of  their own.  This will allow a function to be assigned to many of  the genes identified by DNA sequence alone, as well as providing a  genetic resource of widespread use.  %%%",
