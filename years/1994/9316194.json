 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316194  Ma    The long term goal of these studies is to understand the  molecular mechanisms controlling flower development in  Arabidopsis.  Three specific aims are identified:  (1) The  PI will analyze agamous (AG) function using inducible  promoter fusions.  The focus will be on already generated  transgenic plants that carry fusions of AG with a heatshock  promoter.  The PI will perform temperature shift experiments  at different times and study the effects of such treatment.  (2)  The PI will identify and characterize AG binding sites.  He has characterized in vitro DNA binding with wild-type AG  proteins.  He will use the DNA binding assays to  characterize several AG truncation mutant proteins which he  has expressed in E. coli.  He will also test one point  mutant that causes a very interesting ag-like phenotype in  transgenic plants.  The PI also plans to test DNA binding in  yeast and will use this system to analyze different AG  target sites, including those from the AGL1 gene.  (3)  The  PI will test possible AG target genes, using in vitro and in  vivo assays to study AG binding to potential AG-binding  sites in the 5' AGL1 untranscribed region and in the large  AGL1 intron.  Sites identified in vitro will be further  analyzed in yeast and in transgenic plants using reporter  gene constructs.  These studies will further our  understanding of AG function during flower development,  particularly its role as a transcriptional regulator of  genes in a regulatory hierarchy.  ***",
