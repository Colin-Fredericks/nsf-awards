 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313042  Range       Professor John E. Fornaess, a leading international  expert in the area of multidimensional complex analysis,  will present a series of ten lectures, centering around the  behavior of classes of holomorphic self-maps of complex n-  dimensional Euclidean spaces and projective spaces.  Just as  in the one dimensional case - widely known through stunning  computer generated visualisations - iteration of such maps  in higher dimensions reveals surprising phenomena, and new  properties of dynamical systems which need to be understood.  While some of the work in dimension two goes back to  classical work of Fatou and Bieberbach in the 1920's (Fatou,  together with Julia, is one of the pioneers of complex  dynamics in dimension one), most of the topics covered in  Fornaess' lectures are based on quite recent work.  The  field is the subject of many current investigations, and  there are many open problems.  The lectures are intended to  make this research area accessible to non-experts in  multidimensional complex analysis, and they should help  mathematicians new to this field to gain a deeper  understanding of the major problems and current directions  of research in this new and rapidly expanding research area.       The conference will take place June 13 to June 18,  1994, on the campus of the University of Albany, State  University of New York.  Albany is the center of the Capital  District in Upstate New York, a cast region which includes  among its many educational institutions the University of  Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College,  Skidmore College and Siena College.  Multidimensional  complex analysis is an active area of research at the  University of Albany, and many experts in classical function  theory, ergodic theory and (real) dynamical systems work in  the region.  A special effort will be made to attract  interested participants from neighboring institutions, who  may want to enter this research field.  It is hoped that  this series of lectures  will help to build new interactions  between mathematicians from the different institutions in  the region, and stimulate new research efforts in  multidimensional complex analysis in the region.",
