The field work was carried out from an ice  camp jointly occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February  to June 1992.  The data set obtained by the principal investigator  consists of high frequency vertical profiles of velocity and  temperature from an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a  string of twelve internally recording temperature sensors, as well  as a Rapid Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor system  that free falls through the upper 250 meters of the ocean.  The  observational phase of the project was extremely successful.    The objective of the analysis phase is to study the dynamics of  diapycnal momentum and energy fluxes in the upper mixed layer, and  to investigate their dependence on shear induced mixing and double  diffusion.  The work will also provide kinematic descriptions of  the barotropic and baroclinic variability of surface currents and  temperature which will be used to study how the free internal  gravity wave field responds to topography and to changes in the  large-scale hydrography.  ***",
