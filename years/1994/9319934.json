 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319934  Saladin       Several experimental investigations on the behavior of  nuclei at high angular velocity (i.e. high spin) are proposed.   The interest in such studies lies in the fact that, as the  angular velocity of a nucleus is increased, its internal  structure changes due to the influence of the coriolis and  centrifugal interaction.  The proposed experimental program will  be carried out with the Pitt array at Notre Dame, the Pitt-FSU  array at FSU and at Gammasphere.  In the A=70 to 80 region a  search for theoretically predicted superdeformed bands is  proposed.  It is furthermore proposed to study odd A nuclei in  the A=70 to 90 region and in particular the odd-odd nucleus Br-  78.  A series of lifetime studies on Ac-219 by means of DSAM and  the plunger method are proposed.  A series of experiments are  proposed. which are based on conversion electron spectroscopy  which can provide crucial information on the multipolarity of  transitions.  Specifically it is proposed to study the origin of  \"surplus\" electrons that were observed by the Pitt group in Ce-  130.  Experiments are planned in neighboring nuclei in the A=130  nuclei and for different target and projectile combinations.  It  is furthermore proposed to confirm the M1-character of the  recently found so-called M1-bands in the light Hg and Pb region.",
