 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404157  Jin    Numerical methods for hyperbolic systems with inhomogeneities and  general conservation laws will be studied, involving three main  projects:  I. continuing the study and development of  under-resolved numerical schemes for hyperbolic systems with  relaxations, with applications in phase transition modeling and  kinetic theory of rarefied gas dynamics; II. continuing the  development, analysis and application of the relaxation schemes  for general conservation laws; III. studying the fluid dynamic  limits of some kinetic schemes for the compressible Euler  equations.  These projects, if successfully carried out, will put  various numerical approaches for general conservation laws into  perspective, and provide new numerical tools for solving problems  related to conservation laws.    Systems of conservation laws are among the most important and  difficult physical problems that mathematicians, physicists and  engineers have been investigating.  These problems arise from,  for example, fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics, and phase  transitions.  The important physical quantities, such as mass,  momentum and energy, are governed by systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.  For most of these problems it is  impossible to find the exact solutions, and the qualitative  behavior of the solutions is exceedingly hard to obtain by  mathematical analysis.  Thus, numerical simulation has been  playing a critical role in studying these problems.  Successful  numerical simulations to these problems require not only modern  advanced computing equipment, but also numerical methods that  work correctly, accurately and efficiently.  The goal of the  proposed research is to develop robust numerical methods, to  analyze their behavior, and moreover, to apply them to explore  the interesting yet challenging physical problems that are  described by systems of conservation laws.",
