Given student demand for GIS  courses and the evolution of GIS technology, our GIS Lab is  seriously deficient in equipment and software.     The improvements proposed incorporate results of the NSF supported  National Center of Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA)  study of core curriculum requirements for GIS. The improvements  will provide our students with strong hands-on training in raster  and UNIX vector GIS systems, GIS concepts, geocoding, data  structures and editing, the building of topology, analytical  modeling, GIS applications and cartographic presentation. The  requested equipment will allow major improvements in the  Geographic/Land Information Systems course and allow immediate  development of three new GIS courses: Advanced Methods in GIS,  Environmental Applications of GIS (an innovative team-oriented  course), and GIS Applications in Business (tentative title). Four  additional courses also will experience significant improvement.  With the new equipment, image processing and several levels of  networking are made possible. Additionally, the proposed  improvements will allow implementation of a local GIS Adopt-A-  School Program. This innovative program is designed to enrich  education within environmental science, earth science, and  geography curricula. The improvements will ensure that students  receive up-to-date training in the technology and methods that are  becoming important tools for the stewards of our natural, social  and economic systems.",
