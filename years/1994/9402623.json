Mathematical modelsare presented to lend insight into a wide  variety of biologicaland biomedical areas, including population  and community dynamics,cell and tumor dynamics, epidemiology,  immunology, and physiology.Advances in mathematical methods that  are useful in analyzingbiological data and models are explored  via lectures ondifferential equations, dynamical systems,  functional analysis,control theory, and probability and  statistics.  The program forthe meeting includes eight principal  survey lectures;approximately 80 shorter lectures and 20 posters  by otherparticipants present recent research results.         The purpose of the Conference is to provide a forum  forexposition of new research in the field of mathematical  biologymathematics applied in biology), and to promote  interactionbetween mathematical and biological scientists.   Interactionbetween mathematics and other sciences has always  played animportant role in the advancement of scientific  knowledge.Recently, as biological knowledge has exploded,  interactionbetween biologists and mathematicians has increased.   Theseinteractions have improved understanding of theoretical  andpractical questions in biology, and have stimulated  mathematiciansto develop new methods appropriate for these  questions.  In thisConference, research papers are given on  mathematical analysis ofthe spread and possibilities for control  of AIDS and otherepidemics, on questions about scales of  measurement in ecology andenvironmental science, on radiotherapy  and chemotherapy, onseveral physiological medical problems, and  on other problems.  Newbasic research on mathematical methodology  is also reported.  Aspecial effort has been made to attract a mix  of established andnew researchers, includin g women and  minorities.  The format ofthe meeting includes plenary survey  lectures, individual researchpapers, and poster sessions, thus  encouraging exchange of ideasamong established and new  researchers in this interdisciplinaryfield.",
