 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319835  Ostrom    Common Pool Resources (CPRs) have been the focus of extensive  research in the social sciences.  In particular, there has been  an ever-growing policy debate regarding the ability of diverse  institutions to cope with the allocation issues that surround  CPRs.  Individuals jointly using a CPR are assumed to face a  social dilemma - - often called the tragedy of the commons - - in  which individually rational resource users ignore the external  harm they impose on other users, leading to outcomes that are not  rational from the perspective of the group.    Using a theoretical and empirical approach with foundations in  game theory, field studies, and experimental methods, the  authors' previous research addressed numerous questions related  to the allocation issues that surround CPRs.  The current  investigation extends this previous work by examining behavioral  regularities in more complex (more realistic) laboratory and  field environments.  In particular, the proposed research begins  the process of examining behavior in environments with the  following attributes:  time dependencies; multiple equilibria;  heterogeneities; and, local/global nesting.  Each of these  attributes will be investigated with a specific focus on how the  institutional setting interacts with individual and group  behavior.    In the laboratory, time-dependent settings will be investigated  in which subjects' current decisions have significant  consequences on the characteristics of the decision setting they  face in future plays of the game.  Settings will be investigated  where subjects make decisions facing exogenously imposed \"rules  of the game: and settings where subjects have flexibility in  choosing the rules.  A principle focus will be the potential  conflict that arises due to heterogeneities in input endowments,  costs, technology, and information.    In the field, the focus will also address issues of time  dependency and appropriator heterogeneity in relation to  variations in physical a nd institutional conditions.  The filed  research will focus principally on forestry resources.  As part  of prior NSF funding, the authors developed and pretested a  series of data collection instruments that can be used to record  systematic data about forests and forest institutions on a  repeated basis over time.  This current project is crucial for  extensive scientific analyses of this evolving database.  ***",
