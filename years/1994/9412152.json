 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412152  Rapoport      The popular movement and candidacy of H. Ross Perot added an  historic dimension to the 1992 presidential election. By winning  19 percent of the popular vote, Mr. Perot outdistanced all  independent candidates in the 20th century except Theodore  Roosevelt, who ran as a popular ex-president in 1912.  Perot;s  success in mobilizing thousands of activists and attracting  millions of votes raised questions about the health of the  American two-party system, and whether he would be able to  transform his movement into an enduring third party.    The most important and enduring legacy of the Perot movement will  likely be manifest through the cadre of activists mobilized by  his campaign.  The Perot movement will change the parties whether  Mr. Perot runs again for president in 1996, and whether he is  able to convert his movement into a third party.  The purpose of  this investigation is to monitor active participants in the 1992  Perot campaign as they encounter the 1994 congressional elections  and the 1996 presidential election.  By studying changes in their  attitudes, perceptions, and behavior, and by comparing them with  samples of activists in the two major parties, the investigators  will be able to track the Perot movement and its impact on the  two party system.",
