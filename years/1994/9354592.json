 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354592  Snell  CHANCE is a course designed to teach fundamental ideas of  probability and statistics in the context of real world questions  of current interest.  Such questions might include: Do basketball  players tend to shoot in streaks?  Do lefties die younger than  righties?  How reliable are opinion polls?  Do men tend to die just  before their birthdays and women just after them? Does lowering  your cholesterol make you more likely to die by murder, accident,  or suicide?  CHANCE students learn that with the help of basic  notions of probability and statistics, they can think critically  for themselves about issues such as these.  Teaching a CHANCE  course only requires a solid knowledge of probability and  statistics, boundless enthusiasm, the time and energy needed to  keep up with the news, a receptive administration, a good library,  and a willingness to plunge into uncharted territory.  Materials  are being developed and online resources are available by computer  network that will make it significantly simpler to institute and  teach a CHANCE course.",
