 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452815  Canton    The dilemma of student retention has always plagued educational  institutions, especially community colleges.  Although many  community colleges directs some of its efforts toward student  retention, many such efforts are, at best fragmented and ill  planned.  This has also happened in the initiation of mentoring  programs developed by community colleges to combat the problem of  high dropout rates, especially among minority students.  Thus, the  purpose of this proposal is to develop a \"Mentoring Guide for  Community Colleges.\"    This guide will be designed as a resource to assist administrators,  faculty, staff, students and other decision makers to understand  the factors involved in developing a planned mentoring program.   The \"Mentoring Guide for Community Colleges\" will be developed and  written by Dr. Marcia Canton and Dr. David James and edited by Mr.  William Brescia.  Among the major objectives of the guide are the  following: (1) essential components of a planned mentor program and  (2) specific examples of successful mentor programs in community  colleges as well as potential pitfalls that can lead to the demise  of mentor programs.    The projected outcome of this proposal is the production and  distribution of 5,000 \"Mentoring Guides for Community Colleges,\" of  which 1,000 copies of the \"Mentoring Guides for Community  Colleges,\" will be provided to the National Science Foundation.",
