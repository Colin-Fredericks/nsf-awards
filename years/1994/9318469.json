Singlet-triplet energy gaps of biradical-like molecules will   be determined by matrix-isolation electron energy loss   spectroscopy (EELS). Through bond contributions to spin-  orbit coupling and the mechanisms of spin density   delocalization in saturated radicals and biradicals using   molecular orbital theory will be analyzed. New   perfluorinated biradical-like species will be prepared under   conditions of matrix-isolation and a new approach to   selective reactions in matrices will be explored.   Automerization between the two Kekule structures of   cyclobutadiene will be investigated as well. The results   will provide new understanding of the chemical bonding and   properties of reactive intermediates, and the role they play   in thermal and photochemical reactions.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing research of Professor Josef Michl at the   University of Colorado. Normally, there are a total of four   other atoms and pairs of electrons associated with carbon.   Carbon radicals are typically reactive intermediates and   have a total of three other atoms and pairs of electrons   plus one additional electron. Species containing one and two   radical sites will be studied by sophisticated spectroscopic   methods at low temperatures. Interactions between the two   radical sites will be addressed. Calculations of the   structure and energy of these species will be carried out as   well to complement the experimental results. These results   will provide a new understanding of bonding and properties   of reactive intermediates, and their role in thermal and   photo-initiated reactions.  ***",
