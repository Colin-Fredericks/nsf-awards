Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental switch are poorly understood.  Dr. Weigel has previously isolated a gene, LEAFY, that is the earliest known gene to be active in flowers of the small crucifer Arabidopsis, and whose activity is required for floral identity.  He proposes to use genetic and molecular approaches to decipher the genetic hierarchy that leads form floral induction to pattern formation within the flower, initially using the LEAFY gene as a main tool.  Specific questions that he will address include the following:  (1) How does floral induction lead to the activation of genes that determine floral identity? (2) Which genes, in addition to LEAFY, control floral identity?  How is the pattern or organ emergence in shoots and flowers regulated?  (4) Are the mechanisms uncovered in Arabidopsis conserved in other species of flowering plants?  %%%  This work seeks to investigate and identify molecular mechanisms underlying the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in the life cycle of a flowering plant.  Specific questions will be asked in Arabidopsis thaliana and, ultimately, in other flowering plants.  The answers to be obtained to those questions will lead to a mechanistic understanding of floral determination which will permit directed manipulation of flowering not only in Arabidopsis but also in other, economically important plants.  ***",
