 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator plans to study several problems in  design of experiments.  The projection properties of orthogonal  arrays and some other designs will be investigated.   Recent research has shown that interesting projection properties  of certain orthogonal arrays have important statistical  implications.  The newly introduced concept of estimation  capacity, a measure of the capability of a design to handle and  estimate different potential models involving interactions, will  also be investigated.  In addition to factorial designs, the  Principal Investigator will study optimal and efficient  regression designs under random block-effects models.  Other  proposed research includes the Principal Investigator's  collaboration with Professor Ker-Chau Li on the study of  dimension reduction techniques for the analysis of data from  designed experiments.  Such techniques, in conjunction with  dynamic graphics, can help extract additional useful information  that may not be provided by traditional analyses.  The resulting  design issues will also be studied.    Experimental design is used extensively in a wide range of  scientific and industrial investigations.  In industrial  experiments, often a large number of factors have to be studied,  but the experiments are expensive to conduct.  Fractional  factorial designs are particularly useful to handle this problem.   In recent years, factorial designs have received considerable  attention, mainly due to the Japanese success in applying them to  improve quality in industrial manufacturing.  This re-surgence of  interest provides an opportunity to re-examine some conventional  wisdom.  This will be given the highest priority in the Principal  Investigator's research activities during the coming years.  In  addition to theoretical studies, good designs will also be  constructed for experimenters' use.  Other proposed research  includes a problem arising from a recent optometry experiment,  and the study of the performance of a new data-analyt ic tool on  experimental data.",
