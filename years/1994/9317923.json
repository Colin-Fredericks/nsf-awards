Behavioral variability is also an important  component of problem-solving, creativity, and possibly even  mental health.  Dr. Neuringer's research is directed at  providing basic information about how variable and novel  behaviors are generated and influenced.  Dr. Neuringer has  developed a system to study the effects of positive  reinforcement on behavioral variability.  He will examine  basic theoretical questions as well as the effects of  incentives, drugs, and aging on the ability to generate  variable behavior.  He will investigate what contributes to  an individual preferring to vary its behaviors as opposed to  repeating a single act.  He also will study the  contributions of reinforced variations to the learning of  new responses, cognitive strategies and categories.  Dr.  Neuringer's research will make significant contributions  towards our theoretical and practical knowledge of this  relatively unstudied but important dimension of behavior.",
