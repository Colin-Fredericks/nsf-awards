 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320409  Ramakrishnan    This award supports a U.S.-U.K. Workshop on Fiber Reinforced  Cement and Concrete to be held in Sheffield, United Kingdom, June  1994.  The objectives of the workshop are to review the most  recent advances in the field of fiber-reinforced cement based  composities and to identify future collaborative research  directions.  The workshop will also address the different forms  of composites with discrete or continuous fibers, the  characteristics of advanced cement as they influence the  properties of composites, and worldwide standards or  specifications for the use of fiber-reinforced concretes. The co-  chairpersons are V. Ramakrishnan of the South Dakota School of  Mines and Technology and R.N. Swamy of the University of  Sheffield.      Rapid advances have occured in the development and application of  new materials of construction like fiber-reinforced composites,  especially in the United Kingdom. New cement composites are of  great importance to civil infrastructure efforts as they can  extend the life of many existing, old facilities and provide for  new, longer-lasting and economic structures.  The proposed  workshop will advance U.S. research efforts in this area through  information exchange and initiation of links with leading  researchers in the United Kingdom.  ***",
