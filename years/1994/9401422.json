 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401422  Koch       Professor Koch is investigating spin models relevant to the   theory of critical phenomena, neural network models related to   disordered systems in statistical mechanics and variational   problems for non-periodic orbits and configurations. the   techniques and results from previous work on hierarchical models   are applied and extended to a larger class of ferromagnetic   models. The investigation of neural networks focuses on large   general purpose associative memories of the type of Hopfield's   model with thermal noise. The third project deals with  variational problems for nontrivial orbits and ground states of  dynamical systems and statistical mechanics models, respectively.       Professor Koch's work is in the area broadly known as   mathematical physics where a deep mathematical understanding of  physical models is sought. One of his projects involves an  investigation of the renormalization group, where an attempt is  made to understand interactions at all length scales  simultaneously. This is one of the most important problems in  statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.  ***",
