 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321370  Smocovitis  One of the most significant but least understood events in the  recent history of science is the evolutionary synthesis which  developed around the time of World War II.  Under this grant, Dr.  Smocovitis is investigating how the synthesis might best be seen in  the context of the emerging discipline of evolutionary biology--the  area of biology which is frequently thought to be the \"central  organizing principle\" or \"central metaphor\" of the modern  biological sciences.  This process of discipline formation in turn  took place within larger efforts to unify the biological sciences  in this period.    Dr. Smocovitis has organized this study in several parts.  One  component involves examination of the merging discipline in the  context of positivist efforts to unify knowledge. She is examining  the question to what extent, and exactly how, the \"architects\" of  the evolutionary synthesis inherited and accommodated these global  efforts to unify knowledge.  She is also documenting how positivist  epistemology shaped their vision of legitimate science through  methodological concerns such as the adoption of experimental  methodologies, choice of study organism, and the application of  quantitative methods to the historical science of evolution.  Another component of the study involves a look at the emerging  discipline itself through the organizational and institutional  efforts to unify and legitimate evolutionary studies in the US.   The final component of this study is an examination of political,  ethical, and national concerns of the interwar period such as the  desire to formulate a meaningful evolutionary world view.  This  project promises not only to shed light on this significant episode  in the history of western science, but will also make transparent  the historically rooted, context-bound, and humanistic features of  scientific knowledge.  ***",
