 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361232  Taylor  Existing commercial modeling and simulation software packages do  not adequately predict the behavior of complex computer-  controlled systems being developed and fielded today.  These  \"hybrid\" systems involve discontinuous phenomena such as  mechanical parts engaging and disengaging (e.g., spacecraft  docking), control units switching, and software components  reconfiguring.  Unfortunately, these effects are handled  inaccurately and sometimes even missed completely.  Recent  research in nonlinear systems has revealed that there are many  circumstances where this deficiency presents a major barrier to  showing that a system will perform as required, or conversely  that a newly designed system may have safety-critical defects.   For example, a hybrid system may be prone to oscillation or to  chaotic behavior (seemingly random motion) and the simulator will  not be able to predict these problems in time to avoid costly  accidents or redesign.  We propose in Phase I to develop both a rigorous modeling  language for representing such phenomena, and integration  algorithms that will simulate discontinuous nonlinear hybrid  systems with complete accuracy.  The language will be developed  according to modern standards, to facilitate correct modeling  practices.  The integration algorithms will rigorously catch and  hand all discontinuous events.  A commercial package will be  produced in Phases II and III.  ***",
