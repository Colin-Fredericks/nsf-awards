 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first part of the proposal (sections 1-6) is concerned with  several important aspects of the design and analysis of  experiments. In section 1 we study a fundamental problem on the  maximum number of factors an orthogonal array can accommodate. In  section 2 we examine three problems of design selection: (i)  determination and construction of mixed 2- and 4-level designs  with minimum aberration, (ii) study of a new design criterion,  (iii) a theory for choosing ``optimum'' blocking schemes for full  and fractional factorial designs. In section 3 we propose some  optimal design algorithms for constructing efficient  supersaturated designs. In section 4 we study analysis strategies  that allow us to entertain and estimate interactions from designs  with complex aliasing. In section 5, we study the properties of  M-estimators in the context of factorial experiments. Section 6  deals with joint modeling and efficient estimation of location  and dispersion effects in robust parameter design. The second  part of the proposal is concerned with estimation problems that  arise in some reliability studies. Section 7.1 considers  situations where there are size-biases inherent in the analysis  of ``discovery'' or observational data. Section 7.2 deals with  inference in regression models with both time and covariate  censoring. Finally, in Section 7.3 we consider reliability  inference under an acceleration transform model, allowing the  study of non-linear transformations.   An important method of scientific inquiry is to run experiments  by purposely changing the conditions of the variables of  interest. It has been successfully employed in many  industrial,and agricultural investigation.   Two major issues in experimental investigation are how to  properly choose the experimental conditions(i.e., design), and to  analyze the experimental data(i.e., analysis).   Our proposed research strives to find novel designs that achieve  higher efficiencies and economy, and wider applications, and to  develop  novel analysis strategies that can extract more  information from the data for better decision making.   The second part of the proposal is on product reliability. We  propose to develop methods of statistical inference for a wider  class of models that can better describe the actual reliability  of industrial and commercial products. These statistical methods  can also be used to study other interesting problems like medical  follow-up, software reliability and depletion of petroleum  reserves.",
