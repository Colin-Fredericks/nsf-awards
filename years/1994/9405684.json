 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405684  Ward       We propose to investigate the biostratigraphy,  magnetostratigraphy, and strontium isotope stratigraphy of the  Upper Cretaceous Rosario Formation of southern California and Baja  California.  It has long been known that macrofossils are extremely  abundant from various horizons of the Rosario Formation.   Nevertheless, there has been relatively little study to date  investigating the biostratigraphy of these sections, especially  outcrops exposed in Baja California.  We have identified three  target sections located in Baja California that hold the promise of  greatly increasing our understanding of Upper Cretaceous  chronostratigraphy of the Pacific Coast.  We have recently  discovered that molluscan fossils from these sections are composed  of a mixed assemblage of Pacific Coast endemics and Gulf Coast and  European species.  Of greatest importance are European zonal index  ammonites, recognized here for the first time form the Pacific  Coast region.  Our target sections have already been partially  sampled for magnetostratigraphy.  By integrating a more complete  magnetostratigraphic sampling with a revised biostratigraphy, we  will produce, for the first time, a first order correlation between  Pacific Coast Upper Cretaceous strata and the stratotype sections  in Europe, and with Tethyan sections of the Gulf Coast, Western  Interior and Atlantic Coast Plain.",
