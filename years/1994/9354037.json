University  faculty, including outstanding mathematicians and scientists  will work together with secondary mathematics and science  teachers to revise course syllabi and pilot the targeted  courses.  Cooperating campuses include three of the  California State University campuses (Dominguez Hills, Los  Angeles and Northridge), the University of California, Santa  Barbara, and Loyola Marymount.  ***",
