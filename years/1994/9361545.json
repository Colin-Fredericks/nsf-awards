 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361545  Meador  Waveguides are used to transmit light through optical processors.   Combining the resolution potential of deep-UV photolithography and  the extreme sensitivity/high contrast of chemically amplified  positive acting (CAMP) resists offers a potentially simple method  for fabricating highly resolved, polymeric waveguides structures.   CAMP resists can be mated with other cladding materials with lower  refractive indices to provide the necessary gradient.  The  objectives of this program (Phases I and II) are to optimize CAMP  resists for waveguide applications, to directly fabricate structure  using deep-UV exposure, and to characterize the structure's  performance.    CAMP resists (thin film) are noted for outstanding sensitivity,  contrast, and resolution; but thick film performance is not well  documented.  For the Phase I effort, we will synthesize two acid-  sensitive polymers {poly(p-t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene) and poly(p-  t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene-sulfone)} and two photoacid generators  (2,6-dinitrobenzyl tosylate and triphenylsulfonium triflate).  The  polymers and photoacid generators will be chemically characterized;  and formulated resists will be tested for thick film application  performance, deep-UV sensitivity, contrast, resolution, near  infrared absorption, and refractive index.  Resist(s) will be  micromachined into waveguides and at least one structure  characterized (optical loss, SEM, refractive index).    The resist materials and waveguide fabrication procedures developed  in Phase I will be further improved in Phase II and preferred light  guiding structures characterized.  ***",
