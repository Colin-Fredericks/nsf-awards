The principal means to be used to gather this data are    1)   Correspondence with research leaders at various universities  around the country, and participation in several Internet news  groups to locate additional researchers;    2)   Visits to six to eight of the principal sites around the  country in which research on education and virtual environments is  underway;    3)   Travel to the United Kingdom (from France, during another  trip) to visit schools and universities developing research  programs in VE for education;    4)   Attendance of the National Educational Computing Convention in  Boston, MA for interviews and data gathering.    The resulting report will be provided to the National Science  Foundation in draft form on 15 May 1994, and in final form before  the end of June 1994.",
