These processes are of fundamental  importance to the growth and development of all living organisms.   In plants, little is known about the various mechanisms which  regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis, but most evidence suggests that  the important sites of regulation are the first and/or second steps  of the pathway, involving the enzymes carbamoylphosphate synthetase  (CPSase) and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase).    The objective of this research is to investigate the various  molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of these enzymes in  plants.  This will be accomplished by cloning the genes for CPSase  and ATCase, purifying and biochemically characterizing the enzyme  proteins, and producing CPSase and ATCase-specific antisera.  The  nucleic acid and antibody probes will be used to investigate  expression of the genes encoding CPSase and ATCase in different  plant tissues and in response to various treatments that would be  expected to impact pyrimidine biosynthesis.    The genes encoding CPSase and ATCase will be cloned by functional  complementation in E. coli carA/B- and pyrB- mutants.  This  approach has already permitted the successful isolation of two  different genes (pyrB1 and pyrB2) encoding functional ATCases in  pea.  This plant is the first organism in which more than one pyrB  gene has been demonstrated.  ***",
