 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451257  Gibson  We request funding to purchase and establish an earth station for  receiving high resolution images from the environmental satellites.  The station would be used in several areas of the sciences  (initially physics and ecology) and at several levels, from  introductory classes to undergraduate research. It would also be  used in an outreach research program for secondary teachers and  students.  Science Classes. Initially we would use the station in  PHY 220 Modern Physics and BIO 402 Ecology, where the physics  students would collect images from the satellites and use them to  prepare information products for the ecology students. The ecology  students would then do two projects: a meteorology project, where  they would obtain Lake Michigan surface water temperatures from the  satellite infra red images and ground-truth them against buoy data,  and a vegetation project, where they would use NDVI (Normalized  Difference Vegetation Index) techniques to follow changing  vegetation patterns in the state of Michigan during the fall by  assessing chlorophyll changes.  Undergraduate Research. We would  develop undergraduate research projects in both biology and  physics, taking advantage of the very large range of possibilities  inherent in the multi-spectral HRPT and VISSR images.  Outreach. We  would use the satellite receiving station in an outreach program to  involve secondary school teachers and students in accessible  research activities with the high resolution images. We have a  record of success with this type of research involvement with the  high school teachers and their students.",
