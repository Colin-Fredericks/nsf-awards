 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318890  Hughes  The flagella of the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium is a complex  organelle which is completely dispensable and thus amenable to  genetic dissection.  This research will focus on how the assembly  of the flagellar structure is regulated.  We have characterized a  gene, flg M, whose protein product regulates flagellin expression.   In cells unable to make a hook-basal body complex, the FlgM protein  prevents expression of flagellin genes.  This inhibition occurs by  interaction of FlgM with the alternative signa factor, o28, which  is specific for expression of the flagellin and chemotaxis genes  the details of the interaction between FlgM and o28 are being  explored.  In cells with a functional hook-basal body complex, the  FlgM protein is transported by the flagellar-specific export  pathway through the intact hook-basal body structure and into the  growth medium.  The specific role of FlgM in flagellar regulation  remains to be determined and is a focus of this proposal.  When  plan to use FlgM export to initiate a general characterization of  the flagellar-specific export pathway.  Besides the flgM gene,  three other novel regulatory loci were discovered which affect  flagellin regulation.  These will be further characterized as well.   Finally, the role of FlgM in virulence suggests a broader role in  the central Biology of S. typhimurium and we plan to explore what  other pathways are regulated by FlgM.  %%%  This research will provide insight into a mechanism by which cells  can control the assembly of structures on the surface of bacteria  that have been shown to be involved in pathogenesis.  ***",
