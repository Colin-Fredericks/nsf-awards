The two complementary components of the  program are:  (1) individual research projects in which each student works closely with an  advisor/mentor experienced with undergraduates, and (2) weekly lectures/discussions for all  the students.  Eleven undergraduates will participate in research with nine faculty sponsors in  the Department of Biology.  Students will be recruited intensively in the Boston area and also  elsewhere in New England and further afield, with particular attention to women, minorities  and non-traditional students.  The research is focused on issues of biodiversity and  conservation ecology but topics are intentionally diverse.  They include three on the  behavioral ecology of rare/endangered vertebrates, and others on the physiological ecology of  Lepidoptera, the diversity of bacteria, the genetics of endangered plants, and the genetic  diversity of deep-sea mollusks.  Each student will prepare a report and present a short paper  in a student research symposium.  The group meetings will address the theory and practice of  research and its conduct or its implications, including ethical issues.  Some of these ethical  components will be shared with REU students at Wellesley College and Boston University.    Participants will also visit two or more field sites and learn directly about each others'  projects.  A small hands-on workshop on molecular techniques will show the great potential  of such methods for ecology.  An end-of-session retreat at the University Field Station on  Nantucket Island will serve to articulate impressions, explore philosophical issues, and weave  together some of the summers' threads.  ***",
