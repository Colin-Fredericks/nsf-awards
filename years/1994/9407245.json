 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407245  The work proposed here will involve the study of conductance  anomalies in point contact, superconducting island and  superconducting to insulating transition in metallic films.  The work related to point contacts is very closely tied to  the experiments at Cornell.  The work on superconducting  islands focusses on understanding the even vs. odd number  of electrons in superconducting rodes and is motivated by   the experimental observation that the properties of these  systems depend upon whether the number of electrons is  odd or even.  The proposed work will develop a microscopic  theory of superconducting to insulating transition analogous  to the Anderson theory of localization.  %%%  The proposed research is to provide a fundamental understanding  of some unusual properties of point contacts and superconducting  rodes and is motivated by experiments in these systems.  The  work will also focus on developing a microscopic theory of  superconducting to insulating transition, which is one of  the important unsolved problems in theoretical condensed matter  physics.",
