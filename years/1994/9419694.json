 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to the History of Science Society (HSS), the Philosophy of Science Association (PSA), the Social Studies of Science Society (4S), and the Society for History of Technology (SHOT) to provide travel awards to graduate students independent scholars to attend the annual meetings of the societies in 1994.  Three of these societies (HSS, PSA, and 4S) will meet together in New Orleans October 13-16.  SHOT meets in Lowell Massachusetts October 6-9, 1994.      These travel grants are essential for the future of these new scholars in the STS disciplines.  They will be able to present their research findings to their colleagues within the disciplines, receive constructive criticism and learn of new approaches and new areas of interest.  These meetings begin the process of introduction of these scholars to their peers.  The criteria for selection include active participation in the organized sessions of the meetings.  Decisions are made by a committee within each society.   This award will provide support for at least 80 graduate students and unaffiliated scholars to participate in these professional meetings.",
