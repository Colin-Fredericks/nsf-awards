A  major educational reform is essential.  The NCTM Curriculum and  Evaluation Standards provide excellent direction for changes in  mathematics education, and inspired the development of this real-  world problem-solving high school mathematics courseware.  With  this courseware, teachers can base their instruction on real world  problems to be solved using mathematics, and provide their students  with the power of computing technology to do so.  The courseware  consists of 1) a set of 60 simulated real-world problems that  require practical solutions; 2) a set of 15 mathematical,  measurement, and data collection computing utilities; and 3) a  teacher guide.  Students are invited to explore problems,  implement problem-solving strategies, apply the appropriate  mathematical concepts, select and apply the computer utilities they  think are appropriate, and determine whether or not the problems  have been adequately solved.  This courseware is available in  CD-ROM based multimedia, as well as video tape and stand-alone  computer software.  ***",
