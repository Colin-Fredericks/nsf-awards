 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320549  Cleary    Studies of the cellular basis of learning and memory support  the  idea  that  learning  involves  changes  in  the  properties   of  individual  neurons in the brain. There is already evidence  that  learning  involves  dynamic  changes  in  the  strength  of   the  connections  between  nerve cells but  it  is  thought  that  the  structural  connectivity  between neurons  remains  stable.  This  proposal  addresses a very important question - the  relationship  between  changes  in  the  cell's  physiological  properties  and  changes  in the structure of the cells. This will be examined  in  sensory neurons of the marine mollusc Aplysia. These neurons  are  involved in the changes that occur when the snail learns  not  to  respond  to a noxious stimulus that is given over and  over  with  little  consequence, much in the same way that a human  jumps  in  response  to a loud noise but learns not to jump when  that  same  sound  is  heard  again and again. The experiments  look  at  the  structural  changes in the neurons that occur with  learning  and  how  these structural changes are affected by chemicals that  are  known  to interrupt the changes that occur in these neurons  with  learning.  The  results of this study will help us to  understand  the  way  that the cells in the brain change during learning  and  memory.",
