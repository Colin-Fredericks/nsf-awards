 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321833  Dickison       Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. William Dickison at  the University of North Carolina, graduate student Kenneth Cameron  is conducting field work in South America and in the Far East to  collect materials of the orchid groups related to the genus  Vanilla.  Morphological and molecular analyses will then yield new  characters for comparative studies aimed at improving taxonomic  recognition of species and genera and for inferring phylogenetic  relationships among these plants.  New molecular data from  chloroplast DNA and from nuclear ribosomal DNA are likely to  provide strong hypotheses of evolutionary relationships.  In turn,  knowledge of the evolutionary patterns in these orchid groups will  help assess trends of evolutionary change in pollen and seeds,  which are distinctive in many of the vanilloid orchids.       The vanilloid orchids include the commercially important genus  Vanilla as well as several presumably derived genera that have lost  photosynthetic capabilities and exist as mycotrophic parasites,  feeding on soil fungi on the roots of tropical forest trees.  This  combined morphological and molecular study will help improve our  understanding of the evolution of these novel plant adaptations.",
