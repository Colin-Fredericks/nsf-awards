 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452119  Cannon  Mississippi College is upgrading and expanding the program in biochemistry. This will include the  addition of an ACS chemistry major with a Biochemistry option. In order to accomplish this, a second  semester of biochemistry was added; molecular biology, medicinal chemistry or research will be available  as the advanced course. Biochemistry I Laboratory is being completely reorganized to include more  instrumentation and more modern techniques. The addition of a preparative ultracentrifuge and an  ultrasonic processor will make possible a variety of experiments to Biochemistry, Molecular Biology,  Microbiology, and Immunology laboratories. Experiments have been designed that involve both  differential and gradient centrifugation. Undergraduate research will be greatly enhanced due to the  availability of a wide range of projects made possible by this new facility. Such experience will lay a  better foundation for graduate school.",
