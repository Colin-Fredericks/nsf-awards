 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413057  Theoretical and computational research will be conducted on the  physics of fractional statistics.  The work builds on previous  research on anyon superconductivity and contributes to the physics  of the fractional quantum Hall effect.  Three specific projects are  proposed: (1) A quantum Monte Carlo study of the metal-insulator  transition for anyons; (2) The physics of a new quantum number  which is a measure of Hilbert space exclusion, that is, a  generalization of the Pauli Principle; (3) The application of a  dissipative mapping to the problem of stacking polytypes in metals  and insulators.  %%%  This theoretical research will focus on the study of particles with  fractional statistics, that is, particles unlike the common ones  found in the real world.  However, there is evidence that these  particles exist under special circumstances and may also underlay  other more common phenomena.  This research will study the  foundations of these particles and study a number of their possible  manifestations.  Additional effort will also be expended in  investigating various complex materials systems using a new  technique derived from nonlinear dynamics.",
