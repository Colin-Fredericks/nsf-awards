A percolation process  typically depends on one or more parameters.  There may be a  dramatic change in physical properties depending on whether a  parameter is above or below a critical value.  For example,   suppose we immerse a large porous solid in a bucket of water.  Clearly, how water penetrates the solid depends on the size of  the pores.  A simple mathematical model of such a process is   defined by considering the pores to be distributed in some  lattice, and to be open or closed with probabilities p or 1-p.  There is a critical threshold, p(c), for the probability at which  the behavior changes abruptly.  Below the threshold the water  penetration is only superficial and above it the penetration is  infinitely deep.  Of special interest is behavior near the  critical threshold.  One of the most challenging problems is to  show that the probability of infinite penetration behaves like a  power of |p-p(c)| if p is near p(c).  This research will focus on  mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the percolation  process.
