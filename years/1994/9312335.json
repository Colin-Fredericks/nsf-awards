Brandenberger of Brown University,  to collaborate in theoretical physics with Professor Christoph Schmid  and others of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and the  University of Zurich.  These research groups represent centers of  excellence that share an interest in understanding the physics of the  very early universe.  The participants bring complementary expertise in  particle physics, field theory, astrophysics, and cosmology to the  cooperative effort.  A collateral goal of the proposed project is to  enable the junior U.S. and Swiss participants to broaden their  intellectual horizons through international collaboration.  The joint  research will focus on three topics of mutual interest: 1) applications  of the theory of cosmological perturbations to gravitation and  cosmology; 2) application of entropy arguments to the theory of  cosmological phase transitions; and 3) construction of a nonsingular  universe.      This research addresses several intriguing questions about the physics  of the early universe.  The combinations of different backgrounds and  perspectives among the participants increases the potential contribution  of the research toward improved understanding of the formation of large  scale structures in the universe.  This area of cosmology is  particularly interesting now because of recent and planned satellite  observations that measure anisotropies in the cosmic microwave  background and the clusters, superclusters and the walls and voids of  galaxies.  These observations may provide means of evaluating and  refining the models and otherwise advancing the research of the U.S. and  Swiss collaborators.  ***",
