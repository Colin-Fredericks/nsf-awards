 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program, further develops the direct simulation Monte Carlo   method for the solution of the electronic Schroedinger equation.  The   goal is to compute definitive theoretical energy surfaces for various   molecular systems with two to six electrons including small Helium   clusters, Lithium hydride, and the proton transfer reaction between the   Helium atom and the Hydrogen molecule ion.  Approximate Monte Carlo   methods for larger systems will be developed based on cancellation of   Monte Carlo walkers with opposite signs.  The goal is to achieve   significant improvement in accuracy over that of fixed-node Monte Carlo   methods.  These methods will be applied to the water molecule and to some   small hydrocarbons.    Direct simulation Monte Carlo methods employ a rigorous mathematical   relationship between the solutions of certain differential equations and   the statistical average of a large sample of weighted random walks in   many-dimensional space.  The accuracy of the method applied to the   approximate solution of the electronic Schroedinger equation is limited   only by the size of the statistical sample.   Monte Carlo calculations   have yielded the most accurate quantum mechanical potential energy   surfaces for the hydrogen atom hydrogen molecule exchange reaction, and   for various other small molecular systems, and so provide reliable   standards against which to test all other computational methods in   molecular electronic structure theory.  The present research project is   of fundamental importance because it will provide additional benchmarks   needed to better establish the foundations of theoretical methods to be   applied to a wide range of chemical problems.  A second goal of this   research is the development of less precise but more efficient Monte   Carlo methods applicable to somewhat larger molecular systems.",
