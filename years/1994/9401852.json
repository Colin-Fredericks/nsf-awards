The  principal investigators propose (1) to begin its publication,  starting with the introductory sections giving an outline of the  series and laying the general group-theoretic and  K-group-theoretic foundations for the later parts; and at the  same time (2) to continue the writing of the later parts, for  which drafts of most chapters already exist.                  A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.   It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as physics and  chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are  finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of  the past decade is the classification of the finite simple  groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal  pages.  The research supported is a joint effort to produce a  self-contained, simplified and coherent treatment of this proof.",
