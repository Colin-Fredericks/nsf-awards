 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317503  Malamy  Conjugal transposons are genetic units that play an important role  in the dissemination of genetic information in bacteria.  They  combine the characteristics of transposons and conjugal elements in  a single unit.  Conjugal transposons have been extensively studied  in the Gram positive cocci: we have recently described Tn4399, a  conjugal mobilizing transposon from the important human pathogen,  the Gram negative anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis.  We are continuing  our studies to characterize the transposition and transfer  properties of Tn4399. We will concentrate on the proteins and sites  within Tn4399 that are required for its ability to transfer from B.  fragilis donor cells and to be mobilized by the IncP plasmids, RP4  and R751, in E. coli.  We have defined a 2.8 kb region of Tn4399,  that contains the \"mobilization cassette\" which is sufficient for  IncP plasmid mobilization.  We will determine if this unit can  promote plasmid transfer from B. fragilis donor cells, or if other  proteins must be supplied in trans.  We have identified two Tn4399  proteins, MocA and MocB, and an oriT4399 site that are required for  IncP plasmid mobilization in E. coli. We will determine if these  proteins, and site are required for Tn4399 promoted transfer in B.  fragilis.  To develop a genetic tool that can be used to map the B.  fragilis chromosome, we will engineer Tm4399 insertions into the B.  fragilis chromosome at known locations and determine if B. fragilis  chromosomal DNA can now be transferred to recipient cells.  To  study the transposition properties of Tn4399 we will attempt to  establish plasmid-to-plasmid, and chromosome-to plasmid  transposition systems.  It may be that Tn4399 is not fully  competent for transposition and may need proteins supplied in trans  from the chromosomal TET transfer element TUF present in the  original transposon donor cell.  We will test this hypothesis using  a new set of plasmids in B.fragilis cells containing TET element  TUF on the chromosom e.  If these experiments are successful, we  will begin to determine the role in transposition of the terminal  inverted repeats and the five extra basepairs at the right end of  the element, which are a unique feature of Tn4399.   The studies of  Tn4399 described above should provide important information on the  mechanisms of conjugal  DNA transfer from B. fragilis donor cells,  the mechanism of transposition of this novel elements, and help to  create a genetic system for the analysis of the chromosome of B.  fragilis.  %%%  Understanding the interaction of Tn4399 and the IncP broad host  range plasmids will provide insights into the dissemination of  genetic information to a wide variety of medically important  bacterial species.  ***",
