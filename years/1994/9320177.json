Specific items include a tool rack to allow automatic exchange of probes without recalibration, a rotary table to allow part repositioning under CIMS software control without recalibration, and the CIMS software upgrade needed to operate each of these.     The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:  Sensing strategies and tactics for the validation and reverse engineering of manufactured parts, emphasizing the detection and recognition of complex manufacturing features; automated feature-based inspection of manufacturing operations; and representations for tolerance specification which unify design, manufacturing, and measurement.     For each of these projects, experimentation requires the ability to acquire accurate three-dimensional data about real objects.  The requested equipment will allow the CMM currently installed in the laboratory to make measurements of objects with more complex shape than is currently possible and to do so in a more autonomous manner than it can now accomplish.  In addition, the rotary table will significantly enhance the utility of a 3-D range camera to position objects to increase the accuracy of range sensing and acquire multiple calibrated views of the same object from different viewpoints.  ***            TERMINALHLP           @ j       9320177  Thompson     This award provides funds to purchase Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) accessories whi ch will be dedicat    V   `                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       K   M           Q   V                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  $         $         $              G                                   V                         `         V          Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                      e   e                        6    Thompson/Utah    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
