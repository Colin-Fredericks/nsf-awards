 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314358  Snider       Capture of supercooled cloud droplets by snow crystals  (riming) and depostion growth (from the vapor are the mechanisms  which lead to ice crystal sizes sufficient for removal as  precipitation from mid-latitude tropospheric clouds.  During  ricing, cloud-droplet-dissolved pollutant gases are incorporated  into nascent precipitation particles.  The efficiency of gas  scavenging during this process has been studied in both laboratory  and field experiments.conducted in natural clouds at a remote  continental mountain-top site (Elk Mountain Observatory in  southeastern Wyoming) and involving hydrophilic chemical species  are proposed to provide specific information about the extent to  which trace gases are incorporated into ice crystals growing by  vapor deposition.       Our experimental strategy is to grow ice crystals attached to  a ventilated substrate in water-saturated air that is pre-  conditioned to remove supercooled cloud droplets and by addition of  known amounts of each study compound (either methanol, ethanol, or  normal butanol).  We intend to measur, as a function of  concentrations in the gas-phase, the amount of study compound  incorporated into the sampled ice crystal.  The resulting data set  will afford an examination of how both hydrophilic properties and  substituent chain length affect gas scavenging.  These studies will  be complimented by an examination of the extent to which ambient  amounts of these normal alcohols are retained in ice formed by  ricing.       The compounds selected for study are of interest because their  lifetimes with respect to reaction with wintertime concentrations  of hydroxyl radical are generally comparable to estimated lifetimes  corresponding to removal in precipitation.  Therefore, it is  important to characterize the efficiency of removal for alcohols,  as well as other hydrophilic compounds, by ice-phase hydrometeors.   In addition, the selected compounds that play important roles in  the atmosphere.       In addition  to these studies, we plan to conduct concurrent  gas-phase measurements of the xxx alcohols and the inorganic  species xxxxxxxxxx  Using the inorganic gases as tracers of air  contaminated by man-made pollution, the relative importance of  biogenic and anthropogenic source processes corresponding to the  low-molecular weight alcohols will be examined.",
