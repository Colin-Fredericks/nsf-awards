 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant development differs from animal development in a  variety of fundamental ways.  The flower of the cruciferous  plant Arabidopsis thaliana is being used as a model to  attempt to understand the basic molecular mechanisms that  control plant development.  In particular, the proposed  experiments focus on the specification of organ identity in  the flower.  Experiments performed in recent years in a  number of plant species, in particular in Arabidopsis and  snapdragon, have revealed that the genes that control the  specification of organ identity in the flower are highly  conserved in different plant species.  Thus, information  gathered about flower development in Arabidopsis is likely  to be applicable to other plant species.  The experiments  proposed here deal with the characterization of APETALA3  (AP3), a homeotic gene involved in specifying the  development of petals and stamens in the flower.  AP3 has  been cloned and its RNA and protein expression patterns  characterized.  The AP3 protein has a conserved 57 amino  acid domain called the MADS domain.  The MADS domain is  postulated to encode a DNA binding function, and there is  evidence that AP3 binds DNA.  Elucidation of the biological  function o the plant MADS domain proteins, however, has been  hindered by the lack of a biologically relevant target (DNA  binding) sequence.  The first set of proposed experiments is  aimed at defining the sequences in the AP3 promoter involved  in establishment, maintenance (autoregulation), and ovule-  specific expression of AP3.  The second set of proposed  experiments is designed to identify genes that interact,  regulate, or are regulated by AP3.  The genetic interactions  of the suppressor and enhancer mutations with both ap3 and  the other floral homeotic mutants will be characterized.",
