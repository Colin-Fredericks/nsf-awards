Materials are being developed for both teachers and  students.  The teacher supplement contains examples and  instructions on how and when to effectively use a graphing  calculator as an instructional tool.  Less emphasis is placed on  traditional lecture and more emphasis is placed on exploration and  group problem solving.  The material integrates practical  applications taken from astronomy and physics and other areas that  use mathematics.  Students generate real data through the use of a  Calculator Base Laboratory System (CBL).  The device enables the  collection of real time data for analysis with the graphing  calculator.  The collection and analysis of real data provides the  means to integrate practical laboratory experience into pre-  calculus and calculus.  The instructional materials include the use  of the CBL system.    The student supplement is designed with an emphasis on using  technology to explore mathematical concepts and write about the  findings.  Projects address four types of activities: (1) \"get  started\" activities to familiarize students with using the  calculators; (2) activities to help students understand concepts;  (3) projects to promote deeper understanding of concepts that may  be used as group projects or for advanced students; and, (4)  investigation projects for topics beyond what is discussed in  class.  This range of activities will benefit the slower student by  providing activities for understanding as well as the advanced  student by providing enrichment material.  The conceptual approach  combined with real applications, emphasis on understanding and  problem solving benefits all students.",
