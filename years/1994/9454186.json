A pilot group of 30 teachers receives training on the  basics of connectivity and accessing and sharing resources over  the Internet.  Through this pilot, the project team learns the  breadth and depth of training required, the type and extent of  ongoing technical supports needed, and the viability of using the  Presidential Awardees as experts for other educators who have  access to the Internet.    The training is held for one week in North Carolina and draws 30  teachers from the pool of 1994 Presidential Awardees in  mathematics and science, elementary and secondary.  In addition  to the formal workshop, support materials are developed and  tested to help teachers use SLIP accounts and networked services.   Ongoing support is provided by MCNC and by teachers who  participated in the earlier Global Schoolhouse project.  The  project may extend to supporting awardees who were not selected  for the formal training if feasible.    Cost sharing is not specified but the project does incude  contributions and expense sharing provided by the individual  participants and by company donations such as AT & T.  MCNC is  not responsible for any of these donations.  ***",
