The organism  of choice, the filamentous ascomycete Nectria haematococca,  is the most cytologically tractable fungus which is also  amenable to both conventional and molecular genetic  technologies.  It is the only organism in which both astral  pulling forces and spindle pushing forces have been  demonstrated to occur in vivo; both of these forces  contribute to chromosome separation during anaphase B.  Previous studies have also determined the time-course and  ultrastructural details of mitosis in N. haematococca.  The molecular targets of this investigation are kinesin-like  proteins (KLPs), which are candidates for generating pushing  force in the spindle, and dynein-like proteins (DLPs), which  are thought to produce pulling force in the aster.  KLPs are  known to be necessary for normal mitotic progression in  three other fungi (Saccharamyces cerevisiae,  Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Aspergillus nidulans), and a  DLP has recently been shown to be necessary for mitosis to  progress normally in S. cerevisiae.  The superior  cytological and optical properties of N. haematococca will  be used to observe the roles of these proteins in mitosis in  vivo.  The strategy is to clone genes from N. haematococca  encoding KLPs and DLPs, destroy the function of each cloned  gene by site-specific mutation in the genome, and observe by  video microscopy the cytological phenotype (if any) caused  by each mutation.  For each protein, the hypothesis that  elimination or overproduction will alter the rate of mitotic  movements will be tested.  Laser microbeam experiments will  then be used as a confirmation of the suspected roles of the  proteins in mitotic force generation.  Additionally, each  protein will be localized in the mitotic apparatus in situ  using immunofluorescence microscopy, and the polarity of  force produced by each protein will be determined using in  vitro motility  assays.  One KLP-encoding gene, Klp1, has  already been cloned, the genomic copy has been disrupted,  and the phenotypic effect of the loss of KLP1 has been shown  to be abnormal behavior of the mitotic spindle.  The role of  KLP1 in mitosis will be investigated, and the analysis will  be extended to additional KLPs and DLPs in the organism.  The proposed work represents a rare opportunity to correlate  specific motor proteins with in vivo demonstrated mitotic  forces of known polarity and location.  The strategy of  testing functional inferences by performing laser microbean  experiments on the mutants is entirely unique and, if  different motor proteins are involved in different aspects  of mitosis, the results may provide clear demonstrations as  to which motor protein is responsible for which mitotic  force.  This would contribute substantially to our  understanding of the mechanisms of mitosis, a process that  is fundamental to growth and development of all eukaryotes.  %%%  Mitosis, the process of cell division, is fundamental to all  eukaryotic life.  The process ensures that the genetic  material of the cell is equally distributed between the two  daughter cells, by carefully regulating the movement of  paired sister chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell prior  to physical division of the cell into two.  This is critical  to the viability of the daughter cells.  The process is  accomplished by a complex, highly regulated and predictable  series of microtubule-mediated movements of the chromosomes.  The biochemical mechanisms involved in these movements and  their regulation are not yet well understood, although there  is evidence that two kinds of microtubule-based motor  proteins (chemomechanical transducers), kinesin and dynein,  are involved.  With prior NSF support, this laboratory has  used state-of-the-art laser microscopic techniques to study  the forces exerted by the microtubular apparatus (known as  the \"spindle\") on the chromosomes during the various stages  of mitosis.  Th e laboratory is now planning to apply state-  of-the-art molecular genetic approaches to determine the  biochemical basis for each stage of the mitotic process.  The work has broad significance.  The better we understand  the process, the better we can manipulate it, either to  disrupt unwanted mitotic events (e.g., pest or weed control  in agriculture, novel treatments for cancer, etc.) or to  understand and perhaps intervene in unwanted, pathological  disruptions.  Also, since these processes take place on very  small size scales (microtubule diameters are in the  nanometer range), a better understanding of the mechanism  and regulation of these small but precise movements may  serve as useful paradigms, or even as novel materials, in  nanofabrication engineering.  ***",
