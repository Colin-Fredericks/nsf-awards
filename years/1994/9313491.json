 "awd_abstract_narration": "Noori    Higgins Laboratory, a multidisciplinary research facility, on the campus of Worcester  Polytechnic Institute (WPI), is home to the Department of Mechanical Engineering.   Constructed in 1941, the building has never been renovated or upgraded substantially. The  research activities presently conducted are in the areas of controls and vibrations, fluid  dynamics, biomechanics and biofluids, laser holography and metrology, and combustion.  Though organized around the traditional disciplines of mechanical engineering, the research  conducted addresses emerging area of Critical Technologies, such as Manufacturing,  Biomechanics and Thermal Science. Although WPI has an ongoing engineering effort,  critical infrastructural deficiencies exit which impinge on the research that is conducted in the  facility.    This award will provide funding for the renovation of research space for the lower level of  the Higgins Laboratory Building. Existing laboratories lack proper and adequate air quality  control, electrical power, accessibility, and waste management.  Space will be upgraded to  consolidate research activities that are currently scattered in small, outdated and  compartmentalized facilities. By organizing the available space to encourage exchange, the  improvements will facilitate interdisciplinary efforts between all groups.  The renovated  facility will provide ample space to meet the requirements of the growing numbers of  students in the Mechanical Engineering Program at WPI.  These trained students, a high  percentage of whom are U.S. citizens, will significantly contribute to the Nation's intellectual  capital in several Critical Technology areas.",
