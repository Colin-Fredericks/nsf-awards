 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451300  Slater  The proposed project addresses the use of electrohydraulic test  stands to educate undergraduate engineers in the area of controls,  instrumentation, and fluid power. The test stands will allow  students to quantitatively evaluate design changes relative to  system performance on a real-time basis. Total system response  including transient and steady state can be monitored and analyzed.    This integrated, interdisciplinary approach provides the student  with an exposure to computer-aided design/analysis methods for  real-time electrohydraulic control system design. In parallel,  software-based simulation methods will be used to develop models  which can be verified in the laboratory. Direct verification of  principles provides reinforcement and builds student confidence.  Structured methods of logical system design and diagnostic  identification provide students with valuable experience for use in  open-ended industrial design projects, which culminate the senior  year. This problem solving/project experience and computer  design/analysis skills are important capabilities required in  today's global economy. The proposed project is innovative in that  the use of electrohydraulic technology for undergraduate  instruction in controls requires an interdisciplinary approach  using fluid power, electronics and computers as opposed to teaching  control systems within a single discipline such as electrical,  pneumatic, mechanical, etc.    Dissemination of the results will be through seminars open to both  academia and industry. Past history has shown this to be an  effective method for dissemination and adoption of the methods  employed in undergraduate education and industrial instruction.",
