 "awd_abstract_narration": "A graduate program is proposed to develop expertise and research  skills in the discipline of Environmental Sensors and  instrumentation.  The program will combine the science and  engineering teaching and research resources of the Georgia  Institute of Technology and Clark Atlanta University in an  interdisciplinary program leading to a career in the burgeoning  field  of environmental measurement.  Students will select a  primary major area (e.g. Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Civil  Engineering, Chemistry, Environmental Engineering or Biology)  while pursuing a 24 credit-hour graduate certificate course.   This course will be structured around a 15 credit-hour core of  basic studies, with additional optional specialist topics.   Students will select their research projects from a wide range of  science and engineering disciplines, working with highly  qualified faculty members.  The program will heavily recruit  minorities and females, and their progress through the program  will be monitored for maximum retention and success.  Students  with appropriate interests will have the opportunity for  collaborative and international research programs with industrial  and Government sponsors, primarily Hewlett-Packard Analytical  Instruments Division, Electricite de France, and Savannah River  Site.  An additional four traineeships beyond the NSF commitment  will be co-sponsored by the participating universities.",
