Scheraga, Department of  Chemistry, Cornell University, to pursue with Professor Mu Shik Jhon,  Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (KAIST), and Dr. Kyoung Tai No, Department of Chemistry, Soong-Sil University,  Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on the development of  empirical potential functions for protein folding.  This theoretical research  is designed to elucidate the energies and mechanism of the folding of a  polypeptide chain into the native conformation of a protein.  While current  potential functions, developed by the collaborators, are sufficiently accurate  for several applications, the collaborators will develop new and better  potential functions which will have greater applicability.    This research is important for developing a better understanding of the  structure and properties of proteins.  The collaborators are highly respected  researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an international cooperative dimension  to the PI's research under NSF Grant No. DMB-9015815.  ***",
