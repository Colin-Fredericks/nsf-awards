The experiments will require people to make a dichotomous decision about a test item (a word or picture); the method will manipulate the amount of time the person is allowed before being required to make a response.  By varying that amount of time, it is possible to determine the earliest point in the retrieval episode at which an individual's decision accuracy rises above chance (the intercept).  Previous research has suggested that different kinds of information may be characterized by different intercepts, in the range of 300-550 ms.  These experiments will explore intercepts for a range of memory-based judgments, including judgments of generic information (knowledge acquired before the experiment began) and episodic information (acquired in the experimental context).  They will also examine effects on intercepts of such fundamental experimental variables as repetition, recency, and similarity.  The research will include the development of computer simulation models, as an aid in interpreting the results.  The findings will help shape theories of memory systems, memory representation, retrieval, and memory-based decision making, and thereby contribute more generally to our understanding of the role of memory in cognition.  The work should contribute in the long run to applications in such areas as education and training, brain damage and amnesia, and biases in human judgment and decision making.    ***",
