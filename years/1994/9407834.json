Although both red and blue light photoreceptors,  phytochrome and cryptochrome, have been implicated in light  signal perception, very little is known about the molecular  basis of the intracellular signal transduction pathways  mediating the light-inducible developmental processes marked  by chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic gene  activation.  We are interested in elucidating the molecular  mechanisms mediating light responses in leaf cells by  combining the genetic power with other biochemical, cellular  and molecular approaches offered by the maize experimental  system.  We will investigate systematically maize mutants  that are defective in light-inducible gene expression and  chloroplast biogenesis.  A versatile and powerful singlecell  transient expression system will be used to clone and  characterize regulatory genes controlling light-inducible  gene expression and chloroplast biogenesis which are cell  autonomous activities.  The studies will facilitate our  understanding of photosynthetic functions and signal  transduction in higher plants.  %%%  Light regulates many aspects of plant growth and development  among which the conversion of dark-grown etiolated leaves to  photosynthetic competent green leaves (greening) is most  essential to plant life and best documented in higher  plants.

We are interested in elucidating the molecular  mechanisms mediating light respo nses in leaf cells by  combining the genetic power with other biochemical, cellular  and molecular approaches offered by the maize experimental  system.  We are planning to analyze systematically the  existing maize photosynthetic mutants by RT-PCR and  protoplast transient expression assays.  We will make  expression cDNA library and conduct pilot experiments to  explore the possibility of complementing mutants using the  protoplast transient expression assay.  New cell surface  reporter genes and fluorescence activated protoplast sorting  techniques which offer the efficiency and high resolution  for expression cloning and mutant complementation will be  tested. It is likely that the system will serve as an  excellent tool to unravel unexpected new insights into the  molecular mechanisms of light signal transduction and gene  regulation in higher plants.  ***",
