A total of four companies are joining the Center  inconjunction with the University of California - Davis research  site.    The research projects to be funded at the Center's new research  site are \"Flow visualization of fluid/particulate mixtures in  tubes\" and \"Optimization of particulate texture in aseptically  processed products through determination of pectic activity, pectic  composition and mechanical properties.\"    The research are eminently qualified for this research.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Fred Heineken, Program  Director in the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental  Systems.    The Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories has  provided funding to augment the Centers ongoing research program  and to obtain a membership in the Center.    The Program manager recommends the University of California - Davis  be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing  award.  An additional $34,272 is recommended for one year with  funds provided by the Department of Energy's Sandia National  Laboratories.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division will  review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria  requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
