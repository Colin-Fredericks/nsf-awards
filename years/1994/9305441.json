 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305441  Seebaugh       Measurements of aerosol made from aircraft sampling platforms  are essential to study the ozone depletion and climatic effects of  airborne particles.  Current aircraft aerosol inlets fail to  achieve samples which are representative of the aerosol in the  ambient atmosphere.  The difficulty arises from the degree of  slowing required between the free air stream and the entrance to  the sampling device or instrument.  Done incorrectly, this slowing  can lead to significant inertial enrichment of the aerosol or to  significant losses due to turbulent deposition within the inlet.         During the initial portion of this project diffusers with  useful area ratios will be built and turbulence will be controlled  with boundary layer suction.  Aerosol deposition studies will be  done to demonstrate that the reduced turbulence in the inlet is  accompanied by increases in particle transmission through the  diffuser.  In the second year, an aerodynamic pumping system to  provide the needed suction will be designed.  The basis for this  design will involve either contouring the leading edge of the inlet  to provide insensitivity to angle of attack or adding a shroud  around the diffuser.  Wind tunnel experiments will be used to  verify that the internal and external flows behave as expected.   The product will be an inlet that is ready for testing on aircraft.  ***",
