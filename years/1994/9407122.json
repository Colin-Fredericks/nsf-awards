 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407122  Kohl  The oxidative limb of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the  cytoplasm of soybean nodules may be an important source of ribose-  5-phosphate, the starting point for the synthesis of ureades and  the form in which biologically fixed nitrogen is exported from the  nodule to the whole plant.  Results with soybean suggesting that  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in nodule extract is not in equilibrium  with the concentration of G6P in bulk medium, and that half of the  PPP activity precipitates at a relatively modest centrifugal force  (290,000 x g) have led to the proposition that the PPP functions as  a macromolecular complex (metabolon).  Within this metabolon, PPP  intermediates are channeled from one enzyme to the next.  Examples  of metabolic channeling in other systems has proved to be important  in conserving the limited solvent capacity of cell water,  protecting intermediates which are unstable if not enzyme bound,  and maintaining metabolite concentration gradients inside cells.   If our hypothesis is correct about PPP channeling, this example of  \"channeling\" would contribute not only to understanding about  nodule metabolism but also to understanding pentose phosphate  metabolism in other plant and animal cells.  Several approaches  will be used to investigate the idea of PPP channeling including  (i) determining which PPP intermediates are out of equilibrium with  their counterparts in the bulk medium, (ii) measuring  \"metabolon\"  size via its centrifugal and gel filtration behavior, and (iii)  comparing the kinetics of pathway function by metabolons vs.  \"collections\" of dissociated enzymes.  %%%  Metabolic pathways consist of a series of reactions, each catalyzed  by a specific enzyme.  The product of one reaction becomes the  substrate (food) of the next enzyme until a final product is  formed.  In some cases, the enzymes of a pathway are associated  with each other such that the product of one reaction does not  leave the site of \"formation.\"  In this way product(s) m ay be  \"channeled\" directly from one enzyme to another.  When this  happens, channeling can be important in improving metaboliic  efficiency by speeding up a series of reactions and protecting  certain unstable intermediates on the way to a final product.  Work  in this laboratory has led to the hypothesis that enzymes of the  pentose phosphate pathway, a key pathway in carbohydrate formation,  operates as a macromolecular complex to channel intermediates from  one enzyme to the next.  The present work will test this idea and  add to the body of evidence that similar enzyme arrangements occur  in the metabolic pathways of other cells as well.   ***",
