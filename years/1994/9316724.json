 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316724  Gilmore  The demonstration that DNA was the principle that transformed  Streptococcus pneumoniae from rough to smooth colony type is  broadly viewed as the event that launched the era of molecular  genetics, the cornerstone of modern biotechnology.  Streptococcal  genetics have continued to be at the forefront in developing  biotechnologies for application in manufacturing, such as dairy,  meat, and silage fermentation industries; the production of novel  streptokinases in the pharmaceutical industry; and for determining  the structure and function of numerous virulence factors in human  and veterinary disease.  Investigators from these diverse fields  who have made major contributions to the rich history of  streptococcal genetics, as well as young aspiring investigators  from across the globe will be brought together in Sante Fe, NM, for  the Fourth International ASM Symposium on Streptococcal Genetics.   Funds obtained from NSF will be used to support travel,  registration, and meeting expenses for students, post-doctoral  fellows, and speakers addressing central issues on the basic  genetics of streptococci, lactococci and enterococci.  ***",
