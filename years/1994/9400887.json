It is an experimental study of  the impact of task feedback on expectations for competence and  status.  It is well known that small task oriented groups tend to  stratify into consistent patterns of participation, task  activity, reward behavior and influence.  Recently, theorists  have begun to examine the conditions under which these  interaction hierarchies become legitimated or normative for the  members of the group.  This study seeks to test the argument,  developed from expectation states theory, that feedback on the  outcome of a task will have important consequences for the  likelihood of legitimation in subsequent tasks.  The likelihood  of legitimation based on initial status is experimentally crossed  with the presence or absence of positive external feedback which  increases the likelihood of such legitimation occurring.    %%%       This experiment tests an important extension of expectation  states theory, which has become highly influential in research on  group processes in both sociology and social psychology.  This  tradition has contributed in the past to administrative and  management science, and we would expect this study to do so as  well.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the  research, this award will materially assist a highly promising  student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus  it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation  and the thorough training of the next generation of social  scientists.    ***",
