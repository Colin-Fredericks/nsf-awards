Twenty-four students will be  accepted for the course, mostly graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers in visual neuroscience, computer  vision, and visual psychophysics.  The aim is to provide  intensive instruction in the application of computational  techniques to a variety of problems in visual science in  which these methods have proved fruitful for  interdisciplinary investigations.  The course is unique as  it brings together lecturers, graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers who share an interest in vision but  have diverse backgrounds including expertise in artificial  intelligence, psychophysics, computational neuroscience,  cognitive neuroscience, and retinal and visual system  neurophysiology.  This provides the participants with both  exposure to other perspectives and possibilities for  developing new collaborations.",
