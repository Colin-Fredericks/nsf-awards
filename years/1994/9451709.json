 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451709  Perone                               The Department of Chemistry is acquiring instrumentation to effect  transformation of the traditional sophomore quantitative analysis  into a course on modern analytical science. We are developing a  course where the basic underlying theme is exposure to concepts,  problems, issues, and procedures contained in a real, operating,  modem analytical laboratory. The key to achieving this is to  provide laboratory investigations which expose lower-division  students to the broad range of modern analytical technology. Among  the laboratory investigations  crucial to accomplishing this is the  commitment to addressing organic, biological, and environmental  studies, instead of the traditional emphasis on inorganic samples.  The types of investigations include: separations science;  multi-element and trace analysis; and combined physical & chemical  characterization. Because of its prominence in contemporary  analytical practice, separations science receives the highest  priority. We emphasize HPLC because it is most consistent with the  students' laboratory experience at this level and because of its  relevance to subsequent courses. For the multi-element and trace  analysis experience we have selected two approaches: analytical  voltammetry and atomic absorption. Analytical voltammetry is  selected because it is consistent with the students' experience  with solution chemistry; it provides an inexpensive introduction to  multi-element trace analysis, (stripping voltammetry); it can be  applied to both metallic and to organic/biochemical analytes; and  it establishes the technique as a detection approach for HPLC.  Atomic absorption is selected because it provides a more nearly  standard commercial laboratory technique for elemental analysis; it  exemplifies fundamental spectroscopy principles; and it provides  broader applicability to elemental analytes than voltammetry.  Superimposed on students' experience with modem technology will be  laboratory conduc t based on Federal Good Laboratory Practice  guidelines.",
