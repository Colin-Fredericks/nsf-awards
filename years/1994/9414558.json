 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414558  Casey  A major practical limitation to the application of high resolution  two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging is the size and flexibility of  the cable linking the transmitter/receive transducer element with  the powering and processing electronics.  The PI's have  successfully fabricated a prototype based on a combination of a  fiber optics and integrated optoelectronics, which would replace  the cumbersome coaxial cable currently used to excite the transmit  pulses for relatively small linear transducer arrays.  They propose  the use of the Electronics and Power Sources Directorate (EPSD)  facility for assistance in the design and fabrication of the  photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS) which is the critical  element of our approach.  Support of the proposed research would be  in direct support of advanced biomedical ultrasound techniques  already being partially supported by the National Science  Foundation as well as Army interests in the application of high  resolution ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) to materials  and structures of military significance.  ***",
