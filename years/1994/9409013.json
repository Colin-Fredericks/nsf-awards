It has been  recognized that exchange of research personnel is an  effective way to upgrade the level of the joint research  program.  Both sides agree that the exchange, which has been  postponed for some time, be initiated during 1994.    The proposed exchange shall include both the short-term  (less than half a year) and long-term (about one year)  visits by researchers to each side.  Each side shall plan to  send one to four researchers to the opposite side's  universities or other research institutions involved to take  part in the joint research work.    The National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research has  a wealth of  past experiences in areas of international  cooperation.  NCEER will provide assistance to the National  Science Foundation Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program to  organize and coordinate international researchers for the  purpose of international cooperation, knowledge transfer and  to coordinate the visits of US and PRC investigators.  The  Center's administrative operations would serve as an  efficient and convenient base of operations to undertake  such logistical planning.  ***   e hejjjjjjjjjjjjj",
