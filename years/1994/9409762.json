 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wave pipelining eliminates the intermediate register stages in a  pipelined system by using the internal capacitance of the  combinational logic for temporary storage.  to obtain a high  operating speed, equal path delays must be ensured between all the  input and the output nodes of a given functional block.  This  requires symmetric rise and fall times, and delay independence on  the input patterns for each component within the functional unit.   This project proposes a method that uses a modified complementary  Pass-transistor Logic (CPL) circuits as the basic cells to  implement a high performance CMOS wave-pipelined system.   Preliminary research and design results show that the family of  basic cells, called Wave-pipelined Transmission-Gate Logic (WTGI),  using standard CMOS technology, can be designed to have equal  rise/fall times and reduced gate delay variations as compared to  other approaches.  The project addresses the design of a WTGL cell  library for computational and signal processing applications.   Further, logic synthesis and the delay tuning algorithms will be  developed with an emphasis towards an application i signal  processing.  CAD tools that can effectively use the WRGL technique  will be developed.",
