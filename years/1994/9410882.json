 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410882  Simpson       Graduate student Karen Clary, under the supervision of faculty  adviser Beryl Simpson at the University of Texas, is studying the  taxonomy and phylogeny of the desert genus Yucca, estimated to  encompass ca. 35 species in Mexico and the U.S.  Morphological,  anatomical, and molecular (DNA) analyses are being conducted to  provide comparative data for assessing genealogical affinities.   The internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA  repeat will be sequenced to determine mutational differences in  nucleotide composition among species.  Results from nuclear DNA  analyses will be compared to those based upon chloroplast DNA  studies for the same species.  Molecular and morphological  characters will be combined to achieve a reliable classification of  the plants.       An understanding of patterns of diversity in molecular and  morphological features in Yucca will provide answers about the  origin of the genus and its evolution in relation to desert  conditions, in general, and in particular should prove interesting  when compared with phylogenetic data on yucca moths, the chief  pollinators of these plants.",
