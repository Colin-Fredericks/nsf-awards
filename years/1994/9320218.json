 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320218  Evert  The proposed research involves studies on the development and  structure of the leaves of maize and barley, utilizing bright-  field, transmission electron, epifluorescence, and confocal laser  scanning microscopy.  The developmental and structural studies will  be complemented by experimental studies aimed at determining: 1)  the pathways followed by photoassimilates in source and sink  leaves; 2) the sites and mechanisms of phloem loading and unloading  in source and sink leaves, respectively; 3) the structural  modifications associated with the sink-to-source conversion; and 4)  the pathways followed by water, which enters the leaf in the  transpiration stream, to intermediate, small, and transverse veins  at various levels of leaves undergoing sink-to-source conversion.    Maize and barley, as other grass leaves, provide an excellent  system for following a sequence of cellular and subcellular events  precisely because polarized cell division at the base of the leaf  results in an unmixed gradient of cell development.  This same  system should be ideal for determining the underlying mechanisms of  the sink-to-source transition.  The leaves of maize and barley  differ in many details both structurally and developmentally.   Parallel studies on the leaves of both of these economically  important grasses will provide a more balanced picture of  structure-function relations in grass leaves than would an  investigation of only one of them.  The results of these studies  will have long-term practical importance in relation to crop  productivity and will be of value to investigators interested in  relations of viruses, insects, mycoplasmas, and other parasites to  their hosts and in the movement of insecticides and growth  regulating substances in cultivated plants.  ***",
