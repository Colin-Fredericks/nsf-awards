 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard Reiss is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry program to continue his theoretical research in   the area of vapor-phase nucleation.  He will extend and improve his   \"modified liquid drop model\" for nucleation in several ways in an attempt   to develop a fully molecular rate theory for this important process.     Although the theory has provided excellent agreement with experimental   data on nucleation of Argon, it needs to be extended to more complex   systems for further verification.   Reiss will develop a suitable   intermolecular potential for treating carbon tetrachloride which will   provide a more challenging test of the theory.  Computer simulations   using Monte Carlo methods will accompany the theoretical developments,   and attempts will be made to improve existing density functional theories   for nucleation which have been developed by others.    Nucleation is an extremely important physical process which has   implications in the area of weather modification and environmental   remediation.  At the current time there is no fully molecular \"first   principles\" theory for predicting the rate of such processes.  The   research being performed by Reiss is a first and significant step in the   direction of such a theoretical development.",
