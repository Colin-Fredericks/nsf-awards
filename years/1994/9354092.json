ASTC'S intention is to organize a network a  \"learning communities\" in five prominent interest areas, identified  by the field, to help science museums focus more effectively on  school science education, and develop close collaboration with  schools to influence systemic change.    During the planning phase, ASTC will:       Organize and convene a national advisory committee       Develop a position paper to inform and engage the field for         school/science center collaboration.       Identify leadership institutions and their partners among school      systems, and form a core group of facilities and personnel for      the leaning communities.       Investigate needs in existing practices and develop an              appropriate range of resources, services, and activities.       Determine priorities for phased implementation of learning          communities and related program activities.       Conduct research to identify useful techniques and approaches       for program documentation, research, and evaluation.",
