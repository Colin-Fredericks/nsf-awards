This project will collect documentary recordings of  as many northern Brazilian Cariban languages as possible and  begin the process of transcribing word lists and grammatical  information from these recordings.  The project will also provide  support for the Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do  intensive field work in three different northern Brazilian  Cariban language communities.  The linguists will use traditional  field techniques, including recording, transcribing, and  translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be via  elicitation and analysis of transcribed texts.  For these three  languages, the project will produce analyses of phonology,  morphology, basic syntax, and papers on theoretically or  typologically relevant issues.  With these new data, the principal investigator will work towards a more reliable classification of the Cariban family and reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and  morphosyntax.    This project is a collaborative effort, designed to help train  new Brazilian linguists in basic linguistic description and  historical/typological/functional approaches to linguistics.  It  will also be responsive to the needs of Cariban language  communities, offering help in preserving their unique languages  and cultures.",
