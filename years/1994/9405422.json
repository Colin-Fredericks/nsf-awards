 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a remarkably conserved  mechanism which is implicated in the control of cell growth,  differentiation and cell survival in organisms as distantly  related as yeast and humans.  Although many tyrosine kinases  have been described, only recently have protein tyrosine  phosphatases (PTPases) been implicated in receptor tyrosine  kinase (RTK) mediated signal transduction pathways.  The  goal of this proposal is to analyze the PTPase, encoded by  the Drosophila gene 'corkscrew' (csw), and its role in  signal transduction. In addition to csw's putative catalytic  activity, it also encodes two SH2 domains, and an SH3  binding concensus sequence, suggesting that 'csw' can  mediate heteomeric protein interactions.  'csw' is among the  first PTPases whose gene mutations are facilitating a  genetic analysis of function in vivo.  The structure and  function of the 'csw' protein will be investigated.  The  expression and activity of the 'csw' protein will be  analyzed in normal and mutant development.  Biochemical and  genetic screens will be conducted to identify proteins that  interact with 'csw'.  These studies will collectively  further our understanding of the role of a PTPase,  covalently linked to two SH2 domains, in a signal  transduction pathway initiated at the membrane by a RTK.",
