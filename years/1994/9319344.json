 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319344  Rollag    Exposure of cultured Xenopus tailfin melanophores to light causes  intracellular pigment granules to migrate from a homogeneous  cytoplasmic distribution to a perinuclear aggregate.  This direct  photic response, which is independent of the visual system,  provides a convenient model system for study of the mechanisms by  which light directly modifies cellular function.  The proposed  research will identify molecular components of the  phototransduction pathway in cultured melanophores, compare the  molecular cascades elicited by light and melatonin (a hormone which  causes similar morphological changes), and define experimental  paradigms that induce the photosensitive phenotype.   Immunocytochemical, molecular biological, radioimmunochemical, and  videomicroscopic techniques will be employed.  It is expected that  this research will 1) provide an important precedent for  understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying extra-retinal  photoreception in vertebrate cells (a biological response that is  not only used during camouflage, but also for regulation of  seasonal reproductive phenomena in a variety of vertebrate  species), 2) expand upon the use of the amphibian melanophore as a  model system for study of the molecular mechanism of both melatonin  and light signal transduction, and 3) provide a method for reliably  inducing the photosensitive phenotype in nonphotosensitive  melanophores (a necessary preliminary to studies that seek to  determine the chemical identity of photosensitizing inductive  factors and their mechanisms of action).  ***",
