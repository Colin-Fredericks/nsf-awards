 "awd_abstract_narration": "19405737  Hay    It has been common practice to run an atmospheric (AGCM) or oceanic  (OGCM) general circulation model and search for results that might  be confirmed or rejected by geologic data.  AGCM output describes  average conditions over large areas, but the non-marine geologic  deposits providing the best record of climate were rarely laid down  under average conditions.  This mismatch between the model results  and the geologic data that might be used for their validation has  been a major problem in paleoclimate studies.  A new AGCM, GENESIS,  designed specifically for paleoclimate research, and a new method  for validating the results of a paleoclimate model, the Proxy  Formation Model (PFM), can be used together to make more realistic  simulations that can be validated by comparison with real data.  A  validated AGCM can then be used to drive  an OGCM to investigate  circulation of the ocean.    GENESIS began as a heavily modified version of CCM1 and differs  from it in treatment of water vapor transport, atmospheric  convection from the earth's surface, solar radiation related to  aerosols, cloud parameterization, vegetation, soil, snow and sea  ice.  Its ocean  is a slab, with heat capacity and ocean heat  transport included.  GENESIS has independent AGCM and surface  grids, allowing for much better representation of surface  paleogeographic, vegetation, and soil conditions.    The PFM is a quantitative link between climate model data and  geologic observations.  PFM's are being developed for sedimentary  deposits that form under known climatic conditions.  1) evaporites;  2) bauxites and laterites; 3) coal (peat).  The PFM prescribes  boundary conditions that must have existed at the location where  the deposits occur.  This additional \"grid point\" is inserted into  the climate model, and the calculated environmental parameters  (temperature, humidity, etc.) are compared with conditions required  for formation of the deposit.  Under  this proposal, we will  develop 4 additional    PFM's : 1) sand deserts; 2) coastal sea ice;  3) mountain glaciers; 4) ice sheets.    The climates of the Early and Late Cretaceous were different from  each other and both were different from Late Cenozoic climates.  In  the Early Cretaceous there was high-latitude sea ice, strong mid-  latitude  seasonality, and a tendency for the \"Atlantic\" to become  anoxic.  In the Late Cretaceous there was no high-latitude ice,  less seasonality, and a more oxic ocean (with two brief notable  exceptions).  The differences were a response to changing boundary  conditions: 1) from isolation of the western Tethys-Atlantic-Indian  seaway from the eastern Tethys-Panthalassic Ocean during the Early  Cretaceous to more open connections in the Late Cretaceous: 2) rise  in the atmospheric content of CO2 from a lower level in the Early  Cretaceous to a high level in the Late Cretaceous: 3) increase in  poleward ocean heat transport form a low level  during the Early  Cretaceous to a high level in the Late Cretaceous: and 4) rise of  sea level to a mximum in the Late Cretaceous.     The paleogeography, paleoclimatology energy balance of the Earth in  the Cretaceous are well enough known to run AGCM's and subsequently  OGCM's that can be rigorously validated using PFM's based on  geologic data.",
