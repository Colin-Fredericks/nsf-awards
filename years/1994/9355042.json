 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has been developed in order to define and plan a  training program in a fundamental area of Plant Biology,  regulation of plant growth and development.  Recent evidence that  signaling mechanisms in plants are controlled by the established  plant hormones as well as other types of signaling molecules has  led us to increase our research efforts on regulatory events that  occur during plant development.  The education of each trainee  will include research and instruction in lecture and discussion  course.  The trainees research will be supervised by a faculty  collaborator in the Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) Program  of the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at the University  of California at Riverside (UCR).  An equally important goal of  this NSF-GRT Program is to promote student diversity in Plant  Biology, leading to an increased number of Ph.D. scientists from  currently underrepresented ethnic groups.  Innovative Inter-  Institutional Arrangements have been made with Tuskegee  University and the University of Puerto Rico an Rio Piedras for  the purpose of recruitment of underrepresented minorities to  graduate studies in Plant Biology.  Faculty collaborators in the  NSF-GRT will visit the two campuses to present a seminar and talk  to students that are interested in Plant Biology.  Qualified  students from these institutions will visit UCR, and will be  given priority during the selection of NSF-GRT recipients.",
