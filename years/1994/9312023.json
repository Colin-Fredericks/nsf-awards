The purpose of  the study is to investigate the properties of giant post-flare  arches which represent an important coronal phase of the most  eruptive flares on the sun.  The Yohkoh soft X-ray whole-Sun and  large field-of-view images, with excellent angular resolution offer  a real breakthrough in the information about these structures which  have energy comparable to those in coronal mass ejections.  The  study will address several problems related to these giant arches:  their internal structure, their magnetic fields, the location of  the footpoints of giant arches in the underlying magnetic field,  the time of onset of a coronal arch and its mode of formation, the  vertical and lateral time dependence of the process, the physical  conditions in the elementary components of the arch, the  association between giant arches and eruptive flares, the  difference between stationary and growing arches, and the  conditions for coexistence of quasi-stationary giant arches with  eruptive coronal mass ejections in the same active region.  The  theoretical investigations will be conducted in collaboration with  Japanese scientists.  ***",
