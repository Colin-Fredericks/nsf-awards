 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452167  Wolf  An instrumented laboratory is being developed for teaching  geophysical field methodologies that are used in environmental  investigations to undergraduate students.  The students benefitting  the most are those with majors in geology, geological engineering,  earth sciences, and environmental sciences who are enrolled in the  Auburn University Department of Geology's classes in applied  geophysics and field methods, the Department of Civil Engineering's  classes in subsurface hydrology and measurements, and laboratories  associated with these and other classes within Geology and  Engineering.  The equipment is being used in a variety of local  settings to demonstrate techniques of data acquisition and  experiment design that are useful in environmental assessments.   Four pieces of geophysical equipment, all used in environmental  analyses, are being integrated into the curriculum:  1) a  24-channel Digital Instantaneous Floating Point (DIFP) Signal  Stacking Seismograph; 2) a DC Resistivity unit; 3) a Proton  Magnetometer, and 4) an Electromagnetic Ground Conductivity Meter  (EM-3 1).  The equipment directly enriches the undergraduate  applied geophysics class and, at the same time, contributes to  three interdisciplinary undergraduate programs by giving students  in these majors first-hand experience in characterizing  environmental conditions with geophysical tools.  A review of  current institutional programs shows a lack, nationally, of  educational laboratory experiences in geophysics as applied to  environmental investigations, despite changes in career  opportunities for graduates of earth science programs. Auburn is  addressing this deficiency by training students for environmental  careers and preparing them to lead research in new approaches for  the future.",
