 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450588  Mappen    The Douglass Science Institute (DSI) Program Series provides in-depth \"hands-on\" mathematics  and science experiences in a single-sex environment for high school women to encourage their  persistence in mathematics and science studies.  It is planned as a multi-year intervention effort.   Research and general literature on the underrepresentation of women in the mathematics,  science, and engineering pipeline, as well as on the education of girls, provide evidence that  intervention programs during the high school years are essential to reverse the attrition of girls  from mathematics and science studies.  Differential treatment, lack of encouragement, and of  knowledge about career options in mathematics and science, lead to negative attitudes towards  these disciplines, limited participation in curricular and extracurricular mathematics and science  activities, and lower achievement rates.    The Series is offered by the Douglass Project for Rutgers Women in Math, Science, and  Engineering, and is held at Douglass College, the women's undergraduate unit of Rutgers, The  State University of New Jersey.  The Program Series is a student-centered model that provides  a continuum of \"hands-on\" involvement in mathematics, science, and engineering, as well as  motivational activities, for high school women over a four-year period.  Students begin the  program during the summer preceeding the ninth grade, and will be able to continue with it over  the following three summers.  The program for ninth graders is the initial phase of the series.   Students who complete the ninth grade program are encouraged to apply for programs which will  take placed during the summers preceding their tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade years.  The  Series incorporates many of the characteristics which have been found to be integral components  of \"exemplary\" intervention programs, including \"hand-on\" instruction and cooperative group  work, a multi-year, residential experience on a college campus, rol e models, and activities for  parents.  Funding from NSF will be used for evaluation and modification of the 10th grade  program (to be offered for the first time in 1994), and for development of the first year of the  11th grade program (1995).  The segment for Ninth Grade Women is funded primarily by the  AT&T Foundation.  (Other supporters of the Program Series include the Merck Institute for  Science Education, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical  Research Institute, and the Schering-Plough Foundation.)   The Series can serve as model for  others in efforts to increase the numbers of young women in the mathematics, science, and  engineering.  ***",
