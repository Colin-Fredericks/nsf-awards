 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work investigates a broad spectrum of problems dealing with  logic in computer science that span finite model theory,  database theory,  complexity theory, and optimization theory.  The question of whether or not  certain important algorithmic  problems are expressible in various logical query  languages,  such as Datalog and extensions of Datalog with negation, are  examined. Further, the relationship between first-  order logic, fixpoint logic,  and polynomial-time  computability on arbitrary classes of finite structures  are explored.  In the area of logical definability and  asymptotic  probabilities, 0-1 laws are investigated for certain powerful extensions of  fixpoint logic and an attempt is made to find necessary and   sufficient conditions for the  existence of 0-1 laws under variable   probability measures.  In a different line of investigation,   the descriptive  complexity of optimization problems  continues to be developed.  An attempt is made   to determine if there is  an effective syntax for   the approximable NP optimization  problems and to seek  structural explanations for the diverse  behavior of polynomial-time  optimization problems with respect to parallel approximation.",
