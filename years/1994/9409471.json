 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409471  Cheng  The objectives of this project are to improve existing hydrodynamic transport models, to develop efficient approaches to nonequilibrium/hot-electron energy/momentum distribution functions in single-and multi-valley bandstructures, to study the fundamental transport phenomena and limitations of device operation at small scales, to explore new device structures, and to improve device performance.  The approach is based on the concept of a \"hydro-kinetic\" distribution which is interpolated between the Boltzmann (kinetic) transport equation and hydro-dynamic equations.  The developed models can properly account for effects, which have never been successfully included in modeling high-speed semiconductor devices.  In addition, the efficient hydro-kinetic approach is useful of analysis of FET gate current, electron injection between heterojunctions, and device reliability, associated with hot-electron phenomena.  Success of this proposed project will result in a new understanding of these effects and will bring in new concepts and structures to improve device performance and reliability.  ***",
