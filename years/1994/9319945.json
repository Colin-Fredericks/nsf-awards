 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates a technique which allows  computer  programs to be constructed which are more easily and efficiently  tested and which can be incorporated into a design methodology  for producing  efficiently testable and fault tolerant software  systems.  The  technique is to modify a primary  applications program so that, with essentially  negligible  overhead, the primary program not only produces its required  output  but also generates additional data, referred to as a  ``certification trail.'' The  certification trail allows the  correctness of the primary program's output to  be completely and  efficiently certified by means of a second, simpler and more  efficiently executed program, referred to as a ``certifier'' which  uses the  certification trail to also produce the output so that a  subsequent comparison  operation can take place.  The relative  simplicity of the certifier has  significant advantages beyond  that of speed of execution.  For example, the  certifier program  can be formally verified for correctness in cases where doing  so  for the primary program is much more complicated --- perhaps  prohibitively  so.  In general, this project develops a formal,  theoritical framework for the  certification trail technique, as well as for  building upon proof-of-concept performance experimentation by means of  implementing the  technique and generating performance data for primary programs  implementing a variety of well-known algorithms.",
