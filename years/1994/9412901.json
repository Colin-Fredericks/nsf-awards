 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412901  MARK       The January 1994 earthquake in Los Angeles destroyed parts  of four major freeways. This event presents a unique opportunity  to explore the impacts of such disruptions on both motorists who  used those freeways and on neighborhoods that receive the  displaced motorists. Due to modified commuting patterns, members  of different ethnic and socioeconomic groups are necessarily  interacting in ways that they did not interact before. White  middle and upper income commuters are now travelling surface  streets in predominantly lower income and ethnically African  American and Hispanic neighborhoods. Preliminary evidence  suggests that significant interactions between commuters and  residents of these neighborhoods are occurring and that these  interactions are changing in intensity over time, suggesting that  contact is stimulating improved relations bewteen these groups.  This study will be based on three forms of data collection.  Commuters will be identified via license plate numbers and sent a  sequence of mailed questionnaires. Neighborhood residents and  businesses will be interviewed in person. Finally, systemmatic  observations of the interactions along major arterials will be  undertaken in order to identify the nature of those interactions  and to corroborate information collected by interviews and  surveys.       Documenting the nature of changes in attitudes and behaviors  between these different social groups will have broad  implications for understanding basic attitudes and attitude  changes brought about by new levels of interaction in a racially  and economically polarized, and geographically segregated, urban  society. The research will further provide insight into the  impact of disasters on travel behavior of residents which should  prove useful in planning for such events. As a doctoral  dissertation research award, this project will also provide  support to enable a promising student to establish a stong  independent research career.  ***",
