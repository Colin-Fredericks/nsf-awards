 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406595  JAROSZ       Determination of the total costs of agricultural production  traditionally has been difficult because considerable labor  contributed by women working on farms has not been compensated or  has been reimbursed at very low wages.  As women have increased  their participation in non-farm labor markets and as agricultural  industries have changed in recent decades, the role of women in  farm production has been transformed, but little scholarly  attention has been given to the form and implications of those  changes.  This doctoral dissertation research project will  investigate changes in the agricultural work of women in the  fresh apple industries of Washington state.  Apple production and  processing has become more labor intensive and more capital  intensive over the last half century.  Special attention in this  project will be given to identifying differences in the responses  of women in different ethnic groups, socioeconomic classes, and  age cohorts to changes in the industry.  These differences will  be identified through analyses of census data and a mail survey  of women working in north central Washington.  More detailed  information will be obtained through intensive interviews and  focus-group discussions of both Chicana and Anglo working women.  In order to ascertain whether preliminary conclusions are valid,  project findings will be discussed at community-based workshops.       This project will provide new insights into the impacts of  technological and organizational change on workers employed by  agricultural businesses.  This case study of female workers in  the Washington apple industry will employ a complementary set of  research methods to contribute new empirical knowledge about  social change, with special emphases placed on the roles of  gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class.  As a doctoral  dissertation research improvement award, this award also will  provide support to enable a promising student to establish a  strong independent research ca reer.",
