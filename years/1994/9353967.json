 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353967  Wilkinson  Borough of Manhattan Community College has been a leader of the  Calculus reform movement. Their present precalculus, calculus  and differential equations curriculum emphasizes students  working in groups and using computer graphers and computer  algebra systems to create written honors projects and animated  mathematical movies. It adapts the model developed by Uri  Treisman at Berkeley to a large urban non-residential college,  and moves beyond the Treisman model in its strong emphasis in  technology and alternative assessment models.   This project  builds on their previous calculus curriculum projects.  They  are offering two regional summer faculty workshops for each of  two summers. One workshop is for faculty inexperienced in  technology and focuses on the preparation of collaborative  computer portfolios in precalculus and calculus. The second  workshop for faculty more experienced in technology and is  emphasizing the use of new computer technology (e.g., Macromind  Director) that animates graphs, and allows students to create  mathematics movies in precalculus, calculus, and differential  equations.  ***",
