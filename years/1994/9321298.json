The focus is the  case of environmental research on global warming.  Unlike the  active involvement of voluntary organizations in policy making for  biomedical research, voluntary organizations in the environmental  arena have concentrated on regulatory rather than research policy.   The goal of the dissertation is to help to answer the questions of  whether and to what extent, and why this is so.   Currently, elite  and technical groups dominate in many science policy arenas.   Voluntary organizations that specialize in particular substantive  areas can play an important role in these arenas, by organizing  expertise and performing a boundary-spanning, translator role  between the broader public concerns and the concerns of the  scientific and technical communities.  While the role of voluntary  organizations in regulatory policy has been studied, their role in  longer-term goal-setting has not.  This study can therefore extend  our understanding of the role of voluntary organizations and  provide a step towards increasing democratic participation in  setting science agendas.  After he completes a review of archival  and other documents, the award allows the student to conduct  approximately 100 interviews with representatives from government  agencies, environmental organizations, and other groups that have  been involved in setting environmental research agendas.  The final  product of this research is a doctoral dissertation, associated  articles and presentations, and an executive summary for  interviewees and others from nonprofit voluntary organizations who  request it.  ***",
