 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320831  Shiller  The purpose of this project is to provide better measures of  major economic risk factors (components of economic or wealth  fluctuations that affect many people) to facilitate the creation  of new insurance and hedging markets for these risks.   The  biggest economic risks today are not represented in any liquid  financial markets.  There are no market for claims on national  incomes or an any other large income aggregates.  There is no  large liquid market for real estate.  An important reason why  there are not liquid markets for such risks is that there are no  agreed-upon objective measures of the shocks that represent such  risks.  This research will focus on developing indices of incomes  or rents or prices of claims on them that are specifically  designed to be the basis of cash settlement of innovative risk-  management contracts, such as futures contracts.  In addition,  data will be collected and assembled on the behavioral  foundations of speculative market behavior: including continuing  time-series data collection on expectations and theories among  U.S. and Japanese stock market participants.  ***",
