At the center of the course  is the interplay between mathematics and computer science and its  effect on computational mathematics. A computer algebra system is  used interactively for all teaching and learning activities in the  classroom and the laboratory. This helps students to integrate  ideas, concepts, and applications from both fields in a natural and  transparent way. The teaching model of the course is based on  interactive learning materials, locating the laboratory wherever a  student and a computer running the software interact, and on the  extensive use of electronic communication between students and  faculty, distributing the laboratory through access to the  Internet.  The course content is designed for the junior/senior  level of the mathematics and computer science curricula, and it  builds on topics and concepts in the sophomore level core of both  fields. The course fits into a curriculum on mathematics,  computational mathematics and computer science with minor changes  in emphasis only. The course is particularly well suited for  academic institutions where mathematics and computer science are  programs in a single department.  The materials for the course,  including a teacher's manual and a collection of student projects,  are being printed and electronic form.",
