Most modeling studies of the climate system tend  to focus on a particular range of time and space scales; however,  many of the interdisciplinary climate questions that need to be  addressed require an understanding of the mechanisms of climate  change on a wider range of time and space scales than would  normally be addressed in one study.  In this research program the  plan is to use a coupled energy balance climate-thermodynamic sea  ice-continental ice sheet model to identify the important  mechanisms of climate change on a wide range of time scales in  order to gain a better understanding of how these mechanisms affect  the climate system.         The particular questions that will be addressed include:    1) What is the impact of increased greenhouse gases on the  cryosphere and hydrologic cycle, of the Earth-atmosphere system,  especially with respect to the initiation of ice sheet growth, and  what are the mechanisms that produce those changes, for the present  and projected increases in greenhouse gases, and for the variations  in greenhouse gases on ice age time scales as observed in the  geologic record?  In particular the PI will address the question of  how the cryosphere, both sea ice and continental ice, responds to  the changes in radiative forcing and its impact on the hydrologic  cycle; and in turn how the resulting changes in the cryosphere  affect the climate.  2) How do Milankovitch solar radiation variations affect the  hydrologic cycle, and the cryosphere to produce initial ice sheet  growth and the large scale glacial/interglacial cycles as observed  in the geological record.  The PI will specifically examine the  role of the hydrologic cycle in producing glacial/interglacial  cycles and use this information to gain a better understanding of   the role of spatial and temporal variations in the seasonal cycle  of solar radiation on producing climate change on all time scales.  3) What is the impact of particulates in and on snow and ice on the  global climate system, and how important is the mechanism of  inclusion or deposition of the particulates in affecting the  climate system?         The use of the coupled energy balance climate-thermodynamic  sea ice-ice sheet model to address these questions is particularly  attractive because of its relative simplicity, while retaining many  of the large components of the climate system.  This type of model  allows a detailed analysis of the response of the climate system to  various perturbations, that will include following the effect from  initial perturbation, through all of the included feedback  processes, to the final climatic effect.  Understanding the  processes of climate change in this type of detail permits the  application of what we learn in one set of experiments to questions  of climate change that occur on other time scales, extending our  understanding of the climate system and how it changes.  ***",
