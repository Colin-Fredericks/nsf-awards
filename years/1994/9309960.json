This research addresses the task of finding the optimal control  policy for complex, nonlinear, and uncertain systems, given a set  of control objectives. The majority of effort so far in intelligent  control systems has been focused on implementation or function  approximation for complex, nonlinear, and uncertain systems.  It is  assumed a priori that the given training information best satisfies  the control objectives without a direct attempt to find the optimal  system control policy with respect to the control objectives.   Conventional optimal control methods are either limited to systems  that are amenable to mathematical analysis or else involve enormous  amounts of computation in the form of dynamic programming.  Intelligent control approaches that address the task of determining  the optimal control policy use the same basic strategy as dynamic  programming, only in less structured form.  This includes Back-  propagation Through Time (BTT) methods and systems that employ  reinforcement learning or adaptive critics.  This research project  uses a computationally efficient means of dynamic programming based  on a cell state space approach that makes it possible to do  multiple iterations of the algorithm in realistic time scales.   These methods will be applied to the six-degree-of-freedom flight  control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles under development at  Florida Atlantic University. One application of these AUVs is a  joint effort between the University of South Florida's Marine  Science Department and FAU to perform a set of long range  oceanographic surveys in the Gulf of Mexico to determine bottom  composition and water quality. Because underwater vehicles can move  freely in three dimensions in relatively uncluttered environments,  the immediate potential for valuable contributions by autonomous  robotic systems may be even greater in the ocean than on land.",
