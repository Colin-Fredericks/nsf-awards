 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412078  Reich  The information content of DNA is expanded in almost all organisms by  methylation of adenine (N6) or cytosine (C5 and N4). DNA methylation is  involved in the control of tissue specific and developmentally  regulated gene expression; the protection of host (bacterial) DNA  against endonuclease cleavage; DNA repair; aging; and genetic  imprinting. The study of two bacterial DNA methyltransferases is  proposed: EcoRI N6 adenine methyltransferase, which methylates the  second adenine in GAATTC, and BamHI N4 cytosine methyltransferase,  which methylates the first cytosine in GGATCC. The ready availability  of the genes and large quantities of homogeneous protein provides the  basis for the structure-function analyses to be performed. The general  goal is to understand the molecular details of sequence-specific DNA  methylation sufficiently to design novel biocatalysts, enzyme \"mimics\",  and/or modify the sequence-specificity of the target enzyme.  Two specific aims are detailed. The first is to identify structural  features of the EcoRI methyltransferase or its substrate, and to a  lesser extent the BamHI methyltransferase, that are essential for  catalysis. The second aim is to determine the three-dimensional  structure of the EcoRI or BamHI methyltransferase and their  corresponding protein-cofactor as well as protein DNA-cofactor  complexes using X-ray crystallographic analyses of the wild type  proteins as well as point and deletion mutants. This structural  information will aid our understanding of past structure-function  studies with the EcoRI methyltransferase as well as provide the basis  for future studies aimed at elucidating sequence-specific DNA  modification.  %%%  These experiments are designed to characterize bacterial DNA methyltransferases. These enzymes  modify unique DNA sequences by methylating adenine and cytosine. Structural characterization using  X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance is proposed. Also portions of the enzymes  which contact the  DNA will be identified using laser cross linking and mass spectrometry. Functional  characterization will largely be through protein engineering and protein modification experiments. The  goal of this research is to obtain a molecular understanding of how these enzymes modify unique sites  within DNA. Sequence-specific DNA modification is a universal biological process which has  practical applications in the field of molecular biology.  ***",
