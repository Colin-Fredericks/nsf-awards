 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dennny  9313891    Surf-zone flows on rocky shores are characterized by rapid  velocities and large accelerations, with important consequences for  wave-swept benthic organisms. In particular, accelerations beneath  breaking waves can exceed 40 times gravity, inducing substantial  acceleration forces that have been hypothesized to set both  distribution limits and mechanical size limits in a variety of  intertidal organisms. However, information on surf-zone  accelerations is presently inadequate to predict the likelihood of  encountering accelerations of given magnitude.     In response to these issues, this research project will address  four major goals: (1) Surf-zone accelerations will be measured at  a representative rocky intertidal site, and their relationship to  concurrent, instantaneous velocities will be described. (2) The  shape factors that determine the force experienced by an organism  encountering a given velocity and acceleration will be measured in  the laboratory. Experiments will focus on testing a representative  variety of algal species. (3) The ability of the laboratory-derived  shape factors to predict forces on algae in the field will be  tested by comparing the forces acting on actual plants in the field  to forces predicted on the basis of the laboratory data. (4) Using  the laboratory and field measurements, the theoretical implications  of the accelerational force to wave-swept algae will be explored.  To this end, strength distributions of several algal species will  be measured, and existing mathematical models will be used to  predict survivorship as a function of size and wave exposure.   Together, these data will be used to estimate distributional and  size limits in these species, results that have significance and  applicability to intertidal community ecology in general.    Additionally, experiments will be carried out to quantify the  effect of turbulence-induced shear stress on fertilization and  early development. The majority of intertidal invertebrate an imals  reproduce by external fertilization. However, because breaking  waves quickly sweep away gametes shed by spawning animals, life in  the highly turbulent surf zone poses a severe challenge to  reproduction. Recent experiments have shown that turbulent mixing  caused by breaking waves rapidly dilutes the gametes, resulting in  low fertilization success. But exposure to turbulence has  consequences other than gamete dilution: there are some indications  that turbulence-induced shear stresses may mechanically damage  gametes and could hinder egg-sperm binding.  Furthermore even when  eggs are fertilized, exposure to turbulence may retard and alter  development. Fertilization in the highly turbulent surf-zone will  be simulated by exposing gametes and embryos to the high shear  stresses developed in liquid sheared between two rotating cylinders  (Couette flow). The longer-term effects of the low to moderate  levels of shear stress found in the near-shore mixed-layer  environment will be studied using a tank in which turbulence is  created by vortices shed from an oscillating grid.  ***",
