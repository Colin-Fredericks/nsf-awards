 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314387  Li       The principal investigator will explore a new system of  traffic modeling and network control in high speed networks.  The  work will build a foundation for integrating traffic measurement  and queueing analysis.  The investigator will consider three stages  of traffic modeling.  He will 1) use advanced signal processing  techniques in traffic measurement to collect the traffic power  spectrum and distribution, 2) develop a programming approach for  constructing a single Markov chain to match optimally with the  power spectrum and distribution, and 3) evaluate the corresponding  queue length and loss rate performance in a finite-buffer overload-  controlled system.  The investigator will design a software package  to accomplish all of the three-stage computation tasks.       For the network control, the investigator will use each node  in a high speed network to take on-line measurements.  On a local  link level, such measurements will be used for congestion control,  input rate control and simplify greatly the design of network-wide  traffic flow control, dynamic routing, and call admission control.   On a link level, the investigator will introduce a simple effective  method for dynamic link capacity allocation based on the on-line  observation of filtered input traffic low in the network.  THe key  advantages of such a control scheme are the ability to improve the  network performance by controlling the low frequency traffic flow  and the simplicity of operation by overlooking the queuing process  at each node.  ***",
