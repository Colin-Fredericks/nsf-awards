 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313856  Marston  Electronic many-body processes play an important role in charge  transfer between hyperthermal (greater than thermal velocity) atoms  and the surfaces off which they scatter.  Many-body correlations  are intrinsic to any theory of dynamical charge transfer which  includes electron spin, multiple charge and excited atomic states.  This proposal focusses on these correlations and tries to model  specific real systems.  Understanding the roles of Auger processes,  electron-electron interactions in the atom and the substrate and  the limitations of present models and their systematic solution are  some of the principal problems to be addressed.  Complicated (more  complex than alkali metal) impinging atoms such as oxygen and  semiconducting target surfaces are to be studied.  %%%  This work has direct significance in the understanding of  interactions at surfaces - eg the glow of atoms and molecules  bombarding the space shuttle in orbit.  It concerns the many-body  description of how high energy atoms scatter off surfaces.  The  work makes use of recent innovations in field theory to deal with  these dynamical strongly correlated electronic systems.  The  proposal concerns treating non-trivial impinging atoms and  non-trivial surfaces - where the qualifiers here mean that their  electronic structure has to be handled by sophisticated methods.  ***",
