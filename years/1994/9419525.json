The flux of the entrained fluid will be compared to that of the injected  fluid to calculate absolute and fractional entrainment.  In this way, entrainment into steady state  conduits, thermal conduit solitary waves, and time dependent conduit flow will be measured and  characterized.  The PI will also vary the chemistry of the fluids to investigate the effects of  different rheologies on entrainment, which can be tested by examining entrainment in a plume  conduit which traverses layers of different density and viscosity.  This research has the potential  to evaluate mantle plumes as \"sampling probes\" of the mantle through which they pass, and  when combined with existing and future geochemical data, results form seismic tomography, and  experimental and theoretical determinations of deep mantle rheologies, will allow the PI to place  firmer constraints on the locations of geochemically distinct reservoirs in the convecting mantle  ***",
