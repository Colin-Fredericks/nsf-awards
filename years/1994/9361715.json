The proposed device is based on a newly invented technique to measure the intensity and phase of ultrashort light pulses called frequently-resolved optical gating (FROG).  However, rather than use the pulse to gate itself via the optical Kerr effect, the proposed technique uses an unknown pulse to gate a different unknown pulse.  Like FROG, the gated pulse is spectrally resolved for a series of time delays.  The intensity and phase of both pulses is found by using two-dimensional phase retrieval methods that are commonly used in astronomy and image processing to deblur images.  This device would not only measure pulses, but would provide insight into ultrafast laser operation as well and hence allow them to be used more easily and more effectively.   Immediate commercial applications are directed toward use as a diagnostic for existing ultrafast laser systems for which few are currently available.  Future commercial applications include use as research tool for industry, academia, and government.  ***   v       s  t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   $         $         $                                (                  F                    /                                                                                                    h             h                                 /  1 Courier    Symbol  & Arial  5 Courier New h         c   c         c           \"             h     YB %YB %              c         C   R:\\WW20USER\\ABSTRACT.DOT     Denise Henry Denise Henry",
