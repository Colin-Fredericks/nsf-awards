 "awd_abstract_narration": "940142  Dunkl       This award supports mathematical research on problems  arising in the theory of special functions emphasizing underlying  group structures and extensions to several variables.  The  analysis involves the study of root systems using a technique a  parametrized algebra of differential-difference operators  associated to finite reflection groups.  There is an intertwining  operator which relates these algebras for different parameter  values.  An important part of the project will consist of finding  integral formulas for this operator for Weyl groups by means of  techniques based on the associated compact Lie groups.   Progress in this topic would lead to more detailed information,  such as asymptotics, about the Bessel functions of Coxeter groups  and certain generalizations of the Fourier transform.  Work will  also continue on singular polynomials of Coxeter groups, at  topic which connects representation theory, monodromy of  differential equations with rational singularities on the  reflecting hyperplanes of the groups, Hecke algebras and the  intertwining operator.       Approximation theory and special functions has  fruitful connections with many branches of applied mathematics  such as differential equations, operator theory, numerical  integration, continued fractions and control theory to name a  few.  These subjects have close connections with special  functions and related symmetry groups which provide a natural  synergism between the theoretical and applied aspects of this  research.  ***",
