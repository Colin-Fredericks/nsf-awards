Roughly speaking, FDE's are equations in which an  unknown function of time t, x(t), appears and x'(t), the  instantaneous rate of change of x(t) with time, depends in a  specified way not only on x(t) but also on the past history of  the function x. For example,in some models the rate of increase  of a population of a class of mature red blood cells at time t  may well depend on population levels of those same mature cells  six to ten days earlier. A rigorous mathematical theory of of  nonlinear FDE's poses serious challenges and various equations of  interest in applications have been neglected. We propose to study  some classes of examples which were, until quite recently,  considered intractable, but for which it now seems possible to  obtain a wide variety of surprisingly detailed theorems.         The starting point of this proposal is the study of the  equation (*), ax'(t) = f(x(t),x(t-r)), r = r(x(t)), where f and r  are given functions and a>0. Equation (*) and generalizations of  equation (*) arise in a variety of applications. In joint work  with John Mallet-Paret, the author has shown that, under natural  assumptions on f and r and for all sufficiently small a, equation  (*) has nonconstant periodic solutions. These periodic solutions  often seem to have strong global stability properties.  Furthermore, in many cases it has proved possible to determine  the limiting profile of shape of such periodic solutions as a  approaches zero. In this proposal we consider many questions  about equation (*), and we discuss possible extensions of results  for (*) to much more general classes of equations.",
