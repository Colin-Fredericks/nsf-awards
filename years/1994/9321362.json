 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321362  SIMS    The scarcity of black pearl oysters is the single greatest  constraint to expansion of this industry. Many Pacific atoll  lagoons are suitable for pearl farming, but simply lack the  oysters. The Hawaiian subspecies of black pearl oysters  (P.Margaritifera galtsoffi) was once common in the islands, but was  heavily overfished for pearl shell.  Only remnants of the  population remain. Re-establishment of pearl oyster stocks in  Hawaii could lead to a small commercial fishery for pearl shell.     The development of a commercial black pearl hatchery using the  local oysters is the necessary first step in developing and  implementing pearl culture in Hawaii. This research  will assess  the technical and financial feasibility of land-based as well as  ocean-based grow-out techniques designed to accommodate conditions  found in Hawaii and other S. Pacific Island groups. In addition,  the establishment of a quarantine hatchery to produce stock from  other S. Pacific Islands, e.g., Christmas Island, could lead to  joint venture farms with these various island groups. If  successful, this project would lead to a competitive pearl oyster  culture operation and enhance the economic status of the region.",
