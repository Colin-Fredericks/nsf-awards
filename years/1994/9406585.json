 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406585  Ruttenberg    The overall objectives of this proposal are (1) to use selective  leaching procedure (the SEDEX Method) to identify and quantify    the chemical from of particulate-P in the lower Mississippi and  Atchafalaya Rivers, at the interface between the Mississippi River   and the deltaic marine shelf, and in proximal surficial deltaic  marine sediments; (2) to identify spatial and temporal controls on  processes modifying  particulate-P during riverine transport; and  (3) to identify spatial and temporal controls on chemical  modification at the continent-ocean interface.  Phosphorus (P) is  an essential nutrient which can limit biological productivity in  fresh, brackish, and saline natural waters.  P associated with  particulate matter in natural waters will enhance biological  productivity to the extent that the P can be assimilated.   Determining the bioavailable P associated with particulate matter  is essential for placing constraints on sources of P for biological  cycling in aquatic systems.    Bulk P concentration is not a useful parameter as P-speciation is  required for assessment of the fraction of particulate P which is  bioavailable.  The SEDEX method separately quantifies  Fe-P,  authigenic sedimentary apatite (ASAP), (phases likely to control  soluble, and therefore bioavailable-P  in natural waters), organic-  P, loosely sorbed-P, and detrital apatite.  P-distribution in  Riverine Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) will be determined at  a series of river stations chosen to permit comparisons of input  from agricultural versus industrial land and between the levied  lower Mississippi and the Atchafalaya  hard-wood swamps.  Temporal  variability will be assessed by re-visiting the river study sites  seasonal.  This work will be carried out in conjunction with  ongoing USGS monitoring programs, which provided an array of  valuable supporting data and a long-term record.  The effect of  estuarine processes on RSPM P-distribution will be examined by  coupling field  measurements with P-desorption experiments.  The  latter will cover the range of salinity observed in the estuary.   P-distribution of RSPM determined before and after mixing should  permit direct identification of solid-phase P-reservoirs which  liberate soluble  (and therefore bioavailable ) P to solution.   These results will be compared to P-distribution of in situ RSPM  from the estuary.  The riverine source of bioavailable-P to the  coastal ocean will be assessed by contrasting the P-distribution of  RSPM from these two rivers with that in proximal surficial marine  sediments, and by contrasting P-loading calculations of separately  quantified RSPM P-reservoirs to P-burial rates in proximal shelf  sediments.  The work focusses on a globally significant system,  mechanisms of transformation, and physical and chemical controls  that should be broadly applicable.",
