 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renovation and replacement of approximately 20,000 square feet of biology, neuroscience  and psychology laboratory space is the goal of this NSF award to Amherst College.   Existing laboratories are housed in the 139-yr. old Appleton and 83-yr. old Webster Halls.   Partially renovated in the 1960s, these buildings still suffer from outdated and ineffective  HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems.  Ongoing facility issues include the limitation of  modern science, periodic systems crises which interrupt and setback experimentation, and  programmatic limitations due to the separation of disciplines.  NSF funds will be utilized  to renovate the first floor of Webster Hall for dry laboratory activities associated with the  Psychology department, and for the replacement of wet laboratory facilities for  Neuroscience and Biology in an addition to Merrill Science Center.  The resulting  enhancement to research facilities will advance the interdisciplinary connections (biology,  chemistry, psychology, and neuroscience) that will characterize science research and  teaching during the next half-century.  The upgraded facilities will also form an important  focus for Amherst's successful efforts to involve a high number of their undergraduates --  40% of whom are women and 25% of whom are students of color -- in research activity   The research emphasis gained at Amherst has motivated more than half of their honors  students to pursue Ph.D. programs, or M.D. programs with research as a substantial  component of their medical school education.",
