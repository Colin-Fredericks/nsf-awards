The goal of the program is to train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced computation.  This will be achieved through the development of a sequence of undergraduate and graduate courses that involve the hands-on use of different parallel machines, the development of software demonstrations for class use, and the use of high-technology classrooms.  The courses will form the basis for a new \"Minor in High Performance Computation.\"  The course will be taught by faculty in different departments and colleges and will emphasize the common aspects of high performance computation that cross the boundaries between disciplines.  The project will be evaluated by an external advisory panel with members drawn from academia and industry with expertise in advanced computation and pedagogy.  Student evaluations will be developed and administered.  Information about the project will be available by provision of external electronic access to computer-based classroom demonstrations, by publicity through the Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL), through training workshops for instructors, and through the development and distribution of traditional course materials.  ***",
