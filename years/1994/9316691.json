 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316691  Charles    An impressive network of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic records from  ice cores, lake cores, deep sea cores and tree rings can now be  compiled for a variety of time periods.  These records potentially  offer quantitative insight to past changes in climate processes,  but their true climatic significance cannot be fully realized  without knowledge of the fundamental driving forces for isotopes in  precipitation.  Simple air parcel models cannot account for the  range of processes which control regional isotope distributions,  and therefore the coupling of isotope tracers to a general  circulation model (GCM) represents a necessary first step towards  a more complete understanding of the isotope signals recorded in  the geologic record.  We propose to investigate these isotopic  records by means of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies General  Circulation Model (GISS GCM).  The major issue we will pursue is  how the changes in sourcewater characteristics, air mass  trajectories, and air mass mixing-- all factors which must have  varied over climate cycles with the major components of the climate  system--affect regional isotopic distributions.  Over the next two  years, we will conduct a number of paleoclimatic simulations to  determine the sensitivity of the model moisture source  contributions and isotope fields to specific changes in boundary  conditions (ice sheets, sea ice, sea surface temperature, etc.)   Results of the paleoclimatic simulations will be compared to the  observations, which we will compile.  This data-model comparison  will help identify the components of Northern Hemisphere climate  system that are most important in shaping the isotope records.  The  comparison will also provide a test for the reliability and  sensitivity of the GCM's hydrological cycle.",
