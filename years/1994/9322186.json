Five cross-disciplinary, team-oriented projects will provide each group of two  students with opportunities to work closely with two experienced faculty mentors on a  collaborative project.  The emphasis on this REU Site project is to promote  collaborative research among students and research biologists whose disciplines have  traditionally focused on different sub-disciplines.  Collaborative research topics  include:  expression of bacterial proteins, mechanisms of gene induction in retinal  cells, hormonal responses to stress in bats, kinship and population processes in voles,  and termite foraging ecology and wood chemistry.  Faculty mentors have been  carefully selected on the basis of their experience with undergraduates in the  classroom, research contacts with undergraduates, and their own scholarly  contributions.  Five students will be selected from regional, four-year colleges that do  not provide significant opportunities for research and five will be selected from  students attending Boston University.  Recruitment efforts will specifically target  minority, women, and physically-challenged students.  Selection procedures will be  based on scholarly aptitude, research potential, and previous experience.  An ethics  component with weekly seminars on topics such as ethical treatment of animals, record  keeping and data management, values and integrity in science, responsibility of  authorship, and reporting and investigating allegations of misconduct.  This ethics  component will be shared with REU students from Wellesley College and the  University of Massachusetts (Boston Campus), and joint seminars, activities, and field  trips have been planned in collaboration with REU programs at these regional  institutions.  ***",
