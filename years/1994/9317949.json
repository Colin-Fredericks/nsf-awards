Natural selection may  be the cause of these geographic patterns, with one allele being favored in warm environments and another allele in cool environments.  It has been difficult, however, to rule out other explanations for geographic patterns in allele frequency, such as random drift of frequencies in isolated populations.  The DNA for the Gpi gene in five species of invertebrates will be sequenced, and several statistical tests will be done which can determine whether natural selection is important in affecting the gene.  The data will also help determine whether the differences between closely related species are due to natural selection, or to the accumulation of random mutations that are not affected by selection.   The results of the project will address two basic questions in the genetics of natural populations: how important natural selection is in determining gene frequencies within a species, and how important natural selection is in determining the differences between species.  When differences are observed within or between species in protein and DNA sequences, it is of obvious importance for a wide range of genetic researches to understand whether natural selection has caused the variation, or whether the variation is due to mutations that are unaffected by selection.  In addition, the research may provide insights into genetic and biochemical basis by which populations of organisms adapt to different environments.  This is importa nt to understanding how species will respond to changing environments, adapting or going extinct, and in designing new genetically engineered organisms.
