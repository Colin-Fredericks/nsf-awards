The primary  objective is the development to efficient error control coding  techniques for reliable data transmission and storage.  The  specific areas of investigation are (1) developing algebraic  methods for determining the maximum error-correcting capabilities  of cyclic codes and algebraic-geometric (AG) codes; (2)  constructing efficient algorithms for decoding cyclic and AG codes;  (3) bridging the gap between the ;more traditional cyclic codes and  the AG codes; and (4) developing efficient concatenated coding  coding schemes using AG codes.  For the determination of minimum  distance, the project will develop an approach based on Newton's  identities and their extensions. Closely related approaches based  on the shifting method of  van Lint and Wilson and the method of  counting the number of\"sentinels\" in a syndrome matrix will be  investigated.  The techniques utilized will both lead to minimum  distance determination and to a procedure for constructing  algorithms capable of using the maximum error-correcting  capabilities. Considerable is planned to develop links between  cyclic and AG codes.  Concatenated codes using convolutional codes  as inner codes and AG codes as outer codes will also be studies.   Both theoretical and practical issues will be addressed.   ***",
