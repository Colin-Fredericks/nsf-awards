 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316564  Mayewski  This award is for support for a three year program to provide a high resolution record of the Antarctic  climate through the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of records of atmospheric chemical  deposition taken from three ice cores located at sites within or immediately adjacent to the Ross Ice  Drainage System (RIDS).  These cores include one from Taylor Dome, and two from West Antarctic  locations identified as potential deep drilling sites for the WAISCORES program.    Collection of the  two West Antarctic cores is intended to be a lightweight dry-drilling operation to depths of ~ 200 m,  which will provide records of > 2 kyr.    Glaciochemical analyses will focus on the major cations and  anions found in the antarctic atmosphere, plus methanesulfonic acid and selected measurements of the  hydrogen ion, aluminum, iron, and silica.  These analyses, and companion stable isotope and particle  measurements to be carried out by other investigators require < 7% by volume of each core, leaving >  90% for other investigators and storage at the U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory.  These records are  intended to solve a variety of scientific objectives while also providing spatial sampling and  reconnaissance for future U.S. efforts in West Antarctica.  ***",
