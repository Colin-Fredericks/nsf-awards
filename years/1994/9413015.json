 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Harvard Forest is a 1300-hectare field station in central New England that serves as the research focus of a National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project and the Department of Energy funded National Institute for Global Environmental Change (NIGEC) program (Northeast Center).  In addition to the resident science and technical staff of approximately 35, over 50 researchers from over a dozen institutions conduct a major portion of their field studies at the Harvard Forest.  Harvard Forest educational activities include (1) annually serving as a host to 2-4 visiting faculty through the Bullard Fellowship Program in Forest Biology at Harvard University (2) sponsoring graduate student thesis research and approximately 28 students annually as summer research assistants to faculty and science staff, (3) hosting more than 15 university courses for field studies, (4) convening numerous state, national, and international conferences in science and policy, and (5) educating more than 5000 visitors annually in the Fisher Museum of Forestry.  Research at the Harvard Forest is integrated around the central theme of forest ecosystem dynamics as affected by natural and human disturbance processes.    In recent years the facility has experienced much higher demands for laboratory facilities, data and sample storage space, and offices in the areas of biogeochemistry, atmosphere-biosphere interactions, paleoecology, population ecology, and microbial ecology.  A major commitment to these areas has been demonstrated by the appointments of a full-time Soil Ecologists, Data Manager/Ecologist, and Paleoecologist, and by increased process-level studies by scientists from several institutions.  Education-related demands on laboratory facilities have risen as both graduate student research and our summer undergraduate research program have expanded.  Increased efforts in ecosystem ecology, ecophysiology, paleoecology have resulted in increased need for cold storage of soils, plan t tissues, and lake sediment.    In order to accommodate these increased research and educational activities an existing eight-bay garage complex will be renovated to provide a document archives, cold storage of lake sediment and soil samples, a soil/plant tissue archive facility, and two additional laboratories for visiting scientists and summer research assistants.  When completed the renovation will provide and additional 800 ft2 of archive/storage space and an additional 800 ft2 of laboratory space.",
