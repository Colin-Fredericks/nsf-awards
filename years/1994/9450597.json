 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450597  George    Based upon the premise that what happens outside the school setting is critical to fostering girls'  interst in math and science, AAAS will adapt the successful \"Girls and Science:  Linkages for  the Future\" pass-through training model in order to deliver hands-on extracurricular science  activities to girls, ages 5-17, from underrepresented minority Hispanic-American and African-  American populations through a network of community-based organizations (CBOs).  It is felt  that this populatio is doubly at risk for falling out of the pipeline leading to careers in science,  engineering, and mathematics.  In this training model, which has been used for years by some  CBOs such as the Girl Scouts, AAAS staff will train local trainers who, in turn, will train  leaders in their organization to deliver the science activities to the girls.  AAAS will utilize  CBOs that already use the pass-through model to help establish the training model where it does  not now exist.      The effectiveness of the program will be enhanced by including minority female college students  enrolled in science programs as assistants, mentors, and role models.  A second enhancement  will be the parent workshops designed to encourage parents to raise the expectations they hold  for their daughters' educational activities.  The effectiveness of these enhancements has been  proven in other AAAS equity projects.  Materials and publications developed by AAAS for  similar projects will be adapted where necessary to better meet the needs of the targeted  populations.  Some new products also will be developed.  ***",
