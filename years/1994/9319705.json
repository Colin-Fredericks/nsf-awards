Soon we will no longer  know what these languages sounded like, or what articulatory gestures  their speakers used. Their disappearance will result in permanent loss  of data for future linguistic investigations. Following a pattern  established during previous research we will investigate endangered  languages that are important from the linguistic point of view.  Another major aspect of this project is that it provides standardized  descriptions in quantified form using a set of basic phonetic  measures, designed to characterize both specific and universal  phonetic features. Fieldwork will be conducted in response to  invitations from linguists already working on appropriate languages.  In many cases such linguists lack sufficient phonetic expertise or  field experiences to do the job alone, but are eager to cooperate in  producing a good phonetic description.       The principal phonetic and phonological patterns will be  identified and illustrated in specially prepared material, along with  supplementary material illustrating coarticulatory and other phonetic  phenomena. We will make both audio and physiological recordings  including aerodynamic records for airstream mechanisms and the timing  of articulatory gestures, and palatographic records for articulatory  contacts. Audio recordings will be analyzed in the UCLA Phonetics  Laboratory. Fully illustrated and documented accounts of each language  will be published so that the knowledge of the sounds and articulatory  gestures involved in these endangered languages will remain available  for future researchers and can form part of the input to the  formulation of theories of phonetic and phonological universals.  ***",
