 "awd_abstract_narration": "Walter Bowyer and his undergraduate students at Hobart and William Smith   Colleges will investigate the mechanism of Grignard reagent formation   with the support of this forty-two month continuing grant from the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The surface of the reacting   magnesium metal will be characterized using photomicrography, scanning   electrochemical microscopy, and kinetic studies.  The goal of this   research is to develop a fundamental, detailed understanding of the   surface processes involved when alkyl halides react with metallic   magnesium to form synthetically important Grignard reagents.    Grignard reagents are among the most commonly utilized organic reagents,   however, the factors controlling the production of these species are not   well understood.  In this research project, designed for undergraduate   participation, Professor Bowyer and his students will characterize the   mechanism of reagent formation occuring at the surface of magnesium   metal.  The results from these studies will permit much better control of   the synthesis of these extraordinarily useful reagents that are employed   broadly in commercial processes.",
