 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benack    Union College is a private liberal arts college known for the strengths of its science programs  and its incorporation of engineering into a traditional liberal arts curriculum.  The  Psychology Department is one of the largest and strongest departments on campus.   Currently the department is located in the North Colonnade, a 177 year old structure that was  last renovated in 1945.  Research space in this building is grossly inadequate to support the  department's research activities.  Space is small, poorly designed for experimental work and  in a state of extreme deterioration.  Electrical and heating systems are antiquated, making it  impossible for equipment to function properly.  Faculty have been forced to abandon some  research areas to conduct many research projects in classrooms and offices not suited for  these activities.  To correct this situation, the college will relocated the department to Bailey  Hall, providing much needed space and first-class laboratory facilities.    This award will provide funding for the replacement of 2216 nsf of research and research  training space in Bailey Hall currently occupied by the psychology department in North  Colonnade.  Space will be configured to support research activities and will be made to meet  code and access requirements.  Five laboratories will be modernized to form the center of a  more vigorous and diverse program of research activities for both faculty and students.  With  the provision of dedicated space for data collection with multiple subjects, research will be  able to proceed more efficiently.  Most importantly the relocation will place the department  in proximity to the other sciences, promoting the development of interdisciplinary work, the  sharing of facilities, more efficient use of computer facilities, and joint supervision of student  with interdepartmental majors.",
