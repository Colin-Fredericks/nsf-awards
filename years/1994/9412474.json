 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412474  Weis  High resolution seismic sensing could improve earth-drilling safety  and efficiency, and provide a better exploration tool for  geophysics.  To achieve high spatial resolutions (on the order of  1 m) a seismic detector must have a frequency response up to about  2 kHz.  Detectors made of fiber Bragg gratings should provide the  required frequency response and be simpler, and more rugged than  prior detectors.  The immediate goals of this project are to  design, fabricate, and test a prototype borehole seismic detection  system using optical fiber-Bragg-gratings.  The longer term goals  of this project are:  (1) build and test an array of fiber-grating  seismic sensors, (2) refine the proposed seismic detection system,  (3) establish a working relationship between RockBit International  Inc. (RBI) and the faculty investigator, and (4) work together with  RBI on further applications of optical fiber sensors to borehole  and measurement-while-drilling (MWD) sensing.    This project will be significant in at least three ways.  First,  the proposed seismic detector will be simple, reliable, easily  multiplexed, and potentially less expensive than present detectors.   Second, it will allow the faculty investigator and an undergraduate  student to learn the problems and challenges of a local  manufacturing company.  Third, it will provide \"real-world\"  engineering examples for instructional motivation in the classroom.  ***",
