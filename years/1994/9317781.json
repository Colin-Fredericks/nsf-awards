 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to request funds for the  purchase of a Philips CM- 200 Transmission Electron  Microscope to be housed in the Visualization Facility (BVF)  of the Beckman Institute on the University of Illinois  campus.    The Principal Investigators will be using this electron  microscope for a variety of studies including (i)  neuroplasticity and its relationship to underlying cellular  and system level processes (William Greenough), (ii) the  study of monodisperse rod-coil block copolymers (Samuel  Stupp), (iii) analysis of nuclear and chromosome  architecture (Andrew Belmont), (iv) sex differences in the  organization and behavioral function of the brain (Janice  Juraska), and (v) the characterization of morphological and  functional abnormalities in cerebellar neural circuitry in a  genetic animal model of movement dysfunction (Louise  Abbott). In addition to these core projects there are 6  other research projects from a variety of disciplines for  which this instrument provides immediate or long term  benefits.    The purpose of obtaining a new instrument is twofold.  Firstly it will provide access to an intermediate voltage  instrument for biological research on the UIUC campus.  The  only intermediate voltage instruments in this region are  exclusively devoted to material science research and  biologists with projects for which higher voltages are  necessary have to travel to remote sites.  Secondly it will  replace an existing 18 year old instrument currently located  in the BVF that is suffering increasingly from age related  problems.  In addition to providing unique capabilities for  imaging thicker specimens this microscope will have a number  of other important advantages over the existing instrument.  The ability to control the instrument through a computer  interface and to collect micrographs using a CCD camera will  greatly aid, and in  certain cases be essential for several  applications.  Specifically, for techniques such as serial  sectioning, quantitative  stereology and single axis  tomography which  involve the collection or examination of  large numbers of images, semi-automatic acquisition  procedures can be devised that not only simplify the process  but also ensure that the electron dose is minimized and the  region of interest is maximized. Furthermore, certain  applications of these 3-dimensional reconstruction  techniques require literally hundreds of images per data set  and these applications for practical  considerations will  only be feasible given the availability of direct digital  data acquisition.  These control and imaging capabilities  will also greatly improve the  routine acquisition of high  quality images.    Further advantages of the new microscope arise from the  advances in technology  over the past 20 years.  These have  led to simplification of alignment procedures, improvements  in beam coherence, lenses and goniometer stages and the  implementation of techniques for acquiring images at low  doses in order to limit beam damage.    The microscope will be located in the Beckman Visualization  Facility which houses  a number of other related instruments  (including a confocal microscope, a stereology workstation  and various light microscopes) as well as supporting  equipment (wet lab, microtomes, darkrooms) and excellent  facilities for the digital processing and analysis of  images.  The location of the microscope in the multi-  disciplinary environment of the Beckman Institute, which  also includes part of the  National Center for  Supercomputing Applications, provides an excellent  environment to take advantage of some of the latest  technology available for the on- line processing and  analysis of electron micrographs.  We are strongly committed  to  providing access to this instrument and its associated,  special facilities to the  campus wide user group whose  research wholly or partly depends on the  application of  electron microscopy.    There is enthusiastic commitment to this project from both  the Beckman In stitute  and the University as a whole.  This  has been demonstrated by the contribution of  50% matching  funds for the project as well as the supporting  infrastructure for the  equipment provided by the Beckman  Institute Visualization Facility.",
