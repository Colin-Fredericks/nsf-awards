The instrument will be  utilized in a series of laboratory experiments designed to  illuminate the subject of Thermal Physics for physics and pre-  engineering majors.  The differential scanning calorimeter will  allow the introduction of a wide variety of experiments, at a  number of different levels. The experiments will range from those  with a high level of direction and firmly established procedure, to  those which attempt to generate original contributions in current  research topics in Physics. The experiments include measurements of  phase transitions in materials (including melting, lambda  transitions, and impurity freezing point depression), the heat  capacity of solids, and solid state reaction kinetics and  energetics. Additional experiments involve the study, in the  context of Thermal Physics, of the operation of the calorimeter.",
