The upper bounds on the dynamic response for structures with  some modeling uncertainties, and with some uncertainties in  the static and transient loads will be established.  Safe  performance for a variety of design goals, including the  ability to withstand worst case wind loads and earthquake  excitations, in the presence of a specified set of component  failures will be ensured.  Finally, structure design with  control design as opposed to existing procedures which add  control after a structure is designed, will be integrated.  This research will lead to a systematic theory of design for  civil engineering structures, complete with a CAD  workstation environment integrating identification, model  reduction, control design, and structure design.  The  improvements in structural design could be significant when  the two disciplines (structures and controls) are integrated  into a single design process  ***",
