 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400975  Hamilton       This award supports mathematical research into problems  arising in the modern theory of functions.  A central theme of  this theory is the deformation of functions by conjugation with  bijections.  Using tools of classical analysis, potential theory,  quasiconformal mapping, boundary values of analytic functions,  and conformal mapping two new approaches to old questions in the  areas of Riemann surfaces and Complex Dynamics have been  developed.  The project will continue to exploit the ideas to  prove rigidity results on Julia sets of rational functions.  For  example, if the Julia set is a curve then it has the Fatou  property, that is, it is a circle or has dimension greater than  one.  For Riemann surfaces work will follow on a recent proof of  the general version of the Bers Uniformization Theorem to prove a  conjecture of Gromov on the uniqueness of the representation.   Other work will focus on n-dimensional bilipschitz mappings in  the context of quasiconformal mapping.  In particular efforts  will be made to characterize those which arise as reflections  across boundaries of domains.       Classical function theory has introduced geometric  techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than  first imagined.  The subject exploits the interplay between  geometric interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to  yield some of the most complete mathematical results in the field  of analysis. In this project, variational techniques and  geometric reasoning are expected to lead to results of valuable  physical significance.  ***",
