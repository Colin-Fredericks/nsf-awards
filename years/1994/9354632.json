This laboratory  section will be designed for students who take the course to  complete the laboratory science requirement for Massachusetts  elementary school certification.  Three weeks will be spent on each  of the following topics: the cell, carbohydrate metabolism,  photosynthesis and genetics. In the first week of the course the  students will do the college -level exercises planned for all  sections on these topics.  In week two, with the assistance of  science and education faculty, students select and design exercises  for a particular elementary level.  The students are graded on the  portfolios they develop.  Elementary school children will visit the  College in the third week, through a collaboration with a local  elementary school.  The students will evaluate the exercise they  have taught.  By including an elementary school visit to each of  the traditional labs science majors will also have an opportunity  to teach.",
