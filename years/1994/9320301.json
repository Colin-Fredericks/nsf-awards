 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320301  Yau, Libgober    This award provides support a joint U.S.-China Seminar on  Singularities and Complex Geometry.  U.S. Principal Investigators  Stephen Yau and Anatoly Libgober of the University of Illinois at  Chicago and Lu Qikeng, Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, have organized a joint seminar to be held in  Beijing, China on singularities and complex geometry, which is an  active area of research in algebraic geometry with implications  for diverse areas of science ranging from elementary particle  physics to fields of engineering.  The geometry of complex  analytic spaces continues to warrant considerable attention in  pure mathematics and in recent years, both the conceptual and  technical aspects of the subject have become increasingly  important in several areas of modern mathematical physics.    The principal investigators are known as leading authorities in  this area, and maintain active research programs.  Participants  on both sides include a mix of senior and junior researchers,  with the expectation that channels of communication will be  opened between the new generation of mathematicians in both  countries.  It is anticipated that given the development of  China's very independent mathematical school, and its limited  contact with the West, new viewpoints and mathematical techniques  will be obtained through this proposed interaction.    Support recommended includes airfare for twelve U.S.  participants, local travel, and modest organizational fees.   China's National Natural Science Foundation and Academy of  Sciences will support Chinese participation and the local  subsistence costs of U.S. researchers in China for the duration  of the seminar.",
