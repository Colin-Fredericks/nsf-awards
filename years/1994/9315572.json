 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315572  Yannas  The inability of damaged or severed nerve axions to  reconnect following spinal cord injury causes paralysis, a  condition amenable to restorative treatment.  However, the  recent availability of chemical analysis of extracellular  matrices (ECM) has enhanced understanding of environmental  preferences of growing peripheral axons.  This in turn has  led to the fabrication of prostheses which have induced  rapid and almost complete recovery of function of transected  sciatic nerves in small rodents.    The goal of this research program is to synthesize,  characterize and optimize the composition and pore structure  of chemical analogs of ECM (based on graft copolymers of  type I collagen and chrondrotin 6-sulfate) that may  facilitate optimal elongation of spinal cord axions.  The  knowledge gained will be used to design implantable  prostheses that will facilitate reconnection of axons of the  spinal cord.  Support for clinical studies will be sought  from other sources.  This research, if successful, is  expected to improve the quality of life of individuals with  spinal cord injuries and effect a significant cost savings  in health care.    This program, supported under the Cost Effective Health Care  Technology Initiative, is a collaborative interdisciplinary  effort involving materials scientists and health care  practitioners from the Fibers and Polymers Laboratory as  well as the Department of Biology and Brain & Cognitive  Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the  Department of Neurosurgery @  Deaconess Hospital, and the  Orthopedics Laboratory @ Brigham and Women's Hospital.  ***",
