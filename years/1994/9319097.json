 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319097  Engeland    Stress Activates the neuroendocrine system through a feedback  mechanism involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system.  Corticotropin releasing factor, a peptide hormone, is released from  the hypothalamus and travels to the pituitary where it triggers the  release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  ACTH travels in the  blood to the adrenal glands where it stimulates the release of  glucocorticoids, such as cortisol and corticosterone.  This system  is also involved in the maintenance of the body's normal internal  functioning.  Glucocorticoids not only help the body respond to  stress but play an integral part of daily life and adaptation to  environmental change.  Recently, Dr. Engeland and others have found  changes in plasma glucocorticoids in the absence of changes in  plasma ACTH under both stressful and non-stress conditions.  The  finding challenges our simplistic view of adrenocortical secretion  and indicates that other mechanisms are involved in the release of  adrenal hormones.  Recent evidence suggests a role for the adrenal  nerves but the specific contribution of adrenal neural input to  physiological responses are not known.  Using a variety of  innovative techniques, Dr. Engeland will characterize the  contribution of adrenal neural activity to non-stress and stress-  induced secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids.  He will then  determine which neurotransmitters are mediating its effect.   Finally Dr.Engeland will identify the adrenal cellular mechanisms  that mediate neural effects on steroidogenesis.  These results will  provide a new understanding about why exposure to the same  environmental conditions that appear to have similar effects on  ACTH release may produce different adrenocortical responses.  The  function of most tissues is dependent on the maintenance of normal  plasma glucocorticoids levels.  Aberrant adrenal hormone secretion  can result in weaken muscles and suppressed organ systems.   Understanding the nature of the interaction  between adrenal nerve  input and ACTH will provide a new perspective on physiological and  pathological alternations in adrenocortical secretion.  Thus,  findings resulting from this basic research may eventually lead to  the development of new pharmacological or surgical approaches to  control adrenal secretion of glucocorticoids.  ***",
