 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414630  O'Cinneide       Computational probability is an area of study that focuses on  the application of non-randomized algorithms for analyzing systems  that are subject to randomness.  Computational probability is a  manifestation of the incorporation of computers into society at  large, and into science and engineering in particular.  This  research is concerned with the problems of computational  probability, including the methods of phases, decomposition  methods, and asymptotic methods.  Some fundamental questions  regarding the scope of the method of phases will be investigated.   Decomposition method will be combined with the method of phases in  an attempt to devise a method-of-phases approach to a large  systems.  A central theme of the research is to bring numerical  analysis to bear on computational probability.  In particular, the  relationship between non-negative arithmetic and the accuracy of  certain algorithms in computational probability will be explored.       The theoretical aspect of this research will have some impact  on applications through the identification of good algorithms and  methodologies for solving problems that have some inherent  attributes of randomness.  On the application side, the work  undertaken in this research can be viewed as part of the process of  incorporating the use of computers into the design of complex  systems.",
