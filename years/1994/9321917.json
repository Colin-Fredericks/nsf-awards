These  changes are expected to be greatest at high latitudes. This  project will assess the capacity of three important arctic plant  species to adapt to new environments that may arise as a  consequence of climate change. Because the exact nature of future  climate change is at present unclear, this research will focus on  plant response to multiple environmental factors including  temperature, moisture, CO2, and nutrients.  In this way, models  of evolutionary response will be developed that have predictive  value among a range of alternative scenarios of climate change.   A series of experiments will focus on plant growth rate and  morphological traits, relationships between traits and growth,  and quantitative genetic analysis.  This research is expected to  produce evolutionary models of each species that describe (1) the  capacity of arctic plant populations to adapt to new environments  and (2) the patterns of morphological and physiological changes  that would be favored by natural selection in these altered  environments.  ***",
