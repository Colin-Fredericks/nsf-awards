 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408739  Dufour       This research involves a graduate student in  anthropology from the University of Colorado studying how  Colombian Indians use different varieties of manioc.  This  food plant is a staple in many tropical places, and grows in  a \"bitter\" (i.e., poisonous) and \"sweet\" variety.  The  bitter varieties are often planted even though they require  a long procedure of food processing in order to extract the  poisons.  The student will study the productivity of the  plants, their disease resistance, how the people treat them  and why they prefer some varieties to others, using a series  of techniques including chemical analysis of the plants and  cognitive tests of the farmer's perceptions of differences  in the plants.  Yields and damages to roots will be measured  for sweet and bitter manioc in 20 family gardens and one  control garden.       This research will enhance our understanding of human  adaptation to tropical rain forests, particularly to black  water river systems.  The knowledge to be gained will be  valuable for agricultural planners and economic development  advisers in all tropical areas where manioc is an important  food plant.",
