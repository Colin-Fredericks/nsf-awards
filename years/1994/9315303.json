The research specifically proposed for this Small Grant for Exploratory Research period consists of exploratory development of a series of biologically realistic models that simulate the structural and functional organization of this neural control system at several hierarchical levels (from single neuron level to systems level) and that lead to understanding of the principles of distributed neural computations which provide for the robust and adaptive control of respiration. Based on Richter's theory of a network origination of the three phase respiratory rhythm, the investigators will develop a model of elementary neural network generator which incorporates the known data on single neuron properties of neurons of different respiratory groups and the data on interconnections between them. This model will simulate the genesis of the basic respiratory rhythm and specific patterns of activity of different respiratory neurons. At the same time, at the network level, we propose a concept of computation that is (in some sense) an alternative to the traditional connectionist approach. It is considered that there are many parallel interacting and competing elementary local generators in a  multistable distributed network of medullary respiratory neurons.  These elementary generators are able to generate their own respiratory oscillations but interact via interneural synaptic connections and operate under common feedback control from the periphery. This feedback synchronizes the elementary generators and provides the common respiratory rhythm. Thus, the common (adaptive and robust) respiratory rhythm results from self organization of the system of elementary parallel generators.   Simulation of this process, incorporating realistic neurons and multiple network generators, will require supercomputing facilities. Special attention will be focused on analysis of advantages of the considered type of parallel distributed computations and control. ***",
