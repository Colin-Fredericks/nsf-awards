 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400180  Raj       The goal of this research is the development of a new   manufacturing design concept for the synthesis of single crystal   thin films of complex oxides from metalorganic precursors.  The   concept embodies molecular control for layer-by-layer growth, large   area single crystal growth of thin films, low environmental impact,   and a table top design that is economical and flexible.  The   concept employs pulsed injection of very small amounts of liquid   precursors directly into a low pressure reactor in order to achieve   atom-layer by atom-layer growth of single crystal films.  The use  of an  ultrasonic nozzle to obtain reproducible deposition per  pulse is a special feature of the research.  The specific objective   of the research is to develop viable models for the processing   parameters that can be used to tailor manufacturing systems, based   on the proposed concept, for specific applications.             The process that will result from this research will enable   monolayer-level control for the growth rate of the single crystal   films used in microelectronic devices and, at the same time, allow   considerable flexibility, cost-effectiveness and manufacturing   potential for making films of various compositions of large area   substrates.",
