 "awd_abstract_narration": "GET REAL         The Get Real! science strand will model and reinforce positive  attitudes towards,and involve in, science and technology.  It will  seek to affirm for children the value of their ideas, and the  importance of asking Why?         It will tell stories about kids involved in science-related  activities (such as science camps, inventors' fairs and wildlife  rehabilitation programs), and connect science concepts to  children's known experiences and activities.  These ideas are basic  to constructivism-that people grow based on what they already  understand, adding levels of knowledge-and are central to Get Real!      It will enforce viewers' active connection to the science content  by making suggestions for projects to get involved with, and by  encouraging children to discuss and question their knowledge of  science and the world around them.  We will also direct students to  appropriate informal science education organizations (such as  science centers and zoos) and to their teachers, for further  discussion and information. (Teachers guides will be developed as  part of this project.)  ***",
