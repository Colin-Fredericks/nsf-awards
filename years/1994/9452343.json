 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452343  Morgan  Funds are requested to develop a unique laboratory facility in  support of undergraduate research into a range of topics related to  animal physiology. In contrast to traditional physiology  laboratories where students perform a series of prescribed  exercises, this facility will support \"project-laboratories\" in  which small groups of students initiate, carry out, and present the  results of a research project of their own design. I propose to  make computers an integral part of our physiology teaching  laboratories at all stages of data acquisition and analysis, not  just when analyzing data obtained using traditional and now largely  outdated physiological instruments (e.g., oscilloscopes).  Specifically, I wish to develop a computerized facility that will  enable students to develop research skills in physiology in three  key areas. (1) The first is a computerized facility for addressing  questions relevant to energy metabolism and respiratory gas  exchange. Equipment requested includes O2 and CO2 analyzers, an  oxygen meter and electrode, and computer data collecting and  analysis software and hardware. (2) The second is a computerized  facility for addressing questions relevant to animal motion  (locomotion and feeding behavior). Equipment requested includes a  stereozoom microscope, a video camera and monitor, a video  recorder, and computer. (3) The third is a computerized facility  for addressing physiological questions relevant to nepve and muscle  function. Equipment requested includes physiological transducers,  a preamplifier, and computer data collecting and analysis software  and hardware. Development of technologically sophisticated  laboratory facilities such the ones proposed above is integral to  departmental efforts to enhance the quality of undergraduate  education at East Carolina University.",
