 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403179  Booksh  Dr. Karl S. Booksh has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Booksh received his  doctoral degree from the University of Washington under the  supervision of Professor Bruce Kowalski. Dr. Booksh will  continue research at the University of South Carolina under the  sponsorship of Professor Michael Myrick.  His postdoctoral  research will provide him with the techniques and knowledge  necessary to design and construct environmental and process  sensors. Longer term, he plans to apply his knowledge of  chemometrics to the development and calibration of in situ  sensors that rely on mathematical and physical separation of  the analyte signal from the background signal. With appropriate  probe design and proper use of calibration algorithms, sensors  will be built that optimize selectivity, dynamic range and  speed.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry is viewed as  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the  knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into  meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and  teaching.",
