 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407779  Fung  We propose to understand the structural of the human erythrocyte  spectrin  -subunit in forming head-to-head association with the    -subunit to give heterodimers and tetramers.  We will use cDNA and  PCR methods to express specific  -subunit segments in E. coli, with  a glutathione-S-transferase gene fusion system.  Spectrin segments  selected for this study will start from the N-terminus of the  -  subunit and ending at different positions in the sequence, giving  peptides of various lengths.  Binding studies of these purified,  -recombinant peptides with the  isolated  -subunit will be conducted to select peptides with  functional properties.  From the functional peptides, Fourier  transform infrared techniques will be used to select the peptides  that have secondary structure similar to that of intact spectrin.   The shortest peptide of these peptides will be subjected to site  directed mutagenesis to provide a set of peptides, each with one  cysteine per peptide but at different positions in the sequence, to  obtain topological information by spin label electron paramagnetic  resonance methods.  At the conclusion of this project, we expect to  have obtained structural information about the first 60 amino acids  in the N-terminal region of the  -submit that are required for     head-to-head association.  We believe that an understanding of the   -and  -subunit head-to-head association forms the basis for  further understanding the assembly of spectrin subunits to give  heterodimes and tetamers.  %%%  Underneath the human red blood cell membranes is a skeletal network  of proteins.  This skeletal network provides many of the membrane  properties, including mechanical and morphological properties, of  the red cells. Abnormal skeletal networks often lead to abnormal  red blood cells causing different types of anemia in patients.  The  major proteins in this network is called spectrin.  Abnormal  spectrin may lead to abnormal skeletal networks.  Thus it is  important to understand  the structure of the spectrin molecule.   However, spectrin is a very large protein molecule for detailed  structural studies.  In our project, we will synthesize a  subfragment of the spectrin molecule, using recombinant DNA methods  and bacterial cells, and use reporter group techniques to monitor  the structural features of the molecule.  In particular, we will  synthesize the region of the molecule that will bind its partner  subunit to provide interwoven molecules of two subunits (a dimer)  that will then bind to another spectrin dimer to form the skeletal  network underlying red blood cell membrane surfaces.  With the  spectrin fragment, we will attach a label which exhibits a signal  in a electron paramagnetic resonance instrument.  By following the  signal changes under different experimental conditions, we will be  able to extract molecular information on the spectrin molecule.   With the understanding of the spectrin molecule, we will gain  insights into the abnormalities of some o the red blood cells from  anemia patients.     ***",
