 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407039  Souvaine       Computational techniques are needed to assist in the analysis of  genomic information to determine structural and functional properties  of the genome.  An example is the problem of differential gene  expression.  The identification of genes expressed differently in  different states of a disease is essential for the characterization  and classification of the biological and clinical behavior of the  disease.  Algorithms are needed to accurately and efficiently compare  \"gene fingerprints\" in order to provide detailed quantitative  information on differential gene expression.  To devise such  algorithms, it will be necessary to provide both useful data  structures for representing fingerprints and comparison algorithms to  determine the essential differences and similarities between two  fingerprints.  I propose to develop and implement such data  structures and algorithms, as well as investigate other mathematical  and computational problems that arise in the analysis of genomic  function.       The first year of the proposed fellowship will be a DIMACS  \"special year\" in Mathematical Support for Molecular Biology.  As  part of this special year, DIMACS will be holding a 25-month  intensive training plan for its postdoctoral associates.  This  training plan will include ongoing mentoring biology seminars,  tutorials and courses, and visits to the Waksman Institute of  Molecular Genetics at Rutgers and the NSF Science and Technology  Center for Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Washington.  In addition to the postdoctoral training plan, the special year will  involve a distinguished lecture series, a seminar series, workshops  and mini-workshops, and ongoing discussion and collaboration between  the postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and long- and short-  term visitors to DIMACS.  While the training provided by CuraGen will  be less organized than the training provided by DIMACS, it will be  equally valuable, and will consist of day-to-day contact with   CuraGen's molecular biologists and physical scientists, as well as  unlimited access to the biology and instrumentation laboratories.",
