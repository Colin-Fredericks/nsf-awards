 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410680  Mahadevan       There is a real need for design engineers to be able to link   the design decision making process with product reliability in a   way that supports quantitative evaluation, more effective use of   experiments, and engineering specifications on production processes   and variables.  It is also important that design tools be easy to   integrate in the design process.  The deployment strategy makes   effective use of industry in the definition and evaluation of the   deployed technology. It also uses computer networks, workshops, and   conferences for rapid dissemination of the technology to   universities and industry.  The educational materials to be   developed include a full description of the methodology,   presentation material in the form of view graphs, simplified   working models for spreadsheet calculations, a computer program   with several options for probabilistic design analysis, and example   problems.       This effort will deploy a ready technology of  computationally-based tools for reliability-based design analysis  to the mechanical design communities in industry through an  educational infrastructure.  The developed technology has been  found to be  generic for mechanical systems reliability and has  been shown to be  directly usable in the design process without  extensive knowledge  of statistics and probability methods.  It  enables the designer to  compute design uncertainties such as the  probability of failure for  any sensible design limit condition and  to combine a number of such  design limit conditions into a  generalized estimate of system  reliability.  At every step, the  designer is given direct feedback  on the critical drivers of  product unreliability and design  confidence levels, facilitation  re-design for enhanced reliability.",
