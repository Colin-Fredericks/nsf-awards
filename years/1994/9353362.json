It is sponored by the New  York Botanical Garden Inst and the Institute of Ecosystem Studies  The goals of the project are to develop outdoor ecological  activities, develop and pilot test a professional development  system for training teachers to use the activities, and to  evaluate the activities and training system. Fifteen teams (one  teacher and one ecologist per team) from around the country will  develop activities appropriate for their setting (urban/suburban/  rural) and climate. These teams will also serve as SYEFEST  trainers for approximately 10 teachers at each site. The  Ecological Society of America will disseminate the model and  manuals. Some of the materials which will be used may include   Feinsinger and review of OBIS. Some materials also may come from  EcoInquiry. The project will begin in 1994 and continue through  1995.  The project matches 13% of the support from the  Foundation.",
