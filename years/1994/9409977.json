 "awd_abstract_narration": "Washington University at St. Louis  George Varghese  RIA: Trading Packets Headers for Packet Processing    In high speed networks, packet processing is relatively expensive  while bandwidth is cheap.  The central thesis here is that if  suitable header fields can be added to packets, then mechanisms to  speed up packet processing can be devised.  Several ideas are  advanced to support the above thesis.  First, data manipulation  (e.g. data copying, checksumming) is a major bottleneck of end  system packet processing.  The approach taken here suggests adding  a data manipulation header to an easily accessible portion of each  packet.  This header contains pointers to fields (in various  layers) required for data manipulation.  This information (e.g. a  pointer to data to be encrypted) allows implementations to  efficiently combine data manipulation steps (e.g. encryption and  copying).  Prior work has shown that combining data manipulation  steps can yield order-of-magnitude performance improvement.  The  present approach can yield similar improvements in a more uniform  and structured fashion.  Second the work studys adding index fields  to protocol identifiers at all layers (e.g. connection identifiers,  network addresses) to reduce lookup costs and generic protocol  processing.  Several new ides to utilize these index fields  (threaded indexing, index passing, and source hashing) are studied.  It is known that the use of Virtual Circuit Identifiers (VCIs) on  virtual circuit packets simplifies lookup and packet processing.   In source hashing and threaded indexing, the added indices  essentially serve as VCIs, but for flows in a datagram network.  In  source hashing, for example, the \"VCI\" is a consistent random label  chosen by the source.  OUr new methods provide the benefits of  normal VCis without requiring a round trip delay for set up.  The  methods can lower uorst case datagram lookup times form O(log(n) to  O(1), which may be important for gigabit routers.  IN this project  we design,  analyze, and implement these new ideas and search for  other techniques that arise from the basis thesis.  The current  climate of transition (in which transport, routing, and data link  protocols are changing) provides an opportunity to apply these  techniques to influence real protocols.",
