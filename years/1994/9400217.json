 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops more effective and efficient Newton  iterative (truncated Newton) methods, i.e., implementations of  Newton's method that use iterative linear algebra methods.  A  concomitant objective is to develop improved Krylov subspace  methods and associated techniques for linear problems; this work  supports the primary objective and is important in its own right.  The project centers around recently developed globally convergent  inexact Newton algorithms, improved implementations of GMRES, and  new applications of Lanczos-based methods and \"residual smoothing\"  techniques.  A specific goal is to construct high-quality codes for  Newton iterative methods and for GMRES that are suitable for  public distribution.       Newton iterative methods and Krylov subspace methods have  many important scientific and industrial applications; examples  include aircraft dynamics modeling, semiconductor modeling,  climate modeling, oil reservoir simulation, and contaminant  transport in aquifers.  The large-scale problems to which they are  usually applied often require high-performance vector and parallel  computers and, indeed, have provided significant incentive for  their development.  This research contributes to improved  computational modeling techniques for scientific and industrial  applications and more effective utilization of high-performance  computers.",
