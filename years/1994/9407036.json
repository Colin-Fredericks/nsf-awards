 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407036  Steinmetz  Marquette University    The photochemistry of aryl substituted di- and tri-silanes will be investigated. The hypothesis will be tested that the triplet local excited state (3LE) is populated by a 1LE -> CT -> 3LE sequence of electron transfer processes, which passes through a charge transfer state (CT). A p-cyanostilbenyl substituted disilane will be used to distinguish the singlet and triplet LE states by triplet quenching. These states will also be monitored by unique photo-products from a disilanyl substituted benzo 2.2.2 bicyclooctenone. CT photoreactivity will be monitored through kinetic studies involving reaction with alcohols. In addition, a study of wavelength effects on silylene extrusion versus electron transfer in trisilane systems will be pursued. The photoreactivity of exciplexes will also be probed by tethering the disilanyl electron transfer donor to electron deficient styrenes.     This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Mark G. Steinmetz at Marquette University. The photochemistry of compounds containing two and three silicon atoms bonded together will be studied. These compounds will also have a benzene-like substituent bonded to one of the silicon atoms. Ultraviolet light absorption by these compounds produces excited states from which photochemistry may proceed. These excited states and photo-products will be characterized. The results may provide insight to the design of photoresists that are important in the electronics industry.",
