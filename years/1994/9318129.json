 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318129  Biewener  Accurate imaging of animal movements underlies studies of the  neuromuscular control of animal movement and the biomechanics and  hydrodynamics of animal function. Quantitative kinematic analyses of  the movements of animal segments or of the animal itself can be related  to simultaneous recordings of nerve firing, muscle activation, force  generation and shortening, skeletal strain, or to visualization of flow  patterns through or around the animal. Often, and especially for small  animals, these movements occur at very rapid rates and over short time  intervals. To record these rapid movements with reasonable time  resolution can require imaging rates of greater than 1000 Hz.  High-speed film analysis represents a central component of the P.I.'s  and the three Co-P.I's research. For many years, we have carried out  such studies by relying on 16 mm film recording and analysis to obtain  imaging rates as high as 500 frames sec-1.  Recent developments in high  speed videography now make it possible to obtain even higher imaging  rates using a video based recording and analysis system.    This proposal therefore requests funds to purchase a high-speed video  system to be installed as a multi-user facility within the Department  of Organismal Biology & Anatomy at the University of Chicago. The  equipment that we seek to purchase is a Kodak Ektapro EM 1012 Motion  Analyzer System, equipped with an intensified imaging camera and  analysis workstation. This system is capable of obtaining 1000 full  frames sec-l under low light conditions, yielding excellent depth of  field (essential to reliable monitoring of animal movement patterns).  By partitioning the memory area onto which each frame is mapped,  practical imaging rates of up to 6000 images sec-1 can be obtained.  This system is state-of-the-art and is likely to remain so for many  years. The Kodak Ektapro and competitive systems have been recently  acquired by other labs working in these areas of biology. To remain  competit ive with these groups and to provide a resource that will  attract students who wish to pursue graduate training in biomechanics  and neuromuscular biology, we believe that it is essential that we  obtain such a system. While the cost of the system is too high to  justify on a single investigator proposal, it is appropriate for use as  a shared facility. This system is ideal for short-term, intensive use  by an investigator/lab group (1 to 2 weeks), during which time  considerable kinematic data can be recorded and later analyzed in the  investigator's own lab after downloading the digitized image files onto  removable high-density disk media. Our goal is to not only share this  high-speed video system among each of our labs, but to make it  available to students and research faculty in other units within the  University. We also envision limited access by persons outside the  University. The P.I. will oversee scheduling, use and maintenance of  the equipment.",
