 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407615  Bronstein     The study of mutualism has lagged behind the study of other interactions between organisms.  Several features of mutualism, notably the inherent conflicts of interests between mutualists, suggest that these interactions may be easily perturbed and unstable.  Yet mutualisms are important and common relationships in most ecosystems.  This project attempts to test some new ideas about how mutualisms persist successfully in nature.  Specifically, the PI's will test the idea that mutualists' fates are linked by extrinsic factors that simultaneously limit both partners' success, and that this variance often cancels out the inherent conflict between mutualists.  The study system used is the relationship between figs and fig wasps.    This research will improve our understanding of the ecology of mutualisms and elucidate the role of extrinsic factors in creating stability in otherwise inherently unstable systems.  The results may have application in conservation biology, including the design and management nature reserves, and in agricultural pollination.",
