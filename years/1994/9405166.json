 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405166  Shipley    This award is under the International Junior Investigator and  Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and  engineers to conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at  research centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique  or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a ten month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. Lisa A. Shipley to work with Dr. Per Lundberg at the  Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umea, Sweden.    Their research is designed to examine the question of predicting  optimal bite size for animals of different sizes based on  tradeoffs between intake rate and nutrient quality.  They will do  this by modelling the optimal bite size based on animal size, the  relationship between fiber and plant secondary chemistry and bite  size or twig diameter, the digestive physiology of the animal,  and the relationship between bite size and dry matter intake  rate.  The predictions will be compared with field and lab  observations of four free-ranging browsing herbivore species of  the boreal ecosystem of northern Sweden feeding in winter on  dormant browses.    ***",
