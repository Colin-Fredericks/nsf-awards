 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320826  Borjas  The large number of immigrants admitted into the U.S. over the  past two decades has had a major impact on the skill composition  of the labor force, and might even be responsible for some of the  major changes in the wage structure observed in the 1980s.  It is  important to stress, however, that the economic impact of today's  immigration is not limited to the current generation.  Because of  the intergenerational link between the skills of parents and  children, current immigration policy might already be determining  the skill endowment of the labor force for the next two or three  generations.    The purpose of this research is to determine and analyze the role  that immigration and ethnicity play in the U.S. economy.  The  underlying theme of the various aspects of this project is that  immigration has both short and long-run effects, and that these  effects are much better understood by grounding the analysis in a  solid microeconomic, theoretical foundation.  The empirical  analysis will use a number of data sets, including the newly  released 1990 Public Use Sample of the U.S. Census, the National  Longitudinal Surveys, and the General Social Surveys.  ***",
