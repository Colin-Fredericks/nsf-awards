 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419043  Rader    This project supported under the technology Development  activity area of the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP),  is designed to develop processes for the manufacturing of  micro surgical knives.  Bulk wet etching of silicon has been  well developed, and recent research interest has focused on  fabricating structural components using semiconductor  processing technology.  In the intermediate size scale of  the proposed surgical scalpels (larger than integrated  circuit features, smaller than traditionally machined  components), silicon is not a structural material.  Previous  research has shown the potential for bulk forming structural  shapes from harder ceramic materials such as sapphire.  The  potential gains from the development of processing for both  commercial and defense related structures will be examined  herein.  %%%  The objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a  growing, integrated, national industrial capability which  provides the most advanced, affordable, military systems and  the most competitive commercial products.  TRP programs are  structured to expand high quality employment opportunities  in commercial and dual-use technologies, manufacturing and  technology assistance to small firms, and education and  training programs that enhance US manufacturing skills and  target displaced defense industry workers.  This specific  project is a joint venture between the personnel at the  Storz Ophthalmic Instruments Company and the Microsurgery  Advanced Design Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Hospital.  ***",
