 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317281  Gabriel       Trypanosomal CRE1 and human L1 are members of the little  understood family of mobile genes known as non-LTR  retrotransposons that are widely distributed in mammals, insects,  plants, trypanosomatids, and fungi.  While evidence suggests that  this class of transposon is involved in such diverse and  fundamental processes as insertional mutagenesis, genetic disease  initiation, pseudogene formation, and genome evolution, almost  nothing is known about the mechanisms by which these elements  transpose other than that they use RNA intermediates.  Most non-  LTR retrotransposons are dispersed throughout their host's  genome.  However, CRE1 and related elements in other trypanosomes  have the unusual feature that they are inserted at a specific,  conserved site within a set of tandemly duplicated genes.  We  propose to utilize a novel yeast expression system to study the  biochemistry of the reverse transcriptase encoded by human L1 and  to identify the basis for CRE1 site-specific insertion.   Accomplishment of our specific aims will advance knowledge of the  mechanisms involved in the replication of this poorly understood  but biologically important class of retrotransposons.  On a  broader scale, the results will be relevant to questions  concerning eukaryotic genome organization and evolution, as well  as the pathogenesis of human genetic disease.  %%%  A variety of transposable genetic elements (\"jumping genes\") are  found within the DNA of all organisms.  Over 10% of human  chromosomal DNA is made up of sequences that were copied from RNA  into DNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT).  This  enzyme, first found in retroviruses, is now known to be essential  for a large class of transposons to copy themselves and move to  new genomic locations.  We have shown that a functional gene for  RT is normally found in human DNA as part of the transposon L1.   We propose to study the biochemical properties of L1 RT to  determine how it recognizes its own sequences and how  it can copy  other RNA back into DNA.  Further, we propose to study an unusual  property of a similar transposon, CRE1, from a protozoan  parasite.  CRE1 is only found inserted in a single region of its  host's chromosomes, and the basis for site-specificity may give  clues to the mechanisms it employs in its jumping.  Our studies  will help elucidate the workings of a poorly understood class of  genetic elements which have been implicated in creating  mutations, causing genetic disease, and stimulating species  evolution.  ***",
