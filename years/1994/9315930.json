The ICP-MS instrument was recently obtained by  Notre Dame University through matching funds from a grant  from the NSF Academic Research Infrastructure Program. It  will be used primarily by students and staff of the  University involved in research and teaching projects in the  area of environmental geochemistry, pollution control,  petrology, paleoclimatology, limnology, and groundwater  hydrology.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory  in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of  researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces, and Archean and Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods for the quantitative  measurement of the isotopes of hafnium.  ***",
