The reversible binding of metal fragments will be evaluated as a route to obtaining complexes of  the higher fullerenes, which will then be structurally characterized. The chemistry of these complexes will be evaluated both to understand fundamental properties and to prepare crystalline polymers which may posses interesting electronic properties. Polyphosphine complexes which contain several metal atoms arranged around an open space within the molecule will be prepared. These will be utilized to explore reactivity both within and outside of these cavities and the ability of the complexes to interact with one another to form new metallomacromolecules will be evaluated.  The fullerenes are a new class of the element carbon in which the  carbon atoms are arranged in ball-like shapes. While the behavior of these species is largely unknown there are hints of interesting electrical and other properties. In this research new derivatives of the fullerenes will be prepared both in order to determine their exact shapes and to explore their chemical properties. It is hoped that new polymeric materials may result form this project. In a separate but related portion of the investigation, cage-like compounds will be prepared in which several metal atoms face an interior void. As chemical reactions which are mediated by metal atoms often require an exposed metal, a comparison of the properties inside the void and  outside the complex will provide valuable information on the exact nature of  exposed metal atoms.",
