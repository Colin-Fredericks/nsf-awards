 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Katharine Hunt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical work which   exploits the properties of the nonlocal polarizability density to find   relationships connecting observable molecular properties such as infrared   intensities, vibrational Raman intensities,  overtone intensities,   electric field shielding tensors, force and anharmonicity constants, and   field gradients at nuclei.  The nonlocal susceptibility tensors describe   the  reaction to changes in the fields due to the nuclei in the same   molecule when the nuclei shift.  She also plans to extend the theory to   cover nonlocal response to inhomogeneous magnetic fields which would then   make it possible to relate chemical shifts to other magnetic properties,   and to increase the information obtainable from magnetic probes of local   chemical environments.    Electromagnetic radiation is the primary probe of microscopic molecular   systems, and most of our knowledge regarding the electronic behavior of   molecules arises from various experimental spectroscopic techniques.    There are a number of quantities which can be observed in spectroscopic   experiments, and we rely on theoretical models to relate these   observations to various molecular properties.   Hunt's research is   uncovering new and important relationships which exist between various   spectroscopic observables.  These relationships further our understanding   of molecular electronic structure, and assist in the interpretation of   experimental spectroscopic data.",
