 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kagan  9322598  The reduction of ubiquinones by electron transport results in the  formation of ubiquinols which donate electrons to phenoxyl radicals  of vitamin E, thereby regenerating the vitamin and conserving its  limited supply.  In the absence of vitamin E (in vitamin E  deficiency), redox-cycling of ubiquinones may result in the  generation of oxygen radicals and oxidative damage of membranes;  these are prooxidant effects of ubiquinones.  We suggest that the  involvement of ubiquinones:  electron transport-dependent  antioxidant function in the presence of vitamin E and prooxidant in  the absence of vitamin E is the subject of this proposal.  The  present proposal is to undertake a limited feasibility study to  determine the limits of sensitivity in detecting phenoxyl radicals  of vitamin E generated from endogenous levels of the vitamin in  microsomal membranes so that the hypothesis can be critically  tested.  An increase in sensitivity and spectral resolution is  expected by using a pulsed Fourier transform ESR spectrometer  recently commissioned at London University.  The instrument will be  used to characterize phenoxyl radicals of vitamin E and possibly  ubisemiquinone radicals and provide preliminary data for use in  drafting a fuyll proposal for NSF funding of a new initiative aimed  to understand the role of coenzyme Q in mechanisms of vitamin E  regeneration in membranes.  %%%  Vitamin E and Coenzyme Q (ubiquinones) are indispensible components  of cellular membranes.  In mitochondria, ubiquinones act as key  elements in energy producing machinery.  We suggest that  ubiquinones have an additional function in mitochondria and other  electron transport membranes: they are involved in membrane  antioxidant protection by interacting with vitamin E.  Vitamin E is  the major lipid-soluble antioxidant of membranes which protects  membranes against oxidative stress.  The reduction of ubiquinones  by electron transport results in the formation of ubiquinols which  can recycle vitamin E  thus conserving its limited supply.  This  antioxidant function of ubiquinones is vitamin E-dependent.   Moreover, in the absence of vitamin E (in vitamin E deficiency),  ubiquinones may be involved in the generation of oxygen radicals  and oxidative damage of membranes.  We suggest that the involvement  of ubiquinones in vitamin E recycling is the major mechanism of the  ubiquinone antioxidant action in electron transport membranes.  An  investigation of these two roles of ubiquinones - as an electron  transport-dependent antioxidant in the presence of vitamin E and as  a prooxidant in the absence of vitamin E - is the subject of this  proposal.  ***",
