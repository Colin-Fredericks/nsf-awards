 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408445  Abello  The problem of supporting interprocessor communication in  massively parallel computers raises two competing issues.  To  avoid bottlenecks in memory access, it may be necessary to  perform hashing; i.e., to randomize the mapping of memory  addresses to their physical locations.  On the other hand, it is  usually more efficient to access long contiguous blocks of memory  than a random set of individual memory locations, and therefore  it is desirable to preserve the physical locality of memory  addresses.  The study of the tradeoffs between these issues has  only recently been initiated.  However, several mathematical  techniques have emerged as possible approaches for the extension  of this research.  This research plans to exploit these  techniques to develop a robust theory of locality and randomness  with applications to the complexity theory of parallel  computation.      ***",
