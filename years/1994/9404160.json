 "awd_abstract_narration": "9494160  Dockery         The investigator studies wave phenomena in several singular  perturbed systems.  The models come from biology and chemistry.   Several  important topics are addressed.  The first topic is to provide  mathematical existence proofs for traveling waves and standing  patterns for these models.  The methods of geometric singular  perturbations are used to ascertain these existence results.   Related  to this topic is the study of the stability and bifurcations of  these  waves and patterns.  Another project is devoted to developing a  predictive model of biofilms.  Some biofilms can serve beneficial  purposes, while others can cause extensive damage in the natural  or  industrial environment.  Understanding the processes and  interactions  occurring in these systems, and formulating conceptual and  mathematical models enable one to control biofilm processes, and  thus  reduce their negative effects or enhance their positive effects.       At present an understanding of wave propagation in  biological and  chemical contexts is quite limited, especially in comparison to  wave  phenomena in other physical systems (water waves, acoustic waves,  etc.).  One reason for this is that the equations are difficult  to  analyze.  These equations typically exhibit a number of different  time  scales, i.e., the systems are singularly perturbed.  Despite  these  difficulties, wave propagation in these systems is a very  important  phenomena.  By way of example, reentrant waves on myocardium are  thought to be the pattern of excitation responsible for  ventricular  tachycardia.  The investigator studies wave phenomena, motivated  by  several problems in biology and chemistry.  Of particular  interest is  biofilm modeling.  In the vernacular, a biofilm might be called  slime  or sludge.  Biofilms occur in nature without human interaction,  or can  artificially be introduced to industrial or natural systems.   Because  of their pervasive effects on water quality, power generation,  energy  eff iciency, and product quality, their negative effect is felt in  most  U.S. industries.  Biofilm processes can also offer distinct  process  advantages, including capacity for higher process throughput,  more  efficient separation/purification, and bioremediation of  hazardous  waste sites.  The potential of biofilm process control has yet  been  fully realized due in part to a lack of fundamental knowledge of  these  processes.",
