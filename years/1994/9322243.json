 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322243  Karlstrom       The goal of this project is to develop a sustainable  undergraduate research program at the University of New Mexico  (UNM).  We will be making research an integral part of our  undergraduate program with a strong emphasis upon recruiting women  and minorities into the sciences.       The proposal has two related components.  First, Junior and  Senior geology majors will conduct geologic research in conjunction  with a faculty mentor.  Second, Hispanic and American Indian  students will be offered jobs by faculty mentors in support of  ongoing research; these jobs will lead towards development of more  independent undergraduate research projects.  Our experience from  past REU projects is that undergraduates are enthusiastic about  solving research problems, but they need this type of close  supervision in order to conduct and complete high quality research.       The unifying concept is to integrate more undergraduate  students into existing interactive departmental research programs.   These include structural geology and tectonics, paleomagnetism,  basin studies, enviornmental geology, planetary sciences and  volcanology.  New Mexico is an ideal site for field-based research  and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences has excellent  analytical facilities to support undergraduate research.  Further,  the University of New Mexico has large numbers of Hispanic and  Native American students and has made a major commitment to  minority education.  Nevertheless, minorities are still under  represented in the sciences.  We feel that an REU site grant can  have a major impact in fostering undergraduate research and  education in general, and in recruiting minorities into the earth  sciences.",
