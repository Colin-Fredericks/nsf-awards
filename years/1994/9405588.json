In our laboratory, the  discovery of 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III  (KAS III) activity has led to new questions about regulation of  fatty acid formation.  We have shown that KAS III is the  predominant mechanism at the start of fatty acid synthesis, but is  it a required step?  To answer this question, we will: (1) analyze  the effect of altered KAS III activity in Arabidopsis thaliana and  other plants.  KAS III expression will be both increased and  decreased in Arabidopsis with antisence and sense constructs of its  cDNA; (2) attempt to identify other KASs and analyze their roles in  synthesis of medium chain fatty acids; and (3) we will determine if  KAS III is capable of interacting with other enzymes of fatty acid  synthase function under in vivo conditions, using a 'two-hybrid'  system to detect protein-protein interaction.  %%%  Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a primary metabolic pathway  that is necessary to provide the fatty acyl components found in the  lipids of membranes and in vegetable oils.  Areas under study are  intended to answer basic questions concerning the regulation and  contribution of individual reactions to this essential pathway.  In  addition, a study will be initiated to probe questions concerning  the molecular organization of this pathway.  What are the basic  reactions of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants and how are they  controlled?  It has been demonstrated by this laboratory that a  reaction caused by the enzyme 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein  synthase, or KAS III, is the predominant route for beginning the  process of fatty acid synthesis.  But whether this in a required  reaction has not been proved. One approach to find an answer is to  study how KAS III operates inside the cell during fatty acid  formation.  It appears that many of t he enzymes that are involved  in fatty acid formation group together and form large, operational  complexes.  As a result, it is believed that the essential role for  KAS III, or other KAS-type enzymes, in fatty acid formation will  become clearer if these enzymes also associate themselves in the  same fatty acid producing enzyme aggregations.  ***",
