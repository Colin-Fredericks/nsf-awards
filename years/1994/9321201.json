 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321201  Liu  The proposal is to explore experimentally the rich phase behavior  exhibited in a confined colloidal suspension, a monodisperse  ferrofluid (oil-in-water) emulsion.  An externally applied magnetic  field induces a large magnetic moment in each droplet, leading to  a transition of the suspension from a fluid-like phase to a more  ordered phase.  The various phases can consist of separated chains,  ordered columns, or a complex labyrinthine pattern.  The evolution  of the structure that forms, and its dependence on various key  parameters will be investigated.  These field induced structures  dramatically modify the viscosity of the fluid, making this system  an ideal model for a magnetorheological fluid.  Thus the results  are expected to lead to new insight into the fascinating phase  behavior of these systems and provide guidelines for making  technologically important materials with fundamentally new  properties.  %%%  The proposal is to experimentally explore the phase behavior of a  suspension of small droplets of oil immersed in water.  Each oil  droplet is uniform in size and contains thousands of tiny floating  magnets.  An externally applied magnetic field reorients the tiny  magnets so that each droplet acts like a big magnet.  This causes  the droplets to line up into chains such that the suspension  undergoes a phase transition.  These field-induced new phases  modify the viscosity of the fluid dramatically, turning the liquid  into a solid which may lead to the development of actively  controlled shock absorbers and clutches for cars or robotic joint  controls.  This research is to study the field-induced structural  change of these systems and to provide guidelines for making  technologically important materials with fundamentally new  properties.  ***",
