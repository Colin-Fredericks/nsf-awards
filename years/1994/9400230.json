 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400230  Semmes       The proposed research involves a combination of harmonic  analysis and geometric measure theory that is somewhat  complicated. Conventionally one likes to ask questions about the  relationship between the geometry of a set in a Euclidean space  and the analysis of functions and linear operators associated to  this set. One can also consider the geometry and complexity of  sets in Euclidean spaces for their own sake, and look for methods  to detect when a set has some nice interesting structure, e.g.,  when it can be parametrized in a nice way with estimates. For  this latter endeavor harmonic analysis has a slightly  indirect relevance, by providing guidance for what \"interesting  structure\" might mean, as well as useful techniques. However,  many of the traditional tools of harmonic analysis do not apply  in this inherently nonlinear setting, and in fact there are  results in the geometric setting whose counterparts in classical  analysis are false.       The  work  of  Semmes involves the  interplay   between measure  theory, geometry and analysis. Given a set of  points  in space, one can ask whether it can be measured. In the  case  of  a one  dimensional  set, this is the question  of   whether  it  has finite  length. This can be a very subtle  question  in  analysis. Classical  answers to this question often  involve boundedness  of certain  operations on spaces of  functions on the  set.  In  this project answers to the question  of \"measurability\" will be sought where  the  classical  approaches cannot work. This  will  involve replacing  the  classical operations by more complicated nonlinear operations.  ***",
