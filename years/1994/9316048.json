Little is  known about the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction  processes in plants, where a variety of hormonal and  environmental signals affect development, maturation and  senescence.  Biochemical analyses suggested that G-proteins  are also involved in the signal transduction processes in  plants.  During the previous granting period the GPA1 gene  (the alpha subunit encoding gene of  the heterotrimeric G  protein) was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, sequenced  and its expression investigated.  since the gene was  expressed in most organs during development, and its level  of expression was high in rapidly dividing cells, in cells  of young organs and nutrient transmitting cells, it was  suggested that the product of this gene is required for cell  division.  Investigations with transgenic plants further  suggested the role of the alpha subunit of the G-protein in  the regulation of differentiation during development.  In  the present proposal experiments are described to further  test the role of the G-protein in cellular regulation with  transgenic plants, on identification and characterization of  proteins that interact with the GPA1 gene, end of the  isolation of the genes encoding these proteins.  These  experiments are the logical continuation of the work, and if  successful, will provide detailed information about the  function of GPA1 in plant cells.  %%%  Dr. Ma's laboratory has successfully studied in the past the  role of G-protein in the development of plant cells,  including the spatial and temporal expression of the GPA1  gene in developing plants, in transgenic plants containing  various constructs of the GPA1 gene, immunolocalization of  the gene product in cells and mapping of the GPA1 gene.  In  the present study he will focus on the analysis of GPA1 gene  function in transgenic plants and in tissue cultures, on the  in vitro analysis of the GPA1  function and interacting  proteins, and will isolate the genes which encode components  of the GPA1 mediated signaling pathway.  He will carry out  some of these experiments in collaboration with others.  These studies will add enormously to our understanding of  plant signaling responses.  The PI's laboratory is very good  at producing the genetic materials and tools that are needed  for success in this work.  Dr. Ma is clearly an emerging  leader in the signal transduction area.  ***",
