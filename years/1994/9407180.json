 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many families of graphs including interval graphs,  permutation  graphs, trapezoid graphs, and co-comparability graphs demonstrate  a  type of linear ordering on their vertex sets.  It is precisely  this linear  order that is exploited, in one form or another, in a  search for efficient  algorithms for these classes of graphs.  The  classes mentioned are known to  have wide-ranging practical  applications.  In addition, they are all  subfamilies of the class  of graphs called the asteroidal triple-free graphs  (AT-free  graphs, for short).  In spite of some encouraging first steps,  the  structure of the AT-free graphs is not well understood.  In  particular, no  efficient recognition algorithm is available.  This research effort  investigates the AT-free graphs using the  powerful tool of graph decomposition,  with the intention to  reveal new structural properties of AT-free graphs that  can be  exploited to obtain efficient sequential and parallel algorithms.  The  results provide a unifying look and a  common  algorithmic base from which to investigate the four  classes of graphs mentioned  above.",
