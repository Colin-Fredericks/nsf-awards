By contrast, when an actor and a target person belong  to different social categories on one dimension but are members  of the same category on a second dimension, such crossed clues  for ingroup/outgroup identity sometimes reduce intergroup bias in  comparison to that found with convergent cues for outgroup  membership. Six specific patterns regarding the relative bias  toward double ingroup, crossed, and double outgroup targets have  emerged in prior research. This research invokes principles  related to affective arousal, cognitive sources of variation in  category salience, and the structure of the setting, to explain  when each pattern will be found. The current studies assess these  theoretical principles in the context of impression formation  tasks, and in ingroup interaction settings. Key measures include  self-reports of liking, perceived similarity, and reward  allocations toward ingroup, crossed, and outgroup targets, as  well behavioral preferences for interacting with different types  of targets. Electromyographic measures (EMG) of non-visible  movement in facial muscles that control the smile and the frown  (furrowing of the brow) will assess non-voluntary positive and  negative affect respectively. This is important in studies that  use targets who are members of racial-ethnic groups because  current norms for our college age subjects invoke a masking of  expression of negative attitudes toward ethnic minority groups on  the paper and pencil measures typically used in laboratory   research. Results from the proposed research will be useful for  structuring more effective intergroup contact interventions and  for reducing intergroup conflict. Intergroup hostility and  conflict across racial-ethnic gender, and other important  dimensions of social category differentiation (e.g. age) can be a  source of misplaced energy in the work setting, contributing to  lowered productivity. The outcomes of the proposed research can  add to the development of a set of rules for structuring work  settings so as to minimize this source of diminished  productivity.",
