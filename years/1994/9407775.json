 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will help the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa Barbara acquire an upgrade of  an existing 500 MHz spectrometer which will be used in research.  The research activity to be  supported include:  studies of the development of sequence specific catalysts for the  hydrolysis of dialkyl-phosphate linkages in DNA and RNA, the synthesis and study of  mimics of heme-containing enzymes, the characterization of siderophores and other metal-  containing compounds produced by marine bacteria, synthesis of new materials that have  high therapeutic potential, and the elucidation of the structure and dynamics of proteins  and other structures of biological importance.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in  biology.",
