The goal is to introduce  students to the community of mathematical scholars through a  series of student and faculty lectures accessible to audiences  with a broad range of experience and expertise.  Special efforts  will be made to ensure an agenda which includes activities  focusing on first and second year students who may not have had  exposure to higher level mathematical concepts.        The principal speaker, Professor John Conway of Princeton  University, while renown for his mathematical erudition, also has  an international reputation as a speaker and advocate of  mathematics to the general public.  Additional speakers, faculty  and students from the host institution and nearby colleges, will  also address the conference. It is expected that this activity,  perhaps the first of its kind, will be repeated on a continuing  basis.   ***",
