 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321371  Drueckhammer  This project will use synthetic Coenzyme A (CoA) analogs to study  fundamental mechanistic questions in enzyme catalyzed reactions of CoA esters.  This work  is based on methodology developed in the P.I.'s lab for the convenient synthesis of CoA/CoA  ester analogs.  The largest effort will be directed at probing the involvement of enolate and/or  enol intermediates in enzyme catalyzed reactions of acetyl-CoA and other CoA esters.  Stable  analogs of the enolate and enol forms of acetyl-CoA will be prepared, and studied as  inhibitors of citrate synthase. The protonation state of these analogs in  isotopically enriched  form bound to the enzyme will be studied by NMR and in some cases FTIR.  Similar studies  will be conducted with related enzymes, including malate synthase, crotonase, and  acetyl-CoA dependent acetyltransferases.  This project is expected to provide new insights  into the enzyme catalyzed reactions of CoA esters and general principles of enzyme reaction  mechanisms.  %%%  Dr. Drueckhammer will study the reactions of enzymes which require Coenzyme A for their  function.  Enzymes are catalysts which carry out chemical reactions in biological systems.   Understanding how these enzymes function is at the heart of understanding biological  processes at a fundamental chemical level.  About 4% of all enzymes require coenzyme A  (CoA) for their catalytic activity.  CoA serves as a reactant or a reactant carrier in these  enzymatic reactions. CoA is also synthesized in biological systems by a series of enzyme  catalyzed reactions. In previous work in this lab, a method was developed for using the  enzymes which make CoA to make altered forms (analogs) of natural CoA.  This research  will use this method to make a series of CoA analogs designed to serve as probes for  studying the reactions of CoA  utilizing enzymes. This will help reveal how enzymes form  chemical bonds to make complex biological molecules from simple building blocks, and how  enzymes break down com plex compounds in food to produce biological energy.  ***",
