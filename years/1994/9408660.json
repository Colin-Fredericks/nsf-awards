 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot field experiment will determine the effects of  variations in natural and anthropogenic cloud condensation nuclei  (CCN) on marine stratus cloud droplet size distributions in the  Canary Islands.  The hypothesis to be tested is that increases in  CCN numbers, caused by transport of anthropogenic and natural  aerosols from Europe and Africa, contrasted to the natural marine  situation, will cause a systematic shift to smaller droplet sizes.   Although previous work has demonstrated that anthropogenic aerosols  have affected cloud microphysics, in case studies, such effects  have not been shown to be significant climatologically on a global  scale, nor have specific sources of CCN been identified in a remote  region.  To justify the assertion that the interaction between  pollution aerosols and clouds is altering climate, ie., to  demonstrate the Twomey Effect, it is necessary to show that a  significant portion of the observed variance of the cloud droplet  size distribution under background conditions is caused by  pollution-derived CCN.       This experiment will be conducted at Tenerife in the Canary  Islands, where wide variations in natural and anthropogenic CCN are  expected, where an existing AEROCE sampling station is located, in  the region where the ACE-2 (Aerosol Characterization Experiment) is  planned.  Marine boundary-layer stratus clouds will be sampled near  could base at a ground-based, elevated site.  The droplet number  and size distribution will be monitored continuously using a PMS-  CSASP-100-HV probe (2 to 95 um dia.), and discrete droplet samples  will be collected for detailed chemical analysis.  The cloud-water  chemistry will be used as a surrogate for the chemical composition  of the pre-cloud CCN.  The relative effects of anthropogenic and  natural sources on variations in droplet size distributions will be  identified using receptor modeling.  Aerosol chemistry from the  AEROCE Izania Observatory (2600m) will be compared with the cloud  chemistry of m arine stratus.",
