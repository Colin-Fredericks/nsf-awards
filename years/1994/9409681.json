The project will first examine  factors that affect the accuracy of testimony by an adult witness  regarding a child's statements, focusing particularly on the  effects of witness preconceptions and on the ability of the witness  to take into account the effects of suggestive techniques used in  interviewing children.  Sesondly, the study will test the ability  of people to evaluate the testimony of the adult hearsay witnesses,  focusing on whether they take into account factors known to  influence the reliability of hearsay witnesses.      These studies cast light on important theoretical issues concerning  the accuracy of cascaded inference in jurisprudence.  They will  also have considerable practical value by illuminating the  cognitive factors that underly the ability of people to evaluate  the accuracy of hearsay evidence.  ***",
