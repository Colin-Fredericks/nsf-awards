 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shared memory computation model provides an attractive  alternative to the message passing model such that the techniques  learned from parallel computations can be applied to distributed  computation problems.  In a distributed environment, node failures  are more often than in a tightly-coupled multiprocessor system due  to man-made downtime.  The fault recovery issue should be dealt  with in order to make the shared memory computation model feasible  for distributed environments.    The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a low overhead  concurrent checkpointing scheme with a controllable checkpoint  interval and no global synchronization; (2) to design a recoverable  distributed shared memory system based on the new checkpointing  scheme; (3) to build an experimental system to examine the  engineering issues related to building such systems; (4) to  evaluate different checkpointing schemes, with benchmark  applications; and (5) to explore potential distributed  applications, based on shared memory computations.",
