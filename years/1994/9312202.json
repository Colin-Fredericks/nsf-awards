There has been much controversy in this  area because children are often the only witnesses to events  resulting in criminal charges that identify them as victims, and  they are frequently in the middle of bitter divorce cases.  The  courts have made procedural rulings but the scientific basis for  these rulings has been challenged.  This research will provide some  answers to some questions in this complex field by examining the  extent to which childrens' memories are susceptible to suggestion  and the effectiveness of investigative techniques.  The research  will not exhaust the questions to be examined or the different  methodological approaches that might be used, but it represents a  solid beginning in an important area of psychology and law.    The project is comprised of three experimental studies involving  pre-school age children: (1) childrens' capacity to distinguish in  memory between true and false events, (2) childrens' recollection  of stressful events after a series of interviews about them,  including the use of anatomical dolls, and (3) the effects, on the  accuracy of childrens' testimony and on jurors' perceptions of  their credibility, of shielding children from the alleged  perpetrator during testimony.  This research will make an important  empirical and theoretical contribution to scientific knowledge  about childrens' reports, and a significant contribution to sound  legal practice and the reliability of legal processes.  ***",
