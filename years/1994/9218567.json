 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218567  Phillips  Natural bacteria on and near roots contribute to plant growth, but  little is known about how particular bacterial species form  communities in the rhizosphere.  Therefore, it is important to  clarify the molecular basis of plant-microbe signaling and define  its role in bacterial growth, survival, and colonization of roots.   Recent results show that small quantities of certain plant  compounds regulate transcription of genes required for infection by  Rhizobium and Agrobacterium bacteria.  It is postulated that other  plant-induced genes in these bacteria control earlier stages of  root colonization and that homologous genes are present in other  rhizosphere microbes.  This project will use Rhizobium and  Agrobacterium as models to find novel plant-regulated genes that  are important for understanding broader issues of rhizosphere  biology.  By moving beyond the well-studied nodulation and  virulence genes in these organisms, it is hoped to build a basis  for future research on rhizosphere ecology.  This project  specifically will 1) define chemical structures of plant signals  that induce genes in soil bacteria, 2) isolate novel bacterial  genes responding to the compounds, 3) deduce signal transduction  pathways, and 4) assess the importance of the molecules as  regulators of microbial colonization in the soil.  These goals will  be achieved by identifying natural signals from alfalfa (Medicago  sativa L.) which induce transcription of random bioluminescence  (lux) gene fusions in R. meliloti and A. tumefaciens.  The tools  and experience for this project are available in the complementary  programs of the three co-principal investigators.  D. A. Phillips  has studied Rhizobium-legume interactions for many years and uses  modern methods to isoate and identify compounds involed in that  symbiosis.  Drs. Kado and de Bruijn are experienced microbial  geneticists with major research programs on Agrobacterium and  Rhizobium.  This project will define in molecular terms how alfa lfa  controls root colonization by two model soil microbes, and it will  develop information and tools required for testing detailed  hypotheses on physiological processes that structure microbial  communities in the rhizosphere.  This is a collaborative research  project with Dr. de Bruijn at Michigan State University.  ***",
