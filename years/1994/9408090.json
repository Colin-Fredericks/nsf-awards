 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on propositional proof systems, Boolean  complexity, and parallel/sequential computable functionals of higher types.  The project specifically concerns: (1) upper and  lower bounds for the number of  symbols in proofs of various combinatorial statements for an extension of  resolution called  cutting planes, originating in operations research, as well  as  for related prepositional logics (logics of approximate reasoning  or  threshold logics, logics with the bi-conditional, with modular  counting gates,  etc.); (2) the relation between the parallel complexity of a language L and the  algebraic structure of so-called invariance groups and extended invariance  groups  corresponding to L (structure of invariance groups of regular and  context free languages, structure of extended invariance groups  of fast  parallel computable languages, invariance groups of  monotonic versus  non-monotonic boolean functions, relation to  Krohn-Rhodes semi-group theory);  and (3) the study of variants of the scheme of bounded primitive recursion  applied to higher type  functionals (functions whose arguments may be  functions), and the  study of parallel computable real valued functions.   This  research applies techniques from complexity theory, proof theory (mathematical  logic), combinatorics and finite group  theory.  Initial experimental studies of  extended invariance  groups will be done using a parallel computer.  The goal of  this  research is to increase our understanding of low level parallel complexity   and associated logics with long term possible  applications in logic programming,   database update methods, VLSI  design, and programming language design.",
