 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hooper  9316906  In soils, fertilizer ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NH3 + 1.5 02->  HNO2 + H2) by the chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacterium  Nitrosomonas europaea.. Nitrite is oxidized by Nitrobacter to  nitrate, a primary source of N for food protein in non-leguminous  crops.  Of great economic transformation of most food nitrogen is  carried out by Nitrosomonas.  Of great economic importance is loss  of N in soils as N-gases produced by Nitrosomonas during oxidation  of NH3 or by reduction of nitrate by denitrifying bacteria.   Control of agricultural loss by denitrification is attempted by the  use of inhibitors of ammonia oxidation by Nitrosomonas.  This gives  significance to improved knowledge of the mechanism of oxidation of  ammonia.  NH3 is oxygenated by O2 to NH2OH which is then oxidized (NH2OH +  H20-> HN02 + 4e- + 4H+) by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase  \"HAO\".  HAO is a large and unusually complex hemoprotein (7 c-hemes  and 1 substrate binding.  \"P460\" group per 63 kDa protein).  Four  electron pass from HAO to a tetraheme cytochrome c-554.  Two  electrons pass from cytochrome c-554 in a separate electron  transfer chain to the ammonia oxidizing reaction.  Two additional  electrons pass to a membrane terminal oxidase, a dissimilatory  nitrite reductase (during growth at low oxygen), to an ATP-  dependent NAD reductase or a peroxidase (to scavange peroxide).  The goal of this project is the analysis of the enzyme HAo.  We  intend to determine details of the structure of HAO with particular  attention to the active site and mechanism of turnover.  The  approach involves optical spectroscopy, peptide analysis, kinetics,  suicide substrates, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,  Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic analysis.  %%%  The soil and water bacterium, Nitrosomonas, is critical to the  cycle of nitrogen in nature, to the production of a greenhouse and  ozone destroying gas, to nitrogen availability in agriculture and  in the degradation of chlori nated pollutants.  This project is  involved in the study of the structure of the biological catalyst  which enables the organism to perform those roles.  The enzyme  oxidizes one of the nitrogenous intermediates, hydroxylamine, to  nitrite.  Is called hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.  We intend to complete the determination of the structure of the  enzyme.  Then, by studying changes in the color of groups on the  enzyme and by measuring the production of intermediate compounds by  chemical means, we will find out how it is able to act as a  catalyst for this unusual reaction.  ***",
