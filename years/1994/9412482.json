These YIPs are part of a larger series of programs  designed to initiate multi-disciplinary, collaborative research  among the new generation of scientists in the United States,  Central Europe, and the former Soviet Union, in fields of  national and global significance.  Each VIP consists of a two-  year summer program for ten American and ten foreign specialists.   Each program phase is three weeks in length, with one summer  session in the foreign country and the other in the United  States.  The NRC selects an interdisciplinary team of American  specialists through a national competition.  To be eligible,  American applicants must have received their Ph.D. since 1986.   The foreign specialists are chosen by carefully identified  foreign counterpart organizations.  These three YIPs began in  summer 1993 and will conclude with a three-week program in the  United States in summer 1994.  The U.S. Department of State has  provided support to cover the costs associated with the American  participants in the second phase.  ***",
