Four primary research sites and  several different secondary sites are being studied. Ocracoke, an  Outer Banks island community settled in the early 1700s and still  inaccessible by automobile, was selected for detailed  sociolinguistic and ethnographic study. This variety is compared  with the speech of two other Outer Banks communities which are  now accessible by automobile, Harkers Island and Hatteras, as  well as a contiguous mainland costal community, Beaufort, North  Carolina. Data from these sites are, in turn, compared with  previously collected data from other types of historically-  isolated areas, including the Appalachian and Ozark mountains,  and the Eastern Shore dialect area of Smith Island off the coast  of Maryland. Data sources consist of a set of cross-generational  sociolinguistic interviews being conducted in the four primary  dialect areas, a set of previously collected oral history  interviews providing for time-depth studies, a set of interviews  conducted in connection with sociolinguistic studies in other  historically-isolated situations, and a limited set of earlier  written historical records reflecting Outer Banks varieties of  the 1700 and 1800s.        The particular set of socio-historical circumstances that  combined to create the prototypical quasi-isolated island  community makes it ideal for the empirically-based examination of  general sociolinguistic principles relating to dialect contact,  assimilation, and change. This study also provides an important  basis for examining assumptions related to the apparent time  construct and the critical intersection of social and linguistic  structures in the description and explanation of language  variation and change.  ***",
