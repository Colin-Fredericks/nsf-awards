The Linda programming language construct  support various models parallelism and are supported by a variety  of base languages. In particular Joyce and C will be supported. The  laboratory would be devoted to a course in parallel and distributed  algorithm development. This course is based on the ACM-IEEE course  AL9 as part of its 1991 computing curricula. During class time,  students would individually view demonstrations of parallel  algorithms using a windowed environment to simulate several  different architectures. Students would be able to individually  view the algorithms at their own pace. Outside of class, students  would write their own parallel and distributed algorithms, using  Linda. Projects and demonstrations would make use of Linda's  graphical debugging tool to view simultaneously the entire state of  all processes as well as the data movement. Labs would be developed  and made available which could be used at other institutions to  teach their own parallel and distributed programming courses.",
