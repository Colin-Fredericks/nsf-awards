The  development of exhibitions and enhancement activities is  based on the Science Framework for California Public Schools  and the emerging National Science Education Standards.  The  project includes:     A series of four museum exhibitions (with a total of 60     exhibits) based on the Science Framework themes of     Patterns of Change, Stability, Scale and Structure, and     Systems and Interactions     Publications (Exhibit Guides and Pathways) for each     collection     A series of workshops and evening events for teachers,     families and students     A symposium, video and Internet resource for museum and     education professionals         An important feature is an information desk and  resource kiosk to inform teachers, parents and the general  public about science education reform efforts.  The project  aims at 5,000 teachers, 32,000 parents and caregivers,  140,000 students and 1,320,000 members of the general  public.  ***",
