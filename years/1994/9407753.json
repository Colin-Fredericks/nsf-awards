The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Terri A. Williams to work with Dr. Gerd B.  Muller at the University of Vienna on the development and  evolution of crustacean limbs.    The relationship between the development and evolution of  limb morphology has been explored mostly by comparing  cellular mechanisms responsible for generating vertebrate  limbs and by dissecting the role of patterning molecules in  early Drosophila embryology.  Dr. Williams proposes to  bridge these two approaches by examining crustacean limb  development.  Little is known about the cellular mechanisms  that form limbs in arthropods.  Much of the patterning found  in Drosophila may be unique to an animal that undergoes  radical change in form and during metamorphosis develops  adult limbs  from small pockets of epithelial cells.  She  will look for underlying themes of limb development by  directly comparing the cellular mechanisms involved in the  formation and proliferation of different crustacean limb  morphologies.  ***",
