The seminar  is co-organized by Professor Ronald Latanision,  Department of Materials Science and  Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, and Professor Koji Hashimoto,  Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku  University, Sendai, Japan.  Several new and  advanced materials will be discussed at the  meeting, including amorphous alloys,  composites, coatings, electronic materials, and  intermetallic alloys.  The speakers will focus  on the environmental degradation of such  materials.    The objective of the seminar is to understand  the present status of new materials known to  have high resistance against environmental  attack, and the environmental characteristics  of other new materials that have attractive  physical and chemical properties but whose  chemical behavior must be determined before  such materials may be used in service.  The  seminar brings together leaders in the  corrosion science and engineering communities  (university, industry, and national  laboratories) from both countries to establish  a shared research agenda that will lead to more  timely and effective introduction of new  materials into engineering systems that serve  society throughout the world.  ***",
