Students will be introduced to  state-of-the-art technologies that currently play such an important  role in neuroscience research. The main idea underlying this course  is to develop these techniques around interesting scientific  questions that will teach the students about the fundamental  organization of the CNS, and about the process of doing science.  This course will become one of the focal points for an  undergraduate neuroscience and behavior \"concentration\" within the  university. In recent years, the philosophy of life science  education at the University of Massachusetts is shifting from a  \"textbook\" science education for undergraduates to a more hands-on  approach.  The proposed laboratory course will be part of a more  extensive research experience for undergraduates. Our long range  goal is to create an integrated training curriculum that would  attract undergraduates to careers in biology in general and to  neuroscience in particular. The requested equipment will serve the  formal laboratory in one semester, will serve other courses in the  neuroscience concentration, and will be the center of an honors  laboratory and Research Experience for Undergraduates during the  summer and intersession.",
