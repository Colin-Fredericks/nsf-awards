The Tri-College Consortium comprises Sweet Briar  College, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, and Lynchburg College.   VERnet, the mid-level network offering services in Virginia, will  provide operations management and information services and it  will give the consortium 3 56 thousand bits per second  connections to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits  per second) National Backbone network.    Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  By  linking to the mid-level and national networks the Tri-College  Consortium's faculty and academics will maintain a position of  leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting  from remote access to super computer centers, data bases and  information services, high speed communications, file transfer  and remote login, and access to library resources. This is also a  unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources.",
