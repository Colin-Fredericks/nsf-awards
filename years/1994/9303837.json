Using a superconducting split-coil magnet  system capable of generating magnetic fields up to 13T, high-  resolution x-ray scattering experiments will be performed on  compounds exhibiting spin-Peierls and spin-density wave phases at  low temperatures.  Phenomena to be investigated include field-  induced nonmagnetic-magnetic transition in insulating and  conducting spin-Peierls systems, the effect of magnetic fields on  the structure of semimetallic charge density wave compounds, and  possible magnetostructural effects in field induced spin density  wave phases.  The structural information derived from these  experiments will contribute to a quantitative understanding in  correlated quasi-one dimensional electron systems.  In particular,  the microscopic origin of field-induced transitions in such  compounds will be clarified.  %%%  This project will develop a unique facility which combines high-  precision x-ray structure facilities with a very high magnetic  field in which samples can be cooled to ultralow temperatures.  In  the presence of a magnetic field, the structural, magnetic and  electronic properties change and new phases of the materials are  encountered.  The nature of these phase changes is not well  understood, and essentially no prior experiments have been  performed, owing to lack of facilities.  The results of the  research will be of fundamental importance to the fields of  magnetism and electronic properties of materials.  ***",
