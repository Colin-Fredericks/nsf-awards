 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413322 Hwang  This project seeks to achieve an understanding of  the relationship between kinetic roughening and native defect  formation in wide-gap II-VI semiconductors.  Kinetic roughening  results from the stochastic nature of the growth process and may  lead to loss of control over surface stoichiometry.  Research  towards the construction of a kinetic phase diagram that correlates  the degree of roughening and growth parameters will be conducted.   Such a diagram allows various growth conditions to be  systematically explored so that optimal growth parameters can be  identified.  The application of statistical physics and surface  physics to the study of defect formation is expected to provide new  insight into the issue of dopant compensation as well as the  kinetic processes on growing surfaces. %%% This project addresses  the issue of dopant compensation in wide-gap II-VI semiconductors  from a surface physics point of view.  The goal of the research is  to establish a relationship between kinetic roughening and dopant  incorporation for a class of materials that are being employed to   develop blue semiconductor lasers.  Currently, doping control  remains to be the main challenge, and it is expected that the  results of this research will have an impact on the fabrication of  these devices, and will contribute to improving the general  perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in  computing, information processing, and tele communica tions.",
