 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to increase our understanding  of the mechanisms of social recognition and perception at  the behavioral level of analysis.  Since this particular  project involves communication by odors, another goal is to  increase our understanding of the functions and mechanisms  of the olfactory system.  Recent biological theory has  emphasized the importance of the individual organism in the  process of evolution, yet we still know very little about  the mechanisms of individual recognition and species  similarities and differences in the perception of  individuals and knowledge of individuals.  This project will  investigate some surprising new phenomena that suggest that  animals have specialized perceptual and/or cognitive  strategies to discover a wide variety of information about  other individuals by investigation of the complex arrays of  scents that are left behind in the environment.  These  discoveries suggest entirely new processes of olfactory  perception and consequently of neural mechanisms underlying  these processes.  Furthermore, characterization of these  strategies should provide insight into the features or  aspects of individuals that have proven to be important for  animals to know about, and therefore that have been  important in the evolution of their behavior and of modules  in the brain to accomplish this kind of social knowledge.  These experiments have importance for at least three domains  of science, and may well have some practical applications in  the future.  First, they will be important for our  understanding of animal behavior, in particular about how  scent is used to regulate social interactions, but more  generally about social recognition, territoriality, dominant  subordinate interactions, mate choice, and competition for  mates and other resources.  The results may have practical  implications for how to maintain healthy animals in  captivity in zoos, labs, and as pets, and it could well be  important in wildlife management in these  times of shrinking  reserves for wildlife.  Second, it is important for  understanding higher-order, cognitive processes in the sense  of smell.  Third, the results should contribute to our  knowledge and understanding of social recognition processes  in humans and other species, processes that are gaining  increasing attention in areas such as cognitive  neuroscience, artificial intelligence, machine and/or  computer recognition processes, and security and law  enforcement (e.g., evidence from dogs or other animals about  the identity of the perpetrator of a crime).",
