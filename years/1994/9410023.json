 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410023  Schrodt      This project extends and demonstrates the use of software for the  automated coding of political event data.  Event data are  generated by coding news reports for specific types of political  interactions:  meetings, agreements, threats, military  engagements, etc.  These data can then be used to test hypotheses  about political behavior.  Historically, human coders created  event data.  Earlier work supported in part by the NSF's Data  Development in International Relations project demonstrated,  however, that machine coding is capable of assigning event data  codes to wire service reports of political events with a  reliability at least as great as that achieved by human coders.   The initial machine-coding system was tested by generating an 11-  year event data set based on Reuters news service reports for the  Middle East.  These data produced statistical results almost  indistinguishable from those produced from human-coded data.  The  data set and the machine-coding program have been available to  political science researchers for the past two years; the system  runs on conventional microcomputers.    The current project will extend this research in three ways.   First, the project will develop an integrated data acquisition  and coding system to code event data in real time.  These data  will be made available on an Internet server for use by other  researchers.  This system will provide a significant improvement  over existing human-coded event data, which typically are not  available until years after events have occurred.   Second, the  project will enhance the machine coding program in several ways  that have been suggested by research experience with the program.   Finally, the project will use the machine-coded data to study two  cases of complex political behavior:  the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict and the ECOWAS international subsystem in West Africa.   These two cases are designed to demonstrate the use of the full  capabilities of machine coding, particula rly the facility for re-  coding texts to detect political activities that may have been  missed in the standard event coding systems.    In addition to developing techniques for event data analysis,  these studies will contribute to understanding the interactions  between the international and domestic political systems.",
