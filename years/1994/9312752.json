 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators continue work to develop numerical methods  for solving problems of flows in porous media and to develop and  analyze fast algorithms for partial differential equations, for  computational fluid dynamics, and for several linear algebra  problems.  Specifically, they (a) develop fast parallel numerical  methods for the solution of the Boltzmann equation used to model  the transport of neutral and charged particles in 1 and 3 spatial  dimensions; (b) develop multilevel zonal techniques for large  scale computational fluid dynamics applications on parallel  computers; (c) study discretization and solution techniques for  fluid flows in porous media that involve complex geometry with  heterogeneous material properties; (d) develop a new methodology  for the solution of systems of partial differential equations by  introducing new dependent variables and forming a least-squares  functional.  In each case, they exploit and extend multi-level  computational techniques.         These projects are focused on important applications, such as  calculating radiation doses for cancer treatment, ion implantation  for semiconductor development, global weather modeling, fluid flow  over airfoils and through rocket nozzles, oil recovery and  contaminant transport in subsurface water supplies.  They reflect  the growing recognition that effective numerical modeling of  physical phenomena involves several stages - formulation of the  mathematical model, transforming the model into a discrete  problem, and developing algorithms for the numerical solution of  the discrete problem on advanced computers - none of which should  be attempted without consideration for the others.  Each project  examines all components of the process, reformulating the model  and discretization when necessary to yield discrete problems that  can be efficiently  solved numerically on parallel computers.",
