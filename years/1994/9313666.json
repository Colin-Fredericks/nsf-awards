 "awd_abstract_narration": "Medical ultrasound works by illuminating the body's interior with short, high frequency sound pulses, receiving the echoes, processing them numerically, and displaying the moving image in real-time on a CTR screen.  The heart of ultrasound is a rather sophisticated composite transducer.  With this sophistication, conventional design methods are approaching practical limits of effectiveness.  Comprehensive computer modeling is seen as the answer.  The industry is currently using frequency-domain finite element codes exclusively, with limited success due in part to the transient character of the signals modeled.  A much better alternative is explicit time-domain simulation.  In our Phase I project we developed and validated such a time-domain finite element code, FLEX, for transient analysis of piezoelectric transducers and general wave propagation.  It includes complete and operational piezoelectric, acoustic, and elastic elements.  the Proposed Phase II project will extend and tailor the code to the very special needs of practicing design engineers.  This research and development is essential if we are to achieve the technical and marketing potential of this computer modeling system during the present window of opportunity.  We are working with ultrasound companies in order to guide these usage enhancements.",
