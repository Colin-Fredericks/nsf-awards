 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413843  BENNER           Research on the sources and reactions of dissolved organic  matter (DOM) in seawater will focus primarily on the 20-30% of  total dissolved organic matter which can be gently isolated in  relatively large amounts by tangential-flow ultrafiltration.  The  three central objectives of research are:     1.   To identify the biological sources and transformations of the       major DOM components.    2.   To elucidate compositional trends among DOM constituents of       different size.    3.   To characterize in detail the compositions and associations of       the various organic materials comprising seawater DOM.         Research to determine the biological and diagenetic origins of  DOM will emphasis rapid processes occurring in the upper column  where large differences in DOM concentrations and compositions are  observed.  A better understanding of compositional trends among  dissolved organic materials of different size will help to  delineate processes affecting DOM cycling and to judge how  representative ultrafiltered isolates are of bulk DOM. More  detailed characterizations of the compositions and forms of  ultrafiltered DOM will aid in distinguishing its biological  sources, identifying key transformations, and deconvoluting  functional relationships among DOM constituents. This line of  research has already provided new insights on both the reactive and  refractory components of the immense seawater DOM pool and should  continue to yield information useful over a wide range of  oceanographic studies.",
