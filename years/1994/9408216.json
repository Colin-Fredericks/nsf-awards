 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408216  Feder    Almost all organisms synthesize a number of characteristic  proteins in response to high temperatures and other stresses;  these are termed \"stress proteins\" or \"heat-shock protein\". In  the laboratory, improved resistance to stress coincides with the  synthesis of these proteins. At present, major gaps in scientific  knowledge include: (1) Whether the conditions that induce these  proteins in the laboratory are ever encountered in nature; (2)  Whether the proteins are adaptive under natural conditions; (3)  How these proteins actually improve resistance to stress. This  project will contribute to the filling of these gaps by examining  strains of fruit flies (Drosophila) that have been genetically  engineered to synthesize very different levels of a key stress  protein, hsp70. The project first will document natural exposure  of wild Drosophila to two likely stresses (temperature and  ethanol), and measure corresponding hsp70 concentrations in these  organisms. Next, it will use this information to design  laboratory experiments in which Drosophila strains differing in  hsp70 expression undergo exposure to each stress. After first  confirming that the expected differences in hsp70 actually occur  under experimental conditions, the project will assess the  consequences of differential hsp70 expression for the ability of  Drosophila to grow and reproduce successfully under stress.  Finally, the project will engineer Drosophila cell lines  differing in hsp70 expression with a light-emitting protein to  test whether hsp70 can repair a stress-damaged protein. The  proposed research is significant because (1) it will gather basic  but presently unavailable data on the natural conditions  experienced by Drosophila, one of the primary models in modern  biological research; (2) it will assess the linkages, if any  between manifestations of the stress response at the  molecular/cellular level and organismal performance; (3) it will  prospectively identify candidate mechanisms for study  at the  cellular/molecular level; and (4) it will lay the groundwork for  a priori predictions and test of the evolution of physiological  characteristics.  ***",
