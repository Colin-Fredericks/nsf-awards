This laboratory and the accompanying computational  exercises are designed to interface with laboratory courses at each  level of the undergraduate curriculum, including general,  inorganic, organic and physical chemistry.  Each of the  computational exercises concerns aspects of compounds which are the  subject of experimental studies in the course curricula.  Thus, in  each case, students are either synthesizing and/or performing  physical studies on the same materials which are the subjects of  their computations.  The intention behind this approach is twofold.   First, each exercise provides the student with a demonstration of  the power of computational techniques in chemistry.  In addition,  the use of a combination of methods (experimental and  computational) to study a given molecular system illustrates for  students that science often progresses by focusing a broad variety  of techniques on a single problem.  The computer laboratory is structured as follows: two graphics  workstations with large computational capacity are networked to ten  Macintosh and ten personal computers.  The small systems serve as  terminals for the workstations.  Students construct their molecular  models at the small computer systems and submit their calculations  to one of the workstations.  This structure makes the software  capacity and the computational power of the workstations available  to all users.  Both Macintosh and personal computers are available  so that educational software written for either of these platforms  can be incorporated.",
