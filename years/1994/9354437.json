 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354437  Cornette         Iowa State University faculty members in Mathematics and in Zoology  and Genetics will develop and implement a one-year  mathematics/mathematical modeling course for freshman and sophomore  students majoring in the biological sciences. The emphasis of the  course will be on understanding mathematical models using  biological processes to demonstrate the applications of calculus.  Calculus and differential equations are essential tools for  describing systems that change with time and will form the core of  the mathematical content. The students will collect data from a  number of 'wet lab' experiments that demonstrate time varying  systems, and will use the data to construct models and learn the  concepts and manipulations of calculus. This lab feature is a  unique component of the proposal.  The mathematics will begin with  the elements of calculus and will culminate with stability analysis  of the solutions to two differential equations in two unknown  functions. Both discrete and continuous systems will be studied.  Students will also develop computer models of more complex  biological systems using commercially available software (Stella)  and will write some elementary codes. We also plan to have students  use Stella later in the curriculum in physiology and environmental  science.  Faculty in Zoology and Genetics will develop the  biological experiments and descriptions. To facilitate use of the  materials with large numbers of students and at other institutions,  the illustrations of biological systems and some analyses will be  developed as multimedia computer software recorded on read only  memory compact disks.  The targeted student population includes the  large fraction of biology students who do not take an engineering  calculus course. The majority of these students are women.",
