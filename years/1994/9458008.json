Novel  effects  have  been discovered  in  these  so-called  mesoscopic systems.  In separate developments, recent advances in  the  understanding  of  disordered systems, critical  phenomena,  and  non-  linear  dynamics have made it possible and imperative  to  ask  deeper  questions  about complexity.  Our approach is to probe  model  complex  systems  such  as glasses and driven vortices in superconductors  with  novel  mesoscopic techniques.  In this way important phenomena can  be  directly studied for the first time.    Non-technical  abstract:   Materials  and  devices  with  very   small  dimensions  but larger than single atoms have recently been fabricated  and   studied.    Novel   effects  with   particular   importance   to  microelectronics  have been discovered in these  so-called  mesoscopic  systems.    In   separate  developments,  recent   advances   in   the  understanding  of such problems as turbulent flow and neural  networks  have  made  it  possible and imperative to ask deeper questions  about  complexity.
