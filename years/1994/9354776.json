 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354776  Fisher         This proposal articulates the development of a new undergraduate  mathematics education program consisting of three new courses for  undergraduate preservice secondary mathematics teachers and two new  courses in developmental entry level mathematics based on proven  secondary reform curriculum. The developmental courses are  adaptations of the highly acclaimed reform secondary mathematics  curriculum, the Interactive Mathematics Project (IMP). The  preservice courses provide training in the philosophies, attitudes,  objectives, and methods underlying the new reform curriculum and  include specific training in the delivery of the adapted IMP  materials. The preservice teachers participate in a highly  structured field experience based on reform ideas as they actually  teach (under the supervision of mathematics education faculty), the  two new developmental courses to college students with entry level  mathematics deficiencies.  The project is conducted in two distinct settings: CSU, Chico (a  typical four year institution that has remedial students and a  teacher preparation program) and in a collaborative setting between  the University of California, Irvine (a research institution with  preservice teachers) and Irvine Valley College (a community college  that has a large population of remedial students). Development of  the curriculum, materials, and implementation design allows easy  export to either higher educational setting throughout the nation.  This innovative preservice-developmental proposal provides both an  important advancement in aligning secondary mathematics teacher  preparation programs with reform ideas and an economical solution  to the growing bottleneck of students with entry level mathematics  problems.  ***y",
