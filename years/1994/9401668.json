The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a four-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Gary J. Mankey of Penn State University to work  with Dr. Markus Donath at Max-Planck Institute fur  Plasmaphysic on spin polarized inverse photoemission of  atomically engineered magnetic structures.    The goal of Dr. Mankey's research is to develop a new  instrument capable of studying newly discovered phenomena  for a wider range of magnetic materials and artificially  layered structures.  The collaborators intend to measure the  changes in the electronic structure of solids as one goes  from the bulk to thin films, superlattices, and ultimately  to a single atomic layer.    The work will develop  collaboration between  two leading groups in inverse  photoemission spectroscopy: a university research group at  Penn State, an industrial research group at IBM Yorktown in  the U.S. and a university research group at MPI in Germany.  ***",
