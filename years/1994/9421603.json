 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421603  Ringo      The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits was started as a multi-  university Center in 1989 with Washington State University and the  University of Washington.  Oregon State University became an  additional research site in 1991.  The State University of New  York, Stoneybrook is being added as another research site of the  Center.  Since only two companies are currently being added to the  Center in association with the new research site, the State  University of New York - Stoneybrook is being added tot he Center  as an affiliate.    The Center's research agenda is being expanded by the new research  site by studies to:  1) Develop new methods for the design of  analog integrated filters; 2) Develop design and simulation tasks  for emerging technologies; and 3) Investigate the analog behavior  of high performance digital circuits.    The Center's researchers are imminently qualified to perform the  Center's research projects.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Deborah Crawford, Solid  State and Microstructures Program.    Additional funding is provided for two supplemental awards to the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Design  ofAnalog-Digital Integrated Circuits at Washington State  University.  The first is a Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to  provide an opportunity for two Assistant Professors at Cogswell  College North and Seattle University, both predominantly  undergraduate instituttions, to work on research in the area of  Simulation and Magnetic Modeling for Power Electronics.  No review  is required for a Research Opportunity Award, however, Dr. Vijay  Vittal, Program Director, Electrical and Communication Systems  provided an internal review.  His comments were very favorable and  strongly recommended support of the project.  The research work  performed through this award will professionally benefit everyone  involved in the project; the two women faculty members, CDADIC  researcher s, industrial sponsors, and the undergraduate students  who will participate in the project.  The second program provides  support for two undergraduates through the Research Experiences for  Undergraduate Research Program.  These students will work with two  Assistant Professors on the research project being supported  through the Research Opportunity Award and through this experience  will be provided a research experience which they otherwise would  not have access to at their institution.                The Program Manager recommends Washington State University be  awarded $143,186 for the first year of a five-year continuing  award.  An additonal $50,000 is recommended for 24 months for an  Researchy Opportunity Award and $10,000 for one year with funds  provided by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.     Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
