 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solomonson  9317557  The nitrate assimilatory pathway is the major route by which  inorganic nitrogen is converted to a biologically useful organic  form.  Regulation of the first step in this pathway, catalyzed by  nitrate reductase (NR), is important to prevent toxic accumulation  of intermediates (nitrite and ammonia), to assure efficient  utilization of nitrate, and to permit rapid adaptation to changes  in environmental conditions.  Results of previous studies have  indicated that NR is regulated at several different levels by  multiple effectors and environmental factors reflecting the key  role of this enzyme and the biological importance of pathway  regulation.  Our research will focus on elucidating molecular  determinants and mechanisms which are important for the regulation  of NR at the molecular (enzyme) level and establishing  interrelationships between various modes of regulation.  Specific  aims will include: a) identification of functional groups involved  in NR turnover, catalysis, binding or regulation, and the  localization of these groups with respect to functional domain or  primary sequence site on the enzyme; and b) determination of  effects of possible activity modulators such as protein  kinases/phosphatases, metal binding effectors (e.g., nitric oxide  or cyanide), or other effectors on NR turnover and catalytic  efficiency.  The ultimate goal of our research is to obtain  information from this and other studies to develop procedures for  increasing the catalytic efficiency of NR and for regulating its  action in an effort to increase agricultural productivity.  %%%  Nitrate is the major source of organic nitrogen in biological  organisms.  The process by which nitrate is converted to a  biologically useful, organic form, termed nitrate assimilation,  occurs in a wide variety of organisms including bacteria, yeast,  fungi and higher plants, which in turn supply the nutritional  nitrogen requirements for other forms of life, including human.   One of the goals of this r esearch is to develop strategies for  increasing the catalytic efficiency and for regulating the activity  of the key enzyme, nitrate reductase (NR), in the nitrate  assimilation pathway.  The focus of our current research program is  to identify the functional groups of the NR molecule and other  factors that will help us learn more about the protein.  We may  then use this information to engineer agriculturally interesting  plants with more efficient nitrogen metabolism and increased  production capacity.  Plants with improved nitrogen metabolism will  result in decreased need to supply chemical fertilizers to our  crops.  ***",
