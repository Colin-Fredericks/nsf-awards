An integrated  instructional approach is planned which begins with the  introduction of simple NMR techniques in the sophomore level  organic chemistry laboratory. The instrument will also receive  extensive use in advanced elective courses which require physical  chemistry as a prerequisite. The desire for faculty to include an  experimental NMR component in organic chemistry courses is readily  understood and there is a growing trend to do so. The role that an  NMR can play in undergraduate education in the areas of inorganic  chemistry and biochemistry has not been explored to the same  extent. Several new experiments have been designed for these  particular courses that are unique and would be of interest to  other colleges and universities. The instrument will also receive  a great deal of use in our undergraduate research program. The  excitement generated by a new sophisticated spectrometer will  inspire more students to become involved in research projects and  to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. The NMR training that the  program will provide will dramatically improve the preparation of  graduates for immediate employment in chemical industries.",
