The project will study adolescent apprentices in Germany, a country with a well-developed system of apprenticeship.  A sample of industrial apprentices will be compared with a matched sample of school attenders in relations with family, peers and unrelated adults for various aspects of adolescent behavior.  The subjects will be observed in their natural settings, the classroom and workplace.  Questionnaires and tests to measure their relationships and attitudes will be administered.   This research is important because adolescent violence is a major problem in contemporary society, and increases in our understanding of its causes will help us control it.  In addition the project is timely since the German in American.  This study should help us assess its applicability for our nation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            !         !         !
