 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413808  Jensen   This award provides for the following research and teaching  equipment: a five-axis milling machine and tooling, a scientific  data and visualization computer system, surface measurement instruments (optical comparator, toolmaker's  microscope, etc.), piezoceramic actuators/sensors interfaced to an  adaptive controller, and cutting tools with internally mounted heat  and force sensors and associated telemetry systems.  This equipment  will be used in five research programs and in the Mechanical and  Manufacturing Engineering curriculums at Brigham Young University.   Interdisciplinary efforts using this equipment will continue their  focus on the elimination of machining errors and the subsequent  hand finishing of complex sculptured machined parts.              Coupled with the funding of  this request, more extensive research will study aspects of complex  machining of sculptured parts.  The impact to the nation's  manufacturing infrastructure could be a substantial decrease in the cost to manufacture molds and precision machined  parts for the automotive, aerospace and plastic industries.  This  research will help restore competitiveness to the American machine  tool, mold, and die industries which have seen a continued loss of  business to overseas competition during the past decade.",
