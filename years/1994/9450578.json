 "awd_abstract_narration": "OSR-9450578  Ma  Development of a Core Facility for Biotechnology Research  The proposed activity is to establish a core facility for research  and development in biotechnology at the West Virginia University  Robert C. Byrd (WVU-RCB) Health Sciences Center under the current  federal Good Manufacturing/Laboratory Practice (GMP/GLP)  regulations. Formation of a GMP/GLP facility would be  cost-intensive, but would also greatly improve research  infrastructure at West Virginia University, and strongly enhance  our ability to obtain research grants from both federal and  industrial sources. Because such a facility consists of federally  approved laboratories for product development and characterization,  this facility would also have the capacity to participate in  collaborative commercial ventures with private sector biotechnology  companies. Due to the extensive costs associated with the  establishment of a complete GMP center, the requested funding from  the EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Initiative program will be used to  develop a start-up facility to include: 1) a GLP laboratory to  characterize chemical and biological materials, such as for quality  control of starting materials and/or biotechnological products; 2)  a cell culture laboratory to develop methods for cell biology  research and the screening of xenobiotic biotransformation; and 3)  a small-scale manufacturing facility to produce biotechnological  reagents and polymeric and lipid membrane-derived systems for  cellular targeting of bioactive compounds. This core facility will  be used for long term stimulation of competitive research at the  WVU-RCB Health Sciences Center and serves as a base for future  establishment of a full GMP facility to foster biotechnological  development in West Virginia.    The anticipated outcome of the proposed activity is three-fold. The first  is to promote multidisciplinary research by combining cellular targeting  strategies, physicochemical and molecular biological methods in studies  such as those  included in the current proposal. The second is to  establish the GMP/GLP laboratories as planned to support future  development in industrial applications of biological research and  technology/knowledge transfer to the private sectors. Thirdly, this core  facility will be used for long term development of competitive research  and funding by federal and/or industrial sources.",
