 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320973  Jaffe  Knowledge spillovers are key to understanding the process of  technological progress, how it contributes to economic growth,  and how policy levers can be used effectively to foster growth  through innovation.  Knowledge spillovers are created when  universities and government labs produce the basic research  results that provide the foundation for applied research in the  private sector; they are also created in the private sector, when  researchers take advantage of knowledge produced by other private  agents.  Yet, despite this importance and a decade of research,  crucial questions remain unanswered.  For example, we do not know  the relative importance of different institutions, different  industries and different geographic regions in generating  spillovers; the extent to which spillovers are contained within  local or national boundaries; whether and how firms vary in their  ability to use spillovers from others; and how the public  knowledge flows that spillovers represent have varied over time.   The contribution of this project comes from assembling a  comprehensive database on patents, validating the use of patent  citations as evidence of knowledge flows through the detailed  examination of other evidence, and using the datasets to address  these unanswered questions.    More specifically, the project constructs a comprehensive  database on all patents granted between 1975 and 1993 and all  citations made by those patents, including references to earlier  patents going back to 1871.  The citations database is used to  map the flows of knowledge across time and among sectors,  geographic regions, and different institutions such as firms,  universities and government labs, and to measure the \"basicness\"  and appropriability of particular inventions or the portfolio of  inventions held by particular firms, sectors or regions.  The  database will be merged with the NBER R&D Panel dataset, which  contains annual financial and market value information on over  2000 firms.   It will also be merged with the Census LRD data on  production by establishment, and the Census-NSF industrial R&D  survey data.  These datasets will be used to explore a number of  important questions at the heart of the economics of  technological change and crucial to technology policy.",
