 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support   Professor Novotny's investigations of the applications of pulsed-field   capillary electrophoresis (CE) in the separation and characterization of   polysaccharides and proteoglycans.  The goal  is to extend CE technology   to high molecular weight biopolymers in the range of 100,000 to   100,000,000 Daltons. The materials to be investigated will include large   proteins, DNA molecules with unusual shapes, polysaccharides,   proteoglycans, and other biomolecules.  In addition, a  fundamental   investigation of the factors which control the rate of migration of large   molecules in pulsed electric fields will be carried out by Professor   Novotny and his students.      This research will extend the capabilities of capillary electrophoresis,   a method that allows the separation of charged components present in   complex macromolecular mixtures.  The goal is to be able to separate   large biomolecules with  molecular weights up to 100,000,000 Daltons.    Pulsed electric fields will be investigated in order to overcome many of   the problems encountered in the fractionation of mixtures of large   molecules by conventional capillary electrophoresis methods.  The   materials to be investigated include polysaccharides, carbohydrates, and   proteoglycans.  The  techniques developed in this project will be used to   separate large molecules of biochemical and technological significance",
