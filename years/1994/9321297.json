 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational   chemistry program.  Coupled-cluster and density functional  methods in   molecular electronic structure theory will be studied and compared to   search for an ab-initio-derived-functional for density functional theory.    An improved scheme will be explored for computing the triples   perturbative correction in Brueckner doubles theory.   These   computational methods will be applied to the study of transition metal   systems and combustion processes.    In principle, the physical and chemical properties of  molecular systems   can be obtained from either the many-body wavefunction (traditional ab   initio theory) or from the electronic charge density (density functional   theory).  There presently exist highly developed computer programs for   applying either of these two theories to any of a wide variety of   chemical problems.  Ab initio equations, particularly those of coupled   cluster theory, may require very heavy computations using supercomputers,   but these equations are firmly based on well established mathematical and   physical principles.  The equations of density functional theory offer   significant computational advantages, but serious questions remain   concerning the precise form of these equations.  The present comparative   study of ab initio and density functional methods attempts to develop   improved computational methods for molecular electronic structure   computations which combine the strengths of these two different   formalisms.  The development of such an improved density functional   theory is currently a hot topic in  modern theoretical chemistry.   A   breakthrough in this area  will greatly extend the size of molecular   systems for which reliable theoretical predictions can be made using   modern computers, and will almost certainly find wide and immediate   application.   The proposed test calculations on transition metal   compounds constitute the initial steps toward the rational design  of new   industrial catalysts.",
