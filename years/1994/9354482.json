 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354482  Miaoulis        This project proposes to develop a novel curriculum that will  stem from a strong partnership between the College of  Engineering and the Department of Child Study and will provide  a common solution to two separate major problems: the  inadequate preparation of early childhood teachers in  understanding and teaching science and technology, and the  enthusiasm generation and retention of engineering students.  Teams of engineering faculty members, and graduate and  undergraduate students will develop a coordinated pool of  mini-courses that focus on exciting topics of applied science  and technology. These courses will be interdisciplinary in  nature, will include open-ended laboratory and/or field  experiences, will involve semester-long team projects and will  be designed to allow students with no previous college-level  background to participate. Although the courses will be  rigorous and emphasize depth versus breadth, special attention  will be given to creating an understanding and appreciation for  the scientific and engineering process. Engineering freshmen  and Child Study majors will each select and take two of these  courses. In addition to these courses, Child Study majors, the  future K-3 teachers, will take a Science and Technology  Curriculum Development seminar-course that will train them to  transfer technical knowledge to the development of teaching  units appropriate for young children. The focused nature of the  courses will allow the proposed program to grow from the roots,  since courses will be proposed and developed following personal  research and other interests of individual faculty members,  while being supported from the top, by a strong institutional  commitment. The project, which will be cost-shared by the  university, can be easily disseminated to numerous colleges and  universities that combine science and/or engineering  departments with teacher preparation units.  ***",
