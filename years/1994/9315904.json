 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315904  Garden    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will fund (i)  initial laboratory characterization tests of a recently developed  128 x 128 mid-infrared (4 to 30 microns) detector array, and (ii)  the construction of a small test dewar/camera to permit  measurements of the array's performance on real astronomical  sources using the Lick 1-m telescope.  When mounted on the 1-m  telescope, the prototype camera is expected to achieve 2 arcsec  resolution images over a 16 arcmin2 field with a signal-to-noise of  10 on a 30 mJy (7.8 mag) source in a 1 hour integration at 10  microns through a 1 micron bandwidth filter.  The astronomical  capabilities of the new detector array will be demonstrated by  using it to conduct one of the most sensitive surveys yet made of  the mid-infrared continuum emission from young star-forming  molecular clouds, such as Rho Oph and Orion.    This project is particularly suited to the SGER program as the  proposed work is at the forefront of contemporary detector array  development, yet is relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in  the course of only one year.  The knowledge and experience to be  gained during both the initial laboratory characterization and  subsequent observing phases of the proposed program will be of  immense value for the development of future mid-infrared imaging  systems for the new generation of very-large telescopes, such as  the recently constructed Keck and the soon-to-be-built Gemini  observatories.  Furthermore, a large portion of the requested funds  will be used to employ a graduate student who will assist with the  testing of the array and the development of the prototype camera.   Finally, if this project is funded, and we succeed in  demonstrating the power of the new array through observations with  the Lick 1-m telescope, we probably stand a good chance of being  awarded a more substantial NSF grant next year to build a more  sophisticated camera, based on a larger 256 x 256 mid-infrared  array.  ***",
