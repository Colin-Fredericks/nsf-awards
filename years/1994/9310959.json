University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee  Title:    Climate Diagnostics and Prediction Using Nonlinear  Empirical Models                                ABSTRACT         This project's main objectives are to develop and test  nonlinear statistical models for climate diagnostics and for  climate predictions.  The methodologies to be applied, based on  artificial neural networks and local-approximation models, have  been developed recently in the emerging fields of deterministic  chaos and parallel distributed processing.  The goal is to achieve  skillful models of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on  seasonal to interannual time scales for both the Pacific and  Atlantic basins and, through prediction, to enhance understanding  of the processes involved.         Climate variability on the seasonal to interannual time scale  is strongly related to ENSO.  Recent research suggests that ENSO,  primarily a Pacific signal, can be considered as a low-dimensional  chaotic system.  In addition, the Atlantic region also has major  climate variations shown in atmospheric and oceanic data.   Predictions of both ENSO and Atlantic oscillations will be  attempted by applying the nonlinear statistical modeling techniques  developed for the prediction of chaotic system behavior.  The  performance of several nonlinear statistical models will be  validated and optimized through hindcast experiments with data sets  from as early as 1950.  The absolute verification experiments will  be hindcasts of ENSO SST events in the period of 1985-1990, as  established by the Working Group of the TOGA Program on Seasonal to  Interannual Prediction (T-POP).         The algorithms developed, particularly those for the  Connection Machine, are based on new modeling techniques and will  be made readily available to the meteorological and oceanographic  communities.",
