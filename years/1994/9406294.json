 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to establish and explore new  connections between the theory of certain infinite variance  stationary processes and the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows.  This connection leads to a natural classification of such random  processes and gives a base for their systematic investigation.  A  new approach has been necessary because the ideas and techniques  based on harmonic analysis of square integrable processes have a  very limited use in the infinite variance case.  On the other  hand, many results of the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows  have their natural counterparts in the theory of infinite  variance stationary processes.  For example, the famous Hopf  decomposition of flows into dissipative and conservative parts  permits us to identify and isolate the moving average parts of  the corresponding stationary processes.  Building upon these  connections, structural and path properties of certain important  classes of infinite variance stationary processes will be  investigated.       Stochastic stationarity can be observed in the long-time  behavior of many random phenomena when the same patterns of  behavior occur with time independent frequencies.  For example,  in a noisy communication channel the initial signal is  superimposed with a random noise giving a stationary random  process on the channel's output.  In recent years there has been  a growing interest in the investigating of highly random  (infinite variance) models.  The existing methodology and tools  of harmonic analysis, that have been very successful in the study  of moderately random stationary processes, have shown a very  limited applicability in the infinite variance case.  This  project is intended to establish and explore new connections  between certain classes of infinite variance stationary processes  and the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows.  This new approach  reveals the structure of highly random stationary processes and  it is anticipated that it may lead to a new methodology i n the  study of such processes.",
