This project is  sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.    Professor Zhang is a leading nuclear structure theorist active in  worldwide research at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University  of Copenhagen and the Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research at  Oak Ridge.  His visits with the experimental groups at SUNY Stony  Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory will focus on research  aimed at understanding nuclear structure of transitional nuclei.   This research is focused on the leading edge of low-energy  structure studies.  The key to this program is the effective  interaction between the experimental and the theoretical  approaches to the understanding of these research areas.",
