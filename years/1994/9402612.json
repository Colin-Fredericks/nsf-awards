 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemistry and the International Programs   Divisions Donald W. Setser of Kansas State University will pursue   cooperative international research with Dr. V. A. Alekseev of the Physics   Research Institute of St. Petersburg, Russia to characterize the   spectroscopy and kinetics of the states of ClF in the 8.5 to 12 eV energy   range.  Dr. Alekseev has extensive experience with vacuum ultraviolet   excitation in this energy range, and Dr. Setser has studied similar   species using two-photon laser excitation or dc discharges in flow   reactors.  After gaining experience at Kansas State, Dr. Alekseev will   return to St. Petersburg and will combine the two-photon technique with   one-photon techniques currently used in that laboratory.  Specific   species of interest are the B and C states of XeCl made by   photodissociation of the precursor van der Waals molecule XeClR (where R   is any group) prepared using a pulsed free jet expansion.  %%%  Excimer lasers, which are based on rare-gas halide molecules, are   currently used for a wide variety of purposes, from cutting and annealing   metals in manufacturing to surgery in doctors' offices.  Understanding   the nature of these species could impact the development of new laser   sources as well as provide a better characterization of existing excimer   lasers to better optimize them.",
