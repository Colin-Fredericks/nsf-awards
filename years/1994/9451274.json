The purpose of the  project is to assess the viability of the workshop format in a  university setting, by conducting a pilot program for 30 students.   If successful, the program will be scaled up to serve approximately  900 science and engineering students per year.  We will outfit a  laboratory with computers to run the Comprehensive Unified Physics  Learning Environment (CUPLE), a multitasking, multimedia learning  tool which was developed by Rensselaer and other universities.   CUPLE will provide (1) on-screen videos to help students set up lab  experiments; (2) data acquisition via video technologies and other  traditional transducers; (3) a variety of tools for data analysis,  visualization, and modeling; and (4) access via hyperlinks to  databases of text, graphical, and video information.  The  multimedia software and data acquisition capabilities of the  hardware will enable the students to work jointly on group learning  assignments, problem solving sessions, laboratory experiments, and  the preparation of oral and written presentations.  The equipment  is a vital component of the interactive, cooperative learning  strategy on which the workshop format is based.",
