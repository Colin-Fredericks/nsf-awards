 "awd_abstract_narration": "Randolph-Macon College has obtained instrumentation that supports  laboratory instruction and student research in a new undergraduate  interdisciplinary program in environmental studies, and also in a  well-established and well-respected undergraduate program in  chemistry. Specifically, we have obtained a capillary gas  chromatograph equipped with a mass-spectrometric detector. The  goals of this project include: putting the laboratory component of  the new environmental studies major on a firm foundation, providing  an interesting and scientifically rigorous laboratory experience  for general-education non science majors, and enriching the  laboratory curriculum for chemistry majors and minors. Another goal  is to establish a connection with regional secondary-school  teachers. A specific objective is the incorporation of  project-oriented environmental chemistry experiments in the  introductory environmental studies laboratory course and in the  organic chemistry course, as well as in the advanced chemistry  laboratory course sequence. Inclusion of project-oriented  experiments has been shown to enhance student interest in  laboratory curricula, and to prepare students better for the  environmental and/or chemical workplace or graduate program. A  further objective is to provide well-motivated senior environmental  studies or chemistry majors an opportunity to carry out original  research on a senior project in water pollution and air pollution.  A third objective is to introduce sophisticated analytical instru-  mentation to non science majors interested in environmental or  forensic science. We are not aware of the use of GC/MS with  lower-level science or non science majors (below the organic  chemistry course); our target audience includes not only  environmental studies and chemistry majors and minors, but also non  science students who take these lab courses as a terminal  experience.",
