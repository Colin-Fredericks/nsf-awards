 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of Georgraphic Information Systems (GIS) is expanding  rapidly throughout the world, creating an extraordinary demand  for professionals well versed in that technology. The aim of this  project is to develop and institute a new and innovative method for  introducing GIS to undergraduate engineering and non- engineering  students. Being developed are a series of GIS laboratory exercises  which  maintain a balance between software training, and the  conceptual and intellectual basis for GIS. The laboratory exercises  are being produced in a multimedia format and are available in a CD  ROM or compact diskette medium.  The programming strategy used   yields a student centered, non-linear approach to learning and  mastering GIS concepts and usage. The courseware developed can also  be used for the initial training of other faculty, and to  disseminate project results. While the major impact of this project  involves the civil engineering curriculum, there is keen interest  and support for a new GIS laboratory and it's attendant innovative  method of instruction shown by  the College of Arts and Sciences,  and the College of Education.",
