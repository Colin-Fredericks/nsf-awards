 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, jointly supported by the Chemistry Division and the Small   Business Program of NSF, pioneers the development of an experimental   approach to bringing the talents and capabilities of PhD chemistry   graduates of the University of Michigan to the attention of small   chemically related businesses.  In an exploratory venture termed the   Michigan Demonstration Project, Professor Michael Morris of the   Department of Chemistry will coordinate the professional videotaping of   interviews with some twenty to twenty-five newly minted chemistry PhDs   for subsequent distribution, upon request, to small businesses who seek   new employees with expertise in those areas of chemistry represented by   the graduates.  The intent of this exercise is to facilitate awareness on   the part of small businesses, which do not have extensive recruiting   infrastructure, of the capabilities for technological innovation offered   by these new chemistry PhDs.      During the past eighteen months to two years, the majority of new jobs   for PhD chemists have been in small businesses rather than in large   chemical corporations.  Recognizing this trend and the difficulties   attendant to small businesses recruiting the nation's most outstanding   talent among the ranks of new PhDs, the University of Michigan chemistry   department has developed a plan to use videotaped interviews of their new   PhD graduates as a means of displaying the talents of these young   scientists to potential small business employers.  The success of this   project could impact markedly on how prospective employers seek out and   identify promising young scientists for recruiting.",
