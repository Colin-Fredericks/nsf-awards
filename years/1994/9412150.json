 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412150  Rust    This dissertation enhancement grant provides  partial support for a U.S. graduate student,  Myra E. Barnes, working under the guidance of  Dr. Richard W. Rust, of the Department of  Biology at the University of Nevada, Reno, to  study two species of Acacia trees in northern  Botswana.  A low rate of seedling establishment  has curtailed replacement of trees destroyed as  a result of elephant foraging.  Observational  and experimental methods will be used to  determine which biotic and abiotic factors  influence the rate of seed production,  germination, seedling establishment, and  survival of trees to reproductive maturity.   The goal of the research is to determine  whether pollinators, insect, avian, or mammal  seed predators, browsers, soil water potential,  fire, or a combination of these or other  factors, limit seedling establishment and  survival.  The research will be conducted at  seven existing study sites in four wildlife  areas in northern Botswana and two or more  additional sites which will be added later in  1994.  Staff members from Botswana's Department  of Wildlife and National Parks will collaborate  with Ms. Barnes on this project.    This study will make an important contribution  to the understanding of elephant-habitat  interactions as they relate to biological  diversity in northern Botswana.  The grant will  also provide support to enable a promising  student to establish a strong independent  research career.  ***",
