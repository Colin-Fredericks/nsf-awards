 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412983  Feld  This project involves the dissertation research of a student  in cultural anthropology from the University of Texas.   The  student will study how Native Americans on the Apache San  Carlos reservation in Arizona  adapt and refashion American  popular culture in constructing their Indigenous identities.  Focusing on contemporary popular music, the student will  conduct participant observation  among a range of musical  practitioners.  The central focii of the project will be the  formal properties of  various musical expressions, the  social positions of the participants, the way the music  deals with contemporary power relations of Indians and the  dominant culture, how historical, biographical and emotional  issues are encoded in the songs.   The student will play  music with local musicians, and will transcribe and analyze  musical and linguistic texts, and interview musicians and  listeners about life historical experiences with popular  music.    This research is important because popular music is a major  part of the self-identification of young people.  By  studying the role of music in minority life, how people  adapt dominant culture to express their subordinate  existence, the project will add important understanding of  minority cultures in the stressful condition of culture  contact in contemporary life.  This knowledge will be  valuable to a wide range of social actors and institutions,  from schools, who need to know how to motivate students  towards academic interests, to work places, who need to  understand what young people are interested in to deal with  them successfully.",
