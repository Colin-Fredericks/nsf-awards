Part of the work consists of implementing chip designs using the fabrication facilities of the Massachusetts Microelectronics Center and MOSIS.      (2) High-Performance VLSI Synthesis with Wave Pipelining: Wave pipelining is a custom circuit design method which has previously been used in hand-crafted designs.  This technique is being incorporated in CAD tools for the automatic synthesis of high-performance VLSI circuits.      (3) Testable Non-Scan Sequential Circuits: Design and development methodology for sequential circuits are being done so that most path delay faults can be detected.  To avoid performance degradation, any circuitry added to enhance testability is not allowed to be in functional paths.    (4) Reconfiguration of Real-Time Distributed Systems: Reconfiguration is a powerful method to improve the performance of distributed systems.  Currently, it has largely been used only to react to component failures.  In this project, techniques are being developed to configure the system as a function of the prevailing workload so that the performance is optimized.        (5) Topological and Physical Layout Design Techniques for Yield Enhancement: The greater integration levels and die sizes in integrated circuits have increased the need for yield enhancement.  In this project, design techniq ues are being developed to improve the yield of larger chips, so as to fully benefit from the advantages of higher levels of integration.    ***             (          kT        3COM                   t        WINA20  386            `     $  AUTOEXEC33            Xt    V   LM                     VW @$    CONFIG  BAK            V        CONFIG  OLD           nW        WIN31                  X        9320325  Krishna     The equipment funded by this award will be used for several research projects, including in particular the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Z   \\   u   w                   {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    $         $         $         $              G                                                                                  Times    Symbol  \" Helvetica    Chicago    Times New Roman  & Arial  5 Courier New  R ZapfDingbats    Palatino    Greek    GenMath    MathMeteor    MT Extra                                 \"                   f  eDj                          6    Krishna/UMass    Mark Purvis Mark Purvis",
