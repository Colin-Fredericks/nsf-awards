Materials have been developed with  support from the NSF ILI program and the U.S. Department of  Education FIPSE program.  The goals of this two-year assessment  project are to: (1) identify a list of \"community norms\" - that is,  a list of key concepts students who take an integrated pre-  calculus/calculus sequence are expected to know; (2) design and  implement internal and external assessment tools to evaluate  student learning gains and attitudes, with a particular emphasis on  the impact of technology; and, (3) track student retention rates,  continuation rates, and performance in subsequent mathematics  classes and classes in other disciplines that have a calculus  prerequisite.   Materials are being beta tested in a variety of  settings and developers are assisting colleagues in adapting the  materials for use at their institutions.  Based on outcomes of the  assessments undertaken by this project, the Workshop Calculus with  I and II instructional materials will be refined and published for  widespread dissemination.  The results of the project will be  published and the assessment tools will be distributed.   Workshop Calculus with Review I and II is a integration of pre-  calculus concepts with Calculus I material and is designed for  students who are not prepared to enter Calculus I.  The sequence  provides a gateway into the traditional calculus sequence.  In the  Workshop environment, lectures are replaced by interactive  teaching, where students learn by doing and by reflecting on what  they have done.  In the workshop environment, lectures are replaced  by interactive teaching in which no formal distinction is made  between classroom and laboratory work.  In class, students explore  mathematical ideas  on their own and discover their own approaches  to solving problems, using technology as appropriate and by working  collaboratively on tasks in their Student Activity Guides.",
