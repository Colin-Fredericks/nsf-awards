 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      In this project, we request (1) one high-quality  microscope with phase contrast and  DIC optics; (2) two vibration free air tables with one base  plate, (3) two  rnicromanipulators, (4) one dissecting microscope, (5) one  computer, (6) one cage-  washer, (7) one CO2 incubator, (8) one biosafety cabinet and  one laminar flow hood, and  (8) caging and racks. The requested equipment is focused on  the central theme of normal  mouse development, genetics and molecular biology and will  facilitate and provide for  research, research services and research training for  undergraduates, graduates,  postdoctoral students and investigators. The equipment will  enable maintenance of state-  of-the-art research initiatives in cutting-edge research and  accommodate newly recruited  faculty at Temple in the Fels Research Institute. The  specialized equipment is a  requirement for our program in Developmental Biology. To  maintain our position at  the frontier of research, we have developed five well-  defined basic science programs (1)  Molecular Biology and Oncology program, (2) Immunology  program (3) Biochemistry  program (4) Developmental Biology Program, and (5) Molecular  Pharmacology/  Chemical Carcinogenesis program. The Fels Institute brings  together at one location a  diversity of intellectual skills and research experience.  Our goal is to address questions of  critical importance in each program, particularly in the  area of Developmental Biology  using the most powerful methods of analysis currently  available. Over the last year, we  have actively recruited a number of new investigators to  Fels. Acquisition of the  requested equipment will help fulfill a major research  objective of our Program in  that we will effectively address questions concerning the  normal role of a particular  gene during development and the basic biology and regulation  of gene sequences  during development. This equipment will help to bridge the  gap between an  investigator's ability to define the r ole of a gene in  simple tissue culture systems and in  the organism.    In this proposal, we ask for a related series of equipment  dedicated for the purpose of  conducting gene-targeting and transgenic experiments in our  basic Developmental  Biology Program. The equipment will be placed in a pathogen-  free Barrier animal  facility of Temple University. This facility is a shower-in  facility staffed by two animal  technicians, one manager and one Veterinarian. Experiments  are conducted in the  facility and common-use equipment is located there for all  investigators using the  barrier. The area is currently providing IACUUC and AALAC  approved housing and  care of animals used in research and research training. In a  separate initiative, we are  planning repair and renovation of this space; however, the  proposed series of  instruments will function for the same purpose whether or  not building renovations  occur.    In this project, the acquisition of this equipment will  allow us to perform blastocyst  and egg injections at the same time, will allow efficient  functioning of the animal  facility, and will allow participation of more research  laboratories in Developmental  biology research and research training.",
