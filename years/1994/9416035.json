Using the Xenopus oocyte/mRNA injection  system, research proposed will focus on signal transduction in  response to the environmental stimuli of low non-freezing  temperature and dehydration in higher plants.  A common effect of  these two stimuli on plants is to modulate endogenous abscisic acid  (ABA) levels, not all responses to low temperature are ABA  dependent.  The mode of action of ABA has not been conclusively  demonstrated.  Questions remain regarding actual location of ABA  receptors, and second messengers, if any, that are necessary for  signal transduction.  Research proposed will initially focus on  ABA, since there is evidence in the literature of ABA stimulating  Ca release.  Preliminary data from this lab suggests that ABA may  interact with plasma membrane receptors and cause an increase in  intracellular Ca.  Specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To  characterize the responses, to ABA and several ABA analogues, from  oocytes injected with tobacco mRNA. 2) If Ca is mobilized, to  localize its source in an attempt to determine the manner in which  ABA and its receptors are functioning.  If Ca is not mobilized, to  determine the alternative second messenger system being utilized by  ABA.  3) To utilize the Xenopus oocyte system to isolate and  characterize ABA receptors cDNA clones.  Knowing how ABA and  receptor(s) interact will help in understanding plant responses  common to the stimuli of low temperature and dehydration.  Research  proposed will involve the areas of electrophysiology, molecular  biology, biochemistry and cell biology.  The integrative nature of  this research will make it possible for research to be performed at  appropriate collaborative research laboratories and will prove to  be a rewarding and exciting environment for training of  postdoctoral associates and graduate students.  ** *",
