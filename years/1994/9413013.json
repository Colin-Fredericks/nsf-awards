 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413013  Houde-Walter  Funding for basic research is most compelling when it is connected  to national needs.  This proposal specifically addresses a  fundamental issue in glass science (ion exchange) which is closely  related to manufacture of medical instruments which are used in  minimally invasive surgical procedures, resulting in shorter  hospital stays, less trauma to the patient and significantly lower  costs of treatment and recovery.  Many other optical systems, such  as those used in remote sensing for environmental monitoring and in  distance sensing needed in intelligent automobiles, either use or  are likely to use in the imminent future, ion-exchanged glass  micro-optics.    The scientific goal of this work is to better understand the  relation between structure, composition and properties of  commercially important glasses and to shorten the product  development time of photonic components (gradient-index micro-  optics) that are fabricated by ion exchange.  Relevant structural  chemistry parameters will be obtained by x-ray absorption  spectroscopy and will serve as constraints on molecular dynamic  modeling of the same glasses. Changes in the cation environment  with composition and processing conditions will be investigated in  the lab and related to transport behavior and the resultant index  profiles.  The transport properties will also be observed in  computer experiments of ion exchange and the simulated effect of  minority components on transport behavior will be used to guide the  tailoring of glass compositions to particular gradient-index and  micro-optic applications.  The results will be incorporated in  prototype lenses at Gradient Lens Corp., and a small high tech  company in Rochester, NY, that manufactures micro-optics and  gradient-index lenses.  By the third year on the project we will  have incorporated a large repertoire of diffusion parameters and  models into a commercial lens design program and will have  designed, toleranced, fabricated and tested the qual ity of an ion-  exchanged gradient-index lens system.  ***",
