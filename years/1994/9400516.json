 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate objective of the proposed research is to develop an  improved model of the ionospheric electric potentials in the polar  cap.  The initial step will be to determine the locations of the  convection boundaries, and how the electric potential is  distributed around the perimeter of the convection/electric field  reversal boundaries under different orientations of the IMF and two  categories of geomagnetic activity.  Solving this problem is  perceived to be the most critical step towards  the development of  a better model of ionospheric plasma convection.  Measurements from  the Vector Electric Field Instrument on DE-2 will be used to obtain  a data base of boundary locations and electric potentials around  the boundaries.  The data will be sorted according to IMF  orientation and substorm activity, then an innovative but proven  method of fitting the data will be used to determine the locations  of the convection boundaries and potential distribution as a  function of magnetic local time.  These measurements will next be  used as the initial boundary conditions for numerical calculations,  to produce reasonable models of ionospheric electric potentials.   The results of this project will be needed to check the results of  the GEM Program's global geospace general circulation model (GGCM),  and could be useful in the development of the GGCM code.  The  proposed research will also help to obtain the objectives of the  GEM program's substorm campaign.",
