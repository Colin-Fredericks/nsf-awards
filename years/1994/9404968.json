 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Salvador is funded by a Minority Research Initiation grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in   the general area of graph theory applied to databases of chemical   structural information.  Salvador will use generalizations of the   matching polynomial as a method of sorting and/or comparing lists of   structural data in connection tables or line notations.  Compact   topological indices will be used as descriptors to distinguish chemical   structures by connectivity, constitution, stereochemistry, or complete   three dimensional structures.  These indices and Chemical Abstract   CAS-Registry Numbers will permit retrieval of chemical information on   chemical compounds, their isomers and isomorphs by simply drawing out a   query on a computer screen.    Retrieval of chemical information from large databases such as those   maintained by Chemical Abstracts is a difficult problem because chemical   structures are three dimensional entities.  A number of techniques are   being developed to encode three dimensional information in numerical   indices which can be used to access such databases.  Many of the   techniques proposed to date do not uniquely encode this information, and   they result in a many to one relationship between indices and structures.    Salvador's research shows promise as a method for providing unique   coding of three dimensional structural information.",
