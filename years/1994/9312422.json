 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312422  Morkoc    Fundamental materials science and engineering issues of thin  dielectric films will be addressed using in situ growth and  diagnostics apparatus which exploits the advantages of both  chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy; metal-  insulator-semiconductor structures based on group III-V GaAs and  InP semiconductors will be investigated.  Due to intrinsically  better transport properties of III-V semiconductors, advances in  the speed and power performance of microelectronic  devices/circuits are anticipated from this study.  One of the  likely beneficiaries is low-power consumption digital electronics  such as mobile communication systems. Moreover, this project, if  successful, can provide an alternative path to further size  reduction of Si devices for enhanced performance.  %%%  To date, semiconductors other than silicon have resisted  implementation into the class of transistors, known as the metal  oxide field effect transistor, that has been responsible for the  commercial electronics revolution.  Using modern materials-growth  and in situ surface science  diagnostic techniques, dielectrics  and semiconductors with intrinsically higher potential (than  silicon) for high speed field effect transistor applications will  be studied.  If successful, the project will have considerable  beneficial impact on digital electronics systems such as wireless  personal mobile communication systems; telecommunications, in  general; information processing; and computing.  ***",
