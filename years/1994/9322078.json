 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322078  Cravens         Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is expected to enter the atmosphere of  Jupiter on about July 21-23, 1994.  Significant amounts of water  vapor will be injected into the upper atmosphere of Jupiter.  The  photochemistry of both the neutral gas and the ionosphere will be  greatly altered by the influx of this water vapor or the atomic  oxygen generated by the dissociation of the water.  The odd oxygen  (i.e., oxygen or water vapor or the hydroxyl radical) associated  with the cometary water influx alters the ion chemistry by removing  ionized hydrogen ions, which also has the effect of reducing the  ionospheric electron density because ionized hydrogen is ordinarily  the main ion species in the Jovian ionosphere.  The oxygen atoms  from the dissociation of the cometary water will also react with  the methyl radical and eventually form carbon monoxide deeper in  the atmosphere.  The PI has a numerical model that was originally  developed to study the effects of odd oxygen on the auroral  ionosphere of Jupiter.  He proposes to adapt this model to study  the effects of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the thermosphere and  ionosphere of Jupiter.  These effects (e.g., severe reduction of  electron density) will be both global and significant even a couple  of years after the comet impact which will allow the Galileo  spacecraft to study the recovery from this event.  ***",
