 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to provide upgraded and innovative  computing capabilities for courses in electrical engineering. Plans  have been made to establish a high- speed fiber optic backbone for  all departments. One high- speed workstation, in a cluster  environment, is being provided for each department. A few smaller  workstations (four per department, and 20 for the entire College)  are being located around each high speed workstation in each  department. These workstations  handle some computing locally, but,  if the load increases, jobs will be submitted to the cluster.  The  addition of industrial-type workstations permits: courses in  computer communications, numerical methods, etc. to be enhanced;  students and faculty to have access to image processing, data  visualization, parallel processing, computer networking and  multimedia document processing. Students are being provided with  access to the Internet and a Unix operating system environment.  Also, faculty and students have access to updated and upgraded  systems which support innovative senior projects and research.",
