 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of die casts in manufacturing, level sets of   functions, deposition fronts in simulation, pleasing shapes   in  animation, fast  prototyping, and visualization of interactions in  a virtual   world have one  thing in common:  the need for efficient  representations of   smooth surfaces.  At present, some of our  understanding and use of scientific   results is  handicapped by the  fact that the standard representation   used for the task,  tensor-product B-splines, can only model a small subset of   these  surfaces  naturally and efficiently, namely surfaces that allow  for a   regular,  checker-board arrangement of its pieces.    Free-form surface   splines extend the  spline paradigm and  techniques to cover also irregular   arrangements.  In  extending,  they preserve the intuitive generation of the   surface from the  control mesh by a process of cutting with hyperplanes, also   known  as corner  cutting or subdivision.  So far only first-order,  tangent   continuous surface  splines exist.  Extension to higher-order continuity is both   of fundamental  and practical interest.    The  fundamental  aspect consists of a new theory that arises when   surfaces from pieces using massive computing power in   contrast to  analyzing  surfaces as in classical Gaussian differential  geometry.      The goal of this  research is to develop a general framework for  surface   splines and to use the  representation to optimize the  shape of surfaces with   respect to various cost  functions.  The  immediate goal is the derivation of   surface  splines and to find tools to adjust the variation of   curvature,  an  important quality criterion for surfaces.  Since the   challenge  is considerably  greater than the definition of first-order  surface splines   over irregular  meshes, progress requires heavy  use of symbolic computation   and graphics for  quality assessment.",
