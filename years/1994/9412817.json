This Board provides a focal point for studies related to  environmental engineering and hydrology.  The Board's objective  is to improve the scientific and technological basis for  resolving important questions and issues relating to  management  of water resources.  This award is jointly supported by the  Environmental Engineering segment of the Environmental  Remediation Program in the Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic Sciences Program in the Directorate for Geosciences.    An important function of the Water Science Technology Board is to  conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and conferences that can  be utilized for program planning purposes.  The Board also  functions as an appropriate means for coordination of research  plans with other Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE,  and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  ***",
