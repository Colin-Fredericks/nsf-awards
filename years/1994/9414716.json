 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mattingly  9414716  Bioplastic (biofilm) coatings or biogenic varnishs are natural  accretions present on ancient, stable surfaces.  These biofilms are  from one to 500 micrometers thick and are produced by an apparent  symbiotic activity between Lichnothelia fungi and bacteria  resembling the Rhodococcus-Actinomycetes group.  It requires  hundreds of years for this symbiosis to create a continuous coating  over a stable surface.  Four different types of Lichenothelia-  associated varnishs have been identified based on chemical  differences and include (1) desert varnish, (2) soil varnish, (3)  temple varnish, and (4) tomb varnish.  No less than twenty  different species of Lichenothelia have been described associated  with biofilm formation.  However, neither the role of the fungus  nor associated bacteria is understood in forming the bioplastic  coatings.  Therefore, the goal of this NSF-SGER proposal is to: (1)  establish the identity of the genus and species of fungi and  bacteria involved in biofilm deposition on selected ancient  artifacts by using molecular biological techniques, (2) determine  the nature of the fungal/bacterial symbiotic association and (3)  determine the biochemistry of bioplastic coat formation.  %%%  Many ancient artifacts are covered by plastic coats, or films.   These plastic coatings are very thin and can take thousands of  years to form.  They are apparently produced biologically by the  concerted action of certain types of fungi and bacteria which are  able to colonize and grow together on stable, solid surfaces.  It is believed that the cellular biofilm-forming center is  comprised of a fungus called Lichenothelia and a bacterium, that  may be a Rhodococcus or Actinomyces type cell.  The goal of the  present NSF-SGER proposal is therefore to: (1) find out what types  of fungal and/or bacterial cells are involved in biofilm formation,  (2) to determine if the different cell types have to live together  to form the biofilm, and (3) learn about the chemistry of bio film  forming pathway.  ***",
