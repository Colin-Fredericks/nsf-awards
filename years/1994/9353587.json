The primary focus is on the  role that students' models of their informal mathematical problem  solving play in supporting their transition to more formal yet  personally-meaningful mathematical activity.  As part of the  investigation, particular attention is given to both small group  work and to students' developing mathematical beliefs and values.   The research involves a series of classroom teaching experiments  conducted in collaboration with first, second, and third-grade  teachers.  The four instructional sequences used in these  experiments each last six weeks and address arithmetical topics  that are central to elementary school mathematics.  The analysis of  classroom video-recordings and children's written work coordinates  cognitive and social perspectives to clarify the role that models  can play both in individual learning and in classroom  communication.  The findings have immediate implications for the  design of mathematical learning environments that are consistent  with current reform recommendations.  Further, the four  instructional sequences that will be revised in the course of the  research are designed to all innovative teachers the so-called  basics via communications, reasoning, and problem solving.  ***",
