The long range objective of this  research project is to answer the question:  What determines how  much fatty acid is produced by a plant cell?  Precise control over  primary metabolic pathways is frequently obtained by a complex  network of interlocking mechanisms which include both short term  biochemical regulation over enzyme specific activity and longer  term modifications in enzyme expression.  This project will examine  both types of control of plant fatty acid synthesis and will focus  on the following areas: I. results from prior NSF support of this  project have provided clear in vivo evidence that acetyl-CoA  carboxylase activity is a major determinant of flux through the  fatty acid synthesis pathway.  However, it is not known how plant  cells regulate the activity of this enzyme.  Preliminary  information indicates that acetyl-CoA carboxylase is regulated by  feedback inhibition.  Therefore, one goal of this project will be  to determine which metabolites, regulatory molecules, or other  mechanisms are involved in controlling the activity of acetyl-CoA  carboxylase.  II. Longer term control over the activity of the  fatty acid synthesis pathway may be determined at the level of gene  expression.  We have developed a tobacco cell suspension system in  which the cellular demand for fatty acid production can be either  up or down regulated.  We will determine if there is a direct  relationship between expression of genes for several enzymes of  fatty acid synthesis and the cell's supply of demand for fatty acid  production.  III. Several cDNA and genomic clones for acetyl-CoA  carboxylase have recently been isolated which may encode both  cytoplasmic and plastidial isozymes.  The relationship between the  structure of these different genes.  Their regulation in different  tissues, and their involvement  in fatty acid synthesis in the  plastid and cytoplasm will be determined.  %%%  Plant oils have gradually replaced animal fats and thus, are a  major and growing source of calories in American diets.  In  addition, plant oils are used in a number of industrial application  such as the manufacture of soaps and detergents, lubricants and  plastics.  World production of plant oils is approximately 60  million tons with a value of over 25 billion dollars.  Genetic  engineering of plant oils has the potential to produce new oils  with improved nutritional or industrial value.  To optimize the  production of plant oils for either food or non-food uses it is  important to understand how plants control the synthesis of storage  oils in their seeds.  Therefore, the long range objective of this  research project is to answer the question:  What determines how  much fatty acid (oil) is produced by a plant cell?  We have  identified acetyl-CoA carboxylase as a regulatory enzyme which  controls, at least in part, the flux of carbon into the lipid  biosynthetic pathway.  This project will determine which  metabolites, regulatory molecules or other mechanisms are involved  in controlling the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.  In addition  we will determine if there is a direct relationship between  expression of genes for enzymes of fatty acid synthesis (including  acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and the cellular demand for fatty acid  production.  Information obtained from this analysis from this  analysis of how plants control fatty acid synthesis will be used to  genetically engineer improved oilseed crops.  ***",
