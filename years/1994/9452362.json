In the  lecture, we examine basic science concepts and processes,  technological advances and their impact on society. In the  discussion, we demonstrate how information is collected,  assimilated and understood via direct participation. Students will  use computers for data analysis and presentation; additional  computer-aided instructional materials will be used in both  discussion and lecture. This course will be required of all  undergraduate students, and it will enroll 800 to 1000 students per  semester beginning in fall 1994. Undergraduate pre-service science  teachers will serve as course assistants and be present with the  faculty during the discussion sections. These undergraduate  assistants will also be available to assist the students with  interactive media homework assignments.  The course will serve as  a model for the UW-Whitewater campus and other comprehensive  universities through its unique interdisciplinary nature and its  exploitation of certain pedagogical elements: direct student  involvement, computer-aided instruction, computer-based data  analysis, multimedia enhanced lecture delivery.",
