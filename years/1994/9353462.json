 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353462  Singer    This comprehensive project will serve 450 elementary teachers in  the District of Columbia Public Schools.  More teachers will be  served through mentor teacher activities:  peer-led workshops for  new teachers and as school science coordinators.  In the first  year (1993-94) 50 teachers from five schools will participate;  each year thereafter 100 different teachers from 10 different  schools.  In intensive summer workshops teachers will:  be  instructed in the basic concepts of science, experience the best  interactive activities, hear scientists share the excitement of  doing science, and take field trips; use computers for writing  and organizing data, explore strategies for teaching and  assessing students, and design an integrated science unit  (covering about 6-weeks of study).  During the AY teachers will  be supported further in monthly workshops and on-site visits by  project staff.  Each year 10-mentor teachers will be selected  from those who attended the previous year.  The six themes for  the summer institutes are:  Earth, Environment, Life, Materials,  Energy and Space.  Scientists from local research institutions  and Carnegie Institution of Washington, DC will provide the  science instruction.  The style of instruction in the institutes  is Instructional Dialogues.  A \"Users Group\" will link teachers  and ideas of a speaker to the realities of the classroom.  A  concerted effort will be made to use and adapt materials from  exemplary NSF funded projects:  SS&C, Project 2061, NSRC, CEPUP,  FOSS, etc. consistent with the DCPS science/mathematics  curriculum.  Teachers will learn how to plan, develop and use  alternative forms of assessment imbedded in the curriculum.   Teachers will earn college credits upon completion of the  training from Trinity College, Washington, DC.  ***",
