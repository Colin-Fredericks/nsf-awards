 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409912  Moore       Reinforcement learning is a promising method for robots and  other complex autonomous systems to program and improve themselves.   It requires no fixed, pre-programmed decision routines and no pre-  programmed system model.  Its high degree of autonomy comes at a  severe price:  the curse of dimensionality, in which costs increase  exponentially with the number of state variables.  The proposed  research will address this problem by adaptively partitioning the  state space of the system into homogenous regions while the system  is learning.  Unimportant or unvarying regions are always  represented by large partitions whilst critical regions or  important problem features emerge as finely partitioned areas.  The  algorithms take advantage of two surprisingly powerful assumptions  which are frequently true in problems with multivariate real-valued  state spaces.  First, that all possible paths through state space  are continuous, and secondly that high quality execution of a task  does not require perfect knowledge of the whole of state space.  An  important part of the proposal concerns the development of a suite  of cheap robotic experiments, carefully designed to involve a wide  variety of interesting non-linear problems.  A learning algorithm  which could learn many different real-world tasks automatically  would be academically interesting and also have industrial impact.",
