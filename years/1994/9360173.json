 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360173  Seaver       This research is to demonstrate the accuracy and micro-radian   resolution of a two-dimensional stress-optic scanner.  In the  production of Pharmaceuticals, both the workpiece and the packaging  are too small for conventional bar codes.  Of particular importance  is the use of Automatic Identification to verify the correct  labeling of Pharmaceuticals.  Mislabeling has been a persistent  safety problem and labeling production lines are closely regulated  and inspected.  Producers of semiconductor wafers, semiconductor   chips, and printed circuit boards are shifting to two-dimensional  codes due to lack of space for the amount of data that needs to be  encoded.  The most reliable, accurate and fastest technique for  reading two-dimensional codes would be a solid-state scanning  approach; of the various techniques available stress-optics, using  an imposed stress in photoelastic materials, is the best for small  beams and fast, precise scanning through relatively small sweep  angles.       Stress can produce a such greater index change in some glasses   than can an electric field in electro-optical materials.  And  response rates up to megahertz are possible.  Also, the imposition  of a stress to optical glass does not increase its already  low-loss, and the response is non-dispersive.  Finally, optical  glasses are generally more rugged and environmentally stable and  cost less than do the materials used in other approaches.  The  manufacturability of the basic stress-optics sandwich is straight  forward and this would make it significantly cheaper than electro-  optical equivalent devices.  These last two advantages are   considered to be very important in the matrix code reader market.",
