 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - 9453534  Derrick Rollins/Iowa State University        Because of the \"quality\" revolution and global competition, engineers are finding a greater need to learn and apply statistical techniques.  However, statisticians and engineers often find interaction difficult due to language barriers imposed by differing academic cultures.  As a result, engineers frequently rely on one another to teach and apply statistical concepts.  However, since the majority of engineers have little formal education in statistics, their statistical understanding is progressing slowly.  Hence, the PIs main teaching goal is to increase the proper understanding and application of statistics in engineering, in particular, chemical engineering.  Five areas in chemical engineering are targeted for research in the next five years:  industrial data reconciliation and gross error detection, statistical modeling and sensor validation in space life support systems, statistical methods to enhance neural networks, improving powder mixture homogeneity, and statistical process control.  These research projects will involve faculty and graduate students from statistics, chemical engineering, and a number of other engineering disciplines.      The teaching and research goals will be accomplished in the following ways.   A new undergraduate statistics course for chemical engineering students will be developed which will be the basis for a new textbook.  In addition, a graduate course in chemical engineering on advanced statistical modeling that will come primarily from research in modeling complex chemical engineering systems will also be developed.  The advanced process control course for chemical engineering graduate students which the PI has recently developed will be updated to use a state-of-the-art distributed control system.  In terms of outreach, the PI will develop a number of statistics courses that can be taught to a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.  Research, as mentioned above, will be active in  five areas.  In the areas of data reconciliation and gross error detection, major progress is expected in the development of methods and their implementation into industrial processes.  Secondly, funds will be used to develop statistical techniques that validate and improve measured variables in space closed-loop life support systems (CLLSS), which is a major challenge because of the required accuracies and the low concentrations of chemical species.  Hence, this funding will be used to develop a working algorithm (i.e. a computer program) to validate sensor measurements for the initial phase of modeling CLLSS.  Artificial neural networks (ANN) have received considerable attention in recent years in many scientific and human behavioral disciplines and the PI will attempt to:  (1) increase understanding of the strength and weaknesses of ANN as they apply to chemical processes;  (2) increase theoretical understanding of ANN as they relate to model development in order to evaluate them against current statistical model building techniques;  (3) determine the best modeling approach for a given application -- statistical or ANN and;  (4) investigate the development of statistical procedures to cross-validate ANN models  Specific applications will include modeling and controlling the product moisture content in industrial grain dryers.  The PIs research program to improve powder mixture homogeneity will continue by looking at:  (1) improving the ability to determine if mixtures are significantly segregated;  (2) increasing understanding of mixing phenomena;  (3) improving the ability to diagnose inhomogeneity and; (4) transferring theoretical and empirical knowledge to the manufacturing processes in the form of operating guidelines and process and equipment improvements.",
