Several projects  are to be considered. The first is a continuation of work on  viscosity solutions for fully nonlinear first and second order  Hamilton-Jacobi equations with unbounded Hamiltonian in infinite  dimensions.  The goal is to build upon the earlier work to consider  issues such as the existence of discontinuous solutions, equations  arising in dynamic programming corresponding to optimal control or  differential games and second order problems in infinite  dimensions.  Other work will focus on the study of unique  continuation problems for solutions to linear partial differential  equations and the problem of determining the minimal regularity of  the coefficients for which such results can be obtained.  A final  goal is that of obtaining a complete characterization of the  essential spectrum for semigroups generated by hyperbolic boundary  value problems with applications in stabilization.         Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis  is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide  qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions.  This  may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and  growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for  approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these  approximations.  ***",
