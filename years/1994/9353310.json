Representatives of various  stakeholder populations will assist in designing the self-study  process. School staffs will address the condition of MST education  in the school and indicate needed changes. All school staff  (including custodial and lunchroom staff) will complete  questionnaires.     Questionnaires and brainstorming sessions will be used to solicit  information regarding the state of MST education in Chicago, the  changes needed, and contributions that can be expected from  stakeholders. During these sessions local teachers will discuss  current conditions and explore strategies for improvement. Local  school councils (LSC) members will assist in gaining input from  parents and react to the statements from stakeholder groups and   all school staff, including custodial staff and cafeteria workers.    Input from various stakeholder groups will be presented to the  Coordinating Committee who will develop a final report. Based on  the information and data from this report, a subgroups of  stakeholders will write a comprehensive MST education  implementation proposal.     The Department of Research, Evaluation and Planning will develop  and implement an evaluation design. Evaluation will address the  effectiveness with which the needs in MST are identified and the  relationship of the proposal to the identified needs. Evaluation  will also measure the quantity and quality of involvement in the  self-study process.",
