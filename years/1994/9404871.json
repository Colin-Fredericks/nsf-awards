 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404871     Harris    This research is an experimental examination of anomalous  codeposition in two different systems, nickel-iron and nickel-zinc.   There are several reasons for choosing these particular systems:   1) to determine the mechanism of anomalous deposition; 2) the  systems have nickel in common, but the alloys produced when nickel  is combined with iron and zinc have different properties; 3) both  systems are of importance commercially.  Experiments critically  test the models or theories of anomalous codeposition.  The project  starts with the production of alloy deposits within a test matrix  that includes the following variables: less noble metal  concentration in the solution, pH, current density, and  temperature.  The deposits produced in these experiments are  characterized with respect to their composition, morphology,  microstructure and crystalline phase content.  These tests identify  conditions under which anomalous codeposition does not occur, as  well as regimes of anomalous codeposition that are sufficiently  dissimilar to suggest different mechanisms.  Two additional issues  will be examined later in the project.  First, hypophosphite, which  is able to eliminate anomalous codeposition (at least in the  nickel-iron system), will be used as a probe for testing the  various anomalous codeposition mechanisms.  Secondly, the role of  hydrogen, which has been discounted in the nickel-iron system but  cannot be ignored with nickel-zinc, will be examined using the  electrochemical hydrogen permeation technique.  %%%  This work should assist in the further refinement of the commercial  production and utilization of electrodeposited alloys.  Permalloy  electrodeposition technology has played an integral role in the  evolution of the hard disk drive, and further improvements are  limited by our present understanding of the electrochemical  processing of this materials.  Also, a better understanding of the  nickel-zinc system should enhance its utilization as a corrosion-  re sistant coating for steel sheet used in automobiles and other  applications.  ***",
