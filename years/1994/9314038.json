 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of generally  applicable, reliable and rapid procedures for the chemical  synthesis of longer peptides and small proteins (range of  incorporated amino acids 75-100 or higher). Parallel studies of  the segment condensations and stepwise approaches will be  undertaken with a view to eventual elaboration of the latter  technique to allow the quick synthesis of products of high  purity without the need for elaborate purification. Promising  new coupling techniques based on FMOC amino acid fluorides and  1-hydroxy-7-azobenzotriazole (HOAt) will be emphasized. Because  of neighboring group effects, the latter offers the opportunity  of coupling both urethane-protected amino acids and peptide  segments wthout racemization. Stable FMOC-protected amino acid  fluoride derivatives will be made for histidine and arginine.  When the full range of acid fluorides is available, model  syntheses of 29-, 41- and 76-amino acid peptides will be  examined as tests of the new methodolgy. The same models will  be assembled via HOAt-derived reagents using both stepwise and  segment coupling protocols.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of Dr. Louis A. Carpino of the Department of  Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Professor  Carpino will focus his work on the development of generally  applicable, reliable and rapid procedures for the chemical  synthesis of longer peptides and small proteins. Parallel  studies of the segment condensation and stepwise approaches  will be undertaken with the view to eventual elaboration of the  latter technique to allow the rapid synthesis of products of  high purity without the need for tedious purification. Quick,  reliable methods for the chemical synthesis of higher peptides  are needed in connection with the increasing use of such  substances in the fields of medicinal chemistry, drug discovery  and material science.",
