However, this formal work  has rarely been integrated with the empirical research on  congressional reform.  This dissertation research project will  extend existing distributive, informational and partisan models  of legislative structure into explanations of congressional  transformations, especially the structure and composition of  committees and their jurisdictions.  Since the models provide  divergent explanations for the endurance of institutions,  propositions derived from these new theories should predict  different empirical outcomes with respect to the restructuring of  the congressional committee system.  The student will examine the  explanatory power of these theories, using empirical evidence on  congressional reform in the House of Representatives in order to  compare the effectiveness of each in explaining alterations in  the committee system and jurisdictional boundaries since the  Cannon Revolt of 1910.  Findings from the examination of these  models will give indications as to when and why different types  of jurisdictional reform and committee restructuring have  occurred.  The results will also offer insights into which  approach to legislative structure most accurately captures the  motivations and behavior of members within the constantly  evolving institution of congress.",
