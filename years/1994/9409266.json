 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409266  Jacobson  The objective of this research is to introduce a new set of tools  for building and analyzing simulation models of complex systems.   Issues considered include model verification and validation,  stopping conditions, variance reduction techniques, sensitivity  analysis, and experimental design. The theory of computational  complexity is used to provide a unified framework to classify and  study the issues.  A new heuristic algorithm will also be developed  to address these issues.  Six decision problems fundamental to  simulation modeling and analysis are identified and may be proven  to be non-deterministic polynomial complete.  Special cases of the  decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time are studied.   New heuristics for these problems are developed based on tree  search, dynamic programming, and simulated annealing.       The heuristics developed in this research have the potential   to provide quantitative, automated approaches to address  fundamental decision elements in discrete event simulation.  The   developed tools when attached to simulation languages can help   practitioners build more precise, better quality models, and   perform analysis with a higher degree of assurance and confidence.   The outcome of this research has the potential to advance the  domain of systems that can be modeled and analyzed using discrete   event simulation.",
