 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416383  Vucetic  The assessment of past and future damages are of primary  importance in the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of  strong earthquakes in urban areas.  Past earthquakes have  shown that, besides the source and path effects, damage  patterns are associated with local geologic and geotechnical  conditions.  The objective of the investigation is to use  the Northridge earthquake experience to develop innovative  methods for the estimation and forecasting of the damages  related to local soil conditions.  The methods are based on  modern GIS (Geographic Information System) computing  technologies for microzoning.    The primary focus is on the damage caused by soil  amplification in the nonlinear range.  The research includes  the following components:  (1) completion of a detailed  digitized geotechnical data base for the region affected by  strong shaking, (2) modification of the nonlinear site  response model to allow for the integration into GIS, (3)  integration of the geotechnical data base and nonlinear site  response model into GIS, and automatic calculation of the  distribution of nonlinear site response characteristics over  the region, (4) comparisons of the results from 1 and 3 with  recorded ground surface motions and damage distribution, and  (5) development of the GIS methods for estimation and  forecasting of local site effects based on these  comparisons.    The results will include a series of digitized GIS data  bases and associated microzoning maps.  They are:  (i) a  detailed 3-D geotechnical data base containing digitized  boring logs with soil classification properties, shear wave  velocity and SPT results distributed with depth, (ii) maps  of average soil properties, shear wave velocities and SPT  results for different depths, (iii) map of site  classification according to new criteria on shear wave  velocities, (iv) a data base of approximate design curves  and parameters for 1-D nonlinear site response analyses, (v)  maps of soil-induced amplification  for different period  ranges, and (vi) a series of maps comparing recorded damages  and the maps listed above.  ***",
