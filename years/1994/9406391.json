 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406391  Liff  The three-dimensional structure of the cross-linked high-sulphur  protein matrix of wool fibers is still largely unknown.  This  project will investigate (1) the conformational preferences of  the chains of the matrix and the conformational implications of  the characteristic pentapeptide repeat and (2) the degree and the  homogeneity of the crosslinking in the matrix network formed by  disulfide bonding.  These parameters constitute essentially full  characterization of a cross-linked polypeptide system.  To study  these issues liquid state High Resolution 2D NMR, as well as  solid state NMR, which involves the analysis of chemical shift  anisotropy and quadropolar interactions, will be applied to model  polypeptide systems.  An understanding of the structure of the  interfilament matrix is one of the most important problems in the  biophysical chemistry of natural fibers and it is of special  interest to materials science, where natural materials are  studied to foster new ideas for designing novel man-made  materials.  %%%  The purpose of this research is to elucidate the structure of the  biopolymeric networks formed by cross-linked high-sulphur  proteins of wool fibers.  An understanding of their structure is  one of the most important problems in biophysical chemistry of  natural fibers and is of special interest to materials science  where natural materials are studied to foster new ideas for  designing novel man-made materials.  A variety of Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance techniques will be used as they are the most  appropriate and the most powerful tools for this investigation.  ***",
