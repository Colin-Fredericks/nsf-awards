 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301554  Silver    This award will support a study of fluid flow through accreted  sediments of the Costa Rica margin, the southern extension of the  Middle America Trench. Fluid flow along other accretionary margins  has been shown to be extremely important in controlling mechanical  and chemical characteristics of such margins. The Costa Rica margin  differs from other trench environments in having a low input of  pelagic sediment on the underthrusting ocean  plate and a low input  of continental derived sediments. Underthrusting of the oceanic  plate is high relative to other trenches and it therefore  represents an endmember of trench environments. The objectives of  the project are to locate sites of fluid venting, to sample the  fluids and relate them to structural features of the margin, and to  determine the heat-flow along the margin and its relation to fluid  flow. In addition to examining the basic fluid low system on this  margin, data from this project will be used for siting future drill  holes in the region. The project is a cooperative study between  scientists at the University of California at Santa Cruz, the  University of California at San Diego, and Columbia University. The  field program will be undertaken from the research submersible  Alvin.  ***",
