 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419541  Schwartz    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic  Processing and Packaging Studies is becoming a multi-university  Center with the addition of the University of California - Davis to  the original North Carolina State University research group.  Four new companies are joining the Center inconjunction with the  University of California - Davis research site.  Seven companies  are already members of the initial Center.    A woman undergraduate is also being funded for a study to determine  the hydrocolloid - protein interactions in vitro.    The researchers are eminently qualified for this research.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Fred Heineken, Program  Director in the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental  Systems.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be  awarded $5,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.   An additional $5,000 is recommended for one year with funds  provided by the Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering  Research Assistants Program.  Funding for years two through five of  the five year continuing award are recommended at $30,000 per year  including $5,000 per year for an evaluator.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
