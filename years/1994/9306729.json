 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306729  Lidgard       Unlike solitary animals such as dogs or cats, bryozoans are  animal colonies.  Each colony is made up of tens or even  thousands of modules called zooids.  The zooids within a colony  often differ from one another in form, but share a similar kind  of growth by budding from pre-existing zooids.  This colonial  organization thus introduces variation and complexity not found  in the growth of solitary animals.  Different arrangements of  zooids and different budding processes allow bryozoan colonies to  grow into a remarkable variety of forms, including vines, sheets,  mounds and miniature \"trees\".  Bryozoans are among the most  diverse groups of bottom dwelling animals in marine and  freshwater habitats.  Yet skeletal anatomy related to budding and  colony formation is unknown for many encrusting and most erect  bryozoans because no broadly based study has been attempted.         The purpose of this research is to analyze zooid and colony  growth among tree-like cheilostome bryozoans and to fill critical  gaps in neglected areas of cheilostome morphology.  These  comparative studies will allow (a) evaluation and extension of  previous growth models based on studies of encrusting colonies to  include newly recognized patterns in erect colonies, (b)  assessment of the taxonomic distribution of characters related to  zooid and colony growth, and (c) documentation of relationships  among zooid form and budding patterns and colony form.  Light  microscopy and scanning electron microscopy will be used to  compare growth patterns in both living and fossil groups.  %%%       Bryozoans are interesting and poorly understood colonial  animals.  What appears to be a single \"tree-like\" form may  actually consist of thousands of individuals.  This project will  study patterns of colony growth both in living and fossil forms  of these animals.  Insights will be provides for a major group of  animals whose higher level relationships are poorly resolved and  whose fossil record contains muc h of the known diversity.  ***",
