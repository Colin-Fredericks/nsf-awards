 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405434  A thorough understanding of eukaryotic gene expression requires  knowledge not only of transcription rates but also of messenger RNA  (mRNA) stability.  In eukaryotes, regulation of RNA stability is  mediated by a novel class of proteins which bind to mRNAs at  specific sites.  Yet, how these proteins work is poorly understood  because few have been isolated or genetically studied.  From  mitochondria of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have  purified a site-specific RNA binding protein which specifically  interacts with a dodecamer sequence found only at the 3' ends of  all mitochondrial mRNAs.  In vitro, this protein protects mRNAs  from digestion by a unique, nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) dependent  3' exoribonuclease that was purified from yeast mitochondria.   Since the pathway of mitochondrial RNA decay in yeast apparently  initiates with an attack on an mRNA by that exoribonuclease, it  appears that the binding protein is instrumental for the regulation  of mRNA stability in the organelle.  The objective of the proposed  studies is to test the hypothesis that the mRNA binding protein  regulates the activity of the 3' exoribonuclease towards mRNAs and  thereby regulates the stability of mRNAs.  The gene encoding the  binding protein will be cloned and mutants of the binding protein  will be isolated.  RNA stability and processing in these mutants  will be analyzed to investigate the function of the binding protein  in vivo.  The interaction of the purified protein with  mitochondrial mRNAs and synthetic RNA oligonucleotides will be  investigated in vitro in order to correlate its biochemical  features with its functions in vivo.  RNA processing and stability  will be characterized in mutants of the NTP-dependent 3'  exoribonuclease in order to further delineate the pathway of RNA  decay in mitochondria and the role of the mRNA binding protein in  that process.  ***  Most genes function by first being transcribed into messenger RNAs  (mRNA) which exit the nucleus t o be translated into proteins in the  cytoplasm.  The activity of a gene is therefore determined mainly  by three regulated processes: (i) the transcription rate of the  gene, (ii) the translation rate of its mRNA, and (iii) the  stability of that mRNA.  Although much has been learned about the  first two processes, little is known about the last.  We will  investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the life-time of  mRNAs in the cell.  Our model system is the mitochondria of yeast.   The advantages of this model are (i) that mitochondrial RNA  metabolism is considerable less complex than that for cytoplasmic  mRNAs, and (ii) that yeast offer very powerful genetic methods for  identifying and studying the genes and their products which are  important for regulating mRNA stability.  As for cytoplasmic mRNA  stability, we have evidence that the life-time of mitochondrial  mRNAs is regulated by their interaction with a member of a special  class of proteins which bind to RNAs at specific locations.  These  site-specific RNA binding proteins are proving to be novel gene  regulators whose mode of action is still unclear.  We will identify  the gene for the mitochondrial site-specific RNA binding protein.   We will study its function genetically in the cell by examining  gene mutants.  We will study its function biochemically by  characterizing its binding properties to chemically synthesized  RNAs.  We think that investigating the properties of this regulator  of mitochondrial mRNA stability will provide important new  information about this newly discovered class of gene regulators.  %%%",
