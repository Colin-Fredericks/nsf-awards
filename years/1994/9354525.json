 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354525  Meyer  Almost all universities teach large introductory astronomy classes  for nonscience majors. These classes are typically among the larger  and more popular science classes aimed at nonscience majors, and in  many cases constitute the last formal science education the  students will ever have. Unfortunately, these classes are typically  organized around large lectures, and demand little or no  participation from the students. This creates an environment in  which the students too often resort to an uncritical memorization  of facts, and therefore do not learn the lessons which astronomy is  trying to teach them.  This project is developing an astronomy  class aimed at nonscience majors which as much as possible actively  engages the students in critical thinking. Modern and relatively  inexpensive CCD technology is now being used at many universities  to teach astronomy observation laboratories to small numbers of  astronomy students; the project incorporates this technology into  laboratories designed for large classes of nonscience majors as a  method of increasing the degree of student participation. It also  takes advantage of the nearly ubiquitous presence of computer  classrooms which most universities have implemented over the past  few years, and expands the analysis part of the laboratories into  a separate computer-homework component. This component is used to  enhance the lecture part of the course as well, and thus serves not  only to increase active learning, but also to break down the  barrier between the lecture and the laboratory.  The project pays  particular attention to the practical difficulties of achieving  these goals in classes which may well enroll 200 students, most of  whom are not exceptionally computer-literate. It also focuses on  how such an environment can be maintained in the long term without  burdensome and unrealistic demands on faculty time and/or other  teaching resources.",
