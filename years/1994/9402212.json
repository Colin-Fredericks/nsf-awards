A cross-disciplinary and cross-  cultural team of researchers will survey soldiers, their spouses,  and civilians in surrounding communities and will intervene with  selected subsamples to evaluate attempts to alleviate problems  associated with unemployment.  By conducting parallel studies in  two societies with very different economic, social, and cultural  conditions, this study will evaluate the stability of findings  concerning the effects of unemployment, while documenting the  social consequences of military demobilization.  %%%       By bringing together teams of researchers in Russia and the  United States, this project contributes to mutual understanding in  the crucial area of downsizing of these nations' military  establishments.  The results of the research are expected to  contribute directly to sociology, psychology and social-psychology.   Unemployment and other negative unintended consequences of  demilitarization threaten the benefits Americans hope to gain with  the end of the Cold War, and this study will improve the knowledge  base on which policy-makers can make their decisions.    ***",
