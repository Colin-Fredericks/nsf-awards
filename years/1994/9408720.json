 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial funding are provided for acquisition of an Ion Beam  Analytical Facility. This unique facility will be sited at  Case Western Reserve University and will be part of the Ohio  MatNet consortium of universities. Work stations connected  to the facility over Internet will be located at Bowling  Green State University, the University of Cincinnati, and  Ohio State University. The instrument will initially service  about twenty faculty at the four universities. Ultimately,  it will provide a user-oriented facility for materials  researchers at the 14 Ohio universities, at the two Federal  laboratories in Ohio (NASA Lewis Research Center and Wright  Patterson Air Force Base), and to industrial researchers.  Access will initially be focussed on, but not restricted to,  users in Ohio. The Facility also is anticipated to serve as  a major resource for materials research throughout the  Midwest region. The instrument will be primarily used for  Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy, Nuclear Reaction  Analysis, and Particle-Induced X-ray Emission Spectroscopy;  channeling, elastic recoil detection, and resonance  scattering analysis, will also be available. Applications  include a variety of thin film analyses and quantitative  analysis of hydrogen and other light elements, and analysis  of low levels of metallic impurities in metals,  semiconductors, and device structures.",
