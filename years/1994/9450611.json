The proposed study will have three  segments: the reorganization of the curriculum as a whole and of  specific courses within the  curriculum; attendant changes in the  delivery of classroom instruction; and of laboratory instruction.   The production of new textual materials will follow from these  innovations.  The vehicle for promulgating curricular changes and  their delivery will be recent advances in computing and  communications.  We will study technologies such as:  distance  learning using interactive uplink/downlink systems; computer  modelling and simulation; personal computer-based data  acquisition/analysis systems for teaching laboratories;  chemistry-related computational and drill software, video, and  interactive CD-ROM.  We propose to include broad, thematic elements  in our BS and BSE programs, statewide, in Chemistry and in related  programs: biology, engineering, pre-healing arts - pre-med,  pre-dent, pre-vet.  These common themes, stressed strongly in the  lower division courses, will be chosen after careful study of  existing and potential model curricula.  Particularly stressed will  be the theme that contemporary chemistry is conducted as a more  interdisciplinary enterprise than current compartmentalized  chemistry curricula would suggest.   ***",
