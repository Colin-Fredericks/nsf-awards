Such models will provide a rich environment in which  to explore processing alternatives.  The work will be done in  collaboration with industry.  Two areas of deformation processing  will be modeled, hot mill rolling, particularly reversing miss, and  thin section extrusion.  Results from finite element analyses will  be used to validate the analytical solutions.  The work on hot  sheet rolling mills is primarily aimed at evaluating through-  thickness and thermal effects.  The study is divided into two  areas, thermal effects resulting from roll surface thermal boundary  layers and temperature dependent constitutive behavior, and a thick  slab, three-dimensional rolling model based on generalized plane  strain.  The work on extrusion will be a non-standard application  of asymptotic methods aimed at developing a die design tool for  thin section extrusion.       The application of results obtained from this research will  include both hot reversing mills and hot continuous mills.  The  lack of good models for deformation processing has been a limiting  factor in the optimization and control of these processes.",
