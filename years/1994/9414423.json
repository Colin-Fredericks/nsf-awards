 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414423  Logan  This is an award to support research on the potential utilization  of sodium chlorate as an electron acceptor for metabolic  processes in microorganisms that are capable of utilizing organic  contaminants of soil and aquifers as a source of respiratory  carbon.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted under  conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory  Research (SGER).  The investigator plans on exploring the use of  sodium chlorate to permit white rot fungi, known for their  capability of degrading aromatic hydrocarbons of pollutional  significance, to continue respiring after the formation of a  fungal mat at the gas/liquid interface inhibits or prevents the  entry of atmospheric oxygen into the fluid containing the  contaminants.    Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for  further exploration of the potential use of sodium chlorate as a  source of respiratory oxygen under conditions that prevent or  inhibit use of oxygen from atmospheric sources.  Success in that  respect is likely to result in application of this concept to  decontamination of soil and groundwater aquifers contaminated by  biodegradable organic substances.",
