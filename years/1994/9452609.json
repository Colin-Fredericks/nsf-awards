 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452609  Lahamer  Berea College will modernize an instrument-based physics laboratory  for physics students. The laboratory work will be coordinated with  two two-semester courses covering topics in mechanics, electricity  and magnetism, waves and optics, and modern physics. Emphasis of  this project is on modernizing and adding new experiments in modern  physics including nuclear spectroscopy and installing  computer-based data acquisition systems for measurement, control,  and analysis of physical systems with direct interfaces to the  phenomena under investigation. These systems will allow voltage  measurements at up to 60 kHz sampling frequency, interval timing,  and curve fitting and graphing. The requested equipment will  greatly enhance the basic goals of developing an appreciation of  the scientific method, demonstrating basic physical principles,  teaching the practice and theory of measurement and providing the  opportunity for students to use laboratory instruments. Our  implementation of these goals will have the additional benefit of  introducing the students to current analytical techniques for  materials analysis, and to computer data acquisition and analysis.",
