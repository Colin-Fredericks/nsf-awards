The main themes grew out of problems in quasiconformal and  quasiregular mappings.  The work expanded in recent years to  include methods from harmonic analysis, calculus of variations,  Sobolev spaces, differential geometry and topology.  A major  impetus to the current state of quasiconformal mapping was given  by work of Sullivan and Donaldson on quasiconformal mappings of  four-manifolds.  In the course of this research, new  differential equations were discovered which in many ways  generalize the familiar Cauchy-Riemann system or the Beltrami  equation.  Basic questions to be studied include that of finding  conditions thatensure weakly quasiregularity implies strong  quasiregularity.  Work will also be done investigating  singularities of these mappings and the connection between  dimension and removable sets of singularities.  Additional  efforts will be made to analyze A- harmonic mappings and singular  integrals which carry certain algebraic structures, such as  Grassmannn or Clifford algebras with a goal of determining  dimension-free norms on the integrals when treated as  transformations of function spaces.         Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates onthe accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
