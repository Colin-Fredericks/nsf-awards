Organizers are Dr. James Vary, Iowa State  University, Ames, and Dr. Galileo Violini,  Universidad de El Salvador.  The objective is to  analyze the current status of science in the region  with the purpose of developing a program to build  research and education collaborations with the U.S.  and other developed nations. The U.S. participants  include noted scientists with strong interests in  promoting science education and research in  developing countries.      There is a widely recognized need to improve the  level of science teaching and research in most  Central American and Caribbean countries.  Due  mostly to the low number of scientists at the  masters and doctorate levels in these countries,  there is an inadequate pool of properly prepared  college level science educators.  Consequently, few  significant programs of science research are  established . To address these issues over the long  term, topics of discussion during the conference  will include, among others, advanced studies  programs, modalities of realization, use of new  technologies for teaching and communication, and  establishment of international links between  research groups.  ***",
