 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed to investigate how copies of a data object in  a distributed database system should be placed on the nodes of a  network, in order to maximize data availability and reliability and  reduce communication cost.  This work is an extension of work that  has been done by the investigator and colleagues in the more  specific cases of ring, tree, and hypercube networks.  Although the  general problem cannot be efficiently solved for arbitrary  networks, many solvable, open sub-problems remain.  There are two  related questions that must be studied.  The first is, \"Where  should the copies of data objects be placed (i.e., at what sites of  the distributed database), in order to maximize the probability of  a successful read-only, write-only, or read-write transaction?  A  ring, tree, hypercube, or other well-structured network, such as a  toroidal mesh, can be studied to suggest solutions to the more  general problem of optimal placement of copies on an arbitrary  network.  Another question primary to the solution of the placement  problem is, \"What is the optimal number of copies of a data item to  maximize the probability of a successful transaction or minimize  communication cost?\"  In fact, these two questions must be studied  together.  This research will explore the more general question of  how many copies of a particular data item should be placed on the  network and where they should be placed.  The research will use  combinatorics, probability theory, linear algebra, and database  concepts to study these questions, in order to determine how to  maximize the availability of data requested by transactions, where  the objects requested by the transactions and the sites at which  the transactions originate are defined by two (usually different)  probability distributions.  The two major thrusts of this work will  be to utilize the concept of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of  a graph to study data availability on general networks and to  employ the conjecture that well- structured networks (rings,trees,  hypercubes, etc.) can be used to suggest heuristics for general  networks.  The primary applications of the work proposed are in the  area of information retrieval, specifically digital libraries and  remote sensed data and mobile computing.  The solution to these  problems will decrease the average time required to access  information in a distributed database and increase the probability  that a successful transaction occurs when links in the network  fail.",
