Through court  cases involving domestic violence, the law defines not only what  constitutes criminal violence but also what constitutes  appropriate behavior for men and women in intimate relationships.   In order to examine the role courts play in reinforcing or  challenging cultural meanings about gender and violence, this  project studies the changing ways domestic violence cases are  handled in a single local court over a period of 140 years.    Data will collected through a detailed study of court records and  observation of court officials as they process cases.  Court  records indicate how domestic violence is described by victims,  justified by batterers, and determined to be acceptable or not by  judges over this time period.  The ethnographic research will  document how these cases are currently being handled and how  court officials, defendants, and victims now think and talk about  wife battering.  The location of the study, a small town in the  plantation region of Hawai'i, is one which has experienced  American colonialism and now has a culturally plural community.",
