 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projects discussed in this proposal represent  interdisciplinary work in the Department of Chemistry and  other Departments at Iowa State University dealing with a  common theme: the importance of protein structure and  dynamics for protein function.    The problem discussed in this proposal range from the  assembly and folding of proteins, the structural role of  proteins in determining efficient energy transfer among  naturally occurring photosynthetic pigments, and the way in  which proteins interact with surfaces.    In order to address these representative problems, dedicated  equipment is required.  Because proteins are the central  theme of proposal, instruments to synthesize and to purify  long-chain peptides on a large scale and to characterize  their structural integrity are requested.  The carefully  designed proteins will be subjected to studies described in  the text that characterize their interactions with surfaces  either by Fourier transform infrared and Raman techniques or  that monitor their reactivity on time scales from hundreds  of femotseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds by various time-  resolved techniques.",
