 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide superior instrumentation to educate  technicians for emerging high technology biology-based careers in  the manufacturing and production phase of the biotechnology  industry. The Biotechnology Associate in Science degree,  certificate and industry specific training programs offered by the  NH Technical Colleges/Institute are the only programs in the state  that will train technicians for entry level employment into the  biotechnology industry and for further education at four year  colleges in New Hampshire and other states. The contextual learning  that takes place in the cornerstone courses, Biotechnology  Experience I and II, will produce technicians that know how to  function in the biotechnology industry. The interactive multimedia  teaching and independent student learning laboratory will  facilitate the teaching and learning of conceptually difficult  aspects of the practice of biotechnology. The resource center  created by the very existence of the biotechnology facility located  at NH Technical College at Pease will connect students, educators,  government and bioindustry representatives interested in the  development of New Hampshire's and New England's biotechnology  industry and will help to nurture a seamless infrastructure which  will provide multiple entrances into and exits from education and  jobs in biotechnology.",
