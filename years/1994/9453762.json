 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453762  Gottfried    The Calvert Marine Museum will develop an exhibit and complementary  programming interpreting the Miocene Age marine life.  Treasure  from the Cliffs: Exploring Marine Fossils will use the world famous  fossils of Calvert Cliffs as the basis for the exhibit.  It is  their intention to convey a strong sense of the personal process of  discovery and the creative component of scientific inquiry to the  exhibit visitors.  In their words, \"The overriding purpose of  Treasure from the Cliffs is to model a new paradigm for natural  history exhibits: to take a humanistic and holistic approach that  recognizes the centrality of imagination to the scientific  enterprise, and that engages curiosity and creativity -- as well as  intellect -- in the process of science learning.\"  Upon entering  the exhibit, a visitor's interest will be peeked by seeing the  large, dramatically lit, fossil Great White Shark Tooth.  Visitors  will get involved in the wonder and process of science at the  beginning of the exhibit in the Paleontology Office/Lab and Fossil  Identification area.  They will then move on to see a replicated  section of the Calvert Cliffs and cases illustrating how fossil  deposits form.  Two recreated Miocene dioramas one of which will  include a full-size skeletal reconstruction of the giant fossil  Great White Shark come next.  Visitors will then be able to  investigate on their own in a reading station and a video and  demonstration theater.  Visitors will exit the exhibit after a  section that shows how the modern Chesapeake Bay was formed.  This  leads them seamlessly into the museum's next exhibit hall Estuary  Patuxent: A River and its Life.  The museum will develop a series  of complementary programs in association with this exhibit to reach  a wider audience that will include formal educators among others.   They will organize a speakers service, develop a fossil field  guide, and produce a video about the Great White Shark.",
