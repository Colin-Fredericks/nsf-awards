 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303037  Guest  This award will support a cooperative research  project between Professor Martin Guest,  Department of Mathematics, University of  Rochester, New York, and Professor Mutsuo Oka,  Department of Mathematics, Tokyo Institute of  Technology in Japan.  Dr. Yoshihiro Ohnita of  the Tokyo Metropolitan University and Dr. Mikio  Furuta at Tokyo University will also  participate in the project.  During his twelve-  month visit Professor Guest and his Japanese  colleagues will continue their previous joint  research on the topology of the space of  harmonic maps of a Riemann surface into a Lie  group.  These maps are of interest from the  point of view of traditional differential  geometry and also from the point of view of  gauge theories in mathematical physics.  The  researchers will study a systematical  description of the singularities of complete  intersection varieties and singularities of the  mappings.  A complete intersection variety will  be interpreted as the regular fiber of a  holomorphic mapping between affine or toric  spaces.  They  will attempt to determine how  the topology of regular fiber or singular  fibers changes under a homotopy of a given  mapping.    Results of the research have probable  application in advanced mathematics theories as  well as various areas of physics such as  theoretical atomic physics.  Professor Guest is  an accomplished mathematician who is currently  one of several authorities working in the field  of variational principles (harmonic maps) as  applied to problems in mathematical physics,  specifically solitons and gauge theory.  Dr.  Oka is an authority on toric varieties. Dr.  Ohnita has expertise in the area of  differential geometry, especially Lie groups  and harmonic maps and Dr. Furuta's specialty is  moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons.  Japan  is a world leader in the areas of toric  varieties and infinite dimensional Lie algebras  and integrable systems.  Since the investiga-  tor's previous collaboration proved to be very  produ ctive in terms of new directions of  research as well as in terms of publications it  is anticipated that the proposed project will  provide similar new scientific opportunities.   This project is supported by the NSF-CGP  (Center for Global Partnership) Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
