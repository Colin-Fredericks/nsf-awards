 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406573  Stredulinsky         One of the outstanding open problems in solar astrophysics  is the existence of enormously high temperatures in the sun's  corona, on the order of a million degrees Kelvin, which have  baffled astrophysicists for generations. The main object of this  project is to give a careful mathematical analysis of a theory  due to E.N. Parker which claims that coronal heating is primarily  due to the formation of certain violent disruptions in the suns  magnetic field (the formation of current sheets) associated with  solar flares. Due to the relationship with sun spots and solar  flares the issue of coronal heating is directly tied to the  practical issues of variations in the earth's climate and  electromagnetic interference. The main focus of the analysis will  be the study of tube like loops of magnetic field lines with ends  anchored in the suns surface or photosphere. It is proposed that  current sheets form when the ends of such a tube are twisted more  than a certain critical amount.       In attempting to understand the phenomenon of current sheet  formation in Parker's model of coronal heating, the equations of  ideal 3D magnetohydrodynamics will studied in an open flux tube  geometry. Existence of solutions will be considered subject to  prescription of the twist in the magnetic field lines from one  end of the tube to the other. It is conjectured that smooth  solutions will exist up to a certain critical twist, at which  point current sheets will form i.e. the curl of the magnetic  field (the current) will become a singular measure, the singular  part supported on a set of finite two dimensional measure. The  transition from subcritical to critical values of the twist is  conjectured to correspond to a critical exponent in a geometric  type of Sobolev inequality linked to the topology of the field  line structure. The main emphasis will be placed on the constant  pressure or force free case of ideal MHD. Existence of solutions  will be studied through the use of an  iteration scheme which  avoids the lack on compactness inherent in many variational  approaches to the problem.",
