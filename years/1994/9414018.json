 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application is a request for monies that wiU be  applied toward the purchase of modern  MS/MS instrumentation. Thirteen projects are included in the  application. The projects have been  submitted by participating investigators that are located in  7 academic departments from both the  main campus and the medical center. The university-wide  participation demonstrates a widespread  appreciation of the critical need for in-house MS/MS at Wake  Forest University. AU of the  investigators have used mass spectrometry in their research  and the availability of MS/MS  techniques wiU dramatically improve the effectiveness of  these investigators.      The MS/MS instrumentation will be used for the analysis of  a variety of complex molecules.  Samples will be ionized by one of several techniques  including: electrospray, cesium ion LSIMS,  or EUCI. A variety of compounds will be examined using the  MS/MS instrument including small,  complex organic monomers, peptides, and proteins. The VG  Quattro-II triple stage quadrupole  mass spectrometer having the foUowing options wiU fiU our  current needs: extended mass range,  EI and CI ionization source and interface, a data system  controUed gas chromatograph equipped  with split/splitless and cool on-column GC injectors, cesium  ion LSIMS, and an API LC-MS  interface for both classical and pneumaticaUy assisted low  flow rate electrospray.      The types of projects that will be supported by the MS/MS  system fall into three broad  categories. The first category of projects involves  structure analysis of smaller molecules, <2,500  amu. Several projects are included from synthetic chemists  desiring to determine the structures of  complex organic molecules and from biochemists studying the  oxidations of lipids and proteins.  These investigators wiU employ LSIMS, electrospray, and  El/CI techniques.      The second category of projects are from investigators  that need to 1) determine the masses of  proteins that are then generated by site-directed   mutagenesis, 2) assess modifications to proteins  subjected to oxidative stress, or 3) analyze chemical  modifications that are generated in mechanistic  studies of enzyme action. In projects utilizing site-  directed mutagenesis, it is desirable to generate  proteins that have well defined modifications of the primary  structure. Electrospray techniques wiU  be employed to ensure that these proteins have been properly  processed. In the studies on protein  oxidation, the degree of oxidation and the number of oxygen  atoms added to the protein will be  assessed by the electrospray technique. In the mechanistic  studies, reactive substrates are added to  the protein and the result of the experiment is assessed by  determining the change in mass of  enzyme exposed to the reactive substrate. In addition to  analyzing purified proteins, mixtures of  peptides can be separated on the HPLC system and directly  introduced into the mass spectrometer  via the electrospray interface. Analysis of these fragments  is essential for determining the specific  region of the protein that has undergone chemical changes.      The last category of projects uses MS/MS for two types of  analyses. The first category will  employ CID techniques to assess the fatty acid composition  of phospholipids. One of the users  will employ this technique to identify which phospholipids  contain arachidonic acid and then assess  how the distribution of arachidonic acid changes in response  to the activation of metabolic  pathways that utilize arachidonic acid. The second type of  analysis will use CID techniques to  determine the sequence of small peptides. This type of  analysis will be employed to verify the site  of substitution by mutagenesis, determine the primary  sequence of a peptide, or determine which  amino acid has been modified after free radical oxidation or  after other chemical treatments.      At least two significant benefits will accrue to the  university from the acquisition of MS/MS  instrumentation. The first  benefit is an improved research  environment. Eight of the thirteen  investigators are junior faculty less than 40 years of age  and access to MS/MS is essential for their  career development. The programs of senior investigators  will continue to grow by having access  to advanced MS/MS techniques. The second benefit is the  improved training that will be available  to our graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.        Page 4",
