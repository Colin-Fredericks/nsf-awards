The project will engage the  students in an eight week program of experimentation, exploration  and computation leading them to consider serious mathematical  problems drawn from several areas.  These include harmonic  analysis related to wavelets and fractals, stability of periodic  circle packings, interactive particle system models of ecosystem  dynamics and superconvergence points in spline-Galerkin methods.  On problems related to nonlinear phenomena, as students will be  offered a number of open-ended problems and encouraged to attack  them numerically and analytically.  To assist the investigations,  students will be given instruction in the using computer  facilities. Additional students supported by REU supplements on  research grants will provide additional opportunities for healthy  interaction among the students.  Students will present the  results of their work orally as well asin written form.       Recruiting efforts will focus on attracting applications  from students in underrepresented groups, especially through  personal contacts.  ***",
