We will study these changes and also those that  occur when myosin heads bind to the thin filament.  Neutron  scattering and diffraction will be used to study filamentous  samples in vitro.  Selective deuteration of one or more of the  members of a complex will allow either the protonated or  deuterated member(s) to be rendered \"invisible\" to neutrons by  solvent contrast matching or a related method.  Structural  changes of the visible components can thus be investigated in  situ with little ambiguity.  The average cross-helix distance  between the tropomyosin (Tm) molecules will be investigated +Ca2  and both with and without myosin subfragment 1 (S1).  Tm ordering  in thin filaments will be investigated +Ca2.  Changes in the  structure of F-actin as a member of the thin filament will be  investigated +Ca2+.  If such changes are found, the structure of  F-actin in situ will be refined to understand the nature of these  changes.  The average cross-helix separation between whole Tn and  Tn subunits (TnC, TnI and TnT) will be studied +Ca2+ and +S1.  We  will search for circumferential movement of Tn +Ca2+.  We will  measure the in situ shape of the TnI-TnC complex and search for  shape changes +Ca2+ and +S1.  We will determine the orientation  of TnC in thin filaments and study its changes upon Ca2+ binding.   We expect that the proposed experiments will important new  information about structural changes occurring in the regulation  of vertebrate muscle contraction and will help to resolve current  controversies.  %%%  The control of vertebrate muscle contraction is regulated by the  binding and unbinding of Ca2+ to the thin filament protein  troponin.  Upon Ca2+ binding, structural changes occur in the  thin filament which mediate the interaction of the proteins  responsible for muscle contraction (myosin and actin) when fuel  (ATP) is  present.  Neutron scattering will be used to study thin  filament samples.  Selective deuteration of one or more of the  members of a complex will allow the (native) protonated member(s)  to be rendered effectively \"invisible\" to neutrons by varying the  D2O content of the sample.  Structural changes of the visible  components, +Ca2+, will then be investigated in situ with little  ambiguity.  We believe that studies such as these, in addition to  increasing our knowledge of vertebrate muscle control, can help  us understand other forms of biological control and, in  particular, how the binding of small ions to proteins can cause  large-scale macromolecular and physiological changes.   Development of some of the methodologies to be employed, such as  deuteration of cloned proteins and neutrons scattering  techniques, may be related to national efforts in biotechnology.  ***",
