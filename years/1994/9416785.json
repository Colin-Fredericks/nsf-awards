CRAW, a committee of the Computing Research Association (CRA), was established in 1990.  The goal of the Committee is to take positive action to increase the number of women participating in computer science and engineering research and education at all levels.  Dr. Mary Jane Irwin, a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Fran Berman, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego are co-chairs of CRAW.    CRAW has been very active in recommending and organizing projects and in many cases obtaining separate funding for them.  Members of CRAW have produced several articles on women's issues in CS for the Computing Research News; have started the Systers-Academia, a moderated electronic mailing list for female faculty and Ph.D. students in CS&E; have established the Ph.D. database of women with Ph.D's in CS&E; and have presented career management workshops at major conferences and events (with additional funding).    The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research.  The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research community and to support and promote its interests.  ***",
