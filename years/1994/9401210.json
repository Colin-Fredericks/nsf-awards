 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourth FASEB Conference on Plant Gene Expression will  bring together cell biology and molecular genetic approaches  to the study of plant development.  The meeting topic was  chosen in light of recent success in gene cloning combined  with technological advances that permit analysis of  developmental events at a finer level than previously  permitted.  The session cover topics ranging from  gametogenesis through reproduction.   Attempts to balance  the use of genetics and cell biology will be focused on in  each session, including a consideration of the factors that  influence cell fate, such as neighboring cells, the  environment, the cytoskeleton, and meristem prepatterning.  The meeting should provide an atmosphere for the exchange of  data and ideas gained from different experimental systems.  The FASEB meeting will focus on development, rather than  attempting to cover all areas of plant biology.  By  combining genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to  questions of development, scientists should come together  who may not normally attend the same meetings.",
