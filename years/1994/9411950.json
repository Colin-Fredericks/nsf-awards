 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411950  Bull       This experimental study examines molecular evolution in  recombinant DNA phages.  The recombinant phage are constructed to  specifically address two topics of interest in molecular evolution:  1) the molecular evolution of essential transgenes (phage capsid  and assembly genes) and 2) the evolution of RNA polymerase-promoter  interactions.  Transgenic phage will be characterized at the  molecular level via sequence analysis and at the phenotypic level  via fitness levels.  The fitness of transgenic phage is initially  low, but increases rapidly when subjected to laboratory natural  selections via serial propagation.  After a response to selection  for increased fitness is observed, the phage will be re-  characterized at the molecular and phenotypic levels.  Initial  genetic manipulations will lead to specific expectations as to  which genetic elements should evolve and how they will change over  the course of evolution.       This system of experimental molecular evolution in  bacteriophage is a powerful new approach in evolutionary biology.   Transgenic organisms have become increasingly popular in many areas  of biology and industry.  This project will for the first time  directly address questions concerning how transgenes evolve, what  their effects are on other genes, and how these combined molecular  changes affect evolution of fitness at the organismal level.",
