The first concerns the study of  Hodge theory for the de Rham complex using different inner  products that the usual quadratic one.  The work should provide  new insights into the regularity theory for elliptic problems as  well as insight into the structure of the harmonic space.  The  Hodge theory for the de Rham complex has important geometric  interpretations.  A second project involves the development of  special function spaces adapted to specific boundary  value problems on specific domains.  Along with recent advances  in operator theory, the idea of designing functions for  particular applications should have far-reaching applications.   In another direction, work will be don on basic elements of  harmonic analysis and function theory on domains in complex  Euclidean space.   This includes the theory of hardy spaces,  functions of bounded mean oscillation, the corona problem, and  Lipschitz spaces.  An important theme in the work focuses on the  geometry of the boundary of the domain and how it determines the  function theory on the interior.  In particular questions of  boundary uniqueness and rigidity for holomorphic functions and  mappings will be taken up.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematicalmodeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  When the  equations are defined over domains in several complex variables,  as they are in this project, the scope of the work increases  considerably to take into account the large body of existing work  available in the study of holomorphic functions of seve ral  complex variables and the corresponding domains.  ***",
