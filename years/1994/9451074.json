New construction graduates are expected to perform well on often  unprecedented and complex construction projects. Inadequacies in  their construction education have had grave consequences, including  building and bridge failures. To prevent and remedy this situation,  the investigators propose to incorporate simulation models for  Construction Operations using Virtual Reality (COVR) in the  Construction Program at The Ohio State University. Using COVR  models students will immerse in a deep simulation process, allowing  them to \"participate\" and \"be in charge\" in virtual construction  operations. Initially, COVR will include the development of two  models commonly encountered in state-of-the-art construction  practice as well as in academic context: deep foundation  construction and bridge erection. Since in the future, COVR can be  expanded to accommodate numerous models its potential contribution  to the curriculum is tremendous. In addition, COVR may become a  model for other disciplines and institutions to enhance their  undergraduate curriculum. In order for COVR to be technically  sound, creative, well developed, worthwhile, and realistic, the  acquisition of virtual reality instruments is essential. With the  NSF support and OSU commitment to furnish additional/matching  support, the acquisition of the following three instruments are  planned: desk-top Binocular Omni-Orientation Monitors (BOOM2C-DT),  SGI graphic workstations (WB-TWO50EX), Beachtron 3-D sound systems,  and World Tool Kit software. COVR models will be completed in 2.5  years. COVR is expected to greatly enhance students' construction  education by encouraging creative thinking and problem solving  skills and by providing more practical training, and a greater feel  for construction, as well as a greater understanding of overall  structural behavior, and of understanding the un derlying causes of  construction failures.",
