 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates finding fast algorithms for  constraint satisfaction problems.  A constraint satisfaction  problem is one in  which a series of constraints is imposed on a  set of discrete variables.  The  task is to find a set of values  for all the variables that satisfies all the  constraints  simultaneously.  For example, when scheduling traffic lights each  light may be in one of only three discrete states.  Furthermore,  there are  constraints on the states of the traffic lights that  require that no two  cross-streets get green lights at the same  time.  A constraint satisfaction  problem may have thousands of  variables and thousands of constraints.  Constraint satisfaction problems arise in diverse areas.  These  include  generating tests of correctness for electronic circuits,  understanding line  drawings by computer, solving combinatorial  problems, and predicting the  folding of RNA molecules.  The set  of constraint satisfaction problems is one  of the NP complete  problem sets, so it is unlikely that a fast algorithm for  all  constraint satisfaction problems will ever be found.  Indeed,  brute force  algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems may  be extremely slow.  Nonetheless, algorithms have been found that  are fast for most problems in  certain NP complete problem sets.  This research concerns finding and  characterizing the  algorithms and problem sets for which constraint  satisfaction  problems can be solved quickly, with the aim of finding general  algorithms that are fast over as wide a range of problem sets as  possible.",
