 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360378  Tidwell  In an effort to reach higher powers,  laser researchers have developed  larger and increasingly complex   devices. An alternate scaling  approach is to combine the output  power of many simple low-power  lasers in an  array. Microlasers are  the perfect array elements because  they are mass-producible and have  polarized, singlefrequency,  diffraction-limited outputs.  Aculight has developed a unique  microlaser array based on the desire  for coherent operation. A coherent   array with N elements produces an  output beam that is N times more  powerful on a distant target or N  times  smaller at the focus of a  lens than an incoherent N-element  array. Since microlaser arrays can  easily contain several hundred  elements, the benefit of coherent  operation is great. Coherent  operation opens applications in   machining and processing of advanced  materials such as composites and  ceramics. It also enables  applications  requiring the output  wavelength to be converted to other  parts of the spectrum using  nonlinear optics. Coherent   operation is also the next step  toward electronic beam steering for  military and commercial  applications. These  opportunities  are possible only with the previous  development of the Aculight  mircolaser array hardware.  The objective of the proposed Phase  I program will be to demonstrate  coherent operation of the Aculight   microlaser array. We will fabricate  servo control electronics for the  array and integrate the circuitry  into the existing computer. We will  test the sensitivity of the laser to  variations in power, cooling, and  other variables to determine the  ultimate commercial feasibility. The  anticipated result is a compact,  scalable laser with high beam  quality and single-frequency output.",
