There are four projects that will  be undertaken as components of this research program.  The \"Zero  Dispersion Limits of Nonlinear Wave Equations\" and \"Macroscopic  Lattice Dynamics\" projects both involve the study of the limiting  behavior of dynamical systems with small amounts of dispersion.   The goal is to construct macroscopic models that consist of  modulation equations for families of exact solutions of these  systems, and to identify those regions of phase space in which  such models are valid.  Both analytical and numerical tools will  be employed, and both integrable and non-integrable systems will  be considered.  The \"NLS Limit of the CGL Equation\" project  studies the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation as a model for  \"turbulent\" dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations  in which the \"inviscid\" limit is the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS)  equation.  This relationship is in direct analogy to that of the  driven Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations in  incompressible fluid turbulence.  The structures of the NLS  equation (which is even integrable in one space dimension for the  cubic case) will be used to provide coordinates for the CGL phase  space.  The \"Moment Closure Hierarchies for Kinetic Equations\",  and \"Numerical Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems\" projects study a  systematic nonperturbative derivation of a hierarchy of closed  systems of moment equations corresponding to any classical  kinetic theory and the numerical schemes to implement them.   Unlike earlier moment closures, every member of the hierarchy is  a hyperbolic system with relaxation terms and entropy, and hence,  is formally well-posed.  Every member also formally recovers the  Euler limit, while members beyond the second recover a  Navier-Stokes correction consistent with the true Navier-Stokes  system.  The related \"Kinetic Theory\" project is more theoretical  in natur e.  It will try to rigorously establish the linearized  Euler limit of the Boltzmann equation and the existence of the  Boltzmann shock profile.  Both of these are long standing open  problems that may be amenable to the techniques developed in  earlier work with Bardos and Golse.  The \"Global Ocean  Circulation Modeling\" project studies the long-time effects of  topography and hydrostatic imbalance on shallow inviscid  incompressible flows, with a free boundary, over a varying  bottom.  An asymptotic expansion of the three-D Euler equations  leads to a system of shallow water equations that captures weak  hydrostatic imbalances and dispersion due to topography, yet  inherits several structural properties of the two-D Euler  equations.  For example, it conserves an energy norm, possesses a  circulation theorem, and has a Hamiltonian form.  This structure  will facilitate both the analytical study of this system and the  development of sound numerical schemes.    The unifying theme that runs through the projects supported is to  understand how collective large-scale behavior of dynamical  systems arise.  From a physical perspective this effort could be  viewed as a study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  But  it is more than that, for it strives to discover and study new  nonlinear phenomena that could impact the way models are  developed for many important physical processes.  The projects  are divided into four groups.  The first group impacts the  theories of super-fluidity and super-conductivity.  The second  contributes to our understanding of turbulent fluids.  The third  will find application in a wide range of problems such as  hypersonic flight and nano-scale semiconductors.  The fourth is a  first step in the effort to develop global climate models that  are both accurate and economical.",
