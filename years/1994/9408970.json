 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408970  Schneider    The delivery of services by local governments involves a complex  series of steps going from the institutions that supply them to  the citizens who use them.  To improve the delivery of public  services, many reformers now suggest eliminating some of these  steps and having government imitate private markets, by  increasing the number of suppliers and \"empowering\" citizens to  shop around.  This market model assumes consumers already know  about the services they use or that they will search to find out  about price and quality.  While the costs of, and the incentives  for, search in private markets are fairly well understood, the  ability of \"citizen/consumers\" to gain information in the use of  local public goods is not well known.    This project will explore the process of information gathering in  local public services, with a primary focus on education, perhaps  the most important service provided by local governments.  In  recent years a few local school districts have established  parental choice, breaking the tight relationship between  household location and the schools that children must attend.   Since these districts can be matched with others that have not  introduced choice, we will examine if and how choice affects  parental behavior and student performance.    Specifically, using a research design matching districts with  school choice to those without choice, this project will compare  how citizen/consumers search for information and the quality of  their information about schools.  To test for a link between  increased choice and citizen/consumer behavior, the project will  survey residents in four communities with different public  service delivery arrangements and different socioeconomic status.   The project will: 1) examine the level and the accuracy of  information citizens have about local public goods; 2) link these  levels of information and the search processes to institutional  structures that affect the incentives of individuals to gather  and  use information.  In addition, the project will:  3)examine  the networks of information in which local citizens operate and  explore how these networks influence the quantity and the quality  of information that citizens have; 2) examine the equity  implications of search procedures, especially by comparing the  networks in which individuals of different races and classes are  embedded; and, examine the efficiency gains that better matching  of student/consumer interest to school curricula can provide as  shown by improvements in student test scores in math, science and  reading.    This project promises to substantially enhance our understanding  of the topic.",
