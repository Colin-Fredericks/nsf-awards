 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408231  Abstract  Termination factor Rho catalyzes the release of transcripts from  elongating RNA polymerase at specific sites in bacterial genomes.   At least two signals appear to be required for Rho-mediated  transcription termination:  (1) a site on the nascent transcript  that binds Rho to the ternary transcription complex and activates  the Rho AtPase, and (2) a release signal, most likely located  within the RNA, that pauses the transcription complex and  kinetically couples Rho binding to transcript dissociation.  We  will apply a novel approach developed in our laboratory to  facilitate the study of Rho-dependent termination by uncoupling the  Rho attachment/transcript release reactions from transcription  elongation.  A set of transcription termination intermediates has  been constructed where RNA polymerase is physically blocked from  further elongation by a cleavage-defective EcoR1 endonuclease  mutant, EcoR1(Q111).  Rho-mediated release of transcripts from  these blocked ternary transcription complexes (BTC's) occurs quite  readily if the blockade occurs downstream of the natural  termination signal contained in the transcript.  By engineering the  blockades at different strategic locations along the Rho-dependent  terminator region, we can progressively uncover separate elements  of the signal that are required for Rho function.  Using the BTC  methodology, we have dissected the transcription termination signal  in the rho attenuator.  This terminator located in a 255 nt region  between the promoter and the Rho protein coding sequence, and  autogenously controls the level of Rho mRNA synthesis.  We propose  to continue our mutagenesis and binding site mapping analysis of  specific sequences in the attenuator that we previously showed to  be essential for Rho-dependent release.  We will also test a simple  two-step kinetic formalism to analyze the binding and release  reaction, and to determine the effects of the auxiliary termination  factors NusA and NusG proteins.  Several mode ls for termination  reaction will be tested using fluorescence spectroscopy and  electron microscopy to detect intermediates between the attachment  and release step.  The details of how the Rho RNA-DNA helicase  couples ATP hydrolysis to mechano-chemical work will be explored  using novel flow cytometry, electron microscopy and RNase H assays.  %%%  Often the expression of genes encoding information for the  synthesis of specific proteins must be controlled very tightly; too  much or too little of the gene product can have profound adverse  effects on cellular metabolism and development.  A common mechanism  for fine control of gene expression in bacteria, plants and animals  is transcription attenuation.  Attenuators are signals located in  front of genes that can conditionally stop the movement of RNA  polymerase during transcription (RNA biosynthesis).  Our laboratory  is interested in a protein factor called Rho, that catalyzes this  attenuation reaction in bacteria. Rho causes transcription  termination by binding to the RNA transcript and using the energy  stored in ATP to physically dissociate the transcript from RNA  polymerase.  Many of the details of this reaction are unknown.   Using a combination of recombinant DNA technology, biochemical  methods and high resolution electron microscopy we will determine  where and how Rho binds to the RNA transcript.  A reason for the  ATP energy requirement may be to fuel the movement of Rho along the  RNA transcript and to permit Rho to physically \"push\" the RNA off  the RNA polymerase and DNA.  To test this hypothesis, we will  construct transcription complexes containing strategically placed  fluorescent tags on the RNA. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and  flow  cytometry, we will monitor how fast Rho releases the RNA, and  determine if the fluorescent signals change intensity and  orientation during the reaction.  Such changes may provide insight  into the intermediate steps that occur between Rho attachment and  RNA release, including possib le movement of Rho on the RNA.  ***",
