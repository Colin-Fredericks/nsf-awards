The first workshop was held in Lagos during 1992  and focused on voltage regulation.  The activities of this  workshop are documented in our proceedings    \"International Workshop on Voltage Collapse and Voltage       Regulation '92\" (IWVCVR '92)  The need for increased collaboration and exchange of technical  information in planning and operation is timely for both the U.S.  and SubSaharan Africa.  Some of the planning and operational  problems include development of strategies for handling small and  large disturbance modeling problems, and inefficient and  uneconomic operations and reliability issues.  The participants  of this workshop will include countries from SubSaharan Africa  and the United States.  Power engineers from Ghana, Kenya,  Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zaire, Mozambique and Zimbabwe  will be invited to participate in tutorials, lectures,  discussions and recommendations.  ***",
