 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goode  9317963  Ceruloplasmin is a serum protein that is believed to be involved in  the transport of copper to specific extra-hepatic cells.  This  process is mediated by cell surface receptors which have been  identified in tissues such as brain, heart, placenta and aorta.   Using the bovine system, we will attempt to isolate the  ceruloplasmin receptor from brain and placenta.  The isolated  receptor will be characterized using standard techniques including  size-exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequence  analysis and peptide mapping.  Use of antibodies against the  receptor in preventing cellular uptake of copper from ceruloplasmin  will also be investigated.  In addition to studies on ceruloplasmin  receptor, we will also characterize two isoforms of bovine  ceruloplasmin.  This will be accomplished using both biochemical  and physical techniques including carbohydrate analysis, peptide  mapping, circular dichroic and atomic absorption spectroscopies and  single crystal X-ray diffraction.  Information on the role(s) and  nature of these two forms may aid in our understanding of the  mechanisms by which copper is removed from the protein into the  receptor cell.  %%%  The average American consumes 1.2-1.7 mg of copper per day of which  roughly half is actually absorbed and enters the blood and tissues.   A key player in copper metabolism is the serum protein  ceruloplasmin, which is believed to be involved in the transport of  copper to specific cells such as brain, heart and placenta.  These  cells recognize and bind ceruloplasmin through the presence of cell  surface receptors.  Our work will study the chemistry and role(s)  of different forms of bovine ceruloplasmin isolated from bovine  serum, using various biochemical and physical techniques.  In  addition we will continue to investigate the role of the membrane  receptor in copper delivery to cells.  This information will help  to clarify the role of ceruloplasmin in copper metabolism, and  perhaps give us a clearer pictu re of the mechanism by which copper  is distributed in the body.  ***",
