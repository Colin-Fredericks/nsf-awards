 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.  David Loper of Florida State University and Professor  Ibrahim Eltayeb of Sultan Qaboos University in Oman.  By  means of a series of working visits, Drs. Loper and Eltayeb  will undertake two projects in the broad areas of Applied  Mathematics and Fluid Dynamics.  These projects involve  analyzing the stability of certain fluid motions that occur  in a variety of natural settings including metallurgy and  geophysics.     The proposed research projects are part of the fabric of  current scientific interest in the structure and dynamics of  the Earth's deep interior, and their successful completion  will advance the state of our knowledge of the Earth's core  and mantle.  An additional benefit of this project is that  it will help bolster scientific research in Oman, thereby  strengthening the quality of scientific and engineering  education with the Sultanate.  ***",
