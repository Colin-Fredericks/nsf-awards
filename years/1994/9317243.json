 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317243  Berger       Adaptors are transcription factors that strengthen the  action of transactivators by physically bridging or guiding  protein interactions with the basal transcription apparatus.  The  proposed research will focus on the mechanism of action of  adaptors, to determine their physical role in the transcription  complex and how they contribute to gene regulation.  Specific  experimental objectives are to dissect the domain structure of  ADAs using in vivo and in vitro analyses, to determine whether  ADA2 physically interacts with the acidic activation domain of  the herpes virus transactivator VP16, and to identify specific  amino acid contacts between ADA2 and VP16 using classic genetic  suppression of substitution mutations in VP16.  %%%  A crucial cellular regulatory step is the decision to turn  specific genes on and off.  I am interested in the basic  principles that underlie this regulation of gene expression, and  the general mechanisms that may be common to all genes.  We are  using a simple model system for studying gene expression, namely  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker's yeast.  Yeast is an  increasingly powerful research tool for the study of basic  cellular processes, because of its unique experimental  accessibility and because the function of many regulatory  proteins is highly conserved in evolution, even between yeast and  humans.  Several separate classes of factors are required for  genes to be expressed.  These factors must physically interact  and these contacts have been the focus of intense interest, since  identification of the precise factors and how they interact will  help to explain the mechanics of the process.  We have previously  established that a novel class of factors, termed adaptors, are  important for these physical interactions.  We devised a method  in yeast to isolate the genes for adaptors and have cloned and  characterized two components of an adaptor.  Future objectives  are to dissect the structure of the adaptor, and to analyze it s  physical and functional role in the gene expression process.   These particular adaptors may be representative of a large class  of factors, and thus, as a class, may be fundamentally important  to gene regulation.  ***",
