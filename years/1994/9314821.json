However,  in view of the strong international interest and participation in  the previous seminars (19 in 1988, 18 in 1991, from Europe, Asia,  and Australia), it is proposed to hold this next on in Europe.    The purpose of the Seminar will be to discuss the best current  understanding of voltage phenomena on large scale electric power  systems, in a way that will be helpful both to the experienced  power system engineer seeking to cope with the new phenomena  which his system is experiencing, and to the academic  investigator seeking to probe deeper into those phenomena.  The  Seminar is intended to enhance understanding of the phenomenal  involved, to stimulate research and development on algorithmic  tools adequate to the needs of the industry, and to encourage  advancement of the state of the art in practical applications.  A specific emphasis in this Seminar will be technology exchanges  between young university professors and post-doctoral fellows,  through explorations of basic phenomena and state-of-the-art  analytical techniques.  This has been a major function of this  Seminar since its inception.  This is demonstrated by the 1988  and 1991 sessions, with international technical exchanges  initiated at and continuing after the sessions, particularly as  they have provided opportunities to young investigators.  The  previous sessions have included participation by investigators  from Australia (University of New South Wales), Belgium  (University de Liege), England (Imperial College, London),  Germany (Aachen University of Technology), Italy (Politecnico di  Torino, Universita di Bari), Japan (University of Tokyo, Meiji  University,Kawasaki, Hiroshima University, University of Tokyo,  Waseda University, South Korea (Seoul Natio nal University), and  Sweden (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm).  In all. over  a dozen young graduate students and assistant professors attended  these sessions.  ***",
