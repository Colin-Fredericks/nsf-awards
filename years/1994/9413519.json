 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT         We are requesting funding for a Becton Dickinson  FACsort.  There are three main objectives for the  acquisition of this instrument.  1) The FACsort will be used  extensively in ongoing studies on lymphocyte  differentiation.  These projects involve 6 to 8  undergraduate students every term, including the summer.  2)  The FACSort will be an integral part of the undergraduate  Immunology course.  3) Experiments using the FACSort will be  introduced into the Molecular Biology course.  Thus, a large  number of undergraduates will gain experience with the  fluorescence activated cell sorting through both  undergraduate courses and research experience.       Two research projects at Occidental College require  cell sorting.  Dr. Pollock's research centers on somatic  mutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes.  Somatic mutation plays an important role in generating  antibody diversity.  We are developing an assay to detect  and isolate lymphocytes undergoing somatic mutation of  immunoglobulin genes.  The assay uses a DNA construct  encoding a fusion protein composed of a rearranged V gene,  containing a stop codon, linked to a lacZ reporter gene.  If  somatic mutation reverts the stop codon, the entire fusion  protein is translated and lacZ expressed.  LacZ expression  is readily detected by fluorescence assays.  This construct  is being used in cell lines and to make transgenic mice.  These mice will be used to ask: 1) where can somatic  mutation be detected; 2) when is somatic mutation seen after  immunization; 3) when does somatic mutation first occur  during ontogeny; 4) which germinal center cells show active  somatic mutation; and 5) what is the phenotype of cells  undergoing somatic mutation.",
