The systems include the high temperature  superconductors, heavy Fermion materials and magnetic materials.  The methods to be applied involve Quantum Monte Carlo, often  coupled with analytical techniques.  The properties on interest  are dynamical response and the models of interest include the  Hubbard, Anderson, Holstein and Kondo.  In addition, the effect  of magnetic impurities on week localization will be studied as  well as 3D disordered correlated systems (via a disordered  Hubbard model with strong correlations on a fraction of the  sites).  Also the PI will continue work on analytic continuation.  %%%  This proposal concerns the calculation of electronic properties  in systems in which the electrons are highly correlated.  Such  systems include the high temperature superconductors and magnetic  materials.  Because these systems are so complex, the effort will  be on the understanding of model systems - chosen because they  incorporate most of the important physics of a wide class of  materials.  Thus generic behavior may be found.  The properties  of interest include transport coefficients (eg conductivity),  spectra and the lifetimes of different states of a given system.  The methodology involves sophisticated numerical simulation as  well as clever techniques to extract information from the numbers  so-found.  This proposal represents strategic but fundamental  work in the understanding of the basic physics of important  technological materials.  ***",
