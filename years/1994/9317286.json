 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317286  Clarke      It is proposed to clone and characterize the cDNA for  the 100 kD vacuolar ATPase.  Preliminary studies in the PI's  laboratory resulted in the isolation from a Dictyostelium  expression library of a 1.1 kb cDNA that encodes the epitope  that is recognized by the anti-100 kD monoclonal antibody.  The ORF of 326 amino acids encoded by this cDNA is 39%  identical (77% similar) to the amino terminus of the 96 kD  subunit of the rat coded vesicle/sinaptic vesicle V-ATPase.  The complete cDNA for the 100 kD protein will be cloned, and  its predicted amino acid sequence and protein structure will  be compared to those of the homologous mammalian V-ATPase  subunit.  Secondly, gene targeting experiments will be used  to explore the function of this protein.  Dictyostelium  cells will be transformed with vectors designed to disrupt  the gene for the 100 kD protein through homologous  recombination, or to reduce its mRNA levels through  antisense mutagenesis.  The resulting mutants will be  characterized to determine whether or not proton pumps are  correctly assembled and targeted, and whether the mutant  cells are defect in their ability to cope with hypoosmotic  stress.  These studies will help to elucidate the role of a  highly conserved and poorly understood subunit of V-ATPases.  They may also reveal functions beyond osmoregulation that  are carried out by the contractile vacuole complex.  %%%  Contractile vacuoles are osmoregulatory organelles found in  freshwater amoebae and protozoa.  The means by which they  accumulate, sequester  and expel water remains mysterious.  They may also serve other functions such as regulation of  intracellular ion levels, but this has not been  demonstrated.  The most distinctive feature of contractile  vacuole membranes is  their extremely high content of  vacuolar type proton pumps , which are likely to play an  essential role  in water accumulation and other transport  activities carried out by the contractile vacuoles.  Monoclonal antibodies  are available  that recognize two  subunits  of the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase)  in  Dictyostelium.  One of these subunits is an integral  membrane protein of approximately 100 kD whose mammalian  counterpart has been postulated to be responsible for the  targeting  of proton pumps to the correct endomembranes.  The present project will employ molecular genetics to  explore the role of this V-ATPase subunit in Dictyostelium.  ***",
