 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301326  HILDRETH    When an observer moves through the environment, a continually  changing visual image appears on the surface of the eye.  The  motion of features in this image conveys information about the  direction and speed of movement of the observer through space, as  well as about the three-dimensional motion of other objects in the  environment.  It is known that from image motion alone, human  observers can judge their 3-D direction of translation relative to  a stationary scene with high accuracy.  The recovery of the  observer's movement from image motion becomes far more challenging  when the environment contains objects that undergo their own motion  through space.  This research will investigate the mechanisms by  which the human visual system analyzes the motions of the observer  and objects in the environment from information available in the  changing visual image.  Psychophysical experiments will examine the  accuracy with which humans judge their 3-D direction of translation  when viewing dynamic visual displays that simulate the motion of an  observer toward a scene containing moving objects.  Further  experiments will test the human ability to detect moving objects,  measure their 3-D direction of translation relative to the  observer, and judge the time-to-collision of the observer with  approaching objects.  The successful navigation of human observers  through complex dynamic scenes requires that these tasks be  performed with high accuracy.  Computational models will be  developed that capture the behavior observed in these experiments.   These models will be implemented and tested in a computer vision  system that recovers the 3-D motion of a mobile camera and moving  objects from a sequence of digitized 2-D images.    The results of this work will further our knowledge of how the  human system uses the analysis of image motion to perform tasks  such as navigation through complex scenes.  They will also  contribute to the development of successful computer vision sys tems  for autonomous navigation and to applications requiring the  interpretation of 3-D motion and structure from dynamic imagery in  domains such as robotics, medical imaging, and surveillance.    ***",
