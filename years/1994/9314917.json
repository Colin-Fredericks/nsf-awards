 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314917 Strickland  The main objective of this work is to develop computer analysis techniques for representing and analyzing large, multidimensional scalar and vector data sets generated by flow visualization experiments.  The fundamental premise is that complex flows can be decomposed into simpler, physically meaningful flow components, and that doing so facilitates computer assisted flow analysis.  Large 3D regions of the data will be segmented into smaller, computationally manageable volumes.  The interaction between the spatial distribution of critical points and the order of the nonlinear model will be studied.  Modeling techniques will be tested on experimental 3D vector field data.   Turbulent flows will be modeled using the tools of chaotic dynamical systems, namely fractals and iterated function systems (IFS).  The goal is to solve the classic inverse problem - given the image of a flow, or the velocity field, derive an IFS  from which reconstruction of the input data is possible. The dynamical systems models will be used for feature (e.g. vortex) identification, feature tracking in time sequences, and animation and visualization.  Data acquired from established laboratories will be used to test the modeling paradigms and their utility in flow analysis.  This work will address the needs voiced by he fluids, aerodynamics, and combustion and heat transfer communities concerning the automation of computer assisted methods for processing and interpreting large fluid flow data sets. ***",
