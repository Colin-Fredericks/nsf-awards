 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452066  Mehta  To enable the mathematics and computer science faculty of Saint  Xavier University to incorporate technology into their courses and  to better serve their commitment to collaborative learning, they  plan to create a departmental computer center consisting of two  laboratory classrooms. These classrooms will be dedicated to closed  laboratory instruction. Goals of this project include the  attraction of more mathematics and computer science majors and  greater retention in all mathematics and computer science courses.  Based on the results of a recently conducted pilot study, the  faculty expects increased use of technology in a supervised setting  (i.e., closed labs) to enable students to focus on mathematical and  algorithmic concepts.  The pilot study was successful to the extent  that current University computer resources allowed. In order to  expand the mathematics and computer science curricula the  department has two dedicated local area networks, each consisting  of twenty computers. One contains Macintosh Quadras with an Apple  Workgroup server, while the other consists of Hewlett Packard 486  PCs. The labs are adjoined by a common resource and work area. Each  lab is equipped with a projection device as well as the software  necessary to accomplish networking and instruction. The faculty  also requests computers for developmental use in their offices.",
