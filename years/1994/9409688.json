 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana  Alexander Vardy  RIA:  Channel Codes for Digital Communications and Storage Systems    Reliable transmission and storage of information requires the use  of error correcting channel codes to protect the data against  errors introduced by the channel noise or imperfections of the  recording medium.  Error correcting codes are implemented in most  of the modern communications and storage systems ranging from  household compact-disc players through telephone line modems,  computer memories, and mobile radio networks to satellite and deep  space communications.  In this project we investigate two general  types of error correcting codes, known as block and lattice codes,  using a novel dynamical approach.  Since a block code is  essentially subset of finite field, while a lattice is a discrete  collection of dimensional real points with certain prescribed  distance properties, they have been conventionally treated as  geometric or algebraic entities.  However, as is just now being  realized, block and lattice codes may as well be regarded as  dynamical systems.  The latter approach has several profound  advantages over the conventional practice.  One of the objectives  is to exploit these advantages in an attempt to find new codes,  better than presently known.  Another objective is to provide  bounds on the decoding complexity and develop more efficient  maximum-likelihood decoders, which substantially advance the  current performance achievable for a given decoder complexity.   Furthermore, we study the precise trade-off between complexity and  performance in block and lattice error correcting codes, from both  theoretical and practical standpoints.  Progress along these lines  would enable the designer of a communication system to obtain  larger coding gains for the same bandwidth, power,  and complexity  constraints.  Also treated are modulation codes for input  constrained channels used to encode  information into a particular  set of sequences admitted  by the channel.  These codes have  widespread use in a variety of information storage applications,  such as magnetic or magneto-optic recording systems.  New  multi-dimensional modulation codes are currently being developed  for the emerging technology of holographic storage.  Most of the  modulation codes in use today are constructed using tools from  symbolic dynamics.  Taking the point of view of block codes as  dynamical systems makes it natural to consider applying results  from algebraic coding theory for the design of modulation codes.   We will use this approach to develop more efficient encoders for  high order spectral null codes and multidimensional modulation  codes for holographic recording.  The possibility of integrating a  prescribed error correcting capability within such modulation  encoders will also be studied.",
