 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403774  Jones       Mathematical models for the state of an evolving physical  system are the subject of investigation of dynamical systems.   The goal is the development of techniques for determining the  eventual state of the system, whether it be of simple form,  steady-state or periodic, or even chaotic. The reduction of  complex systems is essential in forcing the arbitrarily  complicated behavior to be susceptible to analysis. The  separation of a system into fast and slow time scales affords a  reduction that is particularly attractive as the complexity of  the high-dimensional behavior is retained through the patching  together of fast and slow structures. Such a reduction forms the  context for much of Jones' proposed work.       In recent work with Burns, Jones has uncovered a mechanism  for the stabilization of surprising resonant motions involving  the slow variation of certain parameters. This has been applied  to explain the spin/orbit resonance of Mercury, and a general  theory is envisaged which will be adaptable to many other  problems of resonance, particularly in the context of planetary  motions. In physical systems with spatial dependence, information  is transported in a fixed direction by travelling waves. Jones  will further develop his techniques for determining the stability  of such waves, thus offering a discriminant to assess their  physical observability.  It is anticipated that the methods will  be extended to cover the case of optical pulses, which will help  in determining the feasible methods for  multiple pulse  transmission in nonlinear optical fibers. Nonlinear optics offers  a particularly fruitful area of application as optical processes  occur on a very fast time scale. The transition between different  phases of materials, the sharpness of which reflects a fast  spatial scale, can occur in exotic patterns. Techniques will be  developed, based on the stability theory for travelling waves,  for determining the underlying mechanisms for such pattern  format ion.",
