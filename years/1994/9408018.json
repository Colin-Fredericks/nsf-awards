 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408018  Schardl       Drs. Schardl and Siegel at the University of Kentucky in  collaboration with Swiss colleagues are studying a fascinating  group of ascomycetous fungi that invade or infect grasses and  sedges, fungi usually treated in the genus Epichloe.  The grasses  infected include commercially important turf grasses.  The taxonomy  and classification of the fungi is complicated by the occurrence of  asexual forms and by a general paucity of reliable morphological  characters for distinguishing species.  Yet Epichloe strains are  known to inhabit grass plants internally, where they may function  either as mutualists or as pathogens.  The mutualistic endophyte  fungi are transmitted through the hosts' seeds and they provide  protection from insect herbivores and drought.  The pathogenic  Epichloe inhibit seed production by the host and are able to  produce infecting spores in large quantities.  The investigators  are studying patterns and mechanisms of fungal speciation, mating  systems, and hybridization, while also seeking to determine whether  the fungi coevolve with their grass hosts.       Primary objectives are (1) to use DNA sequence analysis as a  tool for determining phylogenetic relationships of Epichloe species  and relatives, both teleomorph and anamorph taxa; (2) to determine  the number and pattern of origins of mutualism and pathogenicity in  these fungi; and (3) to correlate these patterns with the known  phylogeny of the grass hosts.  The possibility of hybridization  between Epichloe strains leading to the formation of asexual  \"species\" will also be examined.",
