Genetic and physiological analyses have revealed that many plant species have evolved the ability to regulate flowering in response to environmental cues such as changes in temperature or daylength.  However, the biochemical mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to environmental cues to initiate flowering are unknown.  To lay a foundation for studying this process at the molecular level, Dr. Amasino has isolated a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, luminidependens (LD), that is involved in floral induction.  Mutations in the LD gene render Arabidopsis late flowering; thus, the wild-type function of LD is likely to promote flowering.  Physiological analyses indicate that LD is specifically involved in photoperiodism.  Dr. Amasino proposes to characterize the tissue specificity, developmental timing, and environmental regulation of LD at the mRNA and protein levels, and determine the sequence of LD genes from other species, and perform site-directed mutagenesis on the protein.  To determine the role of LD in other species, he will block expression in other species through antisense RNA and/or co-suppression techniques.  Dr. Amasino will explore the effects of different light qualities and quantities on the phenotype of mutant and wild-type plants to address the photoreceptor systems influenced by the LD mutation.  He will determine the interactions of the LD mutation with other flowering mutations to define the position of LD in flowering pathways.  Lastly, Dr. Amasino will initiate the long-term goals of ident ifying suppressors of the LD mutation and isolating genes regulated by LD.  ***   SOL     EXE           @ j       SOUNDRECEXE           @ j = i   SSMARQUESCR           @ j W  B  SSMYST  SCR           @ j `  L  SSSTARS SCR           @ j j  D  TADA    WAV           @ j s  l  TARTAN  BMP           @ j   v   TERMINALEXE           @ j    B  TERMINALHLP           @ j       THATCH  BMP           @ j   V   9318481  Amasino    The major developmental change in the plant life cycle is the initiation of flowering.
