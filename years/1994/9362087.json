 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362087  Leaskey    There is much currently great demand for a material with superior mechanical properties that can be maintained to high temperatures.  Silicon nitride has  been identified as one of the most promising ceramics to meet these material requirements.  To date, research on Si3N4 ceramics has resulted in superior room temperature properties but retention of these properties to high temperatures has not been achieved.  This is mainly a result of liquid phase incorporated for densification and grain growth, but which remains as a glassy grain boundary phase which softens at high temperatures.    A Novel method is proposed which allows for densification and microstructural control of Si3N4 without deterimental glassy phases.  This technique involves use of a transient liquid phase which is subsequently converted to refractory oxides so that no phases with melting points < 1850 C are present.   Also, any silica present on the surface of the Si4N4 particles should be converted to SiC.  This will result in materials with substantially improved creep resistance capable of operation at higher temperatures.    The proposed research involves extensive characterization of consolidated materials in terms of phase analyses and examination of microstructures.  The mechanical properties of optimized samples will be measured at RT and 1400 C.",
