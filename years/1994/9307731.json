The principal problem domain is mathematics with offers a  rich source of theorems that automated provers cannot yet prove.  Methods developed for mathematics apply to many areas, such as  reasoning in expert systems, inference in large databases,  program verification, reverse engineering, factory automation,  etc.    The work focuses on basic heuristic methods either modelled from  human behavior or discovered through analysis of individually  targeted domains.  Specifically, the research focuses on \"large-  step\" methods, second order logic, analogy, proof plans or  scripts, interactive theorem proving, and the combining of these  efforts    Implementation of analogy in automatic proof discovery remains an  important long term goal.  Analogy as used by mathematicians is  an extremely powerful proof methodology.  This project uses proof  plans and scripts, and centers on proving a few very difficult  theorems with analogy.  ***",
