 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416510  Kropp  This project addresses the damage resulting from the 1994  Northridge Earthquake to houses built on fill slopes.  \"Wedge\"  fills are often used to form cut/fill level building sites on  hillsides.  Numerous houses build on wedge fills experienced  substantial (though seldom catastrophic) damage as a result of  the earthquake; this, in the absence of any apparent large-scale  shear failure in the fill soils or building foundation materials,  such as landsliding or bearing capacity failure.  The damage  appears to have resulted from a combination of differential  ground shaking between the cut and fill portions of the building  pads, and from shaking-induced settlement and lateral ground  movements in the fill soils.    A primary objective of the project is to document the seismic  performance of \"wedge\" fills, especially recent fills constructed  to modern standards.  In order to gain further insight into the  patterns of stresses and strains developed in the fills under  earthquake excitation, numerical tools for dynamic response  analysis of two-dimensional soil systems are used to model the  behavior of typical \"wedge\" fill sections during the Northridge  Earthquake.  The validity of these analyses are verified by  comparison with typical damage patterns observed following the  Northridge event.  Following completion of this work, promising  mitigation schemes will be identified; such as the use of  geosynthetic layers within the fills, the use of over-excavation  and thick blanket fills at the top of the embankment, and the  development of guidelines for setbacks of structures from the  cut/fill interface.  ***",
