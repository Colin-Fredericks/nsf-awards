 "awd_abstract_narration": "The communication between nerve cells ultimately depends on  release of chemical messengers termed neurotransmitters from  one nerve cell and subsequent activation of another nerve  cell by the released neurotransmitter.  Neurotransmitters  are released from a specialized portions of a nerve cell  called nerve endings or nerve terminals.  The most important  initiator of neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals is  the concentration of free calcium within the terminal.  As a  consequence of their small size and of their being mixed  with glial cells and other nerve cell regions in intact  tissue, direct investigation of the basic secretory  mechanisms at nerve endings of vertebrates has been limited.  It is the purpose of this proposal to utilize a unique nerve  terminal preparations of vertebrates which overcomes the  above limitations to characterize the fundamental  relationships between calcium and induction of secretion of  the chemical messengers.  State of the art  electrophysiological and optical approaches which provide  high quantitative and high time resolution will be used in  the proposed studies.  Specific questions that will be  addressed include:  What are the qualities of the changes in  intracellular calcium that are most important for initiation  of secretion?  Which calcium entry pathways are most  important for induction of the secretory response?  Does  continued activation by electrical activity alter the  importance of these influx pathways?  In addition, a number  of specific proteins have recently been implicated in the  chain of events leading to secretion by biochemical  evidence.  To date, the specific functions of these proteins  have not been elucidated and is a specific aim of this  proposal.",
