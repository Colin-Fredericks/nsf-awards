Northwestern  University is adding the Georgia Institute of Technology as a  research site in the I/UCRC for  Engineering Tribology research.   Four companies are joining the Center with the Georgia Institute of  Technology becoming an additional research site in the Center.    The joint operation will add research activities on  modelling of  mechanical seals, investigation of hydrodynamic  film forming  capability of various liquids, and the optimization of the dicing  of silicon wafers to the existing research activities and attract  more companies to joint the Center.    The researchers involved with the Centers are well qualified to  perform the research projects.    The Program manager recommends the Northwestern University be  awarded $25,000 for the first year of a five year continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education and Center's  Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of  renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which  the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
