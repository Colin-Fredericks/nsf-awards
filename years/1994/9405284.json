 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berg  9405284  Under certain conditions, cells of chemotactic strains of the  bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium aggregate in  spots or stripes distributed in symmetrical arrays.  Each aggregate  contains a large number of cells that have migrated toward a  discrete locus in response to a signal generated by the cells  themselves.  This signal is produced when cells are suspended in  liquid media and exposed to environmental stress, or to succinate,  fumarate or malate (intermediates of the tricarboxylic-acid cycle),  or when cells are grown in soft agar with one the these compounds  as substrate.  The primary signal is aspartate, produced from  fumarate and ammonia.  A secondary signal is glutamate, produced by  an unidentified pathway.  We propose 1) to establish the general  mechanisms regulating pattern formation, 2) to identify the  glutamate pathway, 3) to learn how these pathways are activated by  different kinds of stress, and 4) to learn whether aggregation has  an adaptive value.  To meet the first goal, we will obtain a more  quantitative description of aggregate formation in liquid media,  characterize different modes of pattern formation in soft agar,  including migrating slugs, map gradients of aspartate, and attempt  to construct suitable mathematical models.  More broadly, we hope  to learn how large numbers of identical cells are able to come  together in response to chemoattractants to form multicellular  bodies and symmetrical patterns.  This is a cross-field endeavor  that links sensory transduction responses to stress and secretion  of signal molecules to the problem of biological self-organization.   It does so with a model system readily amenable to genetic and  biochemical manipulation.  %%%  Bacteria are the simplest free-living organisms.  Species that are  well understood include Escherichia coli, that lives in your gut,  and Salmonella typhimurium, that causes food poisoning.  Both cell  types are motile and can change the way they swim in response t o  changes in concentration of certain chemicals.  We have found  conditions under which the cells excrete chemical attractants (the  amino acids aspartate and glutamate).  As a result, the cells swim  toward one another and aggregate.  When cells are grown on a gel-  like medium (agar), these aggregates form a variety of remarkable  geometric patterns, which change depending upon the amount of  available nutrient.  If the nutrient concentration is high enough,  the aggregates behave like multicellular organisms, moving over the  surface of the agar and consuming one another.  Can we understand  this biological self-organization in molecular detail?  The answer  is yes, because we a dealing with a model system made of cells  readily amenable to genetic biochemical manipulation.  This work  links several areas of basic biology of current interests,  including motile behavior, metabolism, response to stress, self-  organization and pattern formation.  ***",
