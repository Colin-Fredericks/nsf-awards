 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407167  Eftink  In the last grant period we developed a multi-dimensional  spectrophotometer, which enables the simultaneous and automated  measurement of multiple types of optical data (circular  dichroism, fluorescence, absorbance and light scattering) as a  function of temperature, added denaturant, or hydrostatic  pressure.  It is proposed to further develop this method by  adding full spectral fluorescence detection (via an intensified  diode array) and by adding the capability of automatic pH (or  specific ion) measurement during titration experiments.   Additionally we will add a stopped flow accessory to this  instrument to enable multi-dimensional monitoring of the time  course of the folding/unfolding of macromolecules.  %%%  It is proposed to extend our studies of the thermodynamics of  protein folding by systematically perturbing proteins in ways  that are expected to lead to observable populations of folding  intermediates, with emphasis on the continued development of new,  multi-dimensional spectroscopic methods.  We will use these  multi-dimensional methods to study the unfolding of selected  proteins, which are selected because a) they represent examples  of different folding motifs (i.e., alpha helix bundle, beta sheet  structure, eight stranded alpha/beta barrel, mixed alpha/beta  structures having sub-domains, homodimeric proteins) and because  b) they show evidence for a multi-phasic transition under certain  conditions.  Our intent is to characterize the free energy of  coupling between domains/subunits and to appreciate the type of  perturbations that affect the interactions between  domains/subunits.  A second goal is to continue to develop our  multi-dimensional spectrophotometer and related methods, to  extend our ability to obtain equilibrium and kinetics data for  the folding/unfolding of proteins in a multi-dimensional manner.  ***",
