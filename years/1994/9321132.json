 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pittler  9321132    During development many different cell types are formed that  must migrate to their proper locations in central nervous  system (CNS) tissues such as brain and retina.  It is during  this time that neural networks are formed that remain for  the life of the organism.  A pathway in the rat retina has  been identified that when perturbed leads to gross  morphological disruption of the distribution of retinal  cells with minimal degenerative changes.  It is hypothesized  that this pathway is involved in maintaining cell  architecture and overall cell morphology of CNS tissue.  It  is also possible that this pathway functions to direct  migration of cells to their proper location during  development.  This pathway in the retina is being  characterized beginning with the identification of the  proteins involved.  The location of these proteins within  the retina will be analyzed and compared with the location  of the major structural elements that exist within cells.  From these results the proteins that mediate the observed  cell changes, their distribution within cells, and the major  structural elements that are affected can be determined.  This will contribute significantly to our understanding of  structure\\function relationships in the CNS.",
