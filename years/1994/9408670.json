These changes can be beneficial such as  in chalcogenide glasses used for photolithography or in Indium  oxide films for controlling the electronic properties of  transparent electrodes.  On the other hand, they can be detrimental  leading to photodegration of amorphous silicon solar cells.  These  photo-induced changes occur during recombination of photo-excited  electron-hole pairs.  The study of the temperature dependence of  the recombination and transport of photocarriers and of the defect  generation-kinetics will help us to understand the microscopic  mechanisms of the light-induced changes.  Use will be made of  spatially confining the photocarriers in ultra-thin layers of  amorphous semiconductors to explore the effect of reduced  dimensionality.  The light-induced changes will be used in Indium  oxide to explore changes in electronic conduction ad the electronic  states become localized.    non-technical abstract:  The research is aimed at understanding how  light produces defects and other changes in the local structure of  amorphous semiconductors.
