The meeting will outline and discuss the various requirements of plants for wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared, problems in duplicating solar intensities, provide review of new lamp technologies including LED's and microwaves, discuss effectiveness of illuminaries, and procedures for reducing radiant heating. Specialists will be invited to make formal presentations and all attendees encouraged to participate in the discussions and workshops. The specific objectives to be addressed at this workshop will be:    i) in depth examination of the spectral and intensity requirements for the primary plant responses that are controlled by light    ii) discussion of the new technologies in lamps that would have usefulness for plant lighting    iii) review of the available and new technologies for distribution of light and control of excess infra red radiation    iv) development of guidelines for lighting of plants in growth chambers and greenhouses    The workshop is aimed at bringing together plant scientists and physical scientists to interact in the discussions. It will involve participation of plant scientists involved in studying mechanisms of light reactions and those involved in utilizing lighting for crop production in controlled environments. It will include participation of physical scientists from universities and government involved in research as well as those from industry involved in producing lamps and in constru ction of controlled growth facilities.       u    ~     @ EXE           @ j   P   PIFEDIT EXE           @ j F     PIFEDIT HLP           @ j a     PROGMAN HLP           @ j r  x  EXCEL   INI           Hz        REGEDITVHLP           @ j   s=  APPLICATGRP            r        OMNISCANDLL           \"v  '> 8  WINVER  EXE           @ j   @   ARCADE  BMP           @ j 2 v   CASTLE  BMP           @ j       9314213  Tibbitts    This workshop is aimed at bringing together researchers from various disciplines to outline the requirement                (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               N   P           2   4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      '         '   `  &      p @         P      !
