 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314938  Goldenfeld  This proposal concerns the study of non-equilibrium phenomena,  primarily in polymeric systems. The PIs have had much prior success  in studying the approach to equilibrium following phase  transitions; growth of complex spatial patterns; and the use of  Renormalization Group methods to access the long time behavior of  systems far from equilibrium. They have also developed a cellular-  automata-type numerical scheme, the \"Cell Dynamical Systems\"  approach, to study mesoscale phenomena. They propose to study 1)  spinodal decomposition in binary alloy systems; 2) descriptions of  vibrating powder systems; 3) chiral symmetry breaking in Langmuir  monolayers; 4) Renormalization Group methods to study the long-time  behavior of spatially extended non-linear systems; 5) theory of  vulcanization; 6) Large Deviation approaches to nonequilibrium  systems (both the fundamentals of the method and some concrete  applications).  %%%  The PIs work in the area of understanding the behavior of  nonequilibrium systems; particularly of complex systems such as  polymers, rubbers, alloys etc. Here, they propose to study what  happens to mesoscale structures of alloys when they are quenched;  how best to descibe the state of a powder when it is vibrated;  mathematical methods to understand the time dependent behavior of  systems which have been moved out of equilibrium (and how they  thence may establish spatial patterns as they evolve) and, lastly,  a new (at least to many physicists) theoretical method for  describing the thermodynamics of both equilibrium and  nonequilibrium systems which relies on the mathematical laws  governing large numbers. These two PI's are held in the highest  esteem by their community and their work is rated at the very front  of this field. They do a nice combination of fundamental work and  \"real-world\" problems - for example they have helped  experimentalists with the understanding of their experiments.  ***",
