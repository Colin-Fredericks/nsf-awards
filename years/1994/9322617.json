The basis for much of the work is  typically an energy arising from a model in continuum mechanics.  Physical contexts include superconductivity and phase  transitions.  In all cases, the structure of minimizers of the  energy is an issue of primary interest.  Beyond this, work will  be done on gradient flows associated with the energy.  The flows  are modeled by parabolic partial differential equations or  systems whose solution tend to decrease the energy.  A primary  goal is to characterize the large-time behavior of these systems  as they strive to achieve an equilibrium state.  In all cases,  certain geometric structures tend to characterize steady-state  solutions such as minimal surfaces or vortices and one seeks to  understand how such structures propagatein time during the late  stages of the evolution.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  Many  equations arise by invoking physical principles, phrased in terms  of minimizing certain quantities, such as energy.  The resulting  mathematical expression is a variational problems whose solution  is expressed by a partial differential equation.  ***",
