 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321185  Wuttig    This research project examines martensitic transformation in thin  films, concentrating on the transformation of austenite on a  substrate.  This study emphasizes the elastic and anelastic  properties of thin film austenite/martensite/substrate composites  and use the anelastic properties to characterize the metallurgical  changes in the composite as well as the internal stresses.  This  approach has the major advantage that the structural and  microstructural changes, the adhesion and stresses can be monitored  and their effect on the transformation investigated, all in-situ  and simultaneously.  The goal is to learn the effects of substrate  constraint and film thickness, and the state of crystallinity and  microstructure of the \"austenite\" on the transformation.  In view  of their potential practical importance, alloys from the four major  shape memory alloy (SMA) families, nickel/titanium-based, copper-  based, iron/manganese-based, and iron/platinum/palladium-based, as  well as hybrids thereof, are investigated.  Characterization  techniques include X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission  electron microscopy, and Rutherford back scattering.  %%%  Emphasized are thermoelastic martensites.  The substrates include  silicon with different buffer layers because of the potential for  micro-mechanical device integration as well as silicon-carbide  which is fast becoming one of the more important micro-mechanical  materials.    ***",
