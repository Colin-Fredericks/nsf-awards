 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major research instrumentation being requested is a phosphor  imaging and analysis work station which will make possible quantitative  autoradiography of many biochemical and molecular biological  determinations. In recent years, the advancement in gel separation  methods and sequencing technology has given us the ability to resolve  differences down to the singlenucleotide and single-amino acid level.  At the same time, increasingly clever molecular biological  manipulations are enabling us to address ever detailed aspects of the  mechanism of many fundamental life processes. To achieve the most  rigorous answers, it is not sufficient to only pinpoint qualitative  differences, but also to support the detected differences with careful  quantitative measurements. The phosphor imaging technology, which has  emerged in the past decade, is enhancing our ability to achieve  quantitation of molecular differences with great accuracy, speed,  safety, and extraordinary sensitivity. When joined with the data  storage and data analysis capability of computers, we have a powerful  combination that is revolutionizing the way quantitative molecular  sciences are being done these days and will be done for the decades to  come.    The type of research activities to be conducted initially with the  phosphor imaging unit will include quantitative determination of in  vitro transcription reactions, Southern blot hybridization analysis,  DNA sequence analysis, and DNA footprinting studies. The quantitative  aspect of these studies is crucial in reaching the most rigorous  interpretation of the data and conclusions. In terms of research  training, the availability of such a unit will encourage quantitative  thinking and reintroduce much of the needed vigor into many molecular  biological investigations. The ease of usage of a phosphor image with  its impressive speed, capacity, sensitivity, and image manipulability  will become evident quickly.          Although the work of three major users will benefit from th e  phosphor imaging system initially, we fully expect other researchers in  nearby institutions to take advantage of this versatile piece of  equipment. Furthermore, as Mount Holyoke College is an undergraduate  institution devoted to training young women scientists, we also expect  to develop laboratory-teaching exercise units that will incorporate the  use of this state-of-the-art instrumentation.",
