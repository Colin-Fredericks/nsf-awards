Burgess  Using Science & Technology to Build High Performance Communities  The proposed activity is to undertake an experimental demonstration  program to enhance the concept and activities of EPSCoR in the West  by establishing and managing a network of resources from state and  federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation,  Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Environmental  Protection Agency, National Aeronautics & Space Administration, and  the U.S.Department of Agriculture.  These agencies currently  conduct EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs.  The program will convene  a series of workshops to promote and enhance EPSCoR in the West.   The Center will (1) identify western EPSCoR states that will  benefit from the use of locally available science and technology  resources; (2) identify western enterprise formation and long-term  job creation, (3) enhance EPSCoR relations with statewide and  regional civic leadership, (4) convene workshops to explore  resources and strategies, (5) develop university/industry  cooperative projects directed at economic development, and (6)  provide general administrative support activities necessary to  perform these functions.      The project provides for the assessment of western EPSCoR state  potential for technology development.  It will use its assessment  process to select those western EPSCoR states with the greatest  potential as pilot states in which to develop experimental  projects.  The projects will attempt to integrate university,  industry, and federal resources towards the goal of technology-  intensive economic development.  Assessment and documentation of  the various strategies used will be catalogued.",
