 "awd_abstract_narration": "Koshland  9405433  The new proposal builds on the previous experience of the  laboratory on the structures and functions of protein.  The major  part of the work will attack the mechanism of isocitric  dehydrogenase.  The structure of the enzyme has been determined and  it has been shown to be covalently regulated by phosphorylation at  the active site.  Mutations will be made in both the protein and  the substrate.  Measurements will be made of the binding constants  and catalytic turnover numbers of the enzyme containing these  mutations.  The x-ray structures of the mutant proteins and the  wild type with isocitrate and \"mutated\" substrates will be  determined using x-ray crystallography.  The binding constants  calculated from docking programs and the position of the catalytic  groups will then be correlated with the observed properties of  catalysis and binding.  Through these studies it is hoped that an algorithm can be  developed to predict the effect of binding and catalysis on enzymes  and receptors in general and this will be applied to a general  procedure for altering the specificity of enzymes.  The immediate  application will be first to convert isocitric dehydrogenase to an  isopropylmalate dehydrogenase by modifications of a few residues at  the active site and possibly also to convert the isopropyl malate  dehydrogenase to an isocitrate dehydrogenase by similar mutations.   Since both the structure of the isocitrate and isopropylmalate  dehydrogenase are known this should be a moderately straightforward  task.  If the calculations turn out to be predictive and accurate,  it is then proposed to expand the range and apply the techniques to  other enzymes.  %%%  Enzymes, natures catalysts, have specificity and catalytic power  capabilities far beyond any man-made catalysts that have been  created so far.  To understand the mechanisms used by these natural  enzymes could therefore be of enormous value in designing new  catalysts which could, for example, be applied to creating new   materials, cleaning up oil spills, and avoiding toxic side products  in chemical synthesis.  Two tools, genetic engineering and computer  design, have recently been added to the repertoire of tools which  could be applied to this problem.  In this proposal these new tools  are applied to a powerful and vital enzyme in metabolism with the  hopes that it can be genetically engineered into a different  enzyme.  In addition it is hoped that the strategy developed for  this example can be generalized for use in a wide variety of other  catalysts.  ***",
