PATH also proposes acquiring  dial-in access to the NSFNET for its Washington, DC office.    Connection to the NSFNET will provide PATH staff with important  information resources which can be used to enhance program  activities, product development, proposal development, and grant  administration.  Program staff will also be able to use the  NSFNET for communications an file sharing between PATH offices,  with funders, international agencies, U.S. government offices,  and collaborators in North America,. Asia, Africa., Latin  America, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    This Internet connection will enable researchers, librarians,  staff and students to collaborate with colleagues at other  Internet sites.  Patient care questions, diagnosis inquires and  treatment plans can be electronically discussed and collaborative  research can be accomplished more readily with an Internet  connection.",
