 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362165  Rampalli       Mechanical System Simulation (MSS) is the technology  used to analyze systems undergoing large overall motion,  such as an automobile going over a pothole or a space  shuttle performing satellite retrieval.  MSS formulations  lead to a coupled set of Differential and Algebraic  Equations called Index-3 DAE.  Index reduction methods (IRM)  are employed to simplify and solve these equations.       Three factors determine the accuracy and stability of  solutions for mechanical systems: (a) the System States  selected, (b) the IRM used, and (c) the numerical integrator  used.  Ideally, these selections should be problem driven.  Yet, most commercial MSS software apply very limited  combinations of the above to all problems.  We will address  this limitation be developing a library of IRM and  integrators, and allow for their independent selection.       In Phase-I, we will enhance an Augmented Lagrangian  Formulation, an IRM, to control constraint violation (ALF-  CC), implement it and demonstrate its effectiveness with two  integrators.  ALF-CC is very accurate and fast.  Unlike  other IRM, it promises to solve through singular  configurations, accommodate inequality constraints and  system topology changes.  ALF-CC will be compared to other  methods.       In Phase-II, we will expand this library and facilitate  creation of problem specific simulators.",
