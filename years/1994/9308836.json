 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308836  Rosenzweig    A major and long-standing issue in the study of the long-term  evolution of the global economy is the relative importance of the  contributions of economic development and specific human resource  program interventions to changes in population growth.  This  question not only is relevant to the understanding of global  change but has a major bearing on a fundamental policy question  of how resources should be allocated between programs that  directly affect demographic outcomes, such as family planning  interventions, and broader development programs that increase  overall resources.  This project will provide quantitative  evidence from the analysis of unique source of household data  from India on the relative importance of economic growth,  technological change and increased investments in human resource  programs in affecting population growth.    In this project newly available multi-level and longitudinal  household data from a large national probability sample of over  4,000 rural households in India covering the period 1968-1981,  merged with supplementary area-specific data, will be used to  examine comprehensively the effects of economic development and  program interventions on population change.  The survey documents  a period of time in India which conforms closely to a natural  experiment in which the source of economic development, the  introduction and improvement of high-yield seed varieties,  exogenously affected the wealth and incomes, the rates of return  to schooling and wages and prices in areas of India in which new  seeds could be grown.  The data will be used to quantify and  compare across districts in India differentially exposed to the  opportunities presented by the new technologies the level and  change in rural fertility and mortality within the context of a  dynamic model of the household.  Based on econometric analyses of  the models, the mechanisms by which economic development affects  these demographic outcomes, such as by increasing i ncomes,  changing the rates of return to schooling or altering the  productive values of children's and women's time, will also be  identified.  The data will be used to measure the impact of  education, health and family planning programs, net of changes in  economic opportunities, on fertility and mortality using methods  that will take into account the non-random distribution of the  programs.  ***",
