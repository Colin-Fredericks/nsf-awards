Speakers at the conference will  elucidate concepts central to manufacturing effectiveness, describe  the nature of technology development and the manufacturing  environment, and emphasize early assessment of manufacturability.  They will also indicate how fundamental and applied research from  the AVS community can significantly benefit manufacturing by  focussing on key manufacturing issues, providing relevant insights,  and developing process, equipment, and diagnostic approaches for  well controlled manufacturing processes.",
