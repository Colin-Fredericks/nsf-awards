 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning grant, \"Planning a Center for Advancement of  Emerging Technology Applications,\" presents a plan by six coalition  two-year technical colleges in Tennessee to develop a Center in  Tennessee that will serve as a national model. Research is  presented which demonstrates the importance of coalition building  and the need for a timely linkage to take the information sharing  from those engaged in development of new technologies and their  applications to the companies that can actually put the  applications into practice. The goal of the proposed planning grant  is to prepare a plan that lays the groundwork for a Center that  will function as a clearinghouse. Through this clearinghouse,  information will be shared statewide and nationally through  conferences, Internet communication and published materials, so  that colleges and universities can provide education for graduates  going into the technology fields.The proposed center will serve as  an intermediary between research organizations and the companies  which use the technology. Using research data from these contacts,  the center can summarize ongoing projects and anticipate the needs  of the manufacturing and service sectors in terms of technology  applications. Ultimately, a research-community college-industry  alliance will develop, producing a defined channel and improved  process for increasing productivity.Six Tennessee two-year colleges  are forming this coalition to develop a plan that is producing a  framework for identifying and developing emerging engineering  technology programs. Components for linkages with industry, other  colleges and universities and high schools are important in the  project.",
