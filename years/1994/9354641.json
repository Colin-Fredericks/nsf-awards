There are two  factors that are unique to the milieu in which this course is  being taught:  1. it is a required course for all  undergraduates and 2. the course uses a network of over five  hundred workstation computers (in lecture halls, labs and  dorms).  Thus, the course is aimed at a wide range of students  who need to learn the basics of programming and the fundamental  concepts in computer science and to understand how  computational issues appear in their chosen disciplines.  These  admittedly ambitious goals are being addressed by orienting the  hypertext around a carefully chosen set of case studies out of  which there are links to material on the larger course  objectives.  For example, there exist case studies involving  curve fitting and image processing, with direct tiebacks to  science and engineering disciplines.  Further, because of the  large numbers of available workstations, our objectives is to  develop a hypertext/hypermedia textbook that can be used by  students to learn in individual and group setting and by  professors to instruct in lectures, labs and interactive  classrooms.  Since the course is oriented around case studies,  material from the hypertext is gradually integrated into the  existing curriculum, i.e., as an addendum to currently used  texts.  As further case studies develop into hypertext the  course shifts away from the use of hardcopy texts.  Evaluation  of our efforts is made by tracking the performance of students  on material learned in a traditional format versus hypertext;  in addition, mechanisms can be added to the hypertext which  monitor (for non-grading uses) the patterns of usage.   Dissemination of case studies is via the XMosaic Internet  viewing program, which permits viewing of documents by anyone  connected to the Internet.  The significance of this wo rk is  that it goes beyond the focus of current introductory computer  science courses (which are oriented towards majors) and moves  towards the teaching of computer literacy as we believe it  eventually must be taught.  Further, the exploitation of  hypermedia seems to be an ideal way to deal with variations  both in the prior background of students and in what they find  interesting and relevant to their future computational needs.  ***",
