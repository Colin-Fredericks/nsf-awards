This is the problem of finding effective criteria for  distinguishing manifolds from other, more singular, geometric objects.  The  classical implicit function theorem gives one such criterion, but even when  this fails and the functions describing the geometric object have   singularities, the object itself may nevertheless be a manifold.  A compelling  example of this phenomenon is the celebrated Cannon-Edwards theorem, which  says that the double suspension of an homology sphere is a sphere.        In 1978, Cannon proposed a simple set of criteria for recognizing high-  dimensional topological manifolds.  In 1991, Bryant, Ferry, Mio, and  Weinberger showed that Cannon's criteria were insufficient.  In fact, they  constructed infinitely many distinct families of \"noncartesian manifolds\" -  manifold-like objects satisfying Cannon's criteria which do not have local  coordinate descriptions.  The detailed geometry of these spaces is mysterious.         The purpose of the proposed conference is to expose this work to the  mathematical public and seek applications of these ideas both within geometric  topology and in other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.  The  conference will be very appealing throughout the Southeastern United States, a  region which boasts a long tradition of interest in the topic.   ***",
