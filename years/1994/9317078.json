 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317078  Gregory    The history of Andean uplift is of great interest to both climatic  and tectonic studies.  The Andes form the only major barrier to  zonal atmospheric circulation in the southern hemisphere and they  extend throughout the tropics, a sensitive zone where small changes  in climate impact on a global scale.  In terms of tectonics, the  Andes are one of the few modern examples of an ocean-continent  subduction zone with associated crustal deformation.  As of now,  the development of Andean elevation is poorly constrained.  The  objective of this study is to estimate the paleoclimate and  paleoelevation of late Tertiary floras from the Bolivian Altiplano  using a new leaf physiognomy-based method.  An existing multiple  regression model explains 93.3% of the variance in mean annual  temperature (MAT) using leaf physiognomy of modern vegetation.   This model will be updated by adding sites from modern tropical  forests.  A new MAT-leaf physiognomy relationship will be derived  and will be used to estimate the paleoMAT of the samples from the  Bolivian sites.  When combined with coeval sea level temperature  and terrestrial lapse rate, the paleoMAT data from the Altiplano  can be used to estimate paleoelevation.  These estimates of  paleoclimate and paleoelevation will address the following  climatically and tectonically important questions:  1) As the only  barrier to circulation in the southern hemisphere, how did uplift  of the Andes impact global circulation, especially in terms of the  production of water vapor?  Could Andean uplift have been partly  responsible for late Tertiary global cooling?  2) Did the uplift of  the Andes predate or postdate the desiccation of the Altiplano?   Was this desiccation a function of the elevation of the Andes, or  of global climate changes?  3) How do botanically derived estimates  of Oligocene-Miocene tropical paleoclimate compare with those from  general circulation model (GCM) climate reconstructions?  4) Was  uplift of the Bolivian Altipla no coincident with crustal shortening  or did elevation develop in the late Miocene-Pliocene?",
