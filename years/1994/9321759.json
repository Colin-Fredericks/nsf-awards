 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321759  Ricklefs    Both energy  and mass constraints are continually interacting to  influence the ecology of organisms. No where is this more clearly  demonstrated than in nesting tropical seabirds where there is  strong selection to store energy for the incubation shift and  also to maintain water balance in this hot, harsh, environment.  In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters  compete for nesting burrows, and those without burrows (44% of  the population) must nest on the ground surface. If these sites  have little protection from solar radiation, only 5-11% will  produce chicks. In contrast to shearwaters, both Sooty Terns and  Brown Noddies regularly nest in the open sun and 85% of the nests  produce chicks. To better understand this disparity in ability to  nest in a hot environment, the PI has constructed a conceptual  model that links energy and material balances so that their  interactions can be clearly understood. Since 1990, the PI has  been collecting data to build this model and hopes to finish it  this year by determining the total body water, water flux, and  daily energy expenditure of shearwaters, terns, and noddies at  nest sites varying in amount of shade. These determinations can  be made by laboratory analysis of blood samples collected in 1991  from birds injected with deuterium or doubly-labeled water. In  addition, the PI hopes to analyze the composition of meals, nasal  secretions, urine and feces previously collected from the above  relative importance of various energy and water balance  variables. Some characteristics that may prevent shearwaters from  successfully nesting in hot microclimates are long incubation  shifts (9 days), infrequent drinking of seawater, and the  formation of stomach oils that reduce the amount of gastric space  available for water. The model of interacting balances, formed in  this study, should be easily modified to evaluate the effect of  other types of competing  balances on the ecology of organisms.  ***",
