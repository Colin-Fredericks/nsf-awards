 "awd_abstract_narration": "PMSA-9453838  Newport News Public Schools  Newport News, VA  Woods, Thomasena and Dianne Robinson    \"STEP:  Student and Teacher Excellence Program\"    STEP (Student Teacher Excellence Program) brings an urban school  district and a broad-based partnership of community organizations  and federal labs to develop a model of comprehensive Pre-K-12  science and math education to boost minority achievement and  significantly increase minority representation in the college-bound  SEM pipeline.  STEP is collaborative venture of partners newport  News Public Schools, NASA-Langley Research Center, CEBAF (the  Department of Energy funded Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator  Facility), Hampton University, CHROME (Cooperating Hampton Roads  Organizations for Minorities in Engineering), and the Virginia  Living Museum, working with universities, exceptional informal  science organizations and high-tech industry.  STEP will produce a  model that incorporates the tremendous expertise and creativity of  the unique concentration of resources in this area and that can be  replicated by communities not so fortunate as to have such  resources nearby.    Newport News is a minority-majority urban system in Southeast  Virginia.  About 55% of the students are minorities, most African-  American.  STEP will address current inequities:  African-American  students, on average, score well below white students on  standardized tests of math and science achievement and are much  less likely to take advanced math and science courses.  The STEP  program is closely tied to the School Board's priorities of  reducing racial disparities in achievement, channeling more  minority students into advanced classes, and ensuring that all  graduates complete Algebra.  STEP also is directly linked to the  City's economic growth strategy focusing on high and applied tech  industries.  STEP is a system-wide initiative and will involve all  30,800 students in the city's 29 elementary schools, 7 middle  schools, 4 high schools, and Governor's  School for Science and  Technology.  Consistent with PMSA goals, the emphasis will be on  minority students, but ultimately all students will benefit from  the accelerated standards, enriched education program, and upgraded  teacher skills.",
