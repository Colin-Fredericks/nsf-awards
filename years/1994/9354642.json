A call is frequently heard for chemistry to be relevant to the  everyday lives of students.  This project, Chemistry Domesticated,  is providing a radical change in how the material in general  chemistry is organized and how it is presented to students, while  leaving intact much of the material which must prepare students for  further courses in chemistry and other sciences.  The chemical  topics in a particular chapter are being chosen on the basis not of  the chemist's view of the world, but of what chemistry is necessary  for the understanding of materials and activities familiar to  students.  Chapters have titles such as Soil and Fertilizer, Blood,  The Laundry Room, and Ice Cream.  The subjects for the 22 chapters  are being chosen to provide a foundation for a broad range of  topics in general chemistry.  The chapters are linked by chemical  topics discussed in adjacent chapters, such as the chemistry of  calcium carbonate being important in both the chapter on Hard and  Soft Water (as scale) and the chapter on Eggs (as the major  component in egg shell).  Numerous appropriate experiments and  demonstrations have already been published in the science education  literature, and they are being put to work in Chemistry  Domesticated.  The proposed curriculum is intended not to displace  the current general chemistry curriculum, but to provide an  alternative to the curriculum that is under attack.  The project  plans call for a year of development, a year of implementation and  modification, and a year of evaluation.  ***y",
