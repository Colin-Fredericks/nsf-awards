The modelling of these microstructures is crucial for  understanding macroscopic phenomena such as shape-memory  behavior and hysteresis, as well as microscopic phenomena such as  the  morphology of twinning. In some situations the observed fine  scale structures and macroscopic effects can be explained on  the  basis of elastic energy minimization. Mathematically, the essence  of  the  matter is the minimization of nonconvex elastic energies  with \"multi-well structure. This project brings to bear a variety  of  tools,  many of them relatively new, including relaxation  of  variational  problems,  the  translation  method,  Young  measure  limits, H-measures, and singular perturbations. Energy minimizing  microstructures  can  be  viewed  as  composite  materials   with  extremal  effective behavior, so methods from homogenization  and  the analysis of composite materials are also relevant.              The  goals  of  this project include  developing  new  mathematical  tools, and also applying these  tools  to  specific  problems  from materials science. One objective is to  understand  why some shape-memory alloys maintain their shape-memory behavior  in  polycrystalline  form while others  do  not.  Another  is  to  explain   experimental  observations  concerning   twinning   and  hysteresis in single crystals of CuAlNi.",
