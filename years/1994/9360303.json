 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360303  Cappo    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  seeks to fulfill the critical need in education for the development  of innovative assessment techniques that support the emergence of  new teaching strategies, reflect what is known about the process of  learning, and measure higher levels of reasoning.  Studies by the  Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) and the Association for  Supervision and Curriculum Development, as well as state reform  movements, have identified the importance of a variety of  assessments.  These formats include oral discussion, group work,  portfolios, self-assessment, peer grading, observation, and  performance-based tests, as well as standard written and multiple  choice tests.  To incorporate these new ideas so that teachers can  move from the use of traditional to current alternative assessment  methods of students, teachers will require tracking and recording  devices that are unobtrusive and adaptable.  Also needed is a bank  of assessment tasks and scoring techniques which focuses on higher  levels of thinking.  The firm Learning in Motion proposes to test  the feasibility of designing assessment tasks and software systems,  which may include new pen-based technology, to improve the quality  of education and meet the educational needs identified by OTA, the  Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development and state  reform movements.     Recognizing that curriculum reform and assessment reform must go  hand-in-hand, Learning in Motion seeks to make an important  contribution to the realization of curriculum reform via assessment  reform.   ***",
