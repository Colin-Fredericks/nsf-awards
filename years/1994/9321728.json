The Navier-Stokes equations can be used to  model compressible, slightly compressible, and incompressible  fluid flow.  The equations are complicated enough that numerical  as opposed to analytical solution methods must be employed.  The  numerical calculation of each type of flow (e.g., compressible  versus incompressible) presents its own particular difficulties.   In this project, the focus is on the efficient determination of  the solutions to the slightly compressible Navier-Stokes  equations in an infinite domain.  These solutions represent low  Mach number flow, and are pivotal to the modeling of sound  propagation.    In the case of slightly compressible flow, at least two time  scales are present in the solutions.  The presence of the two or  more time scales generally makes efficient numerical calculations  difficult to achieve.  In this project, however, the presence of  multiple time scales is actually used advantageously.  Recent  research has shown how certain solutions containing multiple time  scales can be expanded into a sum of simpler solutions (i.e.,  solutions containing essentially one time scale).  In the  analytic portion of this project, the general behavior of this  sum of solutions is examined.  The goal of this project is to  develop, implement and analyze a numerical solver which makes use  of this understanding of the behavior of these solutions.  The  efficiency and accuracy of this new implementation will be  compared with that of existing numerical schemes.  This solver is  expected to be an improvement over existing solvers in  efficiency, accuracy and ease of use.",
