The service  of a drill rig designed for coring, but untested for  paleoenvironmental and geochronological applications will be  contracted for this effort.  Recovered core material will be  analyzed for paleomagnetic, tephrostratigraphic, and physical  properties.    The core site near Dillingham is adjacent to well-studied coastal-  bluff exposures, where the age of sediments appears to be  exceptionally well constrained.  By extending the stratigraphic  record into the subsurface, the core will be used to test the age  assignment.  Most importantly, sediments dating to the last  interglaciation should be found at relatively shallow depth and the  Old Crow tephra (ca. 140 ka) below that.  Well-dated stratigraphic  records of the last interglaciation are rare in northern North  America, yet are critically needed for testing climate models under  warmer-than-present conditions and for comparison with other long-  term paleoclimate records, including the new Greenland ice cores.",
