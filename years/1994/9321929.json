 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321929  Scott  This action concerns the use of scale models to investigate the  response of geotechnical structures (earth dams, embankments,  building foundations, etc.) to earthquake-induced strong-ground  motions.  In particular, the possibility of using a scale model  mounted on a shake table to simulate the earthquake response of a  full-scale geotechnical structure is being investigated through  this exploratory study.    If this 1g (normal gravity loading) experimental technique  fulfills its promise, it will effect two areas.  First, the  potential impact is large for industry, because the lower cost of  1g tests in comparison with experiments performed on a  geotechnical centrifuge (approximately 25% to 40% lower) will  improve the access to physical modeling by practicing  geotechnical earthquake engineers; resulting in a substantial  advance in industry practice.  The second impact is to centrifuge  experiments.  The new scaling relations will permit the current  maximum capacities of centrifuges to be overcome to that the need  for larger and more costly centrifuges is reduced.    This research program combines experiments and analytical studies  to compare with the experiments, in order to investigate scaling  relations.  Particular emphasis is placed on pore fluids and the  dynamic environment, motivated by the need to resolve some  concerns regarding the appropriateness of the scaling relations  currently used for centrifuge studies.  ***",
