 "awd_abstract_narration": "The W.M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory  at Yale University provides a full range of protein and  nucleic acid analytical and synthetic services to nearly 600  principal investigators at Yale University, Cornell  University, Columbia University, Harvard Medical School,  Johns Hopkins Medical School, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine,  Rockefeller University, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Texas  A&M University, and the universities of California,  Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Virginia as well as at another  123 institutions.  Each year this facility completes more  than 10,000 services including the sequencing of  ~750  proteins and peptides.  The vast majority of the latter  samples are HPLC-purified peptides that have either been  eluted from MHC molecules or that have been isolated from  tryptic digests carried out by the Keck Facility on SDS PAGE-  separated proteins.  Although all these peptides gave  symmetrical absorbance peaks upon HPLC, amino acid  sequencing demonstrated that nearly one-third of these  samples were, in fact, either mixtures of peptides, artifact  peaks resulting from Coomassie Blue and other reagents or,  were lost prior to sequencing due to adsorption onto plastic  surfaces.  The ability of the requested laser desorption  mass spectrometer (LDMS) to routinely determine masses on 50-  500 femtomole amounts of peptide will, in most instances,  enable the prior identification of those two-thirds of the  samples which contain only a single species in the expected  mass range (for a 10-40 residue peptide) and which are  therefore suitable for amino acid sequencing.  In addition  to preventing the needless sequencing of unsuitable samples,  the resulting masses will confirm residues which would have  been only tentatively assigned by Edman degradation and will  establish the length of these peptides, which is of  particular concern in characterizing MHC bound peptides.  Other applications envisioned for LDMS are in characterizing  posttranslational modificati ons of proteins and, possibly,  as a quality control monitor of oligonucleotide synthesis.  The other instrument that is requested, a multiple peptide  synthesizer capable of the simultaneous synthesis and  automated cleavage of 96 peptides, will need the increasing  demand for large numbers of economically priced, high  quality synthetic peptides.  Currently, several laboratories  at Yale are synthesizing as many as 100 peptides/year using  a manual system of multiple peptide synthesis.  Obviously,  acquisition of a multiple peptide synthesizer would  significantly increase research productivity in these  laboratories and would bring the cost of these essential  oligomers within reach of many more investigators.    If funds are provided, these two instruments will  immediately be brought to bear on a large number of  important research projects that range from characterizing  peptides bound to MHC molecules in T cell responses to  increasing our understanding of the biochemical basis of  autoimmunity, protein folding,  posttranslational processing  of a parathyroid-like hormone related protein, isotype  switch recombination in activated B lymphocytes to  biological applications of peptide nucleic acids.  The high  level of technical expertise in the Keck Facility virtually  guarantees that these instruments would be expertly  maintained and the extremely large number of Yale and non-  Yale investigators served by this facility ensures that the  positive impact of this equipment on biochemical research  would be large and would extend well beyond Yale University.",
