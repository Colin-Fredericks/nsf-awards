Harvard is in a unique position to lead a new synthesis of molecular biology and evolutionary biology because of its long tradition of excellence in both fields.   Indeed, among the priorities for academic growth and development in the life sciences is the overlap between molecular biology and evolutionary biology.  The Department of Organismic and evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard is already expanding with new faculty representing this type of integration.  Among the five OEB faculty participating, four (Hartl, Donoghue, Kellogg, and Pierce) are new to Harvard, and three (Hartl, Donoghue, and Pierce) are senior appointments.  The need for automated DNA sequencing in the participating groups is immediate and acute.  There is no automated DNA sequencer available for shard use.  Among the applicants, no group alone is large enough or its needs extensive enough to justify purchase, maintenance, and exclusive use of an automated sequencer.  However, in the  aggregate, the groups can make use of an automated sequencer essentially to full capacity (estimated sequencing needs approximately 1 million bp per year).  The automated DNA sequencer will be set up in the Hartl laboratory, which is centrally located among the participating users, and will be supervised by Dr. Elena Lozovskaya, a member of the Hartl group who has extensive practical experience in automated DNA sequencing.   Most of the participating groups have already had relevant experience  using automated DNA sequencers and their projects are funded and ready to be implement.  Therefore, the automated DNA sequencer is a familiar piece of equipment that will be set up in a central location among the users, supervised by an experienced investigator, and used immediately to essentially full capacity. OEB will contribute to the purchase of the instrument and support of the major portion of the recurring service  contract.  at Harvard University are applying for an Applied Biosystems Model 373A-01 Automated DNA Seq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !
