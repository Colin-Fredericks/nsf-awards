 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353364  Odom    This is a four-year project designed to present staggered 3-year  programs of mathematics content, pedagogy, and assessment for all  the elementary school teachers, K-6, and school administrators in  the 122 buildings in Montgomery County, Maryland.  Teachers will be  involved in up to 60 hours of preparation in content modules, which  include extensive attention to how children learn that content.   School administrators and teachers of special subjects are involved  with focused activities for improving student performance in  mathematics from their perspectives.  The school building is the unit of administration in this program.   All faculty and administration in the building will be involved in  the project simultaneously.  An additional 30 hours of activities  is planned to be used by the entire faculty at the school site  based on their needs assessment following the content component.   The project materials are based on a broad base of materials from  the mathematics reform and the research base being developed  through another NSF-funded project:  Project IMPACT carried out in  the district.  Project staff and district leaders will be available  to teachers and administrators through the full 3-year cycle for  each school.  These individuals are in the district, and they have  assignments which allow involvement in the activities and a  availability for site support.  Additional support is being  developed through area colleges and universities which are planning  to offer extended offerings for teachers and use the program as a  model for the preservice education.   The district will be able to monitor student performance on several  measures used in the district including standardized testing, state  testing, and district assessment programs which are being developed  to include performance based activities.  In addition, the project  will monitor teacher and administrator changes through participant  surveys and classroom observations.",
