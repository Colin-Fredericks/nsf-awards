The first is a  joint project with Richard Hain (also at Duke), in which they  intend to study a new type of function, the \"braid  polylogarithms,\" which they hope will become a bridge between the  important and much studied classical polylogarithms and the  Grassman polylogarithms.  The second topic is part of an ongoing  program to study the close relationship between hyperbolic  3-manifolds and the third algebraic K-groups.       Recently, there has been a renaissance of research on  polylogarithms because of their interesting applications to many  mathematical disciplines, including algebraic K-theory, number  theory, hyperbolic geometry and conformal field theory.   Applications are also found in theoretical physics.  This  research hopes to provide further understanding of the  relationship between the two important types of polylogarithm  functions: the classical polylogarithms and the Grassman  polylogarithms, and to contribute to the further understanding of  their applications to other mathematical fields.  ***",
