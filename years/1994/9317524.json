The long term goal of this research is to understand the molecular genetic basis of the signal transduction that occurs in Arabidopsis thaliana following the perception of gibberellins, a class of phytohormones.  Recessive mutations in the SPINDLY (SPY) gene of Arabidopsis overcome all effects of gibberellin deficiency and are phenocopies of wild-type plants that have been treated repeatedly with gibberellic acid.  Thus, it is hypothesized that SPY mutations cause constitutive activation of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway at a point that is common to all gibberellin responses.  The SPY-4 allele is believed to be caused by the insertion of T-DNA into the SPY gene because the kanamycin resistance marker carried on the T-DNA cosegregates with SPY-4.  The T-DNA that is linked to SPY-4 will be used as a molecular tag to clone the Arabidopsis sequences adjacent to this T-DNA.  These Arabidopsis sequences will then be used as a probe to clone the SPY gene and a complete SPY cDNA clone.  It will be confirmed that the SPY gene has been cloned by introducing the SPY gene into the SPY-1 mutant and demonstrating that it complements the SPY-1 mutation.  The sequence of the SPY cDNA will be determined.  Analysis of this sequence will be performed to determine if the SPY gene product is similar to gene products with known functions.  The SPY protein will be produced in a bacterial expression system and purified.  The purified protein wil l be used in biochemical studies to confirm any putative functions that are predicted by the sequence of the SPY cDNA.  The expression of SPY mRNA and protein will be extensively characterized.  The tissue specificity, developmental regulation, and effects of different phytohormones and mutations on SPY mRNA and protein expression will be determined.  Genetic studies that will identify additional components of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway will also be performed.  By continuing the screens that were employed to isolate the SPY mutants, and identifying enhancers of SPY-1, other components of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway will be defined.  In addition, the SPY-1 mutation will be used as a tool to screen the existing gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutants of Arabidopsis and identify mutations that affect the gibberellin signal transduction pathway. This will be done by identifying the dwarfing mutations that are hypostatic to SPY-1.  Mutants identified in these screens will be characterized with respect to their sensitivity to gibberellins.  The proposed experiments will identify new components of the signal transduction pathway and provide insight into the function of the SPY product.  This information can then be used to generate new testable models describing the mechanisms of gibberellin signal transduction.  ***                                                                9317524  Olszewski    The question of how signal transduction pathways for hormones and other signals function is central to our    B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            =   B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      !               !
