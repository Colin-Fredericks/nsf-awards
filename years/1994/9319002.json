 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319002  Delph       This research addresses the genetic mechanisms that may be  responsible for variation in the ability of offspring to survive,  for the alpine tundra plant, Silene acaulis. Silene acaulis has a  mating system that is termed \"gynodioecy\", in which there are two  types of individuals, females and hermaphrodites.  This contrasts  with the majority of flowering plant species, in which only  hermaphrodites occur.  It has been reported that offspring from the  female morph are nine times more likely to survive the seedling  establishment phase than are offspring whose seed-parents are  hermaphrodites.  This is in spite of the fact that the seeds from  the females are smaller and contain fewer nutrients than those from  hermaphrodites.  This suggests that genetic mechanisms are  involved.  Three genetically based hypotheses to explain the higher  quality of seeds from females will be tested using field and  laboratory experiments.  The work funded by this grant will provide  insight into (1) how genes that affect more than one trait in an  organism are selected for, (2) how matings between related  individuals affect offspring fitness,and (3) how competition among  pollen grains that differ in their genetic constitution can affect  offspring fitness.  Furthermore, the genetic basis of sex  determination will be investigated, in that the number of  cytoplasmic types conferring male-sterility will be determined.   Plant species with different mating systems vary in their ability  to persist in natural populations, and this work promote   understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this difference.",
