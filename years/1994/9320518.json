Madulid, National Museum, Manila, a workshop to plan  Phase III of the Flora of the Philippines Project (FPP).  The  participants, six U.S. scientists, three from Western Europe, and  four from the Philippines are members of the Philippine Advisory  Committee, the International Scientific Advisory Committee, and  the Living Collections Committee of FPP.  The workshop provides  an opportunity for the members of these three committees to  discuss the third and final component of FPP.  This component  involves the research, writing, and editing that will lead to the  new flora of the Philippines.  Session 1 of the workshop will be  held at BRIT, in Ft. Worth, Texas, while Session 2 will be held  in Manila.    A completed flora will have major global significance because an  important portion of the earth's biodiversity will be better  understood.  Earlier collections of Philippine plants held at the  Museum in Manila were destroyed during World War II.  There is an  urgency in completing FPP at this time in order to catalog and  classify Philippine plants that are endangered, threatened, or on  the brink of extinction.  The collaborators are well known  researchers in the field of this project.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the East Asia and Pacific Program  which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  East Asian scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  ***",
