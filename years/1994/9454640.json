This partnership project will:  place students and recent graduates in related industries to  provide job experience through internships; include a counseling  component based on TQM concepts applied by industry; provide job-  related educational experiences to additional students through  visits to industries including oral/written visit preparation  exercises, visit observation guide, post-visit reports; provide  opportunities in industries for the professional development of  faculty resulting in course content/instructional materials  preparation/modification to integrate classroom learning to  industry practices; and provide teaching experience to alumni who  will provide follow-up to internship participants. Industries  provide mentors who assist faculty in their professional  development, give suggestions for instructional materials, provide  group orientations related to industry-specific applications of  electronics or computerized drafting, and serve as mentors to the  students. A Board of Consultants, including industry members,  oversees the project implementation.",
