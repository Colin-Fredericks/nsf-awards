 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320339  Al-Sheikhly  This is an award to support research, the objectives of which are  to investigate the mechanisms for destruction of potentially  toxic and hazardous organic materials in aqueous solution using  ionizing radiation produced by short pulses of energized  electrons.  The research includes a consideration of using  selected additives for enhancing the effectiveness of radiation.  Target organic compounds to be studied include representative  halogenated and non-halogenated olefin and aromatic compounds.  Dose rates to be studied range from those characteristic of  industrial gamma radiation sources to those obtained with  electron accelerators used in industrial radiation processing.    Radiation processing of contaminated water, solids and slurries  represents a potentially important practical way to address  environmental problems associated with the presence of toxic or  hazardous substances in water and soil.  Results of this project  are expected to provide additional insights into the potential  uses of ionizing radiation for remediation of environmental  resources contaminated with hazardous organic substances and are  likely to be utilized in the engineering design of processes and  systems for remediation of contaminated environmental resources  of soil and water resources.",
