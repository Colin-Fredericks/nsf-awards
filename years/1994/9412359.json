 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal was submitted in response to the REG Program Announcement and requested support to purchase a high speed, high resolution video system to be shared by several investigators.  The primary use of this system would be for the simultaneous measurement of temperature and heat transfer in microscale environments with rapid transients.  Utilizing laser induced fluorescence of rare earth doped thermographic phosphors, a novel imaging technique has already been developed that is capable of measuring temperatures from 0 to 250 C with 10 micron spatial resolution and 0.5 C accuracy.  With the acquisition of the proposed system, which has a rate of 12,000 frame/sec and on board DRAM storage, the upgraded system would permit the measurements of highly unsteady phenomena and could significantly advance the understanding of these flows.",
