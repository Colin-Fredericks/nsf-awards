The specific objectives of the International  Marine Biotechnology Conference are:  (a) to present the latest  discoveries and applications of marine science with emphasis on  biotechnology; (b) to educate industrial scientists with the  advances made in marine science; (c) to bring together colleagues  from all over the world so that the science can be evaluated and  criticized; (d) to present opportunities for joint ventures and  research partnerships by making contacts through scientific  discussions and informal gatherings; (e) to put together a volume  of extended abstracts so that the science presented at this  conference will be available as a reference book.  (f) to provide  material that will lead to creative new ideas and applications.   %%%  This grant will provide support for U.S. scientists to attend a  five-day International Marine Biotechnology Conference to be held  August 8-12, 1994 on the campus of the University of Tromso, in  Tromso, Norway.  The topics chosen for the conference reflect the  great interest among scientists in exploring the nature of  biological interactions between organisms living in the very  diverse and often extreme habitats of the marine world.  Basic  research on biological mechanisms and molecular interactions  related to a life in aquatic systems has yielded valuable  information about fundamental biological principles.  Studies on  the processes and products of marine organisms have already  opened new and sometimes very unexpected applications within many  sectors of society, including medicine, production of marine food  and chemicals and sequestration of mineral resources.  Presently  a major focus is on the control of microbial diseases in  aquaculture and in aquatic ecosystems.  The emerging science of  marine bio technology is thus being applied in the management of  marine biological resources and in monitoring and remediating the  marine environment.  The underlying philosophy of this conference  to promote rapid advances in the various sectors of marine  biotechnology for the benefit of mankind and in harmony with  nature.    ***",
