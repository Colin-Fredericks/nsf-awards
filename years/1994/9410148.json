Not only do they produce new magnetic  materials by these techniques, but they also study fundamental  aspects of magnetism.  The group detect weak interlayer magnetic  coupling between thin (110) Iron layers through intervening layers  of (111) Silver and (111) Copper.  These studies are important for  understanding the mechanisms of giant magnetoresistance in these  multilayer systems.  This phenomenon is beginning to be exploited  for magnetic read-write heads for high density magnetic disk  memories.    %  %  %  %    This research involves making new magnetic materials by careful  engineering at the atomic level.  Normal magnetic materials such as  iron are alternated with both non-magnetic materials such as gold,  copper, silver and with other magnetic materials to make repeated  atomic-scale multilayer system whose magnetic properties can be  tailored to particular applications by controlling the relative  thickness of the various layers.  This area of research is being  vigorously pursued in a number of countries because of its  potential technological importance.  Already these materials are  coming into use by International Business Machines (IBM) to make  magnetic recording heads for very high density computer disks.  ***",
