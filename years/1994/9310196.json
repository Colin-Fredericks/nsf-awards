 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT -- CTS-9310196  SELL      The PI has proposed a Career Advancement Award project which would allow her to develop a degree of expertise in combustion in order to optimize and evaluate the burning of spent pulping liquors and to investigate the specific combustion characteristics of these fuels.  The PI hopes to gain the necessary expertise in combustion through the interaction with consultants such as Dr. Grace formerly at the Institute of Paper Science and Technology (IPST), a world authority in black liquor combustion and Dr. Sonnenberg, presently at IPST.      The PI intends to focus her efforts on the combustion and combustion properties of spent sulfite liquors from which about 70% of the sulfur has been removed by a new process of acidification and evaporation developed by the PI.  The techniques learned here could also be applied to  potential fuels such as sludges and fiber rejects.",
