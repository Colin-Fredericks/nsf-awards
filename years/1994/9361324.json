In Phase II, a working matrix of  red, green, and blue EL devices for a full-color display panel will  be developed.    The principal investigator recently fabricated the first Si-based  light-emitting diodes configured as heterojunctions between an  electrochemically-processed p-type porous Si and an n-type  transparent semiconductor (indium-tin-oxide).  Quantum confinement  in Si nanostructures is the key to the luminescence of these  devices.  These LEDs emit yellow, orange, and red light:  The  fabrication of a porous Si-based blue LED is presently being  investigated at Spire with NSF funding.  Although most previous  work on porous silicon devices has employed bulk Si materials  rather than Si thin films, Spire has shown that bright visible  light can be obtained from porous structures formed on  polycrystalline silicon thin films deposited on quartz substrates.   The principal investigator now proposes to extend this development  to create a novel thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) technology  based on porous polysilicon films.  Such a technology would be not  only more economical and practical than conventional practice, but  could also offer the monolithic integration of display elements  with the thin film transistor (TFT) chip-on-glass driver circuits.  ***",
