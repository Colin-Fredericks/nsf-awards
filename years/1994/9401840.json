 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401840  Bruce, Barry, D.    This is a start-up grant for a Post Doctoral Fellow in  Plant Biology.  In plants and other eukaryotes, the  translation of nuclear encoded genes can be divided into two  diverging pathways: one, where proteins are translated on  ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and are  destined either for the ER/Golgi complex for secretion, or  for the plasma membrane; and a second pathway, where  proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm.  In plants, proteins synthesized on free cytoplasmic  ribosomes can either remain in the cytoplasm, or being  imported into one of four different organelles: the nucleus,  the peroxisome, the mitochondria or the chloroplast via a  post translational pathway. This post translational import  requires a precursor form of the protein containing a  targeting sequence which directs it to a specific organelle.  It has been proposed that one prerequisite for the import of  these precursors is that they maintain an import competent  configuration.  It is commonly accepted today that import of  proteins into mitochondria requires that they be in a  destabilized conformation.  The role of protein conformation  on import into chloroplasts is much less certain.  The goal  of this proposal is to determine what defines the import  competence of chloroplast targeted precursors, and also what  cytosolic factors are involved in maintaining this  competence.  The small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate  carboxylase has been chosen as a model to address this  question.  The investigation will focus on purification of  cytosolic factors that interact with the transit peptide for  chloroplastic transport; on identification of trans-acting  chloroplast import factors by the two-hybrid cloning  technique, that allows specific protein-protein interactions  to be identified in vivo through the reconstitution of a  transport activator; and assaying in vitro the soluble  factors in increasing import competence of the precursor of  the sma ll subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.  %%%  The PI made good progress during his post doctoral research  on the problems concerning protein import into organelles,  and obtained results which suggest that the conformational  requirements for chloroplast import and mitochondrial import  may be different.  The goal of this project is to  investigate the specific requirements for protein transport  into chloroplasts.  This is the topic that the PI started  during his post doctoral research in the Keegstra  laboratory.  He will be taking the project with him to the  University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where he starts a  tenure track position in January 1994.  This start-up grant  for NSF Post Doctoral fellows in Plant Biology therefore  will be essential to help him establish his own laboratory,  and also scientific status.  ***",
