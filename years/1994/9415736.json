 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415736  Borchardt  Current methods of predicting earthquake damage generally assume  that seismic intensity is a simple function of distance from the  earthquake source, as modified by geologic effects.  Preliminary  observations, derived from detailed damage surveys, show evidence  for north-south directivity involving a near-field pulse which  seems to have occurred during the first cycle of motion of the  1994 Northridge, CA, Earthquake.  The Northridge Earthquake,  having occurred on a thrust fault in a heavily populated area,  now provides a prime opportunity to examine, and perhaps  ultimately to predict, near-field effects.    The objective of the project is to test the hypothesis that  elastic rebound in the Northridge Earthquake produced an initial  pulse that was north-south directed in the near-field.  More  specific objectives are:    1. To relate the damage data to recorded ground motions.    2. To relate the phenomenon to the geologic, geodetic, and  seismologic aspects of the earthquake.    If substantiated, this hypothesis will have basic implications  for the future design of structures.  ***",
