 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phillips  There are many variables that influence the physical and mechanical  properties of crystalline polymers through the processing and  fabrication stages of manufacture.  Four of the most important are  temperature, pressure, molecular weight, and chain microstructure.   The long-term objective of this research is to understand the ways  in which all four of these variables interact in determining the  details of the crystallization process.  Building on past work, the  synergistic effects of these variables will be investigated for  several carefully chosen systems.  Whereas much of past work has  concentrated on cis-polyisoprene, polyethylene, and polypropylene,  the proposed research will continue with polypropylene and its  copolymers with ethylene.  It will introduce copolymers of nylon-  6,6 as a new group.  This latter group will permit a wider range of  copolymer structures to be considered; in particular, there will be  available a series of copolymers in which there is evidence for the  comonomers being incorporated into the unit cell of the  homopolymer.  The research will permit a quantitative comparison to  be made of crystallization theories and will enable us to look in  a thorough manner at the existing theories of copolymer  crystallization.  The research will help us unravel some of the  aforementioned complicated synergisms.  In addition we will  continue to investigate the details of the formation of the gamma  phase in polypropylene at elevated pressures and the conditions  governing its equilibrium with the alpha phase.  It is also  expected that this research will extend to the copolymers of  polypropylene.  The study of copolymers is one of the few methods  available for the study of the critical secondary nucleus in  polymers and many of the results will be applied to elucidating  more information on this least explored of the important physical  features of crystallization in polymers.  %%%  This research, by studying the crystallization behavior of  important po lymers, will provide a more thorough understanding of  how morphology influences observed bulk properties.",
