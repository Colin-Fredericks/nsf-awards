 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457518  Danzig       This project deals with packet networks for computer  communications.  A major portion of the project deals with control  algorithms, in the context of multimedia traffic,  reserved-bandwidth channels, and high-bandwidth and  asymmetric-bandwidth paths. Simulation and emulation are the tools  utilized for performance evaluation, and the work contributes to as  well as utilizes these tools.  For the admission control algorithm  to meet its delay bounds and maintain high link utilizations, must  it know the traffic model a priori or can it adapt to observed  traffic behavior? Is \"predictive service\" only usable with  high-levels of multiplexing? What innovations are required for  efficiently software implementation?  Hybrid-simulations are under  development to study high-bandwidth wide area networks.  The tools  are driven by artificial workload models of TCP/IP traffic.  An  emulator, consisting of 10-30 workstations configurable into  arbitrary  topologies, driven by the workload models, has been  built and will be used to evaluate reliable multicast and traffic  control and load sensitive routing algorithms.  ***",
