 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316157  Rafailovich    Recently, several research groups have demonstrated that due to the  large entropy associated with confining long polymer molecules at  interfaces, the classical wetting theories developed for simple  liquids do not apply.  I order to obtain a better understanding of  the wetting properties of polymer films we are employing a variety  of complementary techniques (SIMS, reflectivity, TEM, and AFM) to  conduct an three-fold program.  1) Wetting properties of thin  liquid polymer films:  We are exploring the role of the chain  dimensions on the film stability, surface diffusion, glass  transition, wetting of rough surfaces, and total density.   Modification of mean-field theories to include new experimental  phenomena are being developed.  2) Surface modification via end-  functionalized polymers:  The conformations of end-grafted polymers  are being studied both in melts and solutions under steady-state  shear.  The in-plane structure of brushes is being studied and  compared with theoretical simulations.  3) Surface induced ordering  of triblock copolymers:  Triblock copolymers have the unique  ability to form surface-induced micelle gel films.  We are studying  the penetration and wetting of homopolymer films on these gel  surfaces as a function of the relative molecular weights of the two  components and the interaction energies with the ordering surface.    Very thin polymer films are known to have a large variety of  applications such as lubricants, coatings for optical and  electronic components, and adhesives.  In order for these films to  be effective, they must wet the surfaces upon which they are spread  or penetrate through the interfaces to provide adhesive strength.  ***",
