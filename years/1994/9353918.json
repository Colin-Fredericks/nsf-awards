 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353918  Landis  This project is developing a portable modular short course  which faculty can take within their institutional context to  better prepare themselves to teach engineering to freshmen.   Topics covered will include 1) understanding engineering  students, 2) achieving effectiveness in classroom teaching, 3)  the freshman year curriculum and early student development, 4)  student/faculty interaction, 5) the importance of the peer  environment, 6) teaching to a diverse student population, and  7) case studies of best teaching practices.  Specific materials  to be developed include self-assessment instruments,  monographs, videotapes, and study guides to the videotapes.   Materials will be developed with the consultation and  assistance of a National Action Committee of distinguished  engineering educators.  Evaluation of the developed materials  will be via actual use by engineering faculty during formative  development and a summative survey of users of the final  materials.  Dissemination of the course materials will include  the usual conference and journal avenues.  An additional avenue  to be pursued includes commercial publishers.  ***",
