 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is a project designed to develop a new class  of  loglinear and logit models for examining structural  effects  in  social  science  research.  Work on the  development  of  these  models will include efforts to examine the robustness  of  the  models and their ability to deal with  a  range  of  empirical phenomena.  The project will culminate in the  the  development of user-friendly computer software to  make  the  methods developed available to other researchers.        Loglinear and logistic models have been widely used in  recent  years by sociologists and others to study  phenomena  which   cannot  be  represented  accurately  by   continuous  variables.  Existing versions of these models suffer from  a  number  of  assumptions and restrictions  that  limit  their  utility in social science research.  By developing a new and  broader range of such models and preparing computer software  to  make  the  newly  developed models  available  to  other  researchers,   this   project   will   make   an   important  contribution  to sociological research on a  wide  range  of  topics.",
