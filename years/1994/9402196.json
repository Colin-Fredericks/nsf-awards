 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402196  Soong  The objective of this joint research program with  researchers in PRC is the full-scale implementation of  passive and active control technology to structures against  wind and earthquake loads.  While several structures in PRC  are being considered for structural control, the focus of  the project is on the Nanjing Tower, which has been chosen  not only for control implementation but also as a test-bed  where multiple systems will be installed and their  performances observed, analysized and compared.  During the  first phase of this project the research, development and  installation of suitable control systems for the Nanjing  Tower will be carried out in collaboration with PRC  researchers.  The systems under consideration include tuned  liquid dampers, viscoelastic dampers, and tuned, semi-  active, and hybrid mass dampers.    One of the direct benefits to the structural control  research community derived from this joint research program  is new information about some of the important  implementational issues in connection with structural  control. Some of the issues to be addressed in the second  phase of this project include: system optimization, fail-  safe measures, reliability and maintenance, operational  issues, diagnostics, and cost benefit analysis.  ***",
