This third year funding will permit development and  implementation of an experiment-based, hands-on program which will  introduce girls in the 5th, 6th and 7th grades to the physical  sciences.  For units in Optics, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism and  Mechanics, and Energy/Rockets, a series of modules will be  developed.  Each will develop a concept (e.g., the reflection of  light) through a series of logically sequential games, simple  experiments, building of gadgets, toys, art projects, and  laboratory experiments using simple scientific equipment and \"gee  whiz\" exploratorium-style exhibits.  By introducing the girls to  a number of different ways of observing and using the same  concepts, we will allow them to see how a simple concept is  developed on a logical basis to understand complex scientific  phenomena.  Through this program, we expect to motivate the girls  by conveying that science is fun, but more importantly,  familiarizing them with simple scientific equipment, developing  their building and experimenting skills, and their capabilities of  logical reasoning.    This effort initially was set up for grades 5 and 6 as an  extra-curricular program, meeting twice a week for four weeks.  By  the end of the 1993-94 academic year, the Optics unit will have  been tested in seven of the eighteen schools, and the Mechanics  unit in two schools.  The Sound and Electricity/Magnetism units  will be ready for testing in the Fall 1994.  The popularity of the  program among girls, parents, and teachers has resulted in this  proposal to expand the effort to integrate some of the material  into the regular curriculum for grades 5,6 and 7, in addition to   to including the 7th graders in Columbia's new middle schools.  The  project's expansion led to the following additional acti vities for  this third year:  (a) reorganization of the material by grade  levels and its classification as curricular and extra- or  co-curricular; (b) integration of the material into the grades 5-7  curriculum; (c) establishing co-curricular activities in the new  middle schools (grades 6-7); (d) training for teachers in grades  5-7; and (e) development of modules for one new unit on energy and  rockets.  ***",
