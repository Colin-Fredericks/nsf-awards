 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450415  Steen    The University of Oklahoma (OU) Minority Engineering Program (MEP) is excited about the  addition of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Research Career for Minority Scholars  (RCMS) project.  The project will be a perfect addition to the OU MEP.  OU MEP and the  university have made a true commitment to provide enhanced higher education options for  minority scholars.  This commitment exceeds one million dollars annually in support of  operating expenses, scholarships, and fee waivers to minority students majoring in engineering  and has allowed the OU MEP to reach a total enrollment of 484 students for the Fall 1993  semester.  The minority engineering undergraduate enrollment constitutes over 20 percent of the  College of Engineering enrollment--a truly phenomenal achievement!  This minority engineering  enrollment includes some of the best students in the nation.  For example four OU students have  won the National Black Engineer of the Year Award - Student Leadership Category in the first  seven years of the award.  The University of Oklahoma minority engineering student population  provides the opportunity for unparalleled success in meeting the objectives of the RCMS project.    The OU MEP RCMS project is designed for excellence.  The centerpiece activity will be a  quality research experience under the supervision of faculty mentors.  The project objectives will  be accomplished using two tiers of research experiences and activities.  Tier I will be a  developmental stage for twenty freshmen and sophomores and will focus on academic  achievement, personal development and an introduction to the world of research.  Tier II is  designed for 20 to 35 advanced students and will focus on a research experience and related  activities.  Tier II participants will also prepare technical research papers, make oral  presentations at monthly meetings, attend  regional and national conferences related to their  research projects, submit their research for presentations and public ation, and serve as mentors  to younger students.  The RCMS participants will also have enhanced opportunities to experience  research outside the university.  The project staff will work with corporations and national  laboratories to provide summer internships.    The participants for the NSF RCMS project will be selected from the minority engineering  student population at the University of Oklahoma. The minority engineering enrollment is  composed of approximately four hundred and fifty undergraduates with a significant number of  all three underrepresented minority groups:  American Indian, Black and Hispanic.  The  minority engineering enrollment is also national in scope with students from Alaska,  Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas,  Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Tennessee,  Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.  The participants  will be selected based on academic ability, motivation, financial needs and careers goals.   Participants will be provided a stipend for their participation in the project.    Evaluation of the project will be based on required data to NSF and such factors as number of  participants, retention rate of participants, number of technical paper submissions and quality  of research experiences.",
