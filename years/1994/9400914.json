 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fomin       This award funds Professor Sergey Fomin's exploration of new relations  between combinatorics and algebra.  A new approach to the theory of Schubert and  Grothendieck polynomials based on exponential solutions to the Yang-Baxter equations  has suggested new developments in the combinatorics of Coxeter groups.  This work  will build on this via symmetric functions, local associative algebras and universal  algebra.            This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of  the most active fields in today's mathematics. At its roots, combinatorics is the study  of systematic counting.  Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods for overcoming these  difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced  and modern mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several centuries, the  field has had an explosive development in the past few decades.  This growth comes  from its importance in communications and information technology and from the  success of modern techniques to problems of counting. ***",
