 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409085  In recent experiments a remarkable range of chemical and physical  properties has been observed in intermediate-sized clusters of  carbon and silicon atoms containing between about twenty and fifty  atoms.  These properties are surprisingly sensitive to such details  as cluster size and shape, reflecting a subtle interplay between  cluster electronic states and the overall cluster structure.  In  this Research at Undergraduate Institution grant, first-principles  methods based on density functional theory will be used to study  the electronic states of clusters in this size range.  The ultimate  goals of the project are to understand how the electronic states  are influenced by such factors as cluster size and shape, and how  the nature of the cluster electronic states in turn affects other  properties of the clusters.  %%%  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution award to conduct  theoretical research on the properties of silicon and carbon  clusters.  These clusters have properties which are intermediate  between those of the molecule and the solid.  These properties are  often unique and are highly dependent on the interplay between  electron states and cluster shape.  This research will conduct  calculations of these electronic states and their effect on cluster  properties.  The work will be done in collaboration with the Naval  Research Laboratory.",
