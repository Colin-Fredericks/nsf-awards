The project has two major objectives: (1) to  continue the development of a model of muscle firmly based  on biophysics and biochemistry, and (2) to test and validate  the model in carefully controlled animal experiments.  The  model is a mathematical approximation to A.F. Huxley's  biophysical cross-bridge theory of contraction.  Current  models for a most important element of the neuromuscular  control system-its actuator, skeletal muscle-have tended to  be rather crude viscoelastic analogies with only the most  tenuous connection to modern biological concepts about how  the muscle works.  A state-variable model of a skeletal  muscle fiber as a direct mathematical approximation to  biophysical cross-bridge models of the type introduced by  A.F. Huxley will continue to be developed in this project.  This model is call the Distributed-Moment Model of muscle  because it emphasizes the important role of the moments of  the actin-myosin bond-distribution function.  These moments  have macroscopic interpretations as muscle stiffness, force,  and elastic energy.  Thus it is of particular significance  that this model establishes a direct connection between the  macroscopic behavior of muscle and contractile mechanisms  believed to be operating at the molecular level.  The  project is a joint effort with Heckman at Northwestern  University (grant number 9419528).  ***",
