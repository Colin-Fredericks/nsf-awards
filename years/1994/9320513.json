 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320513  Horowitz    This is a research planning grant, the first phase of a study of  the positions of professional and consumer groups on whether  there should be representatives of the public on boards of  medical practice.  It will employ a range of methodological  approaches, including interviews, analysis of documents, and  field observations from public meetings.  From these diverse  sources, a quantitative questionnaire will be developed that will  be the heart of a major research study.  Among the chief policy-  related aims of the project are to increase our presently limited  knowledge about the functioning of medical regulatory boards, and  to explore means of making these boards more accountable to the  public.  The research will explore new intellectual territory in  the sociological sub-disciplines of professions, public  regulation, and authority relations.  %%%  This work is supported under the Research Planning Grant program  for women scientists and engineers, and thus among its chief aims  are to assist a promising woman social scientist to prepare for a  major research project, and to expand the scientific personnel of  the United States.  The results of this study will be valuable  for policy-makers attempting to revamp the American system of  health care delivery over the coming years.    ***",
