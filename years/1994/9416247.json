 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416247  Moriwaki  The Joseph Jensen Filtration Plant (JFP) in the San Fernando  Valley, California, provides an unprecedented case history  of seismically induced permanent ground deformations. The  site has been strongly shaken by two earthquakes-the 1971  San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  These two earthquakes produced large permanent ground  deformations and ground cracks at parts of the site.    The site was thoroughly investigated and studied following  the San Fernando earthquake, leading to a conclusion that  the loose alluvium underlying the fill (up to 50 ft thick)  at the site probably liquefied and contributed to the  permanent ground deformations.  In 1988, the owner and  operator of the plant, the Metropolitan Water District of  Southern California (Metropolitan), contracted a thorough  geotechnical and seismic investigation of the site prior to  a major expansion of the facility.  Following the 1994  earthquake, Woodward-Clyde has been working with the  Metropolitan to map the permanent ground deformations,  ground cracks, and other damage at the site.    The project involves the following:  an assessment of the  site conditions; the development of free-field ground  motions at the site corresponding to the 1994 earthquake;  and the documentation, simplified analyses, and nonlinear  numerical analyses of permanent ground deformations at the  site due to the 1971 and 1994 earthquakes.  The  documentation, comparison, and evaluation of the permanent  ground deformations at the JFP site during these two  earthquakes not only provides a unique and important case  history of ground failure, but also provides an opportunity  to evaluate the use of nonlinear numerical modeling of the  ground deformation as a practical and reliable design tool.  Evaluations with conventional and empirical methods also  serve to provide a common basis for comparison.  ***",
