 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315645  MIX    This study has two primary goals: 1) To test two recent hypotheses  that seek to explain the apparent disequilibrium of Delta-13C (and  possibly Delta-18 O) in calcitic shells of symbiotic and asymbiotic  planktic foraminifers. The first of these theories arises from  laboratory culture work on Orbulina universa and states that  photosynthesis by algal symbionts creates a light-dependent, but  temperature-independent, Delta-13C enrichment in the shells of  symbiotic species such as O. universa, G. sacculifer, and G. ruber,  which issuperimposed on the combined host-symbiont respiratory  Delta 13C depletion.  The second theory, based on coral data and  abiotic laboratory studies but which may apply to planktic  foraminifers, postulates a linked kinetic disequilibrium in both  Delta-13C and Delta-18 O that depends on calcification rate.  2) To  evaluate the importance of deep calcification on the isotopic  composition of foraminiferal tests.  There is considerable evidence  from sediment trap and plankton two studies to suggest that much of  the isotopic composition of planktic foraminifers arises from  equilibrium calcification at depths well below the euphotic zone -  between 100m and 1000m depending on the species in question. It is  important to consider both these research topics when attempting to  evaluate the factors that control the isotopic composition of  planktic foraminifers. It is possible for example, that the  apparent observations of deep equilibrium calcification noted above  are in fact due to disequilibrium calcification in the euphotic  zone.  Alternatively, deep equilibrium calcification superimposed  on euphotic zone disequilibrium calcification could greatly obscure  climatic information recorded in the foraminiferal test.  Answers  to these questions will have a profound effect on the climatic  interpretation we place on isotopic results from planktic  foraminifers.",
