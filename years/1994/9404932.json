The proposed research will focus on probabilistic models for hierarchical neural networks.  Two specific architectures will be studied in detail: hierarchical mixtures-of-experts (HME) and Boltzmann trees.     HME networks that model mixtures of more complicated probabilistic processes, such as hidden Markov chains and optimal observers will be developed.  The expectation-maximization (EM) principle from statistics will be utilized to develop learning algorithms for these architectures.  The behavior of these EM algorithms will be analyzed by exploiting the relationship of EM to mean-field theories from statistical physics.     Boltzmann machines are a general class of probabilistic model for constraint satisfaction whose development has been hindered by the lack of an efficient learning algorithm.  Boltzmann machines with tree-like architectures have simplifying features that make them faster and more efficient.  Further work on Boltzmann trees will lead to more powerful algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning.  Various parallels between Boltzmann trees and belief networks for probabilistic reasoning will be explained.  ***",
