The  waterproofing abilities of cuticular lipids are thought to depend  upon their biophysical properties. According to this hypothesis,  lipid melting results in a rapid increase in cuticular  permeability, with subsequent death due to dehydration. This idea  has played an important role in the development of insect  physiology, but experimental support remains sketchy. Recent  technological advances have made it possible to test the lipid  phase transition hypothesis in a rigorous manner. Sensitive water  vapor sensors have allowed the accurate measurement of cuticular  water fluxes, and detailed biophysical studies of small  quantities of cuticular lipids can be performed  using Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PIs will use FTIR to  examine the effects of specific changes in lipid structure upon  lipid physical properties. The permeability of model cuticle  preparations, with lipids of known physical properties, will be  examined as a function of temperature. The results of these  experiments will be compared to those of similar studies using  isolated cuticle preparations. The information gained will  provide: (1) better understanding of the function of the  cuticular lipid waterproofing layer; and (2) the foundation for  physiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of cuticular  lipids and water balance.  ***",
