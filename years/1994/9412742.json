The main objective of   this research is the development of a Group Technology Knowledge-   Based Coding and Classification system and its complementary    database to support the activities within the RRM environment for   a specific product, an automobile crankshaft.       The technical concepts associated with the development of this   environment include feature-based products modeling, knowledge-    based environments, and database systems.",
