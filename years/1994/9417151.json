 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blum  The molecular motion of polymers at solid surfaces must certainly  play a critical role in the physical properties of materials used  in a variety of applications from advanced composites to electronic  devices.  Despite this critical dependence, little is known about  the molecular mobility in these very thin layers which can be on  the order of 10 to 100  ngstroms thick.  This is because these  layers are too thin for their mobility to be probed by conventional  techniques.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will  initiate studies to probe the interfacial mobility of homopolymers   adsorbed on solid surfaces.  Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to probe the mobility of  specifically deuterated polymers.  Methyl-group deuterated  poly(vinyl acetate) and poly(methyl acrylate) will be used and  adsorbed on silica at differing amounts.  The deuterium NMR spectra  of the bulk and surface adsorbed materials will be used to  determine how the dynamics (molecular motion) of the adsorbed  polymers vary as a function as the distance from the surface  binding sites.  %%%  If successful, these exploratory studies will provide a unique view  of the dynamics of these interfacial materials and the results  should allow the development of composite materials with enhanced  performance.",
