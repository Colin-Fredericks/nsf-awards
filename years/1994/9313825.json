 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research proposal to study the effects of formal education on a nomadic pastoralist group in Iran received  enthusiastic reviews.   Reviewer Caton mentions  that he knew the student, but he was not a faculty member at Washington University during the time the student was there (Caton taught at Wash U. for a few years prior to 1988, the student arrived after that date).    There is no justification  in the research plan for the domestic travel in the US or the video camera, and I can't recommend  their funding.  Otherwise the budget is reasonable given the field conditions.    The student has no  other support for this research.    I recommend that the proposal be  funded.     TIME \\@ `MMMM d,  yyyy` September 20, 1993    Beck  9313825    This project involves the dissertation research of a  cultural anthropologist from Washington University, Missouri.  Using archival study, interviews and  participant observation the student will study the effects of state-controlled formal education on the  cultural identity of a nomadic pastoral group in southern Iran.  This part of the world has a long  history of local-national state hostility and struggle over domination.  The researcher, a native  speaker of the language, will study how the identity of local school teachers influences the cultural  content of the education experience of their students.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the state  hostility to local cultural identity has paradoxically served to strengthen this local `resistance`  identity, and the project will study how this m ight have happened.    This project is important in  light of the many local wars and struggles of local ethnic groups against national states.  Increased  understanding of the parameters affecting local resistance and struggle, or local acceptance and  cultural blending, will help us understand and perhaps prepare for other situations of conflict.",
