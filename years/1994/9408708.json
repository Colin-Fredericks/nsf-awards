 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  covers two closely related areas of collaboration technology: collaborative tools and infrastructures. In the  area of  collaborative tools, it is addressing the potential of  these tools  for  making distributed collaborative software engineering tasks  more concurrent,  thereby allowing  these  time-consuming tasks to be completed significantly more quickly. In the area  of collaborative infrastructures, it is addressing support for nearautomatic  generation of efficient, collaborative tools, thereby significantly  reducing the tremendous amount of effort  required to  program  these tools manually. These two efforts are  related since the infrastructure is being used to build the tools and the tools are being used to evaluate the infrastructure. Some of  the specific  issues being addressed include security,  consistency, computer support for gathering software engineering requirements, and asynchronous software engineering meetings. The research  is using an experimental method wherein the infrastructure and tools are  being  implemented  and used in case studies.  The  research results  will  include:  taxonomies of collaboration  scenarios; principles,   interaction  models, software  abstractions,   and architectures that support these scenarios; and evaluation of the infrastructure and tools being developed.",
