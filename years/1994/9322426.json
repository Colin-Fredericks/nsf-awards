University at  Stony Brook, joined by Princeton University, and the Geophysical  Laboratory form the core institutions in the Center.  With this  application, the Stony Brook arm of the Center (the Mineral Physics  Institute) is proposing to expand and formalize an existing summer  program which enables selected undergraduates to participate in the  excitement of the advances made in this environment.  While the  research program will be housed at Stony Brook, we will provide an  opportunity for the students to visit the other laboratories and  institutions involved in the Science and Technology Center. Our  goal with the proposed program is to expose a limited number of  undergraduates to frontier science with the hope that they will be  stimulated to the point of pursuing a career in research science.",
