 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410359  Gadh       The long-term goal of the current research is to develop a   fundamentally new approach to computer-aided geometric design which   integrates a features-based design approach with feature   abstraction from boundary representation surface or solid  models.   The focus of this research activity is on the  determination of  features generated in a design-by-features/loops  environment.       The features-based design approach in the current research    uses an abstract geometric entity called a loop; features are   defined in terms of loops.  A designer may design in terms of high-   level features such as the rib or boss, and subsequently, may   modify features by modifying loops.  The loop provides the designer   the flexibility to generate creative designs thus providing a   function that is lacking in existing design-by-features approaches.    Whether designing by features or by loops, new features - that are   not intentionally created - get formed.  These features often   affect issues such as manufacturability, assemblability etc.  These   features are determined via a set of loop mappings (or feature   mappings).  Determination of these mappings and their completeness   are studied in this research.  A computer implementation of these   mappings is performed and verified by industry experts.",
