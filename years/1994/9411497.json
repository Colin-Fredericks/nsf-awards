 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411497  Dacey    Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time Program  Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)  Coastal Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The NSF/CoOP Study  will augment and collaborate with the Office of Naval Research  (ONR) -sponsored Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Advanced Research  Initiative (ARI) project scheduled for 1995 off the coast of  Monterey, California.  The overall scientific project is  interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts addressing chemical  and biological parameters, while the ONR study focuses on physical  oceanographic and meteorological parameters.     The investigators will focus on the air-sea flux of dimethylsulfide  (DMS) and CO2 in coastal ocean.  CO2 and DMS represent two of the  most important biogasses in the upper ocean and because of their  spectral properties or greenhouse potential, they are important  factors to be considered in climate models.  There is a lack of  knowledge concerning CO2 and DMS air-sea transfer rates, due  primarily to the inability to measure these tracers at high enough  frequency.  A new automated sampling - analysis scheme will allow  for a continuous record of DMS and pCO2 concentrations in both  surface waters and the overlying atmosphere, as well as in surface  water profiles.  This sampling scheme relies heavily on the  development of automated instrumentation packages that will  continuously operate for the full month-long duration of the field  program.  Data collected will be used in conjunction with data from  physical, biological, and chemical projects from other  investigators participating in both in CoOP and ONR MBL programs.   Ultimately, fundamental questions of biogeochemical ocean  processes, air-sea exchange, and atmospheric processes may be  answered to better enable validation and calibration of existing  climate models and develop new models for predicting local and  global dynamics for these important greenhouse gasses.",
