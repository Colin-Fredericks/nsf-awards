The purpose of the workshop is to enhance the knowledge and  capabilities of biomedical engineering faculty and to  improve the quality of the educational experience for  undergraduate biomedical engineering students.  Engineering  education is undergoing significant revamping, and much of  the curricula innovation that is occurring is tied to the  area of engineering design.  This workshop will bring  together biomedical engineering faculty who teach courses  involving biomedical engineering design, as well as key  outside experts in engineering design to share insights and  experiences with the participants.    The second objective of the workshop is to use it as a  mechanism to create a BME Undergraduate Design Resource  Guide.  Participants to the workshop will provide resource  material, and the resulting guide will be distributed to all  participating institutions.  ***",
