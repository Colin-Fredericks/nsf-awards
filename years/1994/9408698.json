Butterworth,  Oakland University, Michigan, Dr. Dieter Reidel,  University of Windsor, Ontario, and Dr. Judith Guzman  Rivera of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones  Nucleares (ININ) in Mexico City, will take place in  conjunction with the annual conference of the  International Association of Great Lakes Research, in  Windsor, Ontario, June 1994.  The major objectives of  the symposium are to identify deficiencies and  problems with current monitoring strategies; to  present novel state-of-the art biomonitoring methods  and applications, and to stimulate new associations  and collaborations between North American Free Trade  (NAFTA) countries to respond to the challenges of  increased pollution rates.       Routine monitoring using biological test systems is  critical in the surveillance of aqueous environments  to identify hazards to human health.  The traditional  method of using biomonitors in conjunction  with  chemical analysis to detect pathologies caused by  toxic contaminants is hampered by the presence in the  environment of complex mixtures of these pollutants.   There is, therefore, an urgent need to accelerate  research in developing improved and new systems to  detect new hazards resulting from increased industrial  development of the NAFTA countries.  The work  presented and the standards recommended at this  symposium will be published as a reference resource  for the benefit of the scientific community,  regulatory agencies, and the public.  ***",
