 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354595  Meltzer   Undergraduate science courses taken by preservice teachers  typically have textbook-centered lecture formats. There is a  need for new course designs which implement ideas found  beneficial in recent educational research. It is essential that  pilot forms of the courses be offered, tested and evaluated,  and that reports of the successes and problem areas of such  courses be widely disseminated.This proposal is for a pilot  project to develop, implement, and assess an elementary physics  course, appropriate for preservice teachers, which would embody  a number of the recent innovations in educational theory and  practice. Among the problems which need to be investigated is  the question of just how severely the breadth of topical  coverage will have to be reduced from standard levels, in order  to ensure that what is covered is actually learned and retained  by the students.The theme of \"energy\" is used as a conceptual  pivot to tie together the various topics. Students'  pre/misconceptions regarding physical phenomena will guide the  presentation, activities, and discussion. After pretesting to  determine student preconceptions, issues related to their  preconceived ideas will be investigated by the students through  guided \"mini-research-projects.\" These projects will be carried  out by the students working in small groups; discussions  centered around each group's results will lead to a systematic  summing-up by the instructor to provide perspective, and tie  into the next topical area with the thread of the theme \"energy  transformation and conservation.\" During course delivery,  ongoing testing and other assessment will guide the pacing and  depth of the topical coverage.The target audience is  prospective elementary and middle-school teachers, and other  non-technical students. The project has the potential to  significantly improve the knowledge of and attitude towards  physics on the part of those whose typical experience with  college physical science tends to be dist asteful and  nonproductive.",
