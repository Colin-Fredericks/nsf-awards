 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451761  Eliason  The acquisition of an FT-NMR spectrometer will significantly  improve the chemistry curriculum. The new instrument will give  the students the hands-on ability to record their own spectra  which is pedagogically superior to book instruction alone, and a  hands-on experience has always been an important objective for  our department. A goal of this proposal is to introduce basic 1H,  13C, DEPT, 1H- 1H COSY and 1H-13C COSY techniques early in the  sophomore organic chemistry course. This will assist in  restructuring the laboratory curriculum of the second and third  years to provide experiments that engage all students in a  research oriented experience. Laboratory students will be  organized into research like teams. The team will be given an  experiment, will discuss experimental design and procedures, will  collect and review data, and will draw conclusions and design new  experiments as necessary. Unlike other programs in which the  laboratory curriculum is a pure research project, our plan is to  provide a mixture of standard and open ended experiments. Our  goal is to provide a research type atmosphere while at the same  time providing an environment in which the student experiences  tangible success thereby providing the excitement of discovery to  attract students into our undergraduate research program.    The laboratory curriculum of organic, biophysical, biochemistry  and physical chemistry will be heavily impacted by this proposal.  The effectiveness of teaching of the basic theory of 1H NMR will  be aided with the use of 1H- 1H COSY as a teaching tool. The  power of 1-D and 2-D NMR techniques to solve structural problems  will be shown both in organic qualitative analysis and in  biochemistry.    Concurrent with our efforts to revise our basic laboratory  curriculum we propose to formalize the involvement of students in  a structured research program. Instead of a single faculty member  working with a single student, project teams consisting of two or  more faculty  will be formed to develop cross discipline projects.  A special effort to recruit dual biology/chemistry major  students, who have tended not to be involved in research, will be  made to increase their participation.",
