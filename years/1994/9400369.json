 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400369  O'Brien  Several methods to polymerize supramolecular assemblies were  introduced in the last decade.  Many of these assemblies, e.g.  monolayers, liposomes, and multilayers, are two-dimensional  arrays of amphiphiles.  Success in the design and reproducible  preperation of new materials from these assemblies requires a  clear understanding of the polymerization processes.  The  previous studies suppported by NSF-DMR have successfully provided  a basic understanding of the nature of linear polymerizations of  amphiphiles in the supramolecular fast-diffusion regime.  The new  research to be carried over will characterize crosslinking  polymerizations as well as polymerizations in the slow-diffusion  regime.  Methods developed in this laboratory will be used to  characterize the efficiency of crosslinking in two-dimensional  assemblies with newly designed bifunctional molecules.  The rate  and degree of polymerization in bilayers will be compared at  temperatures above (fast diffusion) and below (slow diffusion)  the main-phase transition temperature of the bilayer assembly.  These results of these studies on bilayers will be used to design  new monomers for the polymerization of other supramolecular, e.g.  discotic liquid crystals.  %%%  The polymerization of supramolecular assemblies provides an  effective means to modify their chemical and physical properties  to prepare novel materials with particular properties of interest  to both biological and material sciences.  The research to date  indicates that polymerized supramolecular assemblies are likely  to find utility in diagnostics, in the controlled delivery of  reagents and drugs, in the design and preparation of stable  assemblies for the efficient transduction of light energy, in  surface modification, and for the stabilization of organic  zeolites.  ***",
