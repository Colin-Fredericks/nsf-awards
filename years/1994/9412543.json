 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this study is to understand the relationships between  motivated  behaviors, such as feeding, drinking,  aggression  and  sexual    behaviors,   and   the   chemistry   of   the    brain.  Neurotransmitters  are  chemicals  released  by  nerve  cells  to  communicate   with   other   nerve   cells.   Dopamine    is    a  neurotransmitter thought to be involved in motivation and reward.  In  this  study the relationships between changes  in  levels  of  dopamine  and  the expression of the motivational  components  of  sexual  behavior  in  female hamsters will be examined.  Dopamine  will  be  sampled from specific parts of the brain  to  determine  which  attributes of the male effectively contribute to the  rise  in  dopamine levels, what effects prior sexual experience have on  the  response  to  the  male,  and  whether  conditioned  stimuli  associated  with sexual behavior will induce a rise in  dopamine.  Studies will be also be done to identify the nerve cells  in  the  brain that release this dopamine. The results of this study  will  contribute to our understanding of the role of dopamine in sexual  behavior.  The  results of the study could  also  have  important  implications  for our understanding of drug abuse, since  several  types of additive drugs have dopamine-like action on brain cells.",
