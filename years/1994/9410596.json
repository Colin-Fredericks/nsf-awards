 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410596  Totah  University of Iowa  New chiral ligands based on the 1,7-dioxaspiro 5.5 undecane ring system will be prepared and evaluated on their ability to induce asymmetry in organic transformations as well as their ability to serve as hosts to cationic guests. Enantioselectivity and complex configuration will be evaluated by GC, HPLC, NMR, and x-ray crystallographic analysis. Computer modeling will be used to understand enantioselectivity induced by these systems.    This Research Planning Grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Nancy I. Totah at the University of Iowa. Molecules that complex metal ions and molecules that possess a positive charge will be prepared. These complexing molecules will also possess an array of atoms that is unique and related to either a right- or left-orientation. The term chiral (\"handedness\") is used for this particular type of array. These chiral complexes will be evaluated to determine if they will act as catalysts to incorporate chiral into molecules in chemical reactions.",
