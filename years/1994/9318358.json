 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318358  Sponsel  The proposed research will utilize gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic  mutants and photomophogenetic mutants of Pisum sativum (garden pea)  to investigate the mechanisms by which a plant can regulate both  the levels of active hormone and the responsiveness of its target  tissue.    In the le dwarf mutant of pea the conversion of gibberellin A20 to  GA1 by 3Beta-hydroxylation is reduced in intact plants.  GA1 is the  active GA for internode growth in pea.  Some recently reported  results necessitate a re-examination of the biochemical basis for  the le mutation.  In vivo and in vitro feeding studies of labeled  GAs will be used to examine whether the le mutation interferes with  the transport of GA20 from leaves (which are its putative site of  synthesis) to stems, or whether the le locus could code for a  regulatory factor.  Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the GA  metabolites will be conducted using gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry providing definitive identification.  Since 3Beta-  hydroxylation is one of the most important steps in GA biosynthesis  it is imperative that the functional basis of the le mutation is  defined.      The newly characterized lip1 mutation of pea results in light  independent photomorphogenesis.  In this mutant the severe  reduction in stem growth which normally takes place when pea  seedlings are transferred from dark to light (de-etiolation) is  manifest in complete darkness.  Biochemical studies suggest that  the signal transduction pathway from phytochrome A is affected in  the mutant.  An investigation of the effect of this mutation of GA  levels, metabolism and on tissue responsiveness will be conducted  in order to define which aspects of GA biochemistry are a factor in  photomophogenesis.  ***",
