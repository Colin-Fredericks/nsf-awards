The species are the grape root borer (Vitacea  polistiformis Harris) and the squash vine borer (Melittia  cucurbitae Harris), both members of the lepidopteran Family  Sesiidae.  The two species under investigation are the first  insects to have female responses to synthetic pheromones  documented in the field.  Changes in female behavior under  pheromone treatments have been postulated as a new mechanism  for resistance to mating disruption.  If altered female  behavior under pheromone treatments increases the  probability of mating, and if these behavior changes are  heritable, a potential disruption resistance selection may  exist.  Sesiids are unique in that they have highly similar  pheromone blends, and cross species attraction is known.  Thus, the proposed research also has evolutionary interest  relating to questions of reproductive isolation and  evolution of mating systems.  Lastly, both insects under  investigation are serious plant pests that are not  controlled by either chemical or biological controls in  North Carolina or other areas on the East Coast.  Mating  disruption may be the only method by which to achieve a  satisfactory level of control can be achieved in the  Southeastern United States.",
