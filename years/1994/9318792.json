 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ninfa  9318792  Nitrogen regulation of gene expression in bacteria is accomplished  by the reversible phosphorylation of the transcription factor  Nitrogen regulator I (NRA) which binds to specific DNA sequences  and, when phosphorylated, activates transcription.  The  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NRA are catalyzed by the  bifunctional protein kinase/phosphates Nitrogen regulator II  (NRII).  This project outlines experiments designed to elucidate  the mechanisms of the kinase and phosphates activities of NRII and  their control.  NRA and NRII are related to a large number of  bacterial regulatory proteins, known collectively as the two-  component systems, that share a conserved mechanism of signal  transduction involving protein phosphorylation and  dephosphorylation.  The information gained from the studies of NRII  will increase our understanding of the related kinase/phosphates  proteins.  NRII has several well documented activities:  The protein binds to  ATP and catalyzes the phosphorylation group is then transferred to  NRA in a reaction catalyzed by NRA.  Finally, in the presence of  another signal transduction protein known as PII, NRII catalyzes  the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated form of NRA.  Dr. Ninfa plans to identify, by classical mutagenesis or  oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, alternations of  NRII that result in altered regulation of nitrogen-regulated genes  in vivo.  The altered NRII proteins will then be purified and the  effect of the alterations on the known activities of NRII will be  ascertained.  In this way it is anticipated that the structural  features of NRII required for each of the activities and their  control can be elucidated.  In addition, the roles of the kinase  and phosphates activities of NRII in the control of nitrogen-  regulated genes can be further delineated.  Another approach that will be taken is to more completely  characterize the structure and activities of wild-type NRII.  For  example, a potentially usef ul improvement in the assay for the  phosphatase activity will be employed and the crystallization and  structural analysis of NRII are planned.   %%%  Living organisms do not express all of the genes present in their  DNA at all times; rather, various genes are expressed at certain  times in a manner that is appropriate for the orderly development  of the organism or for an effective response to a stressful  situation.  The turning on and off of genes is accomplished by  molecular switches.  The PI interested in how such molecular  switches function, and is studying a model switch from bacteria.   Bacteria respond to nitrogen starvation by turning on the  expression of certain genes.  The components of the switch required  for this process have been identified.  The most important switch  component is a protein called Nitrogen Regulator II.  This protein  has been purified, and Dr. Ninfa is investigating its properties.  In particular, he would like to know which parts of the NRII  protein are responsible for interacting with NRA, another protein  known as Nitrogen Regulator I, with PII, another protein.  In order  to obtain such information, will be subtly perturbed at known  sites, and alterations in properties will be monitored.  Most  informative are those perturbations that affect only property of  NRII, leaving the other properties intact.  In this project, the  effects of such subtle perturbations to NRII will be studied in  great detail in order to increase our understanding of how this  molecular switch works.  ***",
