Dr. Bruce Baldwin of Duke University in collaboration  with Dr. Scott Armbruster of the University of Alaska is  reconstructing the phylogeny of Old and New World species of the  pantropical plant genus Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae family) in order  to gain insights into the evolution of the group's pollination  system and its biogeographic history.  Specific objectives include:  1. to collect liquid-preserved and herbarium specimens for  morphological analysis and for DNA sequencing of chloroplast and  nuclear ribosomal genes; 2. to determine the pollination ecology of  a sample of Old World taxa, thus complementing knowledge of New  World species; 3. to reconstruct the phylogenetic pattern of  species divergences using nuclear and chloroplast DNA data and  morphology; and 4. to use the phylogeny to trace the biogeographic  history of the group and to generate testable hypotheses about  change in pollination ecology and floral form.       The application of phylogenetic information to evolutionary  biology and ecology has generated considerable excitement in recent  times.  Important features of studying evolution with an estimated  phylogeny include the ability to infer long-term evolutionary  history of characteristics not preserved in the fossil record, such  as ecological relationships between plants and animals, and to  distinguish adaptive evolution from the effects of phylogenetic  constraint and past stochastic events.  The Armbruster and Baldwin  project will advance that agenda.",
