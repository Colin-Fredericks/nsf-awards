 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360219  Powell  Novel probes are proposed for the study of cytoskeletal structures  and processes by electron microscopy.  These will comprise large  cluster complexes of gold, platinum and palladium 0.8 nm - 2.4 nm  in diameter covalently lined to phalloidin, cytochalasin B,  colchicin and taxol via a single reactive functional group  incorporated into their ligand spheres.  The proposed conjugates  will penetrate 20-30 u or more into cell sections and achieve  significantly higher resolution than colloidal gold=antibody  conjugates.  They will be microinjectable and compatible with  living cells, and will be used to extend the use of electron  microscopy to the study of organisms such as procaryotic bacteria,  in which antibody probes are not feasible.  Combined labels  including both a gold cluster and a fluorescent moiety will be used  to prepare additional probes with the same molecules, enabling  correlation of fluorescence confocal microscopy and electron  microscopy data from a single labeling experiment.  The preparation  of molecular wires will be attempted by the in vitro assembly of  gold-labeled cytoskeletal components, followed by silver  enhancement.  %%%  A new class of probes for cystoskeletal structures and processes,  compatible with living cells, will permit electron microscopy with  higher resolution than antibody probes.  In vitro assembly of  labeled cytoskeletal components will be used to prepare novel  conductive molecular wires, and may be applied to the fabrication  of other molecular devices, catalysts, new materials and novel  molecular detection systems.  ***",
