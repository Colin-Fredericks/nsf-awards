 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313786  Jiang  Transport experiments will be carried out on the GaAs/AlGaAs two-  dimensional electron gas in the quantum Hall regime at low  temperatures and high magnetic fields.  The proposed experiments  include study of the transport properties of the Anderson insulator  in a magnetic field, investigation of the critical exponents of the  phase transition between the insulator and the quantum Hall liquid,  and study of the global phase diagram of the quantum Hall effect in  the magnetic field-disorder plane.  The delocalization processes  and general scaling properties of the transitions are likely to be  important to the understanding of other low dimensional quantum  systems.  %%%  Very thin sheets of electrons can be created in artificially  layered semiconductors.  Such electronic two dimensional (2D)  conductors have significant device potential but can also serve as  ideal systems for testing recent theoretical predictions.  A gate  electrode can alter the character of the electron gas from that of  a conductor to an insulator.  An applied magnetic field can revert  an insulating phase to a conducting phase.  It is proposed to study  the 2D electron gas as a function of applied bias and as a function  of magnetic field at low cryogenic temperatures.  The results will  be compared to a recently published comprehensive theory.  The  results are expected to have an impact on the understanding of  other low dimensional electronic systems.  ***",
