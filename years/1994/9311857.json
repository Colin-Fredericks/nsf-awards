 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311857  Burby  Credible arguments can be made for both deterrent and cooperative  approaches to code enforcement, but at present we know relatively  little about the extent to which agencies are using deterrent or  cooperative enforcement techniques, or about their antecedents  and their consequences for improved compliance.  Much of the  discussion in the literature is normative and anecdotal, and  focused mainly on federal regulatory programs.  Thus, there seems  to be a clear need to begin examining empirically strategies  local governments are using to enforce building codes.    This research has five main aims: (1) to determine the degree to  which deterrent and cooperative enforcement techniques are being  used in enforcing building codes in areas subject to seismic  hazards; (2) to isolate agency and community characteristics that  facilitate the use of each approach; (3) to document the  strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the  perceptions and actual experiences of code enforcement personnel;  (4) to isolate factors associated with successful and  unsuccessful experiences with deterrent and cooperative  enforcement (in other words, in what circumstances does each work  well and less well?); and (5) to assess the implications of these  findings for federal and state efforts to foster more effective  enforcement of the seismic provisions of codes and for future  federal and state hazard mitigation programs.  These goals will  be accomplished through a national survey and community case  studies.  ***",
