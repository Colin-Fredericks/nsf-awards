The simulation of  this process is one of the components of a new computational model of  phonetic implementation. It describes a syllable-based organization of  speech. It computes articulatory gesture patterns and resulting  articulatory (and based thereon acoustic) signals. In the last  component of this model, called signal generator, the speech organs,  centering around the tongue, under muscle contraction control, move to  produce speech signals in a new dynamic 3-dimensional finite-element  model.       In the one-year project, new tongue data will be analyzed and  incorporated into this finite element computational framework. This  work will be carried out principally by Mr. Chao-Min Wu, currently a  graduate student in the Bioengineering Program at OSU, whom the PI  advises for a PhD dissertation.       The specific tasks of the research project are (1) to supplement  tissue boundary data of the tongue and other oral structures, which  are obtained from MRI head scans of several subjects, with internal  muscle structure data which are available in detailed anatomical  drawings, and (2) to construct a basic finite element model of the  tongue and adapt it for each subject and then to the tongue shapes in  different vowel articulations, by a method of nonuniform geometrical  mapping. The model designs will be improved by successive  approximation through comparing their transforms for available MRI  data from task (1).        The data created in this project will be available for use by  researchers in phonetics in general, and will be useful for any theory  of phonetics. The anatomical data to be produced along with the newly  developed software will be made available also for any other tongue  modeling and similar articulatory studies.  ***",
