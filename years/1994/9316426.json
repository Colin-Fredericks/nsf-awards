Like other marine organisms, sea urchins  contain mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) which absorb  environmentally relevant wavelengths of UV. Various seaweeds  eaten by sea urchins are rich in MAAs, and preliminary  chromatographic analyses indicate concordance between the  MAA levels in seaweed and in sea urchin tissues, especially  ovaries. Controlled maintenance of sea urchins on seaweeds  lacking or rich in MAAs confirms dietary accumulation of  MAAs in the urchins' ovaries, and provides an experimental  means to fortify the eggs with these presumptive UV  defenses.       Published documentation of a UV-protective effect of  MAAs is largely circumstantial. Thus, a major objective of  the proposed research is to test directly whether MAAs  protect echinoid eggs and larvae from exposure to natural  and simulated solar UV. If the hypothesis that MAAs do  confer protection against UV radiation is correct, dietary  fortification of sea urchin ovaries should confer a greater  resistance to UV in eggs and larvae; therefore, effects of  acute UV exposure on pyrimidine dimer formation in DNA,  fertilization, development, and larval survival will be  assessed in MAA-rich and MAA-deficient individuals.       A comparative study in this project is aimed at  determining whether different exposures to solar UV  radiation are associated with qualitative and quantitative  differences in MAA content. MAA composition and content in a  Maine species of sea urchin will be compared with those in a  sympatric sand dollar. The sea urchin species matures and  spawns in late winter; thus gamete maturation and larval  development take place under relatively low levels of UV  exposure. In contrast, the sand dollar is mature and spawns  repeatedly from June through October, so its eggs and larvae  are exposed to higher seasonal UV radiation than the winter-  spawning se a urchin and may require more robust  photooxidative defenses.       The results of this study will have implications for       the  mechanism of  accumulation and effectiveness of natural  photooxidative defenses in marine food chains. This is a  genuine concern because of deterioration of the protective  ozone layer, where boreal marine organisms have evolved  under relatively low solar UV exposure. The research may  also have importance in the search for natural (dietary)  antioxidants, some of which may be active as inhibitors of  tumor promotion in human cells.  ***",
