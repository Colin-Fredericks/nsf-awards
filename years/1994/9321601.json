Ofer Bar-Yosef and Katherine Wright, in collaboration with  chemists from University College, University of London, will  conduct chemical analysis of residues incorporated onto prehistoric  pounding and grinding stones. The objects to be studied derive from  a series of sites in Jordan and Israel. On this basis they hope to  reconstruct the uses to which these objects were put, determine  whether individual specimens served to reduce animal or plant  products, and hopefully identify the individual plant species. They  will employ thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass  spectroscopy. Materials selected for analysis derive from secure  well dated archaeological contexts and include both pre-  agricultural and early agricultural sites.    The domestication of plants and animals occurred in the Near East  ca. 10,000 years ago and marks a major transition in human  lifestyle. This \"Neolithic revolution\" provided the basis for  population increase, the development of settled village life and  the rise of civilization. Archaeologists wish to understand the  process which lead to domestication and recognize how difficult it  is to accomplish this. Plants only infrequently leave a visible  mark in the archaeological record because - in contrast to animal  bone - they are often fragile and do not preserve well. It is known  by ethnographic analogy that ground stone objects are often used to  process plant and animal foods and for this reason Drs. Bar-Yosef  and Wright are focussing on such materials.    This research is important for several reasons. It will help to  develop a technique which may be applied in many archaeological  situations. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists  and increase our understanding of how complex societies such as our  own developed.  ***",
