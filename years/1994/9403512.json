New techniques and methods of analysis of the behavior  of existing approximation methods will be studied.  Three main  problems will be considered:  (1) A new approach to  superconvergence and extrapolation will be studied resulting from  new local error estimates.  Extensions to problems with non-  smooth solutions, parabolic equations, and integral equations  will be investigated, as well as applications to domain  decomposition methods and multigrid.  (2) Algorithms for  obtaining optimal order accurate methods for elliptic problems on  3-dimensional polyhedral domains where there is a confluence of  edge singularities and vertex singularities in derivatives will  be studied.  (3) New methods for obtaining local up to boundary  estimates for finite element methods using isoparametric elements  in R^n will be investigated.    The subject of superconvergence and extrapolation for finite  element methods has been the object of investigations by many  researchers.  A new and general theory that unifies both of these  subjects and leads to new results has been developed by the  principal investigator.  These results lead to new highly  accurate and efficient methods for solving some important  physical problems.  The methods are easy to implement, especially  on modern supercomputers.  They can be totally parallelized and  are compatible with recent domain decomposition and multigrid  algorithms.  Fewer finite elements are needed for these methods  to produce the same accuracy as standard finite element methods  using the same type of element.  The new theory seems to be the  most general available at the present time.  It is proposed to  continue to investigate new facets of the theory and expand its  applicability to a variety of new problems such as problems with  non smooth solutions and parabolic equations.",
