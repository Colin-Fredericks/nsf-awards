 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411515  HEINZ  During the last two decades, extensive changes have taken place in  the legal services industry.  In particular, the market for legal  services has changed significantly.  U.S. Supreme Court decisions  striking down limitations on advertising and fee schedules  unleashed new forms of competition and new mechanisms for the  delivery of legal services, including franchise law firms and group  legal service plans.  Corporate law firms experienced dramatic  growth, internal bureaucratization, and intense competition as  longstanding client relationships gave way to a transactions-  oriented market.  During these same decades, women entered the  professions of the law in far greater numbers than ever before, and  the percentage of minorities among legal professionals also  increased substantially, though far less rapidly.  These  practitioners control access to the legal system  -  in fact, they  dispose of most of the cases.  Therefore, the social backgrounds  from which they are recruited, the types of work they do, the kinds  of clients they represent, the professional and community roles  they occupy, and the social and political values they hold are  related fundamentally to the character of justice in American  society.    This study will be based on interviews with the full range of legal  professionals, including prosecutors, judges, and inside corporate  counsel, as well as private practitioners.  Data exist from a  similar survey conducted in Chicago in 1974-75, which will provide  a basis for comparison and analysis of the extent of changes over  the past twenty years.  Personal interviews will now be conducted  in Chicago with a random sample of about 800 respondents.  The  analyses will assess changes in the nature of the work, work  settings, career histories, professional commitment, client  relationships, professional networks, and personal background  characteristics.  Special attention will be given to the changing  roles of women and minorities in the legal services  industry.    ***",
