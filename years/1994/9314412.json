The  U.S. investigators are I.V. Ramakrishnan, Leo Bachmair, and Jieh  Hsiang and the French investigators are Helene and Claude Kirchner  and Michael Rusinowitch.  The objective of their research is to  investigate the use of constraints in the design and implementation   of high performance deductive computing systems.  They will focus  on parallel automated deduction with constraints; methods for  fundamental operations in deductive systems and program analysis of  logic programs.    This project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the U.S.  and French groups. The U.S. investigators bring to this  collaboration their strengths in theory and application. The French  group at Nancy are considered leaders in software development as it  relates to term rewriting and constraints.  This investigation will  impact software design for high performance computing systems and  has important applications in logic programming.  ***",
