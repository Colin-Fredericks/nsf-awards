 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314040  Laue  Previous NSF support of this lab has resulted in the  development of devices uniquely capable of measuring  macromolecular charge directly in solution and has helped  lead the world in the modernization of the analytical  ultracentrifuge. The work outlined here will combine and  expand these previous efforts to provide the experimental  means to examine the role of electrostatic charge in the  energetics dictating rnacromolecular structures and  interactions. Correlations will be made between measured  charge and molecular structures, yielding direct  experimental assessments of: 1) the contribution of charge  to the stability of the native state of proteins, 2) the  change in charge that accompanies structural changes in  proteins and nucleic acids and 3) the charge contribution to  the energetics of rnacromolecular associations. To  accomplish these goals, new instrumentation and  methodologies for analytical ultracentrifugation and  equilibrium electrophoresis are needed. New instrumentation  resulting from this proposal will include: 1) the  development of fluorescence detection for the XLA analytical  ultracentrifuge, 2) equilibrium electrophoresis devices with  greater accuracy, that require less the time to reach  equilibrium and need less sample, 3) fluorescence detection  capabilities for equilibrium electrophoresis devices, and 4)  a new means of determining and regulating small electric  fields in a conducting fluid. Improved rnethods for  examining rnacromolecular associations will include: 1) on-  line determination of extinction coefficients and  fluorescence quantum yields to improve the deconvolution of  spectra, 2) the use of biologically-produced spectrally-  enhanced protein for the analysis of complicated equilibria,  3) combining fluorescence, absorbance and refractive data to  increase the concentration range studied and 4) combining  results from fluorescence depolarization and sedimentation  velocity to better define molecular shapes. Test systems for  thes e developrnents will be provided by on-going  collaborations involving: 1) the change in charge associated  with urea denaturation of proteins, 2) the role of charge in  protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions  relating to gene regulation, 3) associations involving  proteins important to blood coagulation, 4)macromolecular  interactions important to proteoglycan structure and  assembly, and 5) the change in charge as supercoiled DNA is  first relaxed, then linearized. For the first category,  charge mutants of T4 lysozyme and \"leucine zipper\" peptides  will be used. For both, good native-state structures are  available, and the denatured state is presumed to be a  random coil. In the second category, we have used 5-OH-  tryptophan-spectrally-enhanced  cI repressor to detail the  linkage between protein self association and DNA binding.  Similar studies with the more complicated CytR-CRP system  are being initiated. Fluorescence detection is needed to  characterize the tight binding events in these systems. In  the third category, long-standing projects involving the  structures and interactions of various blood coagulation  complexes will continue. Specific fluorescent labeling of  many of these proteins is possible, so that the increased  sensitivity and selectivity afforded by fluorescence optics,  will allow the examination of both higher affinity and more  complicated interactions. In the fourth category, work will  continue on gathering basic information concerning  proteoglycan assembly and their interactions with peptide  hormones. In the last  category, the charge on plamid dsDNA  will be measured when the molecule is in supercoiled,  relaxed and open forms, and correlated with hydrodynamic  shape and size. Knowledge of the charge in each of these  categories has scientific importance beyond the  instrumentation development. Likewise, each test system  serves as a paradigm for how the instruments and methods  developed in this proposal can be applied to other, similar  prob lems. Funds are sought for the equipment, supplies and  technical personnel needed to: 1) develop fluorescence  detection capabilities on the XLA analytical  ultracentrifuge, 2) refurbish/replace a circular dichroism  instrument, 3) continue the development and optimization of  equilibrium electrophoresis equipment and 4) continue  ongoing collaborative experiments on equilibrium  electrophoresis and the analysis of heteroassociating  systems by sedimentation and equilibrium electrophoresis.",
