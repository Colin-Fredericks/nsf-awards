The project has three objectives that address needs established  by the physics education community: to develop instruments and  methodologies to explore students' beliefs about the structure  and content of physics knowledge, and about teaching and  learning; to develop tasks that would elicit students' prior  ideas; and to develop strategies suitable for ongoing  assessment of student understanding.  When met, these objectives  will be utilized to develop a new infrastructure for promoting  meaningful learning of physics in college level introductory  courses.",
