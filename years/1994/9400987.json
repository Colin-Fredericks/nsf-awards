These subfactors have subsequently found  applications in topology (construction of invariants of 3-  manifolds) and category theory (classification of tensor  categories whose Grothendieck ring coincides with the one of  SU(k) or with related so-called fusion rings). It is planned to  study new subfactors obtained from the relation between  invariants of 3-manifolds and subfactors. Further work will be  done extending the investigators classification of subfactors. An  attempt will be made to gain insight using the path idempotent  approach for Hecke algebras in the case when they are not  semisimple. This has already been applied to a special quotient,  the Temperley-Lieb algebra and it seems to have potential for  more general cases.       This research is in a very active area of Modern Analysis  involving applications of operator algebras to mathematical  physics and geometry. A certain abstract algebra invariant  discovered in the mid 1980's by V. F. Jones has had surprising  applications to geometry and mathematical physics. This project  involves such applications based on specific algebraic structures  discovered by Professor Wenzl.  ***",
