 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301635  Bayliss       The investigator numerically studies the development of  complex spatial and temporal patterns in combustion.  These  patterns are associated with narrow reaction zones in which rapid  changes in the dependent variables occur across narrow spatial  regions.  The solutions are obtained using an adaptive  pseudo-spectral method in which coordinate transformations are  introduced during the course of the computation to better resolve  the reaction zone and the associated patterns.  He considers the  formation of modulated traveling waves (MTWs) in cellular flames,  transitions between different types of MTWs and transitions  between MTWs and chaotic patterns, one-step and multiple reaction  mechanisms, the role of thermal expansion of the gas on the  formation and evolution of the patterns, and the formation of  spatial and temporal patterns in condensed phase gasless  combustion.  He also further develops the numerical method to  account for problems where there are multiple regions of rapid  variation.       It has been observed that many combustible mixtures do not  necessarily burn in a unifrom pattern.  Rather, ripples and other  patterns can occur along the flame.  The formation of such  patterns is believed to be an important stage in the transition  from laminar combustion (in which the burning occurs in a  regular,  predictable manner) to turbulent combustion (in which the burning  occurs in an erratic, seemingly random fashion).  An  understanding  of the transition process is an essential prerequisite to control  of the transition process to lead to more efficient burning.  In  many instances these patterns can not be predicted by analytic  means and experiments are much less advanced than for nonreacting  flows.  In the project, the investigator studies the problem of  the formation of patterns and the transition to turbulence in  combustion.  The project uses supercomputer computations to study  the formation of these patterns and the physical mechanisms  underly ing them.  The study relates both to gaseous combustion,  i.e., the burning of fossil fuels, and gasless combustion, in  which a solid burns directly.  The last process is employed in  the  synthesis of materials, in particular of advanced ceramics and  metallic alloys.",
