 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311774  Ibrahim  This award supports Professor Raouf Ibrahim and a graduate  student of  Wayne State University to collaborate in mechanical engineering  research with Professor Karl Popp and his group at the University  of  Hannover, Germany.  They share an interest in the influence of  friction on the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems.  Utilizing  the  expertise of the German group, they will conduct experiments to  measure the friction characteristics of metallic friction  interfaces  under stationary and non-stationary relative rotational motion in  rotating machinery.  This will enable the collaborating research  groups to develop friction models with nonlinear and random  characteristics.  Then the group at Wayne State will test these  models by carrying out analytical and numerical studies of  stick-slip  motions in discrete rotating systems.    This research addresses an important group of problems related to  vibration and wear in sliding surfaces.  Undesirable effects of  instability and friction are common in virtually all machinery  and  mechanical systems.  The results of this research will enable  these  investigators to develop design guidelines for sliding surfaces  free  of friction-induced noise. This would be relevant, for example,  to  the design of improved rotating bearings for high speed  machinery.  ***",
