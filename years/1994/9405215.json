The instrument will be added to the  microanalytical equipment pool covered by a Cooperative  Agreement of the Triangle Earth Science Micro-analytical  Consortium, assuring that it will be freely available for  shared use by staff and students of Duke University, The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and The North  Carolina State University at Raleigh.       The upgraded electron microprobe system will be capable  of accurate elemental chemical analysis of major and minor  elements in solid samples with a spatial resolution on the  order of micrometers. The electron microprobe is a basic  tool of geological research dealing with the chemistry of  earth materials and will be used in a variety of research  and teaching projects in the earth sciences.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory  in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of  researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces, and Archean and Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods for the quantitative  measurement of the isotope s of hafnium.  ***",
