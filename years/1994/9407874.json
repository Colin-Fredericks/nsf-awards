 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  INT-9407874    The globalization of science is occurring in parallel with a  rapid expansion in the speed and sophistication of information  and data handling technologies, and in their uses for scientific  purposes.  Developments in these areas permit the planning and  execution of large scale scientific programs.  Such programs, in  turn, frequently require sophisticated data handling and  processing techniques.  In view of the multilateral character of  many large scale scientific programs, the handling, processing,  and transmission of scientific data has become a major  international enterprise in its own right, one that is vital to  those scientific programs. The Committee on Data for Science and  Technology (CODATA) is a non-governmental, multilateral body  affiliated with the International council of Scientific Unions  (ICSU).  The principal objective of CODATA is to facilitate  worldwide communication on problems relevant to scientific data.   Like other members of the ICSU family, CODATA is comprised of  non-governmental National Member Organizations.  The National  Academy of Sciences (NAS) fulfills that function in the United  States.  This award will provide partial support to the NAS to  continue to manage U.S. participation in CODATA, including  partial payment of dues to CODATA and partial support of the  activities of the U.S. National Committee.  Additional support is  also being sought from several other federal agencies:  DoE,  NASA, NIH, and NIST.  ***",
