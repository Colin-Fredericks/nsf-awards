The accomplished of these goals are by fulfilling the following specific aims:    1. Develop a new biotechnology curriculum - An upper level undergraduate/lower level graduate course, entitled \"Biomolecular Engineering\", will focus on engineering analyses and applications at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level.  It will be based largely on on-going research efforts in laboratories of the University of Michigan and some of its industrial research partners.  The existing upper level biochemical engineering courses will be modified to include more advanced concepts.  The resulting bioengineering sequence will provide students with breadth as well as depth of knowledge in biotechnology.    2. Develop interactive multimedia-based software for the new curriculum and for national integration into the core undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum - This software will be used in the new course (Aim 1) as well as in an existing biotechnology course which covers the more traditional aspects of biotechnology, e.g. fermentation process design.  Abbreviated versions of the software will be prepared for use in core undergraduate chemical engineering courses.  These modules, which will be distributed nationally, will serve both as motivators to provide exposure to the biotechnology field as well as facilitators to enable students to analyze engineering fundamentals as they are applied to new situations.  ***",
