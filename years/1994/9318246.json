Fuller understanding of how those  traits in which males and females differ, including  behavioral traits, influence both the actions of other  animals and biological success are important in a number of  applied areas, particularly in designing optimal breeding  programs for endangered species.  In the long run, a full  understanding of these basic biological processes will  provide clues to understanding male and female interactions  in other species, including humans.    Dr. Westneat will employ experimental manipulations,  observations of the behavior of free-living individuals, and  analyses of the genetic consequences of behavior to provide  an understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on the  interactions between males and females.  Five experiments on  red-winged blackbirds will be carried out.  Three will  investigate how individual variation in appearance among  free-living males affects three components of mating success  (number of females nesting on the territory, proportion of  their young sired by the territory owner, and number of  young sired in other males' territories) using molecular  genetic techniques.  The other two experiments will test  different factors that influence female responses to males.  Dr. Westneat's research will help us comprehend the  evolutionary consequences of the relationship between  appearance and behavior in the context of male-female  interactions.",
