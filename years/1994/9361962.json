 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361962  Savage       To meet existing and future casting manufacturing needs, the  development of an automated rapid metrology (ARM) capability for  investment casting layout is needed.  The suggested approach is  based on the extraction of dimensional information from computed  tomography (CT) images of a part.  A key advantage of ARM is that  it relies upon a radiographic method to nondestructively obtain  both exterior and interior views of the object, eliminating the  need for sectioning.  A second advantage is that CT is a  densitometric modality, both dimensional and defect information can  be obtained simultaneously.  However, the most important advantage  of the ARM concept is that CT systems are orders of magnitude  faster than alternate methods.  A single CT scan set can be  obtained in a few hours, providing complete dimensional information  and 100% screening for porosity and microshrink defects, even in  inaccessible regions of complex multiple-wall superalloy castings.   Corrections for partial-volume and scattered-radiation artifacts  and algorithms for thin-wall porosity detection will be researched.   The efficacy of these methods will be evaluated on high-energy CT  data of a large structural superalloy component.       Development of an automated rapid metrology system will result  in significant cost reductions and throughput improvements during  process development and production of large investment castings.",
