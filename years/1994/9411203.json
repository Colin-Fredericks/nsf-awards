 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411203  Zhao       This award is for a planning grant to enable the principal   investigator to develop a program of research on the application of   genetic algorithms to the optimal design of engineering systems.    In particular, this research will focus on the design of complex   systems involving the synthesis of topology, geometry, component   properties, and their relationships.  The preliminary research will   study some important issues concerning the development of   methodologies for the above purpose, including the possible   representations of engineering systems suitable for genetic   algorithms, the representation of design requirements and   constraints, and possible extensions to other engineering problems   that involve the synthesis of a large number of subsystems and   components.       This research could lead to a better understanding of the   engineering design process, and the ability to affect better system   designs.  Although it is initially focused in the area of civil   structures, if successful, it should be applicable to a wide   variety of engineering systems.",
