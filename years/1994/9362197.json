 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362197  DOUGLASS  This project will to use a low altitude, polar-orbiting,  data collection satellite platform, in conjunction with  commercial communication satellites, to provide direct  worldwide recovery and distribution of data from in-situ  instrumentation platforms.  It also provides a command link  for remote control of the untended platforms.  This project  offers an affordable approach to greatly improved polar  telescience.  It will significantly increase communication  capacity and reduce delays in data recovery for deployed  systems.  The overall objective of the program is to  increase the daily data throughput capability by a factor of  100 or more, compared to existing systems.  The anticipated  total system cost makes it feasible to develop the system  with private sector financing and operate it on a a fee-for-  service basis.  The Phase I study will (1) examine user  requirements, (2) develop a system specification, (3)  prepare a preliminary design of the sensor platform and  satellite equipment, (4) perform a cost effectiveness  analysis, including budgetary life cycle costs, and (5)  develop a Phase II plan for system development, simulation,  and demonstration.  The study will emphasize minimization of  total system complexity and costs by using simple sensor  platform communication packages, low cost development  options, proven satellite components, and existing, proven  comsat systems for data distribution.  ***",
