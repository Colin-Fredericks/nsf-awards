 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric chemistry is a rather young discipline, but  technically very demanding.  The international programs that rely  on well-trained cadre of atmospheric chemists for executing complex  and ambitious research, monitoring and assessment tasks include the  International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Program (IGAC--a core  project of the IGBP), the Global Climate Observing System) and the  System for Analysis, Research and Training (START--a core project  of the IGBP).  To promote education and training in this field,  scientists in IGAC, GAW and START have joined forces to design and  execute an integrated approach to \"academic capacity building\" in  developing countries.  The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its  affiliates will establish an international pool of voluntary  lecturers recruited from their memberships and to coordinate the  initial efforts of the program.  These include:         Establishment of an international voluntary teaching faculty.       Establishment of a steering committee in charge of curriculum       design for an atmospheric chemistry program which can be       implemented at participating universities in developing       countries.       Execution of a series of mini-sessions and workshops involving       members of the voluntary teaching faculty for finalizing the       implementation plan.    Preparation of a proposal which can be submitted to international  funding agencies for implementing the academic capacity building  program.",
