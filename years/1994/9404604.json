 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404604  Rivera         The investigator extends a variety of theoretical results  for dynamical systems and applies them to problems in electrical  engineering and mathematical biology.  The theoretical results  include: shooting methods, spectral analysis of operators on  Banach spaces to obtain new results on invariant manifolds, and  linearizations about stationary solutions.  These results are  applied to analyse the existence and stability of travelling  waves in PDE epidemic models and the losses in NFDE models of  electrical power transmission lines.         Biologists have observed that animal and human epidemics  spread throughout a geographical area in the form of a travelling  wave.  Engineers have observed how much loss occurs as  electricityis transmitted through power lines over distances.   The mathematical models mentioned above give reasonable  approximations to essential features of these physical phenomena  and enable us to improve our ability to predict and control them.   This is important because of the expanding problem of animal and  human epidemics (e.g.  HIV-AIDS and rabies).  The investigator  applies analytical and computational methods to improve  understanding of these models and to interpret the physical  meaning of the results.",
