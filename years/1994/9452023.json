 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the use of advanced technologies, a diverse faculty, and  computer innovation, the institution will produce an inorganic  laboratory that bridges the gap between molecular and materials  sciences using techniques and methodologies which will prepare  students with the tools necessary to succeed in industry and  academia today. The central plan for this new laboratory is to have  students model, prepare, and completely characterize a series of  independent inorganic systems that range from simple molecules,  such as ferrocene, to extended molecular structures and materials,  such as zeolites. In each case the students will: 1) explore the  reaction conditions and characteristics of target substances using  advanced computer software, 2) apply their computer results in the  preparation of these systems by modern synthetic methodologies, and  3) completely characterize these systems using advanced  spectroscopic and analytical technologies. At the completion of  each system, the students will assess the success of the initial  modeling efforts on the final observed product and reaction  conditions, and test any changes they may develop through  additional computer analysis. Each system/experiment will be a self  standing module that is readily transferrable to other  universities. This new laboratory will act as a model which can and  will be implemented at universities and colleges across the country  both in the inorganic curriculum and, with suitable examples, other  sub-disciplines as well.",
