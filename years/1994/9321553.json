 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321553  lLevey       Plant recruitment is the process by which plants produce  offspring (seeds) to replace themselves and thus produce a self-  regenerating habitat.  Seed dispersal is the process that allows  plants to \"move\" by distributing the seeds throughout the  surrounding area.  Most plants produce many more seeds than can  survive because after dispersal, mice and other rodents eat (and  therefore kill) many of the seeds.  Sometimes, if seeds are  abundant, rodents may store some extra seeds to be eaten later in  the year.  A few of these stored seeds may be forgotten and may  germinate, in which case the rodents are acting as \"secondary\"  dispersers.  Those seeds that survive and germinate face many other  dangers, such as plant-eating insects and mammals, mold and  disease, and falling branches and trees.  Thus, plant recruitment  is a complicated process of many stages and involves interactions  with many other species.  In tropical forests, which are being  rapidly destroyed, we know very little about plant recruitment, and  therefore we lack the information necessary to make recommendations  about how to save and restore these forests.%%%       Ocotea endresiana (related to avocados) is a common tree in  the mountain forests near Monteverde, Costa Rica.  The large fruits  are eaten and the seeds dispersed by relatively few species of  birds.  Despite several studies on seeds dispersal of some related  trees, the post-dispersal fate of these seeds is not well  understood.  In this study, recruitment of O.endresiana seedings  will be examined to determine the importance of primary dispersal,  secondary dispersal, and seed predation on seedling  establishment.%%%       This research will provide some of the first information on  the degree of complexity involved in the seed dispersal process.    Such information will prove useful to wildlife managers who hope to  rebuild -- or even simply to maintain -- natural habitats.  The  interrelationships among a complex array of seed dispers ers and  predators will be examined.  Each one plays a role in determining  plant survival -- the question is, how critical is that role?  If  the roles of various primary and secondary dispersers are known,  then one can predict the effects of animal extinctions on seed  dispersal.  Increasing knowledge of seed dispersal and plant  recruitment will provide another piece in the puzzle of  understanding how tropical forests \"work.\"***",
