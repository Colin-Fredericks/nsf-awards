 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hormones of the posterior pituitary are known to function  in  regulating water/mineral balance, stimulating contractions of the  reproductive  tract,  and controlling lactation.  Recently  these  hormones  have  been discovered to be distributed throughout  the  brain  and  have been implicated in the regulation  of  behaviors  such   as   attention,   learning,   communication,   aggression,  reproduction  and  parenting. This project examines  whether  the  pituitary  hormone vasotocin plays a crucial role in coordinating  the  body's  physiological  responses to  changing  environmental  conditions  while  at the same time modulating  the  individual's  social  behavior.  The  hypothesis is that  environmental  stress  causes massive vasotocin release into the bloodstream, inhibiting  gonadal  function,  inhibiting vasotocin action  in  brain  areas  regulating social behavior, and inhibiting reproductive behavior.  In   contrast,  nonstressful  environmental  conditions  decrease  vasotocin  release  into  the bloodstream  while  increasing  its  production in brain circuits modulating social behavior,  leading  to  the  onset of reproduction and paternal behavior. Experiments  will  measure  the  distribution of vasotocin in  the  brain  and  observe  social behavior under different environmental conditions  to  test  the  hypothesis.  If this  hypothesis  is  correct,  it  suggests that it may be very difficult for the body to respond to  physiological  stress  without  inadvertently  affecting   social  behavior.",
