They will  collaborate on the use of semi-analytical methods to  solve scale-dependent contaminant transport  equations in heterogeneous aquifers.      The solution of the differential equations for  contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers is  made difficult by the many varied boundaries and  interfaces encountered under natural conditions.   Executing numerical solutions methods on a fine  time-space grid slows the computations to an extent  that can make the method prohibitive. The use of  semi-analytical methods offers an alternative to  arrive at stable solutions that may result in more  accurate forecasting models and a better  understanding of contaminant migration in aquifers.   The project will take advantage of this approach,  more common to European hydrologists, and the  expertise of Dr. Sahuquillo and his development of  semi-analytical methods in groundwater hydrology.  This proposal contributes to greater intellectual  interaction between the different approaches of the  European and American communities that may lead to  significant contributions to this important problem.  * * *",
