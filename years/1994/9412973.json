 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412973  Krimsky  This research project will examine scientific and ethical and  social factors in the evolution of and policy responses to a  controversial hypothesis linking environmental estrogenic chemicals  to a variety of animal and human disorders and pathologies.  The  Environmental Estrogen Hypothesis (EEH) postulates that a sizeable  class of chemicals including antioxidants, plasticizers,  detergents, and pesticides mimic the action of endogenous  biological estrogens, hormones that play a central role in sexual  maturation and reproduction, thereby making these chemicals suspect  in male sexual abnormalities and reduced fertility rates in humans  and wildlife, metabolic disorders in birds, fish and mammals, and  cancer in humans.  The research involves collection and analysis of  relevant scientific and popular literature and interviews of  scientists, regulators, policymakers, and representatives of non-  governmental organizations.  The investigators will study the  factors that determine whether the estrogen hypothesis emerges as  a major public policy issue, remains dormant in the public agenda,  or is dismissed for lack of evidentiary support.  The scope of the  study includes an analysis of how the environmental estrogen issues  are being framed, how the hypothesis is presented and communicated  to the public by scientists, the sources of controversy among  scientists, and the impact of the hypothesis on public policy.  The  value dimensions to be examined include:  moral and ethical  judgments by scientists and their articulation of social  responsibility with respect to the hypothesis; implicit values and  norms in the selections of scientific methodologies of those  advocating or criticizing the hypothesis; and the ethical and value  dimensions associated with the implications of the hypothesis for  sexuality, masculinity and femininity, and species extinction in  the social mind.  The results of this study will contribute to the  theoretical discussion on risk selection and  communication by  tracking and examining a potentially high-profile risk event.  They  will advance our knowledge of the roles of scientists in shaping  public policy and their conceptions of social responsibility.  They  will provide insights into conceptions of various social groups  about ethical and value implications of particular kinds of risks,  and about the normative factors involved in scientific  contributions to risk assessment.  The investigators will produce  articles reporting on these results, and make presentations at  relevant conferences and meetings.  ***",
