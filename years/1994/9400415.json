The  purpose of the Center is to develop enabling technologies in  these   areas  of  research  with  the  long-term  goal   of  facilitating  the  commercialization of new  products  using  these  technologies.   The MRSEC is  organized  through  two  interdisciplinary research groups.    The  semiconductor misfit heterostructures  group  addresses  problems  associated with the development  of  semiconductor  device technology using non-lattice-matched materials.   The  long  term  goal is to produce economically viable  enabling  technologies for fabricating photonic and electronic devices  using  unexplored  semiconductor  materials  grown  on  non-  lattice-matched  substrates  with  optical  and   electrical  properties matched to specific applications.  The  extrinsic  control  of  heterostructure  properties  group  focuses  on  important materials problems associated with light  emitting  and   detecting   devices  fabricated  from  high-band   gap  semiconductors  with composite semiconductor materials  used  for  electronic,  photonic  and optoelectronic  applications  (especially nonlinear applications).    The  MRSEC  supports programs for educational  outreach  and  human   resource   development  based  on  existing   Purdue  University efforts.  Special focus is on the enhancement  of  programs  for  minority  and  women  students.   The   MRSEC  supports shared experimental facilities for the preparation,  fabrication    and   characterization   of   heterostructure  materials  and  devices.  The center currently  supports  10  senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral research associates,  1  technical  staff  member,  8  graduate  students,   and   10  undergraduates.   The MRSEC is directed by  Professor  Jerry  Woodall.  ***",
