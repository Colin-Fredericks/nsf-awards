Recognizing the pivotal role of independent laboratory research in students' decisions to  make a commitment to research careers in the biological sciences, this opportunity will  be provided to students from colleges with limited research opportunities, and to  members of groups traditionally underrepresented in the fields of biochemistry and  molecular biology.  The program focuses on several overlapping areas of biochemistry  and molecular biology, principally protein structure and function, enzyme mechanisms,  and protein engineering; proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure; the structure,  function, and regulation of membrane proteins--receptors, ion channels and ion  transporters--and of their genes; and molecular developmental biology.  To maximize the  unique  opportunities offered at The University of Kansas, students will be involved in  several collaborative projects combining classical protein structure analysis, genetic  engineering and physical biochemical approaches.  Early hands-on experience with these  powerful techniques in a carefully controlled environment awakens students' excitement.   This experience will provide the students with an inside view of these areas of  biochemistry and molecular biology that may previously have seemed inaccessible to  them.  ***",
