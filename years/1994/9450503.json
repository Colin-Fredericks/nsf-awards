The students will be exposed to decision-making and  policy formulation in science and engineering fields; provide  agencies with high ability students who can make contributions to  existing programs; prepare students for future MSE leadership  positions; enhancing the students' awareness of MSE educational  policy issues impacting minorities; and reinforcing the  importance of community service.  NSF staff will gain valuable  insights from the student interns into the obstacles preventing  minority students from pursuing MSE careers and possible  strategies for significantly increasing the participation of  minority students in MSE fields.",
