 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grassi       Professor Grassi will study elliptic threefolds and Calabi-Yau  threefolds. In particular she will study fibrations in Calabi-Yau  threefolds with a view to showing their existence independent of  the minimal model chosen. She also intends to further study the  recently discovered phenomenon of mirror symmetry.       This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.  ***",
