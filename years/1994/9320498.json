 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320498  Finney        This project supports the dissertation research of a student  from the University of Hawaii, studying resource conservation by  a fishing community in the Solomon Islands.  The student is  testing the theory that traditional peoples are natural  conservators of their environmental resources.  By conducting  participant observation, time allocation analysis and economic  and household surveys, the student will test the hypothesis that  fishermen stop exploiting particular resource locations when the  yields decline to the average yield for the area (thus leaving a  given location or \"patch\" before it is degraded, and so  conserving it).       This project is important because it will advance our  understanding of indigenous knowledge in tropical marine  environments; it will evaluate the role of territoriality in  conserving aquatic resources; and it will contribute to our  understanding of human foraging strategies as they relate to  resource management and conservation.  This sort of knowledge  will be valuable to add to our repertoire of resource  conservation strategies in a world of threatened environments.  ***",
