 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406785  Mizuno    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in computer operating systems and system software.  The  investigators are Masaaki Mizuno, Gurdip Singh of Kansas State  University, Mitchell Neilsen, Oklahoma State University and  Michel Raynal of the University of Rennes and INRIA (French  National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics).  The objective of their research is to study the  definitions and implementations of distributed shared memory  systems by developing a general framework for classifying  protocols and for evaluating efficient implementations.  They  will develop protocols suited to different computer  architectures. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration  expertise in mathematical analysis, computer architectures, and  software implementation.  This is complemented by French  expertise in broad areas of distributed computing.  The project  also takes advantage of a large array of equipment at INRIA,  including a distributed parallel machine (a Hypercube with 32  processors), which will be used in the implementation studies.    Distributed shared memory systems are important because they  simplify programming. This project will further understanding of  these systems and its results could be applied to replication of  databases and distributed file systems in a high performance  computing environment.  ***",
