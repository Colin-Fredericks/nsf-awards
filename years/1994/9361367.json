 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361367 Oakes          An innovative technique for the polishing of polycrystalline diamond films is described which uses a high flux, high translational energy (5 to 10 volt) atomic oxygen beam at glancing incidence to etch surface roughness.  The method operates in a reactive etchant energy range, at high flux, that is not obtained by any other chemical or physical method.  As a result, the technique is capable of high polishing rates (0.2 micrometers/min) at low substrate temperatures.  In addition, it is non intrusive and is intrinsically scalable for large area (1000 cm2) polishing.  In a collaborative effort with industry, efficient, high rate diamond etching with a significant degree of surface finishing has been demonstrated.  Existing polishing techniques suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies:  slow polishing rate, small polishing areas, high substrate temperatures during polishing, the need to aggressively handle the diamond film or substrate, and the potential for defect and impurity incorporation into the diamond film resulting from interaction with energetic ions.  The proposed technique is capable of overcoming all of these deficiencies.          Due to diamonds superlative properties the potential commercial applications of diamond films are extensive.  In particular, polished polycrystalline films have optical and tribological applications.  Application of diamond as a heat sink will also benefit from this technique.",
