 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362108  Arlinghaus       We propose to demonstrate the potential applicability of the  sputter-initiated resonance ionization microprobe (SIRIMP)  technique for geological studies by measuring Pb isotope ratios and  U/Pb atomic ratios in geological samples relevant to geochronology.   SIRIMP is based on the concept of resonance ionization of sputtered  atoms and potentially offers several advantages over conventional  high-resolution ion microprobe instruments.  The most important of  these are the high selectivity, significant reduction of isobaric  interferences and matrix effects, and notable reduction in  instrument cost.  Preliminary research will be required in order   (a) assess interferences due to unsuppressed ions created in the  sputtering process (secondary ions) and those created by  nonresonant photoionization and evaluate methods for their  elimination, and (b) experimentally identify and evaluate resonant  ionization schemes for Pb and U.  Results from the proposed  research will provide the basis for the development of new state-  of-the-art analytical methods which would significantly advance  analytical capabilities in earth sciences and promote new areas of  research.  These benefits could extend to other areas such as the  semiconductor industry, the biomedical field, and environmental  sciences.",
