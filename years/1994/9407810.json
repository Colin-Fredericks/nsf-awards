The work centers on Pneumocystis, an exotic fungus  which was for many years thought to be a protozoan, and  which may represent a new order of fungi.  The organism  exists in morphologically distinct developmental forms,  cysts and trophic forms, and very little is known about its  life cycle.  The project will address a single fundamental  and important question: can genetic markers be identified  which are specific to the different forms of Pneumocystis?  The specific aims are to separate the cysts and trophic  forms of Pneumocystis from natural isolates, prepare mRNA  from the different forms, compare them by a PCR-based  technique called differential display to identify cDNAs that  appear to be differentially expressed in the different  forms, use standard analytical techniques to verify that the  mRNAs detected by differential display are present in  different amounts in the different forms, and determine the  sequences of these differential cDNAs.  In addition, in situ  hybridization will be used to define expression of the mRNAs  in the various forms of the organism.  %%%  Pneumocystis is an unusual fungal pathogen that is commonly  found in mammalian lungs and which causes pneumonia in  immuno-compromised mammalian hosts.  It is difficult to  study because to date it has not been cultured successfully  in vitro.  Taxonomically, it appears to be only distantly  related to other known fungi, and in fact for many years was  mistakenly believed to be a protozoan.  Because of the novel  taxonomic status of this organism, the significance of  studies of it extend well beyond merely learning more about  an important pathogen.  Molecular research on Pneumocystis  and organisms like it has only recently begun.  The proposed  work will be an important contribution to the evolutionary  and general biological understanding of fungi in general.  ***",
