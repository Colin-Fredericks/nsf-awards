Several parts of the  research correspond to the most interesting examples of such  varieties.  The first part is to study degrees, determinantal  expressions and singularities of generalized discriminants and  resultants.  Special attention will be paid to the classical  discriminants and resultants as well as the hyperdeterminants-  the discriminants of multidimensional matrices.  The second part  is concerned with singularities of conjugacy classes of nilpotent  elements in classical Lie algebras.  The main goal here is to  prove the principal investigator's conjecture on non-normal  orbits.  The third part is to sutdy the varieties of binary forms  with multiple roots.                This research is concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.",
