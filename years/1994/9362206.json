 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362206  Small    Fluorescence methods are used throughout a variety of fields including biotechnology,  microscopy, immunology, biology, chemistry, photochemistry and photophysics.  Many  fluorescence techniques employ changes in fluorescence intensity of chromophores in  response to their molecular environment.  Their goal is to correlate fluorescence  intensity (an arbitrary value) with fluorescence quantum yield (a fundamental  photophysical parameter, but one that is difficult to measure).    Our objective is to determine the feasibility of using a pulsed-laser photoacoustic method  combined with fluorescence detection to accurately determine fluorescence quantum  yields.  Such a determination should be possible with relatively inexpensive  instrumentation, and sufficient automation to make quantum yield determinations rapid  and easy to perform.    In our instrument a pulsed-laser beam excites a solution of molecules, a light detector  measures fluorescence, and a piezoelectric transducer is used to determine the amplitude  of a compressive sound wave resulting from heat deposited in the solution. Yields of  triplet states will be distinguished because such states are long lived. To support the  automation of this technique, methods are proposed for determining the average emitted  photon energy without resorting to a complete fluorescence spectral measurement.  ***",
