 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321940  Tigyi    This project continues to research a novel and yet not fully  identified class of lipid mediators with growth factor-like  properties generated during blood clotting.  These  phospholipid mediators display functions similar to those of  the more delicate and complicated growth factor proteins.  The simple structure of the phospholipid mediators permits  their easy chemical synthesis on an industrial scale, at a  cost hundreds of times less than that of protein growth  factors.  These naturally occurring molecules are generated  in response to injury, not only in the blood, but also in  the nervous system; and experiments indicate that they are  likely to play a physiological role in the initiation of  regeneration and wound healing.  The current project sets  two goals:  1) determine the structure of the phospholipid  mediators generated during blood clotting, and 2) establish  the main biochemical pathways leading to the production of  growth factor-like lipid mediators in activated cells.  It  is anticipated that learning more about these factors can  ultimately lead to the design and synthesis of new drugs to  prevent secondary neuronal death and the ensuing paralysis.    ***",
