 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  ATM-9405024  Ramanathan, V.  Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD  Title: Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate (C4)    NSF's Science and Technology Center for Clouds, Chemistry and  Climate (C4) was established to develop theoretical, observational  and modeling bases required to understand and predict Earth's  changing climate as affected by clouds, radiation and atmospheric  chemistry and their interactions, be these a result of natural  causes and/or human activities.  Although clouds are believed to  play a central role in regulating radiative heating of the planet  and in governing trace gase transport, they are poorly understood.  This uncertain role of clouds is a primary reason for our inability  to make accurate predictions of global warming.    The Center brings together research groups in the United States and  Germany that have made fundamental contributions in the areas of  the greenhouse effect, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and global  change.  The consortium of universities (UCSD, University of  Chicago, University of Maryland, Oregon State University) and  research laboratories (MPI, Mainz, Forschungszentrum Juelich, NCAR,  Boulder) that constitute C4 will conduct on joint airborne and  shipbased measurements, global model studies, and analyses of  satellite data in order to document and interpret processes related  to climate and climate change.    Through its research programs, and the exchange of data and  scientists, the Center will reach out to mission agencies and  national laboratories involved in global change research.  The  Center will help nurture a new generation of scientists capable of  addressing fundamental problems in global change.  The Center also  collaborates with SIO's Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum to establish  a multi-disciplinary teacher training program.    The Center is located on the SIO-UCSD campus with Professor V.  Ramanathan as Director.  Professor Paul Crutzen, Director of the  Max-Planck Institut fur Chemie, Mainz, coordinat es European  collaborative activities with the Center.  Dr. Diana Baxter,  Education Curator at the Aquarium-Museum oversees the K-12 global  change education program.  Mr. Hung Nguyen, Assistant Director,  coordinates outreach and education activities.",
