 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355721  Braile    This four year project serves ninety earth science teachers from  six midwestern states.  Each year thirty teachers will attend 4-  week intensive summer workshops, 2-weekend workshops during the  academic year, and a 1-day workshop at a national NSTA meeting.   The enhancement activities include:  improving their content  knowledge of current concepts and application of earth processes;  introducing skills through modern technology using computers;  taking an extended field trip in the midwest region; and practicing  presentations and other hands-on experiences.  The program takes  place in two parts with the summer teacher enhancement workshops  occurring during years 1, 2 and 3 while the academic year follow-up  occurs in years 2, 3 and 4.    The central content theme of Earth processes is complemented by  activities which will prepare teachers to disseminate their  understanding of earth processes through the use of materials,  activities, and modeling teaching skills at local inservice  workshops and regional and national presentations.  Participants  will be required to conduct at least one inservice workshop for  their peers.  This will be facilitated by providing them with  guided grant writing experiences.  Participants may earn six  semester hours of course credit:  3-semester hours in the  Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and 3-semester hours  in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, all at Purdue  University.",
