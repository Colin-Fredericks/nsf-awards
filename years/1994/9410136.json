 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, supported by a Career Advancement Award for   Women Scientists, high-level, ab initio, molecular electronic structure   calculations will be carried out for clusters consisting of one or more   metal atoms, particularly Hafnium, inside or outside a cage of 28 carbon   atoms.  The calculations will be carried out with relativistic core   potentials, spin-orbit operators, large orbital basis sets, and a   configuration interaction wavefunction.   The COLUMBUS code will be used   taking maximum advantage of the high point group symmetry of the   molecular system.  The results will be analyzed to predict trends in   ionization potentials, electron affinity, and electronic spectra, and to   study the factors that affect chemical bonding in these fullerene-like   cluster compounds.    The recent discovery of Buckminsterfullerene, a remarkably stable   molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms forming a symmetric cage   resembling a soccer ball, has motivated experiments to find other   molecules with similar chemical bonding.  One of the smallest such carbon   cluster molecules, observed in plasmas, consists of 28 carbon atoms   bonded together, as in Buckminsterfullerene, in fused rings of five and   six atoms around a heavy metal atom.   A few of these 28 carbon atom   complexes are selected for theoretical study using highly accurate   quantum mechanical theory to predict physical properties which will aid   the interpretation of experiments and provide a deeper understanding of   the chemical principles which govern the stabilities of such complexes",
