 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser eye surgery is the most effective known procedure for  treating choroidal neovascularization (CNV) found in a variety of  conditions including age-related macular degeneration, histoplasmic  choroiditis, etc.  However, the current rate of success of this  procedure is less than 50% for eradication of the CNV following one  treatment session, with a recurrence and/or persistence rate of  about 50%.  This research will make possible an instrument that  will drastically reduce this failure rate.    The instrument consists of a computerized multi-spectral 3-D fundus  camera with an associated head-up display and a real-time laser  tracking system.  The tracking system uses a set of automatic image  analysis routines that allow accurate mapping of the pathologies,  and computerized laser treatment planning.    The core image-processing problems that are being addressed are:  (i) constructing a wide-area map of the retinal vasculature from an  image sequence; and (ii) determining the location of the current  frame relative to the wide-area map constructed in step (i) to an  accuracy of 2 pixels, or better, at a frame rate of at least 30 per  second.  The above problems are being solved by the development of  a fast algorithm for matching point sets with unknown  correspondences, in the presence of a small number of noise points.   This algorithm operates by limiting the search to a minimally-  sufficient subset of the most reliable image feature points.  In  addition, the proposed algorithm is being implemented on a linear  array of processors, further enabling real-time operation.",
