 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360808  Buchan    Due to its unique properties and its ability t be processed analogously to silicon, silicon carbide (SiC) will be an important high temperature, high power and high frequency electronic material. The barrier to this developing technology was the availability of 6H0SiC substrates.  However, these substrates are now produced in ever-increasing quantities, and the new barrier is the quality of these substrates.  In Phase I, the defects in grown SiC will be characterized.  Synchrotron White Beam X-ray topography (SWBXT), an innovative and non-destructive technique in which local differences in diffracting power gives rise to image contrast, is uniquely suited for defect characterization in SiC.  The comprehensive and non-destructive nature of this technique makes it an optimal tool for research as well as for quality control in a production environment.  In Phase II, we will extend use of this technique from characterization of the grown bulk SiC to that of the wafer fabrication process, which will allow for the production of high quality SiC wafers in Phase III.  ***",
