 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402989  MOUDGIL         The two-fold mission of the Engineering Research Center for  Particle Science and Technology is to:  (1) develop cost effective  processing and handling of particulate systems relevant to a wide  range of industries, such as chemicals and allied products,  textiles and paper products, coal, metals and minerals, energy and  environmental, construction, land and coastal management,  agricultural and food processing, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals,  advanced materials, etc., and (2) to educate students and other  professionals in the engineering practice of particle science and  technology.  A cross-disciplinary integrated research program will  focus on:  (1) dispersion, consolidation and redispersion, (2)  transport and handling, (3) particles in effluents, and (4)  analysis and characterization.  Research on simulation, modeling  and visualization will provide the integrating base for the  Center's research activities.  A testbed facility will be built for  validation, demonstration and development of process and product  ideas generated by the Center.  The educational program will  include development of curriculum in particle science and  technology, new courses and a minor in particle science and  technology.  Faculty and industrial experts will jointly develop  computer assisted learning modules, multimedia presentations and  textbooks.  A particle science and technology certificate program  for industrial personnel will be implemented.  The Center will  initiate a vigorous outreach program to disseminate information to  other academic and industrial institutions.       A consortium of 30 large and medium, and 18 small companies  will actively participate in the Center's research and educational  programs, and four national laboratories will have joint research  projects with the Center.  Twenty-eight faculty members, 3  postdoctorals, 45 graduate and 25 undergraduate students from 12  departments will participate during the first year.  The University  of South Flori da and Columbia University will participate in the  Center as subcontractors.       This award established the ERC under an initial 5-year  Cooperative Agreement.  ***",
