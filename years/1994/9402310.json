 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is to study the mesoscale transport and  energization of ionospheric plasmas on auroral flux tubes primarily  with the Generalized SemiKinetic (GSK) techniques developed in  recent years at UAH.  This hybrid ion-incell/generalized electron  fluid approach has demonstrated unique capabilities for treating,  over mesoscale (several RE), the transport of ionospheric plasma  under the influence of such effects as instability-driven  microprocesses and the combination of magnetospheric plasma-  supported potentials and wave heating.  This approach incorporates  the self-consistency of processes normally found in \"fluid\" models  while allowing the detailed study of ion distribution formation  normally restricted to test-particle studies.  Using the newly-  developed techniques together with previously developed methods the  areas of investigation will include:  the reaction of an auroral  flux tube and plasma transport to auroral electron beams; energetic  plasma sheet plasmas and electric currents with self-consistent  ionization; time-dependent wave-driven conic generation; and  synergistic effects of hot plasma-driven potentials and wave  fields, including the development of the potentials themselves.   New technical advances in this research will include:  (1)  Incorporation of auroral electron beams into the electrodynamics of  the transport description; (2) Development of techniques for  coupling the GSK approach into the lower F and E-region ionosphere,  with specific allowance for self-consistent ionization and outflow  generated by these electron beams; (3) Improved approaches for  treating the general electrodynamic interaction of hot  magnetospheric plasmas with the ionospheric outflow; and (4)  Development of improved algorithms for the incorporation of effects  of the Current-Driven Ion Cyclotron Instability (CDICI) into  kinetic and generalized transport models.  Finally, interactive  comparisons of the results with auroral ion distribution function  measurements from D E-1, Polar, Viking, Akebono, Freja and other  spacecraft are proposed.",
