 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402246  Duda      This is the first year award of a three-year project to  investigate the creation and evaluation of a process model of how  humans locate sounds in three dimensions.  Emphasis is placed in  understanding well- established but yet incompletely understood  psycho-acoustical phenomena.  An example of such phenomena is the  human perception capability of determining whether sounds come from  above or below without binaural differentiation of the sounds  reaching the ears; another example is the ability to locate sounds  in reverberant environments with multiple sound sources where  echoes and reflections become virtual sound sources.  Another one  yet is the ability to judge distance to a sound source since  loudness alone is not an adequate cue.   This model is based not  only on physical sound propagation effects but also on  neurophysiological studies tracing the auditory pathways from the  cochlea to the auditory cortex. The model extends current  computational cochlea models by incorporating mono- and binaural,  temporally-based, correlation methods for source-locality  information extraction.  The ability to understand these mechanisms  allows the recognition of sounds and speech by computers in  everyday environments, thereby improving the effectiveness of  speech recognition in human-computer interaction.",
