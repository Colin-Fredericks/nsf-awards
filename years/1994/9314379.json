Pacheco, a Brazilian  graduate student working on his doctoral dissertation.   The  study is being developed in  the reserves of the Biological  Dynamics of Forest  Fragments (BDFF)  project, an  association between the Smithsonian Institution of the  U.S.A. and  the Brazilian National Institute for Amazon  Research (INPA).  In order to complete his work, Mr. Pacheco  will spend 400 days in the Amazon forest.  The grant also  provides for travel expenses to Brazil for H. Howe, Mr.  Pacheco's adviser, who will visit him once, to advise him  and to supervise his research.    Mr. Pacheco will perform research to evaluate the influence  of several classes of factors on the distribution and  abundance of two tropical palm tree species in the Amazon  forest.  One of the species grows preferentially on flood  plains, while the other one's preferential habitat are  plateaus.  By studying these closely related species, the  research will attempt to distinguish between the effects of  abiotic (water, light, etc.) and biotic (predation,  infections, etc.) factors on the spatial distribution of the  two species.  Understanding of these effects will help in  predicting the response of tropical tree species to changes  in the regional or global climate, and to human related  activities.  It will also contribute to the understanding of  the kind of tropical biology required in conservation and  restoration efforts.    ***",
