 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315323  Mourou    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in physics between the University of Michigan's Science and  Technology Center for Ultrafast Optical Science directed by  Gerard A. Mourou and the Laboratory for the Application of  Intense Lasers, Ecole Polytechnique, led by Denis Pesme. The  award principally supports an exchange of advanced graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers.  The objective of their  research is to test some of the fundamental concepts of the so-  called wakefield acceleration.  Specifically, they propose to  develop laser amplifiers with the aim of producing ultrashort and  high-energy pulses, and to investigate laser-plasma interactions  in the relativistic regime.    The U.S. investigators are world leaders in the field of  ultrashort, high-energy pulses.  Most techniques developed by  this group are used worldwide. This is complemented by the French  group's vast experience in the general field of laser-plasma  interactions; for example, in the ionization of gas by  multiphoton absorption and in laser-plasma interaction at the  nanosecond regime.  The project will advance understanding of  outstanding problems in condensed matter physics (e.g., high  temperature superconductors) through the application of new  technology in ultrashort optical pulse generation.  ***",
