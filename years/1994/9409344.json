Dynamic implies the planning and scheduling are done in rolling   horizon.  The production capacity at each stage in a given time   period may be augmented in a given time period with overtime or   additional shift.  The distribution system may be a single finished   goods warehouse or a two level system with a central warehouse and   multiple, nonidentical retailers.  General distributions that   account for seasonality and are non-stationary are used.  The   research seeks to develop benchmarks for evaluating the performance   of the developed algorithms both in the quality of the solutions   and the time to compute a solution.       The models and algorithms developed in this research will   offer a methodology to integrate and centralize the planning and   scheduling of production and distribution systems.  The resulting   tools will also provide a means to assess the value of such a   planning system.  Furthermore, the developed planning and   scheduling methodology can supplement just-in-time (JIT) control by   leveling out variation in load and mix.",
