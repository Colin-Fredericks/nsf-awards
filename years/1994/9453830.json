These participants  include 20 high school physics teachers and 20 physics faculty from  2- and 4-year undergraduate institutions.  The goal of the  conference is to build bridges for cooperation among physics  educators in the Americas and Caribbean and extend networks which  were established through previous Inter-American Conferences on  Physics Education. The particular emphasis of this conference will  better prepare teachers from the United States to teach students of  the \"emerging majorities\". The conference design includes  simultaneous translators at the conference and translation of the  conference's papers from the original language. The papers will be  grouped by grade level and published in booklet form for use by  elementary, high school and university teachers. The conference  will be held at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas on  July 17-22, 1994.",
