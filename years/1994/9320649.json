These debates have  been long on rhetoric and short on systematic empirical studies.   In this dissertation, the investigator will develop and  empirically test a model that allows inferences into the  following questions about school choice: (1) Which children  receive a higher quality education, and which receive a lower  quality education under various voucher schemes? (2) Does there  exist a voucher scheme, or class of voucher schemes, which  results in all children receiving a higher quality education than  they current receive? (3) What role do inter-neighborhood housing  price variations and transportation costs play in constraining  households moving their children from their current schools to  higher quality schools? (4) Which types of schools will  experience an increase in demand and which types a decrease as a  result of the voucher scheme?    This grant will permit the investigator to collect data from a  random sample of 600 households living in a metropolitan area and  having at least one child in elementary school.  Data to be  collected under this project do not currently exist in one data  set or in a form which allows the investigator to use data from  various sources.  The survey data will permit the investigator to  conduct realistic simulations about the impacts of different  school choice schemes.",
