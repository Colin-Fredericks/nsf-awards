The CIM curriculum provides students with the  education and skills to respond to the present and future needs of  business and industry. The addition of a Rapid Prototyping System  to the CIM program is critical to the continued success of its  graduates.  Therefore, Camden County College is proposing the  acquisition of a Rapid Prototyping System which will enable  students to fully integrate Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Computer  Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC)  machining in an environment which mirrors current rapid prototyping  systems. Systems such as this minimize the \"art to part\" time  required in developing a new project. This project addresses an  industry need for well educated technicians in the manufacturing  technology field.",
