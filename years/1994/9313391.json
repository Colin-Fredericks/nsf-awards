 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the renovation of the specimen preparation and optical  analysis laboratory facilities at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology.   The renovation project is part of a large program to renovate and modernize Materials  Science and Engineering research and educational facilities on campus.  Constructed in 1968,  the facilities are used for research projects in the first stages of microstructural and  microchemical analysis. Research and training activities, conducted in these facilities, are  fundamental to Materials Science and Engineering.  The specimen preparation laboratories  are a resource for other department and for users outside the Institute, enabling technology  for interdisciplinary activities.  The entire renovation project will establish at the Institute an  integrated microscopy laboratory complex combining optical and electron microscopy  facilities, and all related sample preparation and image processing activities.    The renovation will address the following conditions:  ineffective space utilization, health and  safety violations or potential hazardous, and quality limitations which impact equipment or  reduce performance.  Existing interior walls and infrastructure, utilities, and fixed equipment  will be replaced and reconfigurated to provide efficient laboratory space.  New fume hood  will be installed, improving the chemical handling and storage capabilities necessary to meet  OSHA requirements.  The success of this project will allow the institution to meet research  and educational goals and attract researchers and students by creating an environment where  they can work and learn effectively.",
