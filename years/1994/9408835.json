These  phenomena include non-Fermi-liquid low temperature  characteristics associated with unconventional Kondo effects  in doped f-electron systems, superconductivity and magnetism  in heavy fermion compounds and the formation of small energy  gaps due to hybridization between localized f- and  conduction-electron states in hybridization gap  semiconductors (also called Kondo insulators).  Rare-earth  and uranium intermetallic compounds and alloys, in both  polycrystalline and single crystal form, will be prepared  and characterized.  Transport, thermal, and magnetic  measurements will be made over a wide range of temperatures.  The research involves collaboration with a number of other  universitities and national laboratories, including the  National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  %%%  This project involves the study of a group of metallic  superconductors called heavy Fermion superconductors.  These materials differ in some of their properties from  normal superconductors and the high-temperature copper oxide  superconductors.  The reasons for these differences are not  understood,  so investigations of the heavy Fermion systems  may shed light on the perplexing problem of the high-Tc  materials.  New heavy Fermion materials will be prepared and  characterized by a range of techniques.  While these studies  are of fundamental scientific interest, they are also of  importance in the development of useful materials for  industrial applications.  The research involves  collaboration with a number of other universities and  national laboratories, including the National High Magnetic  Field Laboratory.  The research will contribute to the  training of postdoctoral research scientists and graduate  students at UCSD and at the collaborating institutions.  ***",
