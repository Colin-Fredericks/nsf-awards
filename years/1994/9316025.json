 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316025  Newman  The effect of the state of G-actin on its interactions,  polymerization kinetics and polymer structure will be investigated  by a combination of dynamic light scatting, rheology, and  fluorescence microscopy techniques.  Dynamic light scattering and  rheology experiments will be performed to determine the effects of  the solvent (divalent cation, nucleotide, and temperature) and the  presence of certain actin binding moieties (including the two light  chain isoforms of myosin S-1, profilin, and cytochalasin D) on the  kinetics and state of actin self-association.  Further measurements  in the presence of various high concentrations of an inert low  molecular weight polymer (polyethylene glycol, PEG) will study the  effects of crowding on the kinetics, bundling, and steady-state  sizes and dynamic properties of actin filaments.  The self-  association of actin under crowded conditions, using high  concentrations of sucrose or PEG, within artificially-prepared  vesicles and within certain epithelial cell types will also be  studied using fluorescence imaging microscopy techniques.  These  studies will provide detailed information on the self-interactions  of G-actin and the dynamic properties of the oligomers, filaments,  and actin bundles, both in vitro and in vivo, as functions of the  solvent and actin-specific binding molecules using a variety of  experimental techniques.  %%%  Three different physical techniques will be used to study the  structure and interactions of the protein actin, one of the most  common proteins found in nature.  Actin's role in determining the  structure and mechanical properties of cells is incompletely known.   It is clear, however, that actin plays a unique role in generating  forces within a cell in order to change the cell's shape or to  allow the cell to move actively, as many cells can.  A variety of  other proteins have been discovered which interact specifically  with actin and either regulate or modify the association of many  actins togethe r to form long filaments which are capable to  sustaining a force.  The proposed research will, in part, attempt  to elucidate the role of several of the more prominent such  proteins by studying their effects on actin in a test tube, in an  \"artificial\" cell constructed from lipid vesicles with actin  incorporated inside, and in a living cell.  Methods used will  include dynamic laser light scattering, viscoelasticity  measurements, and fluorescence microscopy techniques.  Two main areas of experiments are planned.  The first will probe  the effects of specific proteins, salts, or drugs on the self-  association of actins.  Such experiments will help us to understand  the details of filament formation in cells leading to eventual  force generation, and some of the control mechanisms involved.  The  second area will study the effects of crowded conditions, such as  are found within cells, on the actual self-association rates and  final states.  Most solution experiments are carried out with  purified proteins in the presence of only other small molecules.   Recently it has been demonstrated that in the presence of other  large macromolecules, not only the rates of self-interaction, but  also the final aggregation state can be greatly influenced.   Crowding will be produced by the addition of inert macromolecules,  which do not directly interact with actin, in order to simulate the  actual conditions within cells.  These experiments will be carried  out both in solutions and in artificial cells, and will be compared  to experiments performed in living cells using fluorescence  methods.  In this way we will attempt to study the interactions of  well-characterized proteins in much simpler environments that those  of cells, but be able to draw meaningful conclusions about the role  of these interactions in living cells.",
