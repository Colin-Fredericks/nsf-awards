 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405200  Eide  In yeast, extracellular Fe(III) is first reduced to Fe(II) by a plasma membrane Fe(III) reductase. The  Fe(II) product is then transported into the cell by Fe(II)-specific transport systems. This strategy of  iron uptake is common in nature, having been found in other fungi, plants, and even animal cells.  Yet, despite this ubiquity, an Fe(II) transporter gene has yet to be isolated from any organism. We  have recently isolated a gene, FET4, that is required for Fe(II) uptake. Our preliminary studies  indicate that this gene encodes an Fe(II) transporter. The analysis of the FET4 gene will add much to  our understanding of the molecular mechanism of iron uptake in yeast. Furthermore, our analysis of  FET4 will provide the reagents (e.g. yeast mutants, DNA probes, antibodies, etc.) necessary to begin  a molecular analysis of Fe(II) uptake in other eukaryotes.  Experiments described in this proposal are designed to assess the role of the FET4 gene product,  Fet4p, as an Fe(II) transporter. Antibodies will be prepared against Fet4p which will then be used to  determine the subcellular location of the protein. The identity of Fet4p as an Fe(II) transporter will be  confirmed by biochemical analysis of iron uptake in Xenopus oocytes or baculovirus-infected S.  frugiperda (Sf9) cells that express Fet4p. Preliminary studies suggest that Fet4p may also transport  other essential divalent cations such as Co(II). We will determine if Fet4p is involved in the uptake of  any transition metals in addition to Fe(II). To gain a more complete picture of the mechanism of iron  uptake, we will extend our genetic analysis to isolate and characterize other yeast genes required for  the process. Finally, we will isolate Fe(II) transporter genes from other organisms, specifically  Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, and humans, by complementation cloning. These  genes will provide the necessary material for a comparative analysis of Fe(II) transporter structure as  well as the reagents nee ded to begin a molecular analysis of iron uptake in these organisms.  %%%  Iron plays an essential role in cellular biochemistry. Although this metal is abundant in the  environment, the oxidized form of iron, Fe(III), is extremely insoluble. Therefore, organisms possess  efficient iron uptake systems. The long-range goal of the proposed research is to understand the  molecular mechanism of iron uptake in eukaryotic cells. We are pursuing this goal through a  combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular analysis of iron uptake in the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. This organism has proven to be a useful model system for the study of many cellular  processes and its utility in studying iron uptake is becoming increasingly clear. We have identified a  new yeast gene, FET4, that may encode an iron transport protein. Experiments are proposed to test  this hypothesis. Also, using yeast strains defective for iron uptake and a method known as  complementation cloning, we will identify and characterize iron transporter genes from other fungi as  well as plant and mammalian species. These genes will provide the necessary material for a  comparative analysis of iron transporter structure as well as the reagents needed to begin a molecular  analysis of iron uptake in these organisms.  ***",
