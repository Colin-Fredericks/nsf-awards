 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318090  Ward  The Arizona Research Laboratories Biotechnology Computing  Facility at the University of Arizona will purchase a Digital  Equipment Corporation Dec3000/500 (ALPHA) computer and associated  peripherals.  The computer will be dedicated to biotechnology  research projects, primarily DNA and protein sequence analysis at  the University of Arizona.  In order to provide maximum  connectivity to, and use of, the machine, we will also purchase  two Digital Equipment Corporation 90TL terminal servers, and  eight high speed U. S. robotics modems.    The Biotechnology Computing Facility is an multidisciplinary  facility that supports more than 300 biotechnology computer users  representing over 30 departments from 4 colleges.  The specific  research that would benefit from the increased computer speed  are: 1) analysis of genes involved in cellular morphogenesis and  differentiation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elgans; 2) the  identification and analysis of proteins of the actin  cytoskeleton; 3) identification and analysis of insect proteins  involved in metabolite transport and uptake and endocrinology; 4)  insect protein, lipid, and structure/function studies; 5) the  genetic study of the olfactory system of Xenopus laevis; and 6)  software development of fast sequencing algorithms.    The computer that currently supports most of the DNA and Protein  sequencing at the University of Arizona is a Vax 3100/76.  The  Dec3000/500 has much faster computing speeds than the present  3100VAX system.  The increase in computational speed from the  3100/76 6.6 SPECmarks to VAX 3100/76 118 SPECmarks will increase  the efficiency and open more computing options, both for the  research projects described and for students in laboratories and  classes.  Some of these options are not practical at the speeds  of our present computer.  ***",
