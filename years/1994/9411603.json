Changes in the attributes  (eg.,moods, attitudes, habits) of spatially distributed  individuals resulting from the interactive, reciprocal, and  recursive operation of social influence processes can be modeled  by social impact theory, a simple but very general theory of  social influence. Surprisingly, several macro-level phenomena can  be predicted to emerge from the operation of these micro-level  processes, including dynamic equilibria with stable diversity, an  incomplete polarization of positions resulting in coherent  clusters of minority members protecting each other from exposure  to majority influence, and a tendency for people's positions on  different issues to become correlated. As in other complex  systems, these tendencies toward self-organization are  accentuated by the introduction of randomness. Empirical research  will determine whether laboratory and real groups show the  predicted signs of self-organization.  Field studies in a   factory town in China will produce information about the nature  of social space and the spatial patterning of work- and  housing-related attitudes. Longitudinal studies of individuals  interacting via e-mail will document the existence of  polarization, clustering, and correlation and determine the  effects of varying the geometry of social space on the  maintenance of diversity.       This research will contribute to understanding the complex  interaction between individual psychological processes and social  outcomes in groups ranging in size from families and other small   groups to organizations, communities, and even nations. Concepts  and procedures developed in this research should be applicable to  understanding the historical development of regional differe nces  in customs, values and beliefs, social determinants of moods,  norms, life styles, and behaviors, both constructive and  maladaptive, and such elusive phenomena as social movements,  national mood, and public opinion. This approach aligns social  psychology with the interdisciplinary study of complex  self-organizing systems, and will contribute to and draw on  related work in physics, economics, and biology. Finally, the  empirical research will contribute to predicting the consequences  of the increasing use of electronic communication in work groups  and society.  ***",
