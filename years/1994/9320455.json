University of Colorado  Title:    Rule-Based System for Prediction and Detection of            Northern Hemisphere Climate Change    Information regarding the climate system is often imprecise,  incomplete, vague, or uncertain.  A significant part of this  information exists as empirical facts and rules, expressed in  qualitative form.  The objective of this study is to develop a  system that can manipulate qualitative information is such a way as  to provide understanding about observed climate changes.    The appropriate method to reach this objective is based on concepts  and techniques of expert systems and artificial intelligence.  The  information about parameters of the climate system will be  presented both in quantitative and qualitative forms.   Relationships between climatic variables will be expressed as  production rules written in IF-THEN format.  Each rule will contain  a certainty factor that represents a numerical measure of the  confidence one has in the validity of a rule.  Two methods will be  used to combine certainty factors.  The first method is based on  the Dempster-Sharper theory, and the second one on the Bayesian  scheme.    The system will be able to evaluate the future state of various  climatic variables (such as temperature, precipitation, atmospheric  pressure, etc.)  and of macroclimatic features (such as centers of  action, jet streams, upper atmospheric troughs and ridges, etc.).   It will also explain why the conclusion was reached and how certain  it is.  This system may also be considered as a decision support  system valuable for recording ideas and retrieving necessary  information that will facilitate discussions about observed and  anticipated climate changes.  During the first year, the prototype  will be developed which will focus on the Northern Atlantic.   During the second year the system will be expanded to the entire  Northern Hemisphere.  The system will be useful both for  climatolog ists and decisionmakers.  It will find different  applications in fisheries, agriculture, navigation, recreation and  other climate-related industries.",
