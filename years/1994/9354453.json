The goal of the work is to  focus on visual presentations, and real-time visual manipulations,  of a variety of concepts that are included in the current chemistry  curriculum. Specific projects include 3-dimensional animation  sequences of atomic and molecular orbitals, 3-D views of polymer  structure and stereochemistry, videos that introduce basic  stereochemical concepts in organic chemistry, and animated  sequences of crystal structures and Miller index planes. Additional  projects include other basic organic transformations, periodic  trends, and hybridization. The specific goals of this project are  to develop materials that can be used in courses throughout the  U.S. and can be readily distributed on computer disks, laser disks,  and video tapes, so that the efforts of this project can have a  broad impact on the national undergraduate and high school  chemistry curriculum.  ***y",
