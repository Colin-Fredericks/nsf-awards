 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418361  Fourkas  This starter grant award to Boston College will support the  research of Professor John Fourkas. The research will focus on  ultrafast dynamics of stretched liquids. Negative presure  techniques will be used to control the relative importance of  intermolecular attractive forces.  Ultrafast nonlinear-optical  spectroscopic techniques will be used as a sensitive, real-time  probe of the microscopic dynamics that are affected by  tension-induced changes in the intermolecular potential.  Optical Kerr effect experiments will monitor the effects of  stretching on intermolecular vibrational and intramolecular  reorientational dynamics, both of which are strongly affected  by attractive forces.  Initial experiments will involve  studying anomalous behavior of water, and techniques will be  developed to study arbitrary liquids at substantial negative  pressures.    A detailed knowledge of the roles of attractive and repulsive  intermolecular interactions is essential in developing an  understanding of the microscopic details of chemical processes  in solution with the ultimate goal of being able to observe and  control directly the course of chemical reactions in solution  through changes in the nature of the liquid itself.",
