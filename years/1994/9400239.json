 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400239  Fish    Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Ms. Karen Harry will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will employ both  neutron activation analysis and petrographic techniques to  analyze potsherds collected at two Hohokam archaeological sites  located in Arizona. She will use field surveys to locate clay  sources and determine the trace element compositions of these as  well. On this basis it will be possible to relate ceramic product  back to raw material source. It will also be possible to examine  the distribution of ceramic types within each of the two sites  and between them.  Ms. Harry can then use these data to  reconstruct intra and intersettlement production, distribution  and consumption patterns and thus gain insight into economic and  social organization.     The Marana and Los Robles settlement communities which form the  basis for this study were occupied by Hohokam peoples during the  early Classic period and date to between A.D. 1050-1300. The  Hohokam are well known archaeologically for the large irrigation  systems they constructed which permitted agriculture in low  rainfall areas of the Arizona desert. They also occupied large  sites with impressive platform mounds. These attest to the  aggregation of large numbers of people and some form of  centralized hierarchical control. Archaeologists wish to  understand how such centralized societies develop and postulate  that control and organization of trade may play a central role.  Ms. Harry will examine this question. Because ceramics played a  vital role in both subsistence and ritual, they provide an  excellent insight into the social and economic lives of these  communities.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  information of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new  light on U.S. prehistory and assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
