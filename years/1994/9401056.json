 "awd_abstract_narration": "It  is  proposed  to  develop  a  numerical  model  of  the  low-  latitude  boundary  layer  (LLBL),  located  in  the  equatorial   region  of  the  Earth's  magnetoshpere  adjacent  to  its  outer  boundary,  the  magnetopause,  and  the  coupling  of  that  layer   to  the  dayside  auroral  ionosphere  via  field-aligned   currents.    The  model  is  intended  as  a  building  block  in   the  construction  of  a  global  geospace  circulation  model   (GGCM)  with  predictive  capability.    Two  versions  of  the   LLBL  model  will  be  developed.    First,  a  relatively   sophisticated  self-consistent  model  of  steady  plasma  flow,   magnetic  fields  and  currents  will  be  completed  and  its   parameters  constrained  by  comparison  with  observations.    In   this  model,  partial  differential  equations  are  solved   numerically  in  the  boundary  layer  approximation.    On  the   basis  of  results  and  experience  gained  from  this  model  a   simpler  version,  based  on  ordinary  differential  equations,   will  be  developed  for  use  in  parallel  with,  and  coupled   to,  existing  models,  or  models  under  development  as  part   of  the  GEM  program,  of  internal  magnetospheric  convection   on  one  side  of  the  layer  and  external  solar-wind  plasma   flow  on  its  other  side.    This  simpler  version  of  the   boundary-layer  model  will  have  as  its  basic  theoretical   elements:  (i)  the  equation  of  momentum  conservation  in  the   flow  direction  integrated  over  the  thickness  of  the   boundary  layer  and  (ii)  polynomial  (or  other  parametric)   representations  of  variations  across  the  boundary  layer,   with  free  parameters  that  will  allow  the  model  to   accommodate,  perhaps  iteratively,  boundary  conditions  provided   by  an  internal  circulation  model  and  an  external  flow   model.    The  simpler  model  which  is  expected  to  be   numerically  fast  will  be  benchmarked  by  comparison  w ith  the   self-consistent  boundary  layer  code  (which  is  computationally   too  slow  to  be  used  in  a  GGCM),  as  well  as  with   observed  ionospheric  and  equatorial  signatures  of  the  layer.",
