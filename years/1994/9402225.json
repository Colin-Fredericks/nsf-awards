The objectives of SCOPE are: (1) to advance knowledge of (a) the  influence of humans on their environment and (b) the effects of  environmental changes upon people, their health, and their welfare,  particularly those influences and effects that are either global or are  shared by several nations; and (2) to serve as a council of scientists  acting as a source of advice to governments and intergovernmental  bodies on issues concerning the environment.  By means of this  award, U.S. scientists who comprise the U.S. National Committee  for SCOPE, and supporting staff at the NAS, will continue their  involvement in international projects coordinated by SCOPE on  sustainable development, biodiversity, and the effects of increased  ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.  ***",
