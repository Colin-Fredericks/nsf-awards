 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405757     Mertes    The research will test working hypotheses on relationships among  the geomorphology of an alluvial of floodplain/wetland, geomorphic  processes active on the inundated floodplain surface, and the  hysteresis between water discharge and sediment concentration  during floods.  Data for the Central Amazon River  show that the  conceptual model adequately describes   the characteristic patterns  of water  and sediment transport and the related patterns of  erosion and disposition during flood on the largest river in the  world.  The proposed work is to test the conceptual model at a  smaller spatial scale by collecting hydrologic, hydraulic, and  sediment transport data for the Altamaha River, Georgia.  The work  is a step in a larger study to develop a physically based model of  the construction of landforms on inundated floodplains for rivers  across all scales.  It is anticipated that the results from the  Altamaha River, with a drainage basin area of 35,200 Km2 will  significantly advance understanding of the hydrologic and  geomorphic processes controlling the development and maintenance of  its floodplain and wetland.      Limited water discharge sediment concentration data for the  Altamaha River indicate that it is similar to the Amazon River, in  that the peak sediment concentration precedes the peak water  discharge.  One hypothesis to be tested is that the rates of  deposition on a non-channelized floodplain surface are a monotonic  function of the rate of water and sediment discharge supplied from  the main channel.  The  second hypothesis is that the rate of  deposition increases at the crest of the flood as the pressure  distribution across the channel-floodplain boundary equalizes.  The  third is that the rates and loci of deposition and erosion in  drainage channels shift from the upstream end during initial stages  of inundated to the downstream end during the falling -water  period.    Data from field studies, remote sensing, and numerical simulations  of hydr odynamics will be used numerical simulations of the  hydrodynamics of the field sites for floods with different  magnitudes and durations the hypotheses.  The data from each source   will constrain the interpretation of the results from the other  techniques.",
