VINE Follow-Through:  (1) Works with Leadership Teams in three  cities to design and test a set of strategies for developing  collaborative teams and leading professional development  initiatives.  The strategies are designed to enable teachers to  follow up on VINE investigations in a manner that will enable  students to do more science and construct meaning from their  experience.  (2) Documents those strategies and produces  professional development materials which can be used to apply this  model in additional settings.  (3) Evaluates this model for  building on informal science education experiences and promoting  science education reform, and assesses its potential for use in  conjunction with informal science education experiences offered  through science museums and other community-based institutions.    Each city's team includes five experienced teachers, a district  curriculum coordinator, a university science educator, an action  research expert, and a VINE project coordinator.  ***",
