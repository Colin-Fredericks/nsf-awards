 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354038  Cox  The primary goal of this proposal is to redesign the curriculum  for preparing teachers of K-12 mathematics and science.  It is  based on a philosophy that emphasizes the integration of  mathematics, science and teacher preparation using inquiry-  based, experiential learning by setting up design teams, which  will be linked electronically.  This is to be accomplished  through experiential and service learning (especially through  environmental service learning projects).  The project features  a summer institute in which prospective teachers, practicing  teachers, and science, math and education faculty will  participate.  The purpose of this institute for 40 students and  teachers, is to prepare the participants to develop integrated  mathematics-science service-learning approaches that will be  implemented in the fall of 1994.  Mentoring teams, consisting  of a scientist, mathematician, a teacher educator, a practicing  teacher and a pre-service teacher, will be formed during the  institute and will continue their discourse during the fall via  an electronic mail network.  Information will be shared among  the participants and with teams at the Partner Schools of  National Network for Educational Renewal (NNER) in Utah, South  Carolina and Texas.  An external evaluation of the pilot  project will be conducted to assess the summer institute and  the fall semester's activities.",
