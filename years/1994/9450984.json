This  approach involves cooperative planning among the faculty in  chemistry to ensure a sequentially significant laboratory  experience with extensive student use of instrumentation and  computers as the essential molecular probes.  The instrument, along  with our FT-IR, and GC-MS, and computers for molecular modeling are  the foundation of this project. Hands-on data acquisition and  interpretation experiments in NMR will be developed for all the  laboratory courses beginning with general chemistry. In upper level  courses and undergraduate research, students will be exposed to the  utility of FT-NMR as a tool for probing molecular structure and  dynamics. This contemporary approach to laboratory design and  teaching, beginning at an early point in the curriculum, is  expected to attract, inform and educate the following audience:  prospective students; enrolled students in the sciences; students  in chemistry, biology and physics as well as chemistry; regional  high school science teachers; chemistry faculty from other liberal  arts colleges.",
