It consists of two main  programs, in parabolic and hyperbolic conservation laws,  respectively. The first project involves the study of  stability of waves in viscous conservation laws. This  project is intimately connected with the central problems of  hyperbolic admissibility and the inviscid limit. Current  theory, based on energy methods, remains ad hoc and  incomplete. A new, pointwise stability analysis is proposed  for the treatment of several open problems, including:  Lebesgue integrability behavior, rarefactions, multiple wave  patterns, undercompressive and \"fake Lax\" shocks, weak  deflagration waves, multi-dimensional fronts in MHD, and  nonuniform convergence of shock capturing schemes. The  second project involves refined wave tracing methods for  hyperbolic conservation laws. Wave tracing gives a great  deal of information about approximate solutions obtained by  the Glimm random choice scheme. It is proposed that, by  refined accounting techniques, more of this information can  be extracted in the limiting process. Previously, decay and  convergence to N-waves have been established for nonconvex  systems. More recently, existence and decay have been shown  for periodic solutions of nxn, nonresonant systems,  generalizing the work of Glimm and Lax for 2x2 systems. It  is planned to study periodic solutions of nonconvex and of  resonant systems, and, ultimately, continuous dependence on  initial data.       This project deals with equations of applied mathematics. In  particular, the equations of continuum mechanics will be  study. Emphasis will be placed on the study of stability and  convergence of viscous shock and rarefaction waves. The  analysis can be applied to real world problems encountered,  for example, in gas dynamics.  ***",
