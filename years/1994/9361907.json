 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361907  Ng  Field tracking of smoke and obscurant clouds from forest  fires or volcanoes requires determination of the two-  dimensional cloud extent shown in visible images scanned  from various angles about the clouds.  At the present time,  two-dimensional cloud extent is determined by an operator  who manually locates points on the cloud perimeter -- a  procedure which has been found to be expensive, time  consuming and vulnerable to human misjudgment.    To address this problem, this project undertakes a study for  the development of computer vision algorithms based on human  preattentive visual processes for the automatic recognition  of smoke clouds.  The objectives of this research include a  study of human preattentive vision to determine important  visual cues, incorporation of these visual cues into  computer vision algorithms for detecting cloud regions,  development of a neural network pattern recognition system  utilizing these algorithms, and integration of the system  with a user-friendly graphical interface.    The innovative use of image analysis features based on human  preattentive visual processes for automated cloud detection  is significant.  Since features modeled on human visual  preattention are capable of functioning in a scene-  independent manner, a system for automatically recognizing  obscurant clouds that is superior to present methods will be  demonstrated.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***",
