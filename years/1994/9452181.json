This project responds to  the local paper industry needs for trained graduates to work in  integrated and automated manufacturing and research operations  performing product analysis and process control using computerized  data systems. The requested equipment is geared toward the rising  industry standards for using increasing amounts of recycled fiber  in the paper making process. Current manual equipment in the  laboratories limits the curriculum to experimenting with fragments  of the systems process. This project elevates the competency level  of the curriculum by creating the potential for a new range of  Laboratory experimentation. This curriculum will be shared with  other college and university pulp and paper science programs  challenged with educating students for employment in this dynamic  industry.",
