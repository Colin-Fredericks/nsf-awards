The results from the  binding study will then be used to develop an improved adsorption-  inhibition mechanism.  This will be accomplished by applying modern  molecular modeling techniques on native AFPs bound to an ice  surface and at the ice/water interface.  These calculations will be  used to study what effect hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and  hydrophilic effects, salt bridges, and electrostatics has on the  binding of AFPs to ice.  Most important is to understand how these  properties contribute to the adsorption-inhibition nature of  antifreeze proteins.  Initially, a docking program will be used to  locate potential binding sites on different ice surfaces.  Once  potential binding sites have been identified, energy minimizations  will be used to determine the binding energy of the AFP bound to  the ice surface.  Molecular dynamics simulations will then be  performed to study the interactions of the antifreeze at the  ice/water interface and provide starting configurations for free  energy perturbation calculations.  The free energy perturbation  simulations will be used to quantify the free energy contribution  of individual amino acids to binding.  Finally, Brownian dynamics  simulations will be done to study how electrostatics, between the  AFP and ice, effects the translational and orientational steering  of an AFP's approach to the ice surface in water.  The results from  this work will provide both a qualitative and a quantitative  molecular description of the properties of AFPs which will be  useful to the biologist, chemist, and biochemist in their attempts  to \"design\" better synthetic analogs.  These synthetic AFPs can  then be used to protect frost sensitive food crops, in food  storage, in cryosurgical methods, and in the prevention of  frostbite.  In summary, the data from this work will have an impact  in chemistry, biology, physics, compute r science, and  biotechnology.  %%%  The objective of this proposal is to study the interactions between  antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice.

Other faculty members in the Chemistry Department will be able to  use the results from this proposal in their teaching.  For example,  visualization, in \"real time\", the motion of a moderately sized  peptide at the ice/water.  This \"movie\" will provide a mechanism in  which to describe the different molecular interactions taking  place, e.g. hydrogen bonding, solute-solvent interactions, salt-  bridges and etc. which are usually discussed as abstract concepts  in the classroom.  ***",
