 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405837  Wilson    We propose to use a mathematical model and laboratory experiments  to elucidate the mixing rule at the pore body or fracture junction  scale.  Traditional models have assumed that tracers or  contaminants entering one of these junctions are either well mixed,  or follow flowlines through the junction.  A cellular automata  numerical model and a machined Lucite experimental micromodel are  proposed to investigate the hypothesis that there is a range of  mixing rules between these limits.  The Peclet number would be used  to position in flow between diffusion control leading to the well  mixed rule, and advection control, with contaminants never leaving  a flowline.  A pore or fracture junction Peclet Number is defined  as the mean advective velocity times pore/fracture size, divided by  the diffusion coefficient.  At high velocities and high Peclet  Numbers there is little mixing across the dividing stream line,  yielding advective control.  At small velocities and Peclet numbers  diffusion dominates, resulting in complete mixing.  We hypothesize  that the transition between these limits spans about an order of  magnitude of Peclet numbers, and occurs near a Peclet number of 1.     Lattice gas automata (LGA) and /or lattice Boltzman methods will be  used to numerically simulate flow and transport  simultaneously.   These methods work well for Peclet numbers near one, but a new  algorithm has been developed to efficiently model dilute solutions  of non-homogeneous fluids in order to economically vary Peclet  number  over a large range, while holding Reynolds number constant.   The experimental approach employs a Lucite physical  micromodels of  a junctions, consisting of four intersecting channels.  In order to  accommodate the expected range of Peclet numbers the low Reynolds  number, and reasonable experimental time constants, the channels  and flow rates must be quite small.  At low flow rates and Peclet  numbers the experiment is very sensitive to leaks, temperature  fluctua tions, and other problems.  We built a preliminary version  of the experiment to elucidate and solve each of these problems.    The cellular automata simulations and the physical micromodel will  be used to explore mixing with different combinations of entering  and exiting flow rates, and with different junction geometries.    We will then work with other investigators to apply the rules to  percolation network models of porous systems, and various fracture  network systems, to determine the spatial distribution of mixing  rules, and their effect on mechanical and macro-dispersion  calculations.  Through collaborations we will simulate miscible  displacement experiments in the networks, with mixing, no-mixing  and adaptive mixing rules, to further investigate the range of  mixing conditions.",
