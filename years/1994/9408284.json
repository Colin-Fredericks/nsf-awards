The research plan contains four projects.    I.     The first project focuses on the interactions between  helical peptides as a means for probing early events in protein  folding.  Modern theory suggests that protein folding begins with  the formation of isolated regions of local secondary structure.   Tertiary structure then follows from adhesion events between  these localized regions.   However, little is known about these  adhesion events.  To probe this process, 2D electron-electron  double resonance (2D ELDOR) will be used to monitor interactions  between structured helical peptides in solution. 2D ELDOR is a  new ESR technique that has just been shown to be extremely useful  for studying peptide-peptide interactions.   The methodology will  be further developed for mixed isotope experiments.  In doing so,  the critical relationship between helical peptide structure and  the strength of peptide-peptide interactions will be determined.    II.     The second project is the synthesis of a rigid side chain  nitroxide amino acid for incorporation into FMOC automated  peptide synthesis.  Recent research has shown that nitroxide spin  labeled peptides can provide wealth of information on peptide  structure and dynamics.  However, almost all published  experiments have used spin label modifications of natural amino  acid side chains.  Linkages of this type are necessarily flexible  and therefore less than ideal for certain types of experiments.   The specific label proposed here is rigid, follows L amino acid  stereochemistry, and contains the necessary design features for a  \"helix-neutral\" amino acid.    III.     The third project is an exploration of the use of  neutral networks for determining motional parameters from slow  motional ESR spectra.  Slow  motional spectra in ESR and solid  state NMR result when the rotational cor relation time is too long  to satisfy the motional narrowing conditions.  Although more  difficult to interpret, slow motional spectra are extremely  sensitive to dynamic details of molecular motion.  In the past,  such spectra were stimulated and motional parameters were  determined by estimating a best fit.  This is a very laborious  process that uses considerable computer and human resources.  The  proposal outlines and approach for tackling this problem form an  entirely new perspective.  Neural networks will be used to  quickly extract dynamic details from slow motional spectra.                  IV.    The last project is the development of a new spectroscopy  called Biradical Electron-Electron Correlated Spectroscopy (BEE-  COSY).  This technique will be used for determining distances of  up to 15A in doubly spin labeled peptides.  COSY spectroscopy has  long been used in NMR to reveal through bond scalar couplings  between nuclear spins.  In biradical peptides, electron-electron  couplings results from a through space interaction.  BEE-COSY  will both detect and help quantify these couplings.  The  detectable length scale is between that of NMR (< 4 ) and  fluorescence energy transfer (> 20 ) and is therefore extremely  important for biomolecules.  % % %       Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a modern biophysical  technique used to explore structure and motion in biologically  important molecules.  The main goal of the proposed research is  to develop new ESR methods to help biochemists refine their ideas  of protein structure and activity.  In turn, these methods will  serve as indispensable aids in basic and applied research.  As an  example, in our last funding period, we developed the use of  double label ESR to reveal previously unseen structures in  protein fragments.  Our ideas were then implemented by another  lab to solve the protein coat structure of the Pf1 virus.  This  critical problem had remained unsolved for nearly 10 years!  For  the new funding period we propose to explo re methods to probe  protein assembly.  In particular, our 2D ELDOR project may allow  us to observe events that correspond to the earliest protein  assembly processes.  The insights gained from this research may  prove critical for predicting structure and stability from  protein sequences.  Such information will help in drug design,  understanding of diseases and the human genome project.  * * *",
