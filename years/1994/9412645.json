 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  It is a study of whites' racial attitudes and the appropriate scientific methodologies for measuring them, focusing on the fact that whites are more supportive of abstract principles of racial equality than they are of policies directed at achieving these goals.  This study investigates two explanations for this \"policy/principle gap:\"  1) survey research is not capturing true racial attitudes due to social desirability pressures to respond according to what are perceived to be the prevailing social norms;  2) models predicting a perfect relationship between principles and policies are inadequate, and additional attitudes, beliefs and values must be considered.  This study attaches fresh data collection and analysis to the on-going Detroit Area Study in order to address these questions.  %%%   The research engages important issues in both research methodology and sociological theory, and the results will contribute to the knowledge base concerning American racial tensions.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
