 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360873  Karam    We propose to demonstrate Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) of GaN/A1N structures at growth rates exceeding 1 micron/hr in an innovative reactor which emoloys continuously flowing, yet spatially separate gas streams and a moving substrate to expose the wafer surface to alternating fluxes of Group III and V reactants.  The reactor incorporates both structural and gas curtain barriers to ensure fast and efficient removal o the excess reactants and reaction  products which limit ALE growth rates.  Their removal is achieved by coupling mechanical boundary layer shearing with hydrogen purging to prevent gas-phase mixing of the two reactant species.  In this way a process which combines the superior thickness and compositional uniformity of ALE with the high growth rate of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) can be achieved.    To show feasibility, in Phase I we will use ALE-grown material to fabricate a functional photoconductive UV detector; in Phase II, growth conditions and detector fabrication processes will be optimized.  One proper control of dopants is demonstrated, high growth rate ALE will be explored as a means of producing P-N junction devices such as lasers, light emitting diodes, and photodiodes.  The excellent uniformity of material grown by ALE will also make possible the realization of two-dimensional staring UV detector arrays.  ***",
