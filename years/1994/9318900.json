 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318900  James Dietz    During its lifetime, an individual primate faces an array of  critical life history decisions, such as mate choice and  timing of dispersal and reproduction.  The outcome of each  of these decisions impacts directly on survivorship and  fecundity, and natural selection should favor those  individuals that make appropriate choices.  Primate research  has rarely been at the forefront in evolutionary biological  work, because of a) their longevity, b) their complex social  behavior, and c) their relatively low population numbers.    This study, by contrast, on the golden lion tamarins in  Brazil, has developed a research system that permits  circumvention of these obstacles.  The investigators have  identified the critical life history junctures for this  species, and have documented a good many rare variations.  They believe that it is the exceptions to common patterns  that hold the key to understanding the factors that shaped  the evolution of life history traits.  During the next three  years, they will intensify  the study of variation in choice  for several critical life history decisions, and test them  with strict hypothesis tests.  The long term goal of the  research is to construct a model based on evolutionary and  ecological theory that will allow us to predict individual  choice at these decision junctures.",
