The proposed program will provide a stimulating biological research  experience for twelve talented students recruited from Furman University and smaller,  less research-oriented colleges in South Carolina.  The program is especially aimed at  women, minority students, and persons with disabilities; and such individuals will make  up the majority of the participants.  Approximately half of the students will be rising  seniors and half will be rising sophomores.  Approximately six research groups will be  formed, with the majority of groups consisting of a senior, a sophomore, and a  faculty research director.  Research areas range from ecology to molecular biology.  The  The goal of the program his to support productive, publishable research involving  undergraduates, with a special focus on promising younger students.  The program builds  on a strong tradition of undergraduate research in a liberal arts environment at Furman  University and a successful NSF/REU program over the past two summers.  ***",
