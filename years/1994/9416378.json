 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416378  Rollins  A preliminary review of damage distribution in the San  Fernando and Los Angeles basins following the 1994  Northridge earthquake indicates that damage was concentrated  in low-rise structures at the fringes of the basins where  soil profiles are relatively stiff and shallow.  Accelerograms located on alluvium at the fringes of the  valleys also exhibited unusually high accelerations,  particularly in the vicinity of San Fernando.    In contrast to the 1985 Mexico Earthquake, it appears that  incoming rock motions were rich in short period energy due  to the proximity to the source, causing significant  amplification in the stiffer shallow deposits (with shorter  natural periods of vibration) located at the fringes of the  basins.  Amplification of short period energy would be  expected to result in a concentration of damage to short  period structures (such as single story structures) located  on these deposits.  It is also possible that 2- or 3-D basin-  shape effects played a role in the amplification at these  locations.    The objectives of this project are:    (1) To evaluate the ability of widely used computer codes  such as SHAKE and DESRA to match recorded motions,  particularly in areas where damage intensity was relatively  high.  These ground response techniques have proven useful  at deep soft soil sites such as those in Mexico City and San  Francisco, but have not been verified against field data for  stiff shallow sites.  Other siesmically active areas, such  as Salt Lake valley, have stiff shallow soils adjacent to  mountain fronts and it is important to calibrate the methods  for these site conditions.    (2)  To calibrate correlations between the damage potential  index (DPI) defined by Seed and Sun (1989),and observed  damage to structures.  Useful correlations between DPI and  damage intensity were observed following the 1967 Caracas,  Venezuela earthquake and the 1985 Mexico Earthquake.  However, the Northridge earthquake provides the best  opportunity to d ate to calibrate the correlation for  conditions in the U.S.  ***",
