 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patterson  The molecular dynamics of bulk polymers can be characterized by  mechanical processes with a distribution of relaxation rates.  The  measurable properties of amorphous polymers are determined by the  coupling of the macroscopic variable with these microscopic  processes.  The goal of this research is to explain the behavior of  longitudinal sound waves in optically perfect bulk polymers in  terms of the longitudinal relaxation processes in the material.   The knowledge of the distribution of relaxation rates for the  processes which determine the longitudinal modulus will then be  used to predict the mechanical properties of these materials.  Many  applications, such as optical fibers, require polymeric materials  which scatter only the minimum amount of light determined by the  compressibility of the liquid.  A series of n-alkyl  methacrylate(n=1,2,4,6) samples which achieve this limit of clarity  will be used in the research.  The optical perfection of the  samples will be measured by Rayleigh-Brillouin spectroscopy.  The  Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum depends on the frequency of the  longitudinal sound waves responsible for the light scattering.   When there are microscopic processes with relaxation rates lower  than the sound frequency, the spectrum displays a central peak  whose shape is determined by the relaxation strengths and rates  associated with these motions.  In the frequency regime important  for mechanical processes such as toughness, (106 to 10-2 Hz), the  measurement of dynamic light scattering is carried out using photon  correlation spectroscopy.  The relaxation function for the  longitudinal density fluctuations which give rise to light  scattering will be measured as a function of termperature,  pressure, and chemical structure.  The samples will be maintained  in the equilibrium liquid state above the glass transition.  The  light scattering data will be used to calculate the distribution of  relaxation rates associated with the longitudinal modulus.  The  resulti ng distribution will be correlated with the chemical  structure of the molecules.  The study of the shape of the  distribution as a function of pressure will allow identification of  modes of motion that couple weakly to the volume of the liquid.   These processes retain their relaxation strength in the glassy  state and are less subject to physical aging.  %%%  Typical tough polymeric materials are sufficiently structurally  heterogeneous that they are opaque.  One of the most important new  applications of polymers is optical fiber.  In order to be useful  in this application, the material must be sufficiently optically  homogeneous.  The challenge is to produce a material which is  optimized both for optical clarity and for mechanical toughness.   The research will employ bulk polymer samples that have been  prepared in optically perfect form.  Light scattering spectroscopy  is well suited for the study of both the optical and mechanical  properties of amorphous polymers.",
