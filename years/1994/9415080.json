 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eastern Michigan University is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation  of research and research training laboratories, located in the Mark Jefferson  Building, home of the Department of Chemistry.  Research activities are  currently conducted in a building designed in 1966.  The department's  allocation of space has evolved in a series of ad hoc adjustments leading to  less than optimum conditions.  With support from the NSF, the department  will reorganize its research, training, and research support facilities to permit  more efficient, flexible and productive use of their resources.  Renovations  consist of:  outfitting three synthesis laboratories with additional fume hoods,  and upgrading the ventilation system; customizing the biochemical  toxicology laboratory by replacing fume hoods with a laminar flow hood and  incubators, and modernizing instrument and chemical storage rooms.  This  project will have the following results:  increasing research productivity,   accommodating more students involved in research training, improving the  health and safety  conditions of  laboratories for all research personnel, and  providing a system for flexible utilization of the department's resources that  will enable the facility to serve for future needs.  More opportunities for  research training will augment Eastern Michigan's success in providing  undergraduates with solid research experiences, leading students to pursue  careers in science.",
