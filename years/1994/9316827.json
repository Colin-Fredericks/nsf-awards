 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in the methodology and  instrumentation of electron paramagnetic  resonance (EPR) hold promise of revolutionary enhancement of  applications of EPR to  problems in materials science, chemistry, physics, biology,  and medicine. One key missing  development is an improvement in the coupling of the sample-  containing EPR resonator to  the microwave source and detector systems.        In preliminary work basic engineering design equations  were developed for three types  of coupling of an EPR resonator to a transmission line:  mutual inductive coupling, series  capacitive coupling, and parallel capacitive coupling. These  equations form an accurate  basis for developing new, more optimum resonator coupling  techniques. Focusing on the  versatile loop-gap type~of EPR resonator (LGR), a test  fixture was built in which were  tested prototype LGR coupling networks. The tests verified  predictions of the equations  and demonstrated that a varactor (a voltage-variable  capacitor) diode is a useful tuning  element in LGR coupling networks. A prototype, novel,  general-purpose resonator has  been constructed. It yields useful low-temperature spectra  of metalloenzymes.        The design equations and the results of tests conducted  on prototype resonators and  coupling devices point directly to the specific aims of the  proposed grant period. It is now  proposed to build a resonator at S-band (2-4 GHz)  implementing the predicted best  low-noise coupling scheme, and incorporating design features  that facilitate ease of sample  change and flexibility for both continuous wave and pulsed  EPR. The design will be  consistent with convenient variable temperature (including  cryogenic) operation. GaAs  varactor diodes and field-effect transistor amplifiers will  be used, since they have good  performance at cryogenic temperatures. Several of the  critical microwave components can  be located in close proximity to the sample on a small  circuit board, which itself can be  cooled alo ng with the sample and resonator, with the goal of  the lowest thermal noise in  the electronic components. Careful attention to materials  properties will result in a robust  and usable assembly.        The second phase of the work will be the development of  a totally new approach to  integrating the resonator, coupling assembly, means for  tuning, and the microwave bridge  element all on or close to a small hybrid microwave subs~te.  Such a hybrid microwave  bridge circuit will have lower losses resulting in improved  EPR signal-to-noise ratio at  room temperature. By cooling the circuitry to cryogenic  temperatures there is potential for  a large increase in signal-to-noise.        Extension to the X-band (9 GHz) region, which requires  making everything smaller  and building it more precisely, will begin during the  proposed grant period. The use of  varactor tuning will be demonstrated at X-band, and a test  fixture will be built to obtain  practical operating experience with the sensitivity of the  resonator and coupling system  performance to various construction features.",
