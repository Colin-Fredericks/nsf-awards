 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354419  Wackerly  Many of the students who register for college-level introductory  statistics courses have relatively weak backgrounds in mathematics  and, more importantly, poor quantitative skills. Although many of  these courses have been developed with only high school level  algebra as a pre-requisite, the typical content of these courses is  really rather sophisticated. Students are expected to understand  concepts such as: conditional probability, Bayes' Rule,  independence, sampling distributions of statistics, confidence  intervals and tests of hypotheses. The level of student  understanding of these (nonquantitative) students depends upon how  well they are able to envision what might happen if a process  (sample, computation, etc.) were repeated over-and-over. This  project will focus on the use of the computer as a device for  illustration and \"discovery\" of important concepts that students  have difficulty grasping. Rather than imagine what might happen if  a process were repeated over-and-over, the computer can be used to  show the students what actually DOES happen. The computer  demonstrations are a tremendous aid in classroom presentations of  the concepts and are also very valuable in the hands of students,  where they can discover important facts and concepts for  themselves. This project will produce (a) the demonstration  software in topic modules for Macintosh computers, and (b) manuals  for instructor and student use of the software.  Student learning  and attitudes will be evaluated.",
