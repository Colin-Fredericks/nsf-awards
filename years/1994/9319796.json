 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319796  Hirschfeld         This research investigates two basic questions in cognition  and social concept formation: (1) What principles do young  children use to organize knowledge of the social world, and (2)  What shapes young children's social stereotypes?  Very young  children show a spontaneous curiosity about the social world, and  appear to reason about it more deeply than previous researchers  suggest. They also develop enduring prejudices about members of  some social groups.  While some children utilize a social  reasoning strategy that focuses on behavioral regularities among  people, others emphasize nonobvious and 'essentialist'  commonalities in a manner that parallels children's expectations  about natural kinds.  This research examines an important but  unexplored issue:  how young children enlist theory-like  appreciation of the natural world to extend their understanding  of the social world.  The research examines whether levels of  prejudice vary as a function of how extensively children's  expectations about social differences are shaped by natural kind  reasoning and the role played by natural kind categories in  helping children go beyond similarities in appearance in their  social understanding. Race and racism are linked to almost every  major social problem facing American society.  They are  implicated in issues ranging from the reproduction of poverty, to  underachievement in schools, to differential rates of illness.   Most previous accounts see the child playing a passive role in  learning prejudice; children acquire racism by virtue of  encountering racist messages.  This research challenges this  assumed learning process, investigating whether children play a  more active role in constructing the knowledge they acquire. As  such, it likens the learning of prejudice more to language  learning than to algebra learning.  Like language, prejudice may  be easy to learn and difficult to forget. By increasing our  understanding of the nature of prejudice and th e psychological  processes underlying it, the present research will place us in a  better position to reduce it.  ***",
