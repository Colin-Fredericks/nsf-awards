Berkey, Center for Atmospheric and Space  Sciences, Utah State University, and Professor  Takeo Hirasawa and Dr. Takayuki Ono, National  Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), Tokyo,  Japan.  The purpose of the project is to obtain  quantitative information on the spatial extent  and temporal development of auroras observed at  Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.      The data to be analyzed have been acquired  using a film-based all-sky camera system that  has been operated at South Pole Station since  1965.  The data are to be processed using a  sophisticated all-sky camera image processing  system developed at the NIPR for the analysis  of data acquired at the Japanese Antarctic  bases.  The analysis system enables the user to  display data in a geophysical coordinate  framework and to analyze images acquired over  short or long time intervals in a manner not  possible with individual photographic images.   Dr. Berkey has responsibility for the all-sky  program at South Pole Station, and Dr. Hirasawa  and Dr. Ono have had extensive experience in  auroral studies, each having spent more than  one winter season in Antarctica.  NIPR is a  national laboratory responsible for conducting  research both in the Arctic and Antarctic  regions.  ***",
