 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to establish an introductory  undergraduate laboratory with a modern three-dimensional fiber  braiding machine for manufacturing, testing and applications of  high performance textile materials and structures for composites.  This project will foster a proposed cooperative educational  experience between Textile Engineering and Materials Engineering at  Auburn University.  The specific educational objective is an  introductory knowledge of composites for the manufacturing and  application of various flexible structures in composites. Besides  its regular use as an undergraduate teaching laboratory, the  proposed equipment will provide excellent opportunity for  undergraduate students in their senior design projects and  independent studies. This project will help to produce graduates  with knowledge of the latest thrust in fibrous materials for  industrial applications.  This project will integrate textile  engineering, textile chemistry and materials/mechanical  engineering. It will expand the range of textile applications in  high performance materials mark will take the students beyond the  borders of traditional textiles and introduce them to new  manufacturing methods and applications of textiles where high  performance is a requirement. It will introduce students to new,  innovative textile structures for composites.  The proposed  braiding machine will be used to manufacture advanced textile  structures for composites. The purpose is to produce a range of  high quality braided textile structures to be used as composites in  high performance applications for the automotive, aerospace and  construction industries. This project will strengthen the  University's interaction with industry.",
