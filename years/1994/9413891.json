 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weiss    With support from the National Science Foundation, Pennsylvania  State University will purchase a DNA synthesizer, automated DNA  sequencer, gel documentation system and biological microscope for  work on molecular and developmental genetics. The Biological  Anthropological Laboratory (BAL) where the instrumentation will  be housed, plays a leading role in anthropological genetics.  However since the laboratory was established in 1986-87,  sequencing instrumentation has changed enormously and new systems  are necessary to permit the BAL to conduct effective research.  New instrumentation will allow the laboratory to address  questions on a much larger scale, both in terms of the numbers of  samples processed and the amount of information obtained per  sample. Many of the BAL's projects require large sample sizes;  the facility recently received for example a priceless collection  of over 12,000 South American Indian blood samples.    The BAL focusses on molecular genetic questions which are of  anthropological significance. It examines the evolution of  evolutionary-interesting phenotypes including, for example, the  genetic basis of susceptibility to diabetes and obesity in  Amerindians, the evolution of genetic susceptibility to  tuberculosis and the genetics of variation in olfaction among  individuals. The laboratory also attempts to reconstruct various  aspects of evolutionary history. Currently, for example it is  investigating the colonization of the South Pacific through the  analysis of patterns of molecular genetic variation in Asian and  Pacific populations. The BAL also places strong emphasis on the  training of students at all levels and the instrumentation  provided will not only help to maintain the high research  standards of the research group, but also provide students with  the training and facilities necessary to ensure productive  graduate and post-graduate careers.",
