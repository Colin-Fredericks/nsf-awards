 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409776  Betterton         Dilute aqueous solutions of sulfite and nitrite can be rapidly  oxidized in high yields to sulfate and nitrate, respectively,  simply by freezing the sample.  Since the yields and rates of  oxidation induced by freezing are high compared to their oxidation  pathways in hydrometeors, and since many clouds become glaciated at  some point during their life cycles, a study of the \"freezing  effect\" could lead to the discovery of significant new pathways for  aerosol formation and acid precipitation.  For example, it could  provide a new feedback mechanism between the release of cloud  condensation nuclei (CCN) by evaporating clouds and the processing  of precursors by existing glaciated clouds; it could provide a  further link between cloud formation and the global concentration  of aerosol particles (thereby affecting the global radiation  budget); and it could affect cloud droplet size distributions and  therefore cloud albedos and the radiation budget.  The \"freezing  effect\" could also play an important role in the formation of acid  precipitation since precursors of both sulfuric and nitric acids  can be oxidized during freezing.  Also of concern is the possible  influence this effect could have on the integrity of cloud- and  rain-water samples preserved by freezing.         This research will examine the hypothesis that the \"freezing  effect\" is in fact a concentration effect that occurs when  reactants are concentrated into liquid micro-pockets as the  solution freezes.  The resulting high concentrations of reactant  and dissolved oxygen could then lead to rapid auto-oxidation.  This  study will focus on a series of laboratory experiments designed to  test the hypothesis and to improve our understanding of the  \"freezing effect\".  The stoichiometry and kinetics of the  auto-oxidation of S(IV) and N(III) upon rapid freezing will be  studied by means of ion chromatography and capillary  electrophoresis.",
