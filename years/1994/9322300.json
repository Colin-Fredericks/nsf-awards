Students will  conduct summer studies in animal behavior and conservation biology.  The goal of this  program is to inspire and motivate students to pursue an advanced degree, and  ultimately, a research career.  Student participants will be drawn from the Psychology  and Biology departments of four historically black colleges (HBC's) in Atlanta  (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Morris Brown College and Clark-Atlanta  University).  The program will last for eight weeks in the summer, followed by a  Directed Studies course in the fall with Project Director Dr. Jackson.    Initially, students will participate in an intensive three-day orientation to  behavioral research at Zoo Atlanta, during which they will finalize the methodology  for an original aspect of an ongoing research project.  Following orientation,  students will work individually on these research projects under the guidance of  Project Director Dr. Jackson, Project Co-Director Dr. Forthman, and Project  Participants Drs. Maple and Stevens.  Students will participate in weekly research  seminars in which they, along with other researchers at the zoo, will discuss the  progress of their research, and develop original strategies for investigating and  furthering ongoing research projects taking place at the zoo and their prospective  campuses.  ***",
