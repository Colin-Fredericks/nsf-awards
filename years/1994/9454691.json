 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454691  Thomas    Network Montana is a collaborative, systemic research and development project constituting  Montana's response to NSF's Networking Infrastructure for Education (NIE) RFP #94-5.  The  goal of the NSF/NIE program is to build synergy between technology and educational  researchers, developers, and implementers in the use of network and telecommunications  technologies in education, with a particular focus on the development of flexible, sustainable  approaches to network infrastructure.  This proposal seeks funding for a one-year planning grant  aimed at developing a systemic approach to K-16 networking in Montana.  The partners in this  enterprise will include teachers, administrators, and researchers from the state's educational  system, leaders in state government, and individuals from a variety of community, professional,  and private sector organizations.  Commitments of talent and resources from all partners will  be focused on the development of a lasting infrastructure capable of supporting the development  of a variety of educational telecommunications services. Specifically, at the end of the planning  period, the Network Montana Project will:         1. Define a state-wide coalition of partners from academia, government, and the private       sector responsible for directing a wide variety of K-16 educational networking activities       during the period of NSF/NIE funding and in subsequent projects;          2. Make use of Montana Information Services Division (ISD) leased lines and Big Sky       Telegraph capabilities to pilot Internet access for select K-12 schools and their local       libraries;          3. Encourage and facilitate long-term partnerships with computer equipment and software       manufacturers, aerospace industries, and other private sector organizations interested in       educational reform;         4. Facilitate cooperative partnerships with NASA, NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey       and other national and international scientific organizatio ns;          5. Cooperate with and support a number of nationally significant mathematics and science       education projects already underway in Montana;          6. Focus on the development of educational and informational resources deliverable over       the Internet and of interest to Montanans of all ages, and;          7. Develop a position paper on the networking implications for mathematics and science       education reform.    The foundation of the Network Montana Project is cooperation and collaboration.  All major  organizations and institutions involved with mathematics education, science education,  telecommunications, or networking across Montana are participants in this planning grant.   Industry support from TCI, Digital Equipment Corporation, Microsoft, Square One TV and  others also plays a significant role.",
