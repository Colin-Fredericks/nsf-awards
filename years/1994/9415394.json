 "awd_abstract_narration": "Watson    Under the direction of Dr. Patty Jo Watson, Mr. Jimmy Railey will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Railey has worked  with Chinese archaeologists in the survey and excavation of  archaeological sites in the southern Yuanqu basin, located in the  middle Yellow River in China. The team has found a series of  settlements which encompass both the Neolithic and early Bronze  Age periods and thus document the emergence of complex stratified  societies in this region. With National Science Foundation  support, Mr. Railey will continue this work. He will participate  in on-going excavations at three sites in the Basin and also  conduct a survey of the surrounding area. Spatial analyses of the  data he collects will provide information on the long-term trends  in regional demography and settlement patterns. It will document  changes in the size and internal organization of specific  communities over time and shed light on the organization of  production and distribution of ceramics. He will conduct a  detailed analysis of ceramic materials recovered and also examine  floral and faunal remains recovered from the sites.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies arose  since these form the basic social structure within which we live  today. To gain insight into the underlying processes involved, it  is necessary to utilize a comparative method and examine a number  of individual instances in which this transformation took place.  Only in this way can general trends be separated from historical  particulars. In this context the Yellow River region of China is  extremely important because this was one of the independent  cradles of world civilization. Mr. Railey works on sites which  span this transition. The research will also provide data of  interest to many archaeologists, further scientific cooperation  between the United States and the Peoples Republic of China and  help to train a promising young scientist.",
