 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354371  Pellegrino  Faculty at Vanderbilt University are developing a new course,  Computer Algebra Systems in Mathematical Modeling, that is open to  any student who has had at least one semester of calculus.  The  course has two primary objectives: (1) to introduce students to a  computer algebra system (CAS); and (2) to use this technology to  investigate applications that are accessible to all undergraduates  who have some calculus background.  Besides the development of the  course, this project serves as one of the planning exercises for  the creation of the Vanderbilt University Center for the  Enhancement of Mathematics and Science Teacher Education through  Advanced Technologies (CEMSTEAT).  The new course emphasizes  applying mathematics to problems that arise in the real world.   Modules for the course are being developed and will be assembled  into a course supplement.  These modules treat applications in the  natural and social sciences.  The development team is employing the  expertise of the Learning Technology Center at Peabody College of  Vanderbilt University.  Experts at the Center are advising the  development team on how multimedia and other technology components  can be used.  The development team is consulting also with faculty  members in the sciences and teacher education in choosing  applications that meet the needs of their students.  Evaluation of  the course addresses three issues: (1) the nature of student and  faculty use of a CAS and mathematical concepts in conjunction with  the proposed modules; (2) student learning and understanding of  mathematical modeling; and (3) students' applications of the CAS to  modeling and other mathematical concepts.  As activities of  CEMSTEAT, the materials and knowledge of student learning developed  are available to a national audience.  ***y",
