 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313192  Minate       The project is an interdisciplinary investigation of the  start-up stage of the direct chill (DC) ingot casting process.   During the start-up stage of the process, the entry of the molten  metal into the mold cavity takes place under very dynamic and  transient conditions.  The resulting fluid flow and the associated  solidification pattern can drastically affect the microstructure of  the ingot.  In addition, the thermal stresses during the  solidification stage can be large and can lead to cracking in the  ingot.  Moreover, the formation of air gap between the ingot and  the mold can significantly  change the heat transfer at the ingot-  mold interface.  Therefore, the transport phenomena, thermal  deformation, and associated coupling between them during the start-  up stage of the process can have a major impact on the formation of  defects in the ingots.  The proposed interdisciplinary study will  involve a comprehensive experimental and computational analysis of  the fluid flow, solidification, and thermal stresses during the  start-up stage to determine their contribution to cracking and  inferior microstructure in the ingots.  The thermomechanical  coupling between the fluid flow, solidification, and thermal  stresses will be studied with the aim of preventing defects during  the DC ingot casting process.       The results of the study may allow for the faster casting of  metal ingots with reduced defect content.  Such ingots can be used  to produce higher quality parts at lower cost.",
