 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411808  Sork     Young secondary forests are becoming increasingly common and important throughout the tropics as primary forests are cleared and unproductive fields and pastures are abondoned.  However, the dynamics of tree regeneration in secondary forests have received very little research.  This study examines the ecology of tree seedling establishment in ten-year old secondary forest in Amazonian Peru.  The objectives are to: 1) examine intra- and interspecific patterns of growth and survivorship of protected seedlings, 2) measure impact of exposure to physical damage from herbivores and litter fall on seedling performance, and 3) evaluate whether morphological traits of seeds and seedlings are predictive of performance.      This research will greatly improve our understanding of the processes of secondary forest regeneration.  The results of this study will have application in the conservation and restoration of tropical forest ecosystems.",
