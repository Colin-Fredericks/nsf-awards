 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412141  Drennan    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Drennan and  his colleagues will conduct four seasons of archaeological  reconnaissance and excavation in the Alto Magdalena region of  Colombia. This area has long attracted the attention of  archaeologists because of its striking stone statuary and  elaborate burial mounds. With previous NSF support, Dr. Drennan  has documented aspects of the regional social, political and  economic organization of the prehispanic inhabitants of one part  of the Alto Magdalena. The results indicate the emergence of  small scale regional chiefdoms beginning about 1 A.D. Dr. Drennan  will now expand his work to include a larger portion of the Alto  Magdalena. In conjunction with his colleagues, he will first  conduct a broad scale regional survey. On the basis of the  results, several localities will be examined in more detail and  select excavations will be carried out.     Archaeologists have observed that in many parts of the world  simple agricultural societies were transformed into more complex  entities which incorporated large numbers of people and exhibited  clear cut social stratification. In the earlier stages such  entities are termed \"chiefdoms\" and archaeologists wish to  understand the processes which led to their rise. The Alto  Magdalena region is unusual in this regard because it appears  that status differentiation, when it emerged, was not accompanied  by great variations in individual wealth. Usually the opposite is  true. Through his expansion in areal coverage Dr. Drennan and his  colleagues wish to understand the process in more detail.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on the emergence of complex societies and assist in the training  of graduate students.",
