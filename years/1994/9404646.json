 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404646  Wand  Because compilers are trusted components of almost every computer  system, it is important to have trustworthy proofs of their  correctness.  This project would continue research on the  development and verification of compilers based on formal  specifications of programming languages.  A major area of  activity would extend semantics and compiler correctness proofs  to languages for parallel computation. Some effort would also be  directed toward the study of fundamental theories for object-  oriented programming.    Cross-fertilization with related research is expected.  Techniques for optimization and concretization would be applied  in the parallel setting, and the parallel setting would raise new  problems for studies of optimization.  Similarly, existing  activity in type theory is concerned primarily with complexity of  type inference algorithms.  It is expected that some of these  results to be applied in the object-oriented setting, and that  studies of OOP would raise new theoretical questions in type  theory.  ***",
