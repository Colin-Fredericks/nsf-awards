 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416232  Hamburger  Light industrial buildings of tiltup and reinforced masonry  construction with panelized plywood roofs house thousands of  workers in the Western U.S.  In addition, strategic sectors  of the Western U.S. economy including the aerospace,  defense, electronics, banking, retailing and semiconductor  industries are located within buildings of this  construction.  The performance of these buildings in a major  regional earthquake clearly has major potential impact on  the safety and welfare of broad segments of the society.    This construction was shown to be vulnerable to earthquake  induced collapses in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.  Building code changes were enacted in the mid-1970s were  effective in mitigating this vulnerability.  However, more  than 400 such structures in the epicentral region of the  Northridge earthquake, many conforming to these updated code  requirements, experienced partial collapse, graphically  demonstrating the inadequacy of current design approaches.    This project examines the response of these commercial and  light industrial buildings with wood framed roofs to near  source ground motions, to determine the causative failure  modes for these structures in the Northridge Earthquake, and  to develop and assist in implementing effective design  procedure changes to minimize the potential for catastrophic  failures in future events capable of affecting the Los  Angeles region, San Francisco Bay Area, Puget Sound region  and other areas of intense development within seismically  active zones.  The findings of this research will be  directly presented to code and standards development bodies,  in forms which can readily be implemented. Recommendations  will be developed to modify the design codes to provide  adequate margin in the near source zones of earthquakes. ***",
