The main  approach is to use singular perturbation methods to derive reduced equations  which capture essential nonlinear phenomena in their simplest form. These  reduced equations are then studied using modern analytical and numerical  methods. Specific problems include the transition from regular to irregular  reflection in weak shock reflection, nonlinear waves in random media, and  nonlinear waves in classical field theories.        Many kinds of waves --- such as sound waves, elastic waves, and  magnetohydrodynamic waves --- are described by hyperbolic partial differential  equations. At large enough amplitudes, these waves are nonlinear. The effects  of nonlinearity are often dramatic and are qualitatively different from the  predictions of a linear theory. For example, nonlinearity leads to the  formation of shocks, or sometimes to other kinds of singularities, and to  various kinds of nonlinear instabilities. This proposal concerns a wide  variety of physical problems involving nonlinear hyperbolic waves. The  problems include the reflection of shock waves, the propagation of large  amplitude sound waves through turbulent fluids, and the analysis of  orientation waves in a massive liquid crystal director field.",
