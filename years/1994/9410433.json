 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) acts to direct the survival and  differentiation of specific populations of neurons in the  periphery and in the central nervous system.  The cellular  mechanisms by which NGF elicits changes in these neurons has  not been resolved.  This proposal is focused on defining the  specific biochemical steps by which the binding of NGF at  the cell surface is transduced, ultimately resulting in  changes in gene expression and cellular morphology.  In the  previous grant period we have identified several enzymes  which participate in a signal transduction pathway, termed  the MAP kinase cascade.  NGF stimulates the serial  activation of the protein kinases which comprise this  pathway and mediate the transmission of signals from the  membrane into the nucleus.  This application is directed  toward understanding how the most proximal member of this  cascade, B-raf, is activated and how the cell can  selectively employ this molecule to regulate the flow of  information to the interior of the cell.  A second aim of  this proposal is to investigate the mechanism through which  B-raf activates the next member of the cascade, MEK.  MEK is  phosphorylated and activated by B-raf, however, how this is  achieved is unclear and it is of particular interest from a  mechanistic viewpoint.  MEK in turn activates the MAP  kinases and we propose to investigate the biological  consequences of their action by inhibiting their actions by  introduction of mutant MAP kinase molecules into NGF  sensitive cells.  The mutant MAP kinases act to block the  activation of the normal enzymes, allowing dissection of  their biochemical targets and identification of cellular  processes which they critically regulate.",
