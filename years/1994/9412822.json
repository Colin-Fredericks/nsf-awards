 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412822  Hu    An International Conference on InP and related materials is  being  held to address current topics in materials growth and  characterization including several contemporary topics on  epitaxy  of increasing importance, namely: Epitaxy, Chemical  Processes;  Selective Epitaxy and Regrowth; Epitaxial Processes for  Patterned  Growth, Epitaxial Structures and Epitaxy for Device  Applications.  There are also a number of sessions dealing with devices,  OEICs(optoelectronic integrated circuits) and device physics  of  advanced electronic and photonic devices based on InP with a  strong emphasis on fundamental processes.  Additionally  there  will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish  ties  between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is  expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and  that  the Conference will provide an effective forum to discuss  and  delineate the critical scientific issues in this research  area,  and to consider and define the approaches and techniques  needed  to address them.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of InP and related  materials, and especially the critical materials research  issues  in epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials  research to  device and circuit fabrication along with  current  assessments of the most important contemporary research  issues in  this field will be of great value to the understanding and  enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of  electronics and photonics.  ***",
