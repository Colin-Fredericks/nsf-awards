 "awd_abstract_narration": "New insights from cognitive scientific studies of learning and  significant advances in the nature of computer technology make the  Learning Sciences a critical area of study for innovations in  teaching and learning based on sound theory and evidence.  The  Learning Sciences Ph.D. program is a new interdisciplinary doctoral  program launched at Northwestern University's School of Education  and Social Policy in 1991 with over twenty newly-hired faculty (in  the disciplines of Education, Computer Science, and Psychology)  targeting the training of a new generation of professionals in the  field.  Faculty and students in the program are engaged in research  to advance the scientific understanding and practice of learning  and education, and the theory, design, construction, and assessment  of innovative technologies and learning environments for schools  and workplaces.  The Learning Sciences Ph.D. comprises a cohesive  training program integrating substantive treatment  of three areas  of specialization in its core coursework, methodological  foundations, and research apprenticeships: (1) the study of  social  contexts of learning which investigates the social, contextual, and  cultural dynamics  of learning in situation ranging from classrooms  to out-of-school setting, (2) the study of cognition, developing  scientific models of the structures and processes by which domain  knowledge and skills are acquired and (3) the study of learning  technologies, which concentrates on the theory-guided design and  use of multimedia computing, artificial intelligence, and  communications technologies for supporting learning and teaching  processes.  This proposal describes the graduate training program  in Learning Sciences and our plans for aggressive recruiting to  attract underrepresented groups to this field in the context of  Northwestern's recent dramatic increases in minority doctoral  program enrollment.",
