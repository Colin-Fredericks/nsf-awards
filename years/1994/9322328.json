Each student will work on an individual research project with one  of four faculty advisors.  Projects have been chosen from  topology, dynamical systems, applied mathematics and analysis.   Students and faculty will also participate in a seminar of  general interest.  Students will read both expository and  research papers and will make most of the presentations. A large  undergraduate program is scheduled each summer at Hope College  allowing many opportunities for interactions among students from  different fields of interest.       The program duration is eight weeks.  Students will  be strongly encouraged to present their work at  professional meetings or in published form. Office space, ample  computing resources and travel funds to professional meetings are  all provided.  A significant effort will be made to  attract applications from students in underrepresented groups.  ***",
