 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vista College proposes to develop an integrated and vocationally  enriched program for bioscience technicians. This proposal responds  to a national need for broad improvement in technical education as  well as local industry needs for bioscience technicians who have  A.S. degrees or vocational certificates. This project will develop  a curriculum in biotechnology that provides students with a strong  scientific background and practical skills acquisition necessary  for success in the work place. Students will gain an in-depth  understanding of basic scientific principles and techniques, the  ability to use sophisticated scientific equipment and computers,  and the ability to think critically. In addition, this project will  respond to the needs of a rapidly changing work force by reducing  embedded institutional barriers to women and other underrepresented  groups seeking to enter science and mathematics based occupations,  incorporating new instructional methods which address the diverse  learning styles of students, providing cooperative learning  environments which are more supportive for diverse learners, and  developing an integrated curriculum which provides students with  practical skills acquisition and hands-on application of knowledge.  The Vista program is based upon a committed industry-education-city  partnership for the design and evaluation of the curriculum and in  support of student training through mentorships with industry  employees and internships in the work place. The program is based  upon a set of skill and knowledge requirements designed by industry  scientists and the program and curriculum development process has  incorporated several review sessions by an industry advisory  committee culminating in general endorsement of the program.",
