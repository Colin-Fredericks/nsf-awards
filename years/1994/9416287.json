 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416287  Engelhardt  The January 1994 Northridge Earthquake caused unprecedented  damage at beam-to-column connections in steel moment  resisting frames.  The failures occurred largely at the  standard welded flange - bolted web type of steel moment  connection.  These failures reflected nonductile behavior,  and has raised serious questions on current methods and  standards of design.    The research undertaken in this project will experimentally  evaluate the performance of reinforced moment connections.  Two reinforcing schemes will be investigated.  Both involve  the addition of reinforcing plates at the connection.  The  reinforcing plates substantially increase the flexural  capacity of the connection, and at the same time, reduce  stress levels on the beam flange welds.  The lower weld  stresses will significantly reduce the sensitivity of the  connection to welding quality.  Such reinforced connection  details have shown promising performance in limited past  tests.  However additional large scale verification of these  details is needed, and will be provided by this research  project.  Most tests will be conducted using beam steels  with high yield strength and high yield to tensile strength  ratio, in order to provide a severe test of the reinforced  connections.  However, some tests will also be conducted  using beam steels with a controlled low value of yield and  yield to tensile strengths.  These tests will demonstrate  the role of steel strength characteristics in the observed  connection failures, and investigate the possibility of  improved connection performance through control of steel  material properties.    The results of this testing program will provide urgently  needed data for structural engineers and building code  officials involved with design of new steel moment frames,  as well as the repair or retrofit of existing steel moment  frames.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
