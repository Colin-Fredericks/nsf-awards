 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319178  Etkin    The function of many nuclear proteins is regulated by  selective nuclear localization.  Xenopus nuclear factor 7  (xnf7), a putative transcription factor, is a member of a  novel zinc finger gene family whose members consist  primarily of transcription factors and protooncogenes.  Xnf7  is first detected in the oocyte nucleus and is retained in  the cytoplasm until the mid blastula stage of development  when it reenters the nucleus.  Recent evidence showed that a  22 amino acid sequence in xnf7 called the cytoplasmic  retention domain (CRD) is required for cytoplasmic retention  prior to the mid blastula stage and that phosphorylation of  two sites within the protein is necessary for proper CRD  function.  Dr. Etkin's laboratory has shown that xnf7 is  retained in the cytoplasm through an anchor mechanism most  likely involving the tethering to a ctyoplasmic anchor  protein.  The hypothesis being tested in this project is  that phosphorylation induces a structural change in xnf7  resulting in the binding of the CRD sequence to an anchor  protein.  Dr. Etkin will test this hypothesis by  accomplishing the following specific aims:  (1) He will  further determine the role of phosphorylation in the  retention of xnf7 in the cytoplasm.  (2) He will analyze and  identify the proteins that interact with the CRD sequence  and function in cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 and will clone  the cDNAs for these proteins.  In addition to gaining an  insight into an important regulatory process during  amphibian development, the analysis of the mechanism of  selective nuclear localization of xnf7 will provide  information necessary to understand this phenomenon in other  systems.  ***",
