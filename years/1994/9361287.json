 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 9361287  PI Last Name: Marchal    The innovative use of computers offers an opportunity to  dramatically improve the learning and teaching of ordinary  differential equations (ODEs).  The challenge is to identify an  instructional tool that addresses a serious and prevalent problem  common to ODE instruction--students' lack of a conceptual framework  necessary to analyze and build mathematical models, and to solve  complex problems.  In response, IntelliPro proposes to investigate  the feasibility of combining mathematical simulation, graphic  animation, and hypermedia to create an engaging multimedia learning  environment to significantly enhance students' understanding and  working knowledge of ODEs.    The researchers envision powerful, easy to use, and pedagogically  meaningful interactive simulation, a computer \"laboratory\" that  will allow students to examine the properties of linear and  nonlinear systems, explore and construct realistic mathematical  models, and apply intuitive understanding of the behavior of  solutions of ODEs to hypothetical and practical situations.  To  determine technical feasibility, IntelliPro will (a) identify an  instructional strategy and essential content material, (b) design  a software structure and implement a proof-of-concept model, and  (c)evaluate the software design, mathematics education, and product  development, will conduct the research.  ***y",
