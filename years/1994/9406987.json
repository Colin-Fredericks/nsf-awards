 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406987  del Moral    This project will continue an in-depth study of mechanisms and processes of primary succession on Mount St. Helens, Washington, which erupted in 1980.  Since the eruption, recovery has been studied continuously in permanent plots and grids representing different substrate and landscape situations.  Control of community dynamics has shifted from invasion to that controlled by resident populations.  However, no community is completely self-sustaining or is it stable.  Most sites continue to receive new species and individuals of existing species from outside the site, as indicated by increasing community diversity and scattered establishment patterns.  The emphasis of this proposal is to explore the assembly of early plant communities.   The relationship between community structure and environmental factors will be explored by several methods, including comparisons of \"replicate\" samples and correlation among environmental factors and species composition.  It is predicted that chance is important during assembly and that community composition will have low predictability for many years.  The association among individual species and their relationships to microsites will also be explored.  It is predicted that interspecific associations will be weakest on the least developed substrates and will become more positive with time, increasing scale, and substrate development.  Suitable microsites will be most restricted on least developed sites, but will expand with time.  Overlap among species with respect to microsite types will be relatively broad, although different species will rarely occur adjacent to each other.  Limited association and broad overlap combine to imply that chance is important in early development and that any of several species can be pioneers in particular microsites.    Several studies designed to measure rates of upward colonization of both tree and ground layer species will be conducted.  It is anticipated that both will be slow.  the analyses will be gene ralized by comparing observed rates to morphological types.  These observations will be useful in predicting the ability of high elevation communities to respond to climate change through upward migration.  In aggregate, these studies will assist with understanding how plant communities are formed and document how stochastic factors may have long-lasting consequences.  Hypotheses concerning niche characteristics of invading species and whether or not community composition converges through time will be tested and general successional theory will be augmented.  The project will result in a detailed, well-documented, long-term data base that can be used and extended by future ecologists to further develop ecological theory.",
