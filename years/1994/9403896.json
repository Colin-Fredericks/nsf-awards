 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry, the   Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Division of   Biological Instrumentation and Resources, addresses two hypotheses.    First, that a highly orientationally ordered, functional protein film can   be self-organized by adsorption at a highly ordered liquid/solid   interface and that the orientational order of this film can be controlled   by changing the nature of this interface, and second, that biochemical   function in a protein film is dependent on macroscopic orientational   order.  The objective of this study is to provide a more detailed   understanding of protein films for applications in biosensing and   bioseparations devices.  During the tenure of this thirty-four month   continuing grant, Professor Saavedra, a chemist, and Dr. Li, an optical   scientist, will cooperatively apply polarized reflection spectroscopies,   namely planar integrated optical waveguide-attenuated total reflection   (IOW-ATR) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), to the in   situ characterization of the structure and function of cytochrome c and   myoglobin films at the solid-liquid interface.    This research addresses both the preparation of ordered, functional   protein films and the development of analytical techniques appropriate to   characterize these films.  The successful development of a general   methodology to self-organize proteins into oriented two-dimensional   arrays would be highly useful for biotechnological applications.  Also,   this research should give rise to a clearer understanding of   relationships between the structure of hydrated protein films and their   macroscopic properties which should aid in protein film design and   applications.",
