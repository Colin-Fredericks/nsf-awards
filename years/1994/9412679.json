 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412679  Brooks    Hermit crabs possess a soft, coiled abdomen which allows the  occupancy of vacated snail shells. Because of crab growth and  shell degradation by fouling organisms, locating new, larger  shells is a critical component in the natural history of these  crustaceans. Hermit crabs can procure new shells in different  ways. One mechanisms involves intra- and inter-specific shell  exchanges between hermit crabs, which can result in a better  shell fit for one or both participants. Another mechanism  involves location of injured conspecifics. Specifically, several  species of crab respond to factors in the blood or hemolymph of  their respective conspecifics. Hemolymph from congeneric and  other hermit crabs or brachyurans fails to elicit strong  attraction responses. The attractant molecules in hermit crab  hemolymph have only been investigated in one species, Clibanarius  vittatus; they are less than 1000 D in size and likely peptides.  Otherwise, very little is known about the specific chemical  nature of the hemolymph attractant or the ubiquity of this  response i hermit crab species. A third mechanism for  hermit  crabs obtaining new shells is by locating snails that are being  consumed by predators. Proteolytic enzymes produced by  predators  of snails trigger the release of signal peptides from the flesh.  Hermit crabs respond to these peptides by moving towards the  source and waiting for the predator to remove the flesh from the  shell ( or directly remove remaining flesh left behind by the  predator). It is unclear whether these attractant molecules are  similar to those involved in crab responses to hemolymph.  Previous studies have also shown that some hermit crab species  respond preferentially to certain snail odors. How crabs  discriminate between these peptide signals is unknown. In all  three mechanisms of shell procurement, the size and fit of the  crab's present shell can influence its behavior and response.  Perhaps other variables such as presence of symbionts als o  influence hermit crab responses. In this proposal, the following  topics will be investigated: (1) specificity of responses by  hermit crabs to hemoplymph; (2) discrimination of chemical  signals by hermit crabs; (3) whether snail cues and hemolymph  from crabs are chemically similar molecules; and (4) the role of  shell fit, sex, and presence of symbionts in mediating responses  to shell availability cues. The results of this study will be  significant because peptide-mediated responses involving  perireceptors are uncommon. Investigation of this novel system  will provide important knowledge to chemical ecologists, as well  as behavioral and evolutionary biologists.  ***",
