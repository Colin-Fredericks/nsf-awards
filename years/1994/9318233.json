 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318233  Sweeney  This Proposal requests instrumentation to permit the  assembly of a prototype of a new spectrometer, employing  vibrational circular dichroism (VCD); the optics will  incorporate a step-scanning interferometer, based on a  Fourier transform methodology.  The spectrometer will be the  first of its kind and will be capable of increasing the  sensitivity of VCD measurements by 2 to 3 orders of  magnitude.  A unique feature of such an instrument will be  its ability to detect solution structures with lifetimes in  the nanosecond range -- structures normally invisible in NMR  analysis.  This will make it applicable to a broad range of  structure problems involving biological macromolecules.  One  of the major users, Dr. Max Diem, has extensive experience  in VCD, having designed and built his own instrument with  the help of NSF grant funds several years ago.  This  instrument is currently being used for polypeptide and  polynucleotide structural studies in the Chemistry  Department, but its sensitivity limits its use to molecules  in the range of one kilo-Dalton.  Various projects are  described, from laboratories at Hunter and at New York  University, which include investigations of basic aspects of  protein and nucleic acid structures in solution, structures  of metalloproteins, and facets of the initiation complex in  protein synthesis, as well as drug-DNA interactions, and the  design of metal-complexed chemotherapeutic agents.    It is anticipated that the new instrument will attract  additional users from the Sloan-Kettering Institute for  Cancer Research, the Rockefeller University and other  institutions in New York City.",
