The project will have a beneficial effect on our other  upper-division laboratory courses as well, including   instrumental analysis and analytical chemistry.  Students will  perform three sets of experiments using a pulsed nitrogen laser  and attendant equipment:    1) The fluorescence and absorption spectrum of I2, with special  attention paid to the nature of state-selected excited electronic  and vibrational states as well as their lifetimes.    2)   A Raman and IR study of CCl4, wherein students will compare  the vibrational information derived from each type of  spectroscopy and determine bond forces.    3) A dynamic study of the fate of excited states of rare-earth  complexes with the intent of studying the effects of fluorescence  quenching, ligand rigidity, and solvent viscosity on the  lifetimes of these complexes.",
