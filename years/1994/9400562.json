However, only  a small subset of the 4096 possible bp sequences present in DNA are  recognized by restriction enzymes.  In addition, commercially  available restriction enzymes are often of poor quality; the  preparations are impure and the enzyme concentration is low.  This proposal seeks to develop recombinant RNA technology making  use of ribozymes that can cut and join RNA molecules to serve the  functions currently served by restriction enzymes and ligase.   Potentially, 4096 different ribozymes, each with a particular 6  nucleotide (nt) sequence specifically, can be generated.  All of  the ribozymes will be generated and purified by the same method and  each will function in the same reaction buffer.  Thus, it should be  possible produce inexpensive ribozymes of consistently high  quality.  This technology will significantly improve our ability to  generate recombinant DNA molecules.  The recombinant molecules will  be generated at the RNA level using in vitro trans splicing  catalyzed by self splicing group II intron sequences.  These  recombinant RNA molecules will be copied into DNA by reverse  transcriptase and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  to yield the recombinant DNA molecules.  This research will  determine the feasibility of recombinant RNA technology as a  practical tool for nucleic acid manipulation.  Group II introns are capable of splicing together exons in vitro  (Peebles et al 1986).  This reaction is autocatalytic.

Restriction enzymes and ligase  are used to specifically  cleave and join DNA molecules.  This  technology is so widely used that we seldom consider its  limitations.  Restriction enzymes typically recognize and cleave  specific DNA sequences that are 4 to 6 basepairs (bp) in length.   However, only a small subset of the 4096 possible 6 bp sequences  present in DNA are recognized by restriction enzymes.

This proposal seeks to develop recombinant RNA technology making  use of ribozymes (RNA catalysts) that can cut and join RNA  molecules to serve the functions currently served by restriction  enzymes and ligase the enzyme that joins nucleic acid fragments.
