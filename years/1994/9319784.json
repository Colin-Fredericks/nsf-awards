 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319784  Buikstra    Under the direction of Dr. Jane Buikstra, Mr. Christopher Begley  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological fieldwork in the Miskito Coast region of Honduras.  In a three stage process, he will carry out a 100% surface survey  of a well delimited river valley region. In the second phase he  will conduct trial excavation in an attempt to locate buried sites  which are not marked by surface architecture and in the final stage  undertake broad scale excavation in selected areas. He will analyze  the ceramics and other cultural material collected and through  radiocarbon and obsidian hydration dating construct a chronological  sequence for the region. At the conclusion of the project he hopes  to be able to trace the settlement history of the area and  determine how cultural complexity developed.    For over a millennia the Mayan peoples dominated major lowland  areas of Middle America. Eastern Honduras, where Mr. Begley will  work has, until recently, appeared to lie outside the Mayan sphere  of influence and relate more closely to prehistoric cultures of  South America. However recent work by Mr. Begley and others  suggests that such may not be the case. At ca. 1,000 AD a number of  Mayan traits such as monumental architecture appear in the region.  What is particularly interesting is that by this period Mayan  culture was in its decline and Mr. Begley wishes to compare and  relate events in the Eastern Honduras to the Mayan heartland. Many  archaeologists and historians have postulated how core and  periphery areas interact with each other and models proposed vary  widely. Mr. Begley's research will provide data to examine several  of them.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  archaeological data from an important and almost unknown region.  and this will be of interest to many archaeologists. The work will  also increase our understanding of how cultural complexity develops  and assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
