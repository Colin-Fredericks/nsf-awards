 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal considers problems in the area of optimal choice of  observation times for a random process. Bayesian inference and  decision theory provide a general and successful theoretical  framework. Within this framework, the goal of the proposed  research is to seek advances in important application areas. In  particular, goals are: To lay the groundwork for Bayesian dynamic  adjustment of sampling frequency in monitoring a random process  for control and other purposes; to study models for detecting the  presence of conditions that do not manifest naturally; and to  study design problems in which the goal of taking observations is  learning about process parameters.    Acquiring information about random phenomena over time is often  costly and hard. Efficiency can be substantially enhanced by  careful choice of observation times. The proposed research  examines specific applications in the hope of a) providing  solutions to pressing practical problems; b) indicating general  strategies. Examples of applications include timing of screening  exams for the early detection of cancer; designing tests for  improving software reliability; efficient monitoring in  meteorology, seismology and environmental sciences; efficient  implementation of process control and quality control in  manufacturing; regulation of airplane maintenance and others.",
