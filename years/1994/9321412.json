Public land planning, along  with federal housing programs such as government mortgage  insurance, increased the homeownership rate and helped create  middle class American suburbs, but they did not prevent and may  have exacerbated the decline of many inner-city areas.  This  proposal seeks to describe the impact of urban planning efforts  on private mortgage lending practices in inner-cities.    The project will examine inner-city community development lending  by private financial institutions since the urban riots of the  1960s.  It will use six case studies to address two questions: 1)  how can financial institutions change economic and social  conditions in low- and moderate-income urban neighborhoods?, and  2) what are the implications for urban planning, public policy,  and theories about the growth and decline of cities and  neighborhoods?  The PI will review both relevant public documents  and financial and and economic data on specific residential,  commercial real estate and business projects, in addition to  conducting interviews with those involved in urban planning in  these areas.  ***",
