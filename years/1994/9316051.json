 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316051  Bodnar  The porphyry copper deposits are major producers of copper  as well as molybdenum, zinc, lead, gold, silver, arsenic,  selenium and other metals.  It is proposed to investigate  sources of the metals in porphyry copper deposits by  conducting synchrotron XRF (SXRF) analyses of carefully  selected fluid inclusions from 6 ore deposits representing a  wide range in vertical and lateral positions within the  larger magmatic-hydrothermal system.  Preliminary SXRF  analyses of samples from the Red Mountain and Morenci, AZ,  and the Santa Rita, NM., porphyry systems document the  feasibility of conducting nondestructive analyses of  individual fluid inclusions from these deposits.  Most of  the samples to be studied have previously been characterized  through detailed petrography, microthermometric and  geochemical analysis, and their position within the  paragenetic sequence and their relationship to hypogene  copper mineralization are well understood.  Results from  this study will improve our understanding of the genesis of  this important ore deposit type by identifying which fluids  are carrying metals and where these fluids are distributed  vertically and laterally within the magmatic-hydrothermal  system.",
