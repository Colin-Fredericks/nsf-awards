 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416041  Pickard  An abundant mechanosensory calcium channel appears able not only to  detect mechanical stimuli such as those that initiate gravitropism  but also to detect thermal, electrical, and various chemical  stimuli.  Because it responds to multimodal input with second-  messenger output, the channel system seems likely to be an  integrator that can engage in feedbacks with many other systems of  the cell - and feedback is the hallmark of regulation.  It is  hypothesized that the mechanical tension required for channel  activation is likely transmitted from the relatively rigid cell  wall to the plasma membrane system via linkage or adhesion sites  which have mechanical connections to the cytoskeleton.  Thus,  functionally, leverage exerted against any given adhesion site will  tend to control channels within a surrounding domain.    Reactions initiated by passage of calcium ions through the  mechanosensory channels could presumably be more effectively  regulated if channels within such a domain were somewhat clustered  and if appropriate receptors, kinases, porters, pumps, and some key  cytoskeletal anchoring sites were in turn clustered about them.   Such arrangements appear likely to play important roles in adapting  plant response to environmental signals and stresses and in  directing cellular growth and differentiation.    Newly emergent capabilities of electronic optical microscopy are  well suited for resolving the spatial distributions of many of  these cytoskeletal and regulatory molecules in living cells, and  for following temporospatial changes in calcium levels and  cytoskeletal geometry during challenge by mechanical, thermal,  electrical, and chemical stimuli.  Moreover, patch clamp technology  can be applied in special ways permitting electrical resolution of  the cascades and feedbacks these stimuli initiate.  Using  representative cells from onion (a monocot) and tobacco (a dicot),  it is proposed to employ these two complementary technologies to  examine how ar chitectural arrangements/rearrangements of  macromolecules and ionic fluxes help plant cells react  appropriately to the diverse stimuli recognized by mechanosensory  calcium channels.  ***",
