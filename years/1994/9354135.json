It will document the accomplishments made in the last  fifteen years, identify weaknesses, and by learning from past  experiences, develop new and more effective ways by which the  institution's capacity to produce science and engineering  graduates will be considerably enhanced.    The six month planning process will include reviews of all  aspects of the science and engineering programs, starting as far  back as fifteen years ago. The accomplishments made will be  evaluated in relation to the resources available for these  activities. Those factors which will be determined as having  impeded the institution's progress in science and engineering  will also be evaluated and documented.    Following the review process, a plan which is expected to  contribute significantly to the university's future objectives  and goals in science and engineering will be developed. Included  in the plan will be the establishment of new areas of study to  expand or augment existing academic programs, putting a special  emphasis on identified areas of national and global needs. New  approaches of recruiting and retaining students in science and  engineering will be developed. The planning process will also  develop cost effective mechanisms for providing qualified science  and engineering students financial support; obtain new laboratory  and other instructional facilities to improve existing ones and  to expose students to new technology; and enhance student  involvement in undergraduate research both here on campus and at  other sites, including industrial research facilities and  National laboratories.",
