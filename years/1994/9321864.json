The basic election mechanism will be list Proportional  Representation (PR) with both local constituencies and a national  list.  This investigation involves using a combination of hard  and soft data to test a number of specific hypotheses about party  strategies and voter choices in this important election - -  hypotheses with general implication for the study of the  influence of electoral systems on racial and ethnic conflict.    An investigator will spend two and one half months in South  Africa observing the campaigning in this critical election and  gathering an archive of campaign material and a data base about  candidates.  The investigator will remain for several weeks after  the election to conduct additional interviews of participants  (both winners and losers) and of academic and journalistic  sources and to collect a complete data set of election outcomes  at the magisterial district (precinct equivalent) level and data  sets from as many public opinion polls as are available.  These  data will also be used to generate simulations of the likely  electoral consequences had alternative electoral systems been  used.  ***",
