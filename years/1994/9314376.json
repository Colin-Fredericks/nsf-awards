It has  been recognized that by utilizing the semantics of complex objects,  transaction models, and correctness requirements during management  and processing of such activities it is possible to achieve better  performance and functionality.  This leads to the notion of  semantics-based transaction processing.    Our prior work with the ACTA framework has helped us understand and  analyze the basic concepts underlying extended transactions and  relaxed correctness criteria.  Building upon this foundation we  plan to investigate the pragmatic considerations related to  semantics based transaction processing:    The lack of comparative performance evaluation of extended  transaction models correctness criteria prompts us to conduct and  empirical evaluation of their performance.    The need to provide programming language support for designing  extended transaction models and for expressing a desired  correctness criterion motivates us to develop flexible language  primitives that allow a designer to express different transaction  models and correctness criteria.    Even where extensions to the traditional approach are required, it  may still be feasible to use some of the standard transaction  concepts and implementation mechanisms to develop the underlying  system support.  So we plan to investigate synthesis-base  implementation approaches that can benefit from established  mechanisms and concepts.    The need for extended transactions and relaxed correctness criteria  emerges from the demands of applications, such as CAD/CAM, software  development environments, object-oriented databases, and  distributed operating systems.  By focusing on the practical issues  in providing transaction support for such application work pr oposed  here will produce results that will those information-intensive  application areas.",
