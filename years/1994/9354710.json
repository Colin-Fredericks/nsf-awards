 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354710  Nakmura  In this decade, career opportunities in the environmental  sciences will outpace those in many other disciplines. However,  women and minorities are poorly represented in the ranks of  environmental scientists. California State University, Los  Angeles (CSLA) has a student body over 37% Hispanic, 10% Black,  and 29% Asian. Entering students have little knowledge of  environmental careers. This curriculum revision project will  magnify student interest in environmental sciences and give  undergraduates the necessary knowledge, skills and experiences  to become environmental scientists. Through this project,  course \"modules\" will be developed that fit the environmental  themes of aquatic pollution, atmospheric change or land use.  Under the aquatic pollution theme, a biology class might  collect marine fish specimens from sewage outfalls and look for  lesions and tumors. A chemistry class would measure the  concentrations of DDT in fish from contaminated and  uncontaminated sites. A writing course would use the shared  data to draft an environmental impact statement. Integrated  modules will give students hands-on experience with a local  problem, use of critical thinking skills and practice in report  writing from multidisciplinary data.",
