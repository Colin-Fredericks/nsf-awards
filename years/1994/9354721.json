 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354721  Karcher         We propose a series of investigative laboratories using transgenic  plants for the introductory biology curriculum. Plant biology is  frequently an area that is neglected in the teaching of biological  sciences, yet plants display unique characteristics in their  developmental and physiological processes that set them apart from  their animal and microbial counterparts. The transgenic plants that  we shall develop for these laboratories contain an uidA (gusA)  reporter gene under the control of various promoters that respond  to different environmental or developmental signals. Following  induction by these environmental or developmental signals, the gusA  gene will respond by producing the enzyme B-glucuronidase (GUS).  When plant tissue is stained with the chromogenic compound X-gluc,  those tissues that produce GUS will turn blue. Using investigative  experiments, students will monitor both the physiological response  of plants to these signals, as well as the induction of gene  activity as reflected by GUS activity. Thus, students will be able  to see that physiological and developmental responses correlate  with specific gene activity. The assay is highly visual, safe for  the undergraduate laboratory, easy to conduct, and relatively  inexpensive. In addition, we shall develop a laboratory manual and  a CD-ROM program to be used by students and teachers when  conducting these experiments. We shall test these laboratories  first in selected courses in the Purdue University Department of  Biological Sciences core curriculum. We shall subsequently have  these laboratories tested by colleagues in undergraduate laboratory  courses at other universities. The laboratories will be evaluated  both for efficacy as a teaching tool, and for ease in preparation  and presentation by the laboratory instructors. Finally, we shall  aid in the distribution of the laboratory material to other  colleges and universities.  ***y",
