The  following tasks are undertaken; (1) develop a SINC ODE-IVP   (sequential  and/or parallel) program package for solving ordinary   differential equation  initial value problems, (2) develop a (sequential and/or   parallel) program  package to evaluate multidimensional convolution integrals,   (3) write a  program package which uses the Maple program to reduce a   differential or integral equation to a system of algebraic   equations, based  on SINC derivative and/or SINC convolution collocation, (4)   write program  packages, based on SINC derivative and/or SINC convolution   collocation, to  solve problems which are important for ongoing research at  the University of Utah (the forward problem Maxwell   equations,  with variable permeability and permittivity, but with   conductivity; the solution, based on SINC convolution   collocation, of  the integral equation formulation of a scalar conservation   law problem  in two and three dimensions), and (5) comparison studies of   complexity and stability of SINC and classical methods,   especially in areas  in which one can expect SINC methods to have advantages over   methods, such as for problems with singularities, problems   over unbounded  regions, boundary layer problems, stiff problems, and   intensive problems such as the solution of the above cited   equations.",
