 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318952  Stone     This project supports the historical ecological research of  several anthropologists studying how two peasant farming  populations exploited a previously unsettled land area of  Nigeria. Using images from remote satellites to document changes  in land use, maps, censuses, and detailed ethnographic studies of  labor inputs to farming by peasant households, the project will  compare the different historical effects of culturally  distinctive patterns of land exploitation by two groups.  Specific questions to be asked include analyzing the differences  between the two groups in their propensity to intensify  production and to abandon through land exhaustion different  areas.   This research is important because land degradation is a critical  problem in many areas of the world, and the solutions to the  problems are not simply technological.  We must understand local  models of how people use land in order to understand why some  groups maintain and conserve land resources and others exhaust  them.  This sort of intensive comparison will provide new ideas  on how traditional peoples exploit their agricultural land.  ***",
