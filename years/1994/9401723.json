 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401723  Steinhorn       This project focuses upon questions having to do with  o-minimality and its extensions.  Some of these questions relate  to expansions of archetypal o-minimal structures and structures  whose domain has as its order type that of the real numbers.   Other problems concerning o-minimality are intended to develop  the structure of groups definable in o-minimal structures as far  as possible in analogy with locally Euclidean groups.  Among the  variants and extensions of o-minimality to be considered are weak  o-minimality and local o-minimality.  It is hoped that the latter  will provide a suitable framework for developing some model  theory for subanalytic sets.  Another goal of the research is to  begin to develop a general model theory for ordered structures,  patterned after stability theory.       The research described above falls under the heading of  model theory within the branch of mathematics called logic.   Model theory attempts to deal with the properties of familiar  mathematical structures which can be described by a formal  mathematical language such as predicate logic.  The focus of this  project is a class that includes and behaves very much like the  polynomial and algebraic functions based on the real numbers that  are studied in freshman calculus and are used to describe many  phenomena.  There has been much exciting progress during the past  five years, in which model theory has played a central role in  deepening our understanding of familiar mathematical systems of  interest in diverse areas of mathematics outside of logic.  ***",
