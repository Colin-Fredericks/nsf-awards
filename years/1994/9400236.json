Staley of  Carnegie-Mellon University and Bertil Eliasson of the University of  Umea in Sweden.  The objective of their research is to measure the  electronic conductivities of various organic structural units,  which can be thought of as building blocks for \"organic wires\".    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the  synthesis and preparation of bridged dicyclooctatetraenes  compounds.  This is complemented by Swedish expertise in NMR  spectroscopy.  In the proposed project, the U.S. group will prepare  the compounds using advanced NMR techniques such as triple  resonance. Then Carnegie-Mellon graduate students will perform  joint experiments with the Swedish group using a state-of-the-art  high-field NMR spectrometer located at the University of Umea.    The results of this study will be relevant to a number of active  research areas, including electron transfer, conducting polymers,  and molecular electronics.  ***",
