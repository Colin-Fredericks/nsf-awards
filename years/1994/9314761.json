The researchers intend to work on theoretical aspects of  commutative algebra and applied links to combinatorics and  computational algebra.  More specifically, the project will focus  on studying graded rings associated to ideals of combinatorial  interest, Gorenstein algebras, the Cohen-Macaulayness of certain  toric varieties and the role they may play in the theory of Grobner  bases.    Both investigators are interested in central questions in  commutative algebra, particularly the aim of finding the solution  of, and detecting Cohen-Macaulay structure in, systems of  polynomial equations in a large number of indeterminates. The  investigators intend to carry out this research through e-mail and  telephone contact, by attendance to meetings and through a program  of regular visits that will involve graduate students and their  collaborators in other countries.  ***",
