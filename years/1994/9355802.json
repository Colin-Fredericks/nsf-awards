The core of the exhibit  kiosk, with related career graphics surrounds, is SET/QUEST, an  interactive multimedia program for both Macintosh and PC/Windows  using CD-Rom as the full motion video source.  Teens and preteens  will enter an interactive exploration of thirty careers with first  person video profiles of people in science and engineering;  animated/reality video simulations of a work experience in these  fields, decision screens, and a database of over 200 more science  and math-based professions.  The documentary profiles, database,  and a personal interest career match component will also be  developed in alternative media formats (video, audio, print) for  broad distribution to community and youth education networks,  schools, and libraries.  Specific emphasis in this project is being  placed on reaching and attracting female, minority, and disabled  youth.         A parent outreach component has been developed and will be  implemented by the Directorate of Education & Human Resources  Programs of AAAS.  The concept of the parent effort is to work  directly with and through the national offices of four major  national organizations with different institutional community roots  -- Science Museums, Public Libraries, Schools, and Community Based  Organizations -- to involve parents and families with SET Project  materials and to provide them with information with which they can  foster their children's pursuit of science and math education and  careers in these fields.  Initial efforts will be conducted in 18  cities.         The project is a collaborative endeavor among three  organizations:  The Educationa l Film Center which will be  responsible for management and development/production of the  software and documentary video profiles; The New York Hall of  Science which will be responsible for the exhibit kiosk and  graphics, will design and develop the student workbook and user  installation print, will serve as the principal test site for the  exhibit, and will advise on software, interactive multimedia  design, and installation options; and COMAP which will be  responsible for direct involvement of the Advisory Board, for  selecting and hiring content consultants, for assuring the accuracy  of the science and math content, for formative and summative  evaluation, and for developing and preparing community leader and  school users guides for publication.  Stephen Rabin, President of  EFC, will serve as PI for the project.",
