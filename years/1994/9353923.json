Participants in this three-  week long, summer workshop will carry out up to six experiments  based on recent Nobel prize-winning work: 1987 Nobel Prize for  High Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the  Scanning Tunneling Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear  Reactions and Nucleosynthesis; The 1981 Nobel Prizes for  Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear Optics, and Laser  Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum Nature  of Solids.  The Nobel Experiments Workshop will offer  participants \"hands-on\" laboratory experience using up-to-date  instrumentation purchased with a recent ILI Grant from the NSF.   Participants will interact daily with local and national  experts on the various topic areas of Modern Physics, and work  to develop instructional materials for teaching the physics  concepts to science students.  Continued contact with the  participants will be maintained through a newsletter and  electronic mail.  The intellectual stimulation and personal  involvement experienced by the participants will help them to  relay the excitement of science to students at their home  institutions.  ***",
