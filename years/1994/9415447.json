It is focussed on recent advances in understanding the  fundamentals of the resistance of metals and alloys to aqueous  corrosion.  Individual sessions are concerned with: in-situ studies  of passive oxide films; structure and properties of passive oxides;  location and dissolution kinetics of active surface sites;  initiation and chemistry of localized corrosion; dissolution  mechanisms of metal alloys; corrosion of light metal alloys;  research/industry interactions; and atmospheric corrosion.    The emphasis of the conference is in areas of corrosion where  significant progress has recently been made and where new  approaches are being studied.  The speakers have been chosen  because of their unique knowledge and research.  Where appropriate  younger scientists have been chosen as speakers (half the speakers  fall within this category).  The speakers are from laboratories in  nine countries: eleven are from the USA, two from the UK, and one  from France, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, and  Switzerland.  This broad representation is intended to provide an  exposure to new studies not otherwise presented as US conferences.  %%%  A key to prolonging the life of components in the infrastructure is  understanding and controlling the processes of degradation through  corrosion.  This conference addressees many aspects of this  subject.  ***",
