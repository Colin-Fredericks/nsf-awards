 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an  award  under the  Grants  for  Improving  Doctoral  Dissertation Research program.  It is a  study  of  the influence of developed countries on the establishment of  land   conservation   areas  and  policies   in   developing  countries.   The  research  will  be  conducted  through   a  combination of quantitative analysis of cross-national  data  on land conservation schemes and intensive analysis of three  case   study  countries:  Costa  Rica,  Kenya,  and  Brazil.  Interviews with key players in these countries as well as in  organizations based in the developed world will  be  carried  out  to  try  to  understand the sources  of  variations  in  willingness to establish land conservation areas.        Problems  of sustainable development in the developing  world  have  serious consequences for all of  humanity.   In  recent  years governments and organizations in the developed  world  have  tried  to  foster  sustainable  development  in  various  ways,  such  as  by encouraging  land  conservation  projects  in  the  developing world.  Yet  we  have  a  poor  understanding  of  what  causes some  countries  to  respond  favorably to such proposals and others to reject them.  This  project, by examining responses to land conservation appeals  around  the  world as well as in three case study countries,  will promote understanding of this vital topic.  In addition  to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this  award  will materially assist a highly promising student  in  completing  research  for the Ph.D. dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and  the thorough training of the next generation of  social  scientists.  This project will also contribute to the  Human  Dimensions of Global Change research initiative.",
