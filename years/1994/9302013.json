 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302013  Newell       The investigator and his colleagues undertake projects aimed  at gaining a better understanding of turbulence in its many  manifestations and at obtaining macroscopic descriptions for  patterns that serve to simplify and unify the behavior of classes  of pattern forming systems in fluids and optics seemingly  unrelated at the microscopic level.  In the turbulence studies,  the aim is to understand the origins of short-lived coherent  structures and their role in causing intermittent and  non-Kolmogorov-like behavior.  It is important first to gain a  clear picture of weak turbulence theories, the reasons for more  than one Kolmogorov finite flux solution, and to understand the  roles that these solutions play in producing inverse cascades and  the roles that inverse cascades may play in originating collapse  structures.  The principal aim of the studies on pattern  formation  is to extend the previous far-from-onset theories to include a  description of pattern behavior when the local wavenumber is  driven outside of a stability band known as the Busse balloon.   The results of the research so far have led to a properly  regularized theory of patterns that can handle pattern  singularities such as dislocations and disclinations.  Moreover,  the latest work suggests that all point defects of almost  periodic  patterns are composed of the two elementary disclinations.       Patterns of an almost periodic nature arise all over the  place.  One sees them in the sand ripples under an advancing or  receding tide, in geological formations, on the coats of animals,  as fingerprints.  They occur in systems driven far from  equilibrium by some external stress that acts to destabilize  spatially and temporally uniform states and preferentially  amplify  certain shapes and configurations.  Geometrical symmetries, such  as rotation in the plane, lead to degeneracies (the wavelength of  a periodic pattern may be chosen but the direction remains  undetermined) and the competition betwee n the various amplified  states leads to patterns that often consist of a mosaic of almost  periodic patches separated by grain boundaries, domain walls and  point defects.  The goal of this research is to build a  macroscopic field theory for patterns that will unify and  simplify  the behavior of systems seemingly unrelated at the microscopic  level and that can capture both the smooth (field) and singular  (particle) components of the pattern.",
