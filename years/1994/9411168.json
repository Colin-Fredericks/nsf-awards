Nepal, like many developing  countries, has arrived at a juncture where mounting peasant  impoverishment has come face to face with growing ecological  degradation.  This interface reveals that poverty is not just a  socioeconomic issue; it is also an ecological issue with wide-  ranging ramifications.  As in many other agrarian societies,  there is a struggle between peasants' day-to-day survival, which  includes land access, on one side and the state's dominant  interests and environmental sustainability, which leads to  land/resource control, on the other.  Two basic questions emerge  from this growing ecopolitical struggle:  why does the struggle  occur and how does it affect the sustainability of what can be  termed \"peasant ecology\" in which peasants are engaged in direct  production relationships with nature.  Their socioeconomic  viability therefore is intrinsically intertwined with the  ecological sustainability of their environment.  Land  encroachment is thus seen as a form of peasant (social) movement  and/or a form of everyday resistance against the state and its  land control policy.  Guided by this general conceptualization,  this study will investigate three interrelated issues:  (1) the  evolution of human-environment relations in agrarian Nepal,  focusing on the social and political configuration of peasant  ecology, (2) the political ecology of land encroachment, i.e. the  social and ecopolitical conflicts over land in te Tarai, and (3)  the implications of these conflicts for peasants' socioeconomic  viability and environmental sustainability.  The study will  involve extensive research in Nepal relying on both the  collection of formal materials relating to land use policy and  actual land use and on interviews with peasants and officials in  the region.       This research will contribute to adva ncing a coherent  theoretical political ecology framework, one that can be used to  investigate similar struggles unfolding in various local and  regional contexts throughout the third world.  As such it will  also add new insights relevant to the formation of policies for  dealing with the growing tension between the protection of  critical environments and the social and economic survival of  local populations who are dependent on those environments.",
