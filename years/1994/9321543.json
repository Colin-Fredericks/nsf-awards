 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, funded by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry   Program, treats two topics in the theory of state-to-state reaction   dynamics.  First, hydrogen atom exchange in heavy-light-heavy-atom   systems is treated by quantum or semi-classical (phase space) dynamics.    Second, scattering resonances will be computed by Fourier analysis of   high energy quantum wavepackets evolving in the transition state region.    A complex gas phase reaction consists of many elementary steps such as   O+HCl = OH+Cl occurring sequentially or in parallel. The first research   topic is the development of mathematical methods for predicting the rate   of such an elementary reaction, in particular, one involving the transfer   of a hydrogen atom from one heavy atom to another.  The theory treats the   dependence of the reaction rate upon the initial relative translational   energy of the reactants and the vibrational and rotational quantum states   of the reactants and products.  In the course of a chemical reaction the   molecular system usually passes through a high energy configuration known   as the transition state.  The second research topic attempts to follow   the behavior of a molecular system which starts out in the transition   state region.  One way to prepare molecules in this initial condition in   the laboratory is to first generate a stable negative complex ion having   (approximately) the appropriate geometry, and then suddenly remove one   electron by laser excitation (photodetachment).  One  goal of this   research project is to develop the theory of these photodetachment   experiments.",
