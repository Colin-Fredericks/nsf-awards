 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410565    Anderson    Animals such as sea anemones, jellyfish (Phylum Cnidaria)  and flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes) are modern-day  representatives of organisms in which the nervous system, as  we know it, first evolved.  As such, they present us with a  window into the evolution of the early nervous system and of  the various molecules that enable nervous systems to  function as they do.  An evolutionary approach to  neurobiological questions has an added benefit inasmuch as  it is possible to identify groups of relatively closely  related animals that differ subtly in some aspect of their  neurobiology.  A case in point concerns the action of  tetrodotoxin (TTX) a toxin that blocks sodium channels  extremely specifically and with high affinity.  Tetrodotoxin  blocks sodium currents in flatworms and higher animals, but  is completely ineffective in jellyfish.  Thus one might ask,  what are the structural differences between the flatworm and  jellyfish sodium channels that account for this differential  sensitivity.  Armed with this information, it should be  relatively easy to identify the equivalent site on mammalian  sodium channels thereby enabling the development of new  classes of highly specific, and highly potent anesthetics  and channel blockers that target this hitherto unexploited  site on this very important class of proteins.    The overall aim of the proposed work is to take advantage of  this difference in the TTX sensitivity of flatworm and  cnidarian sodium channels to identify the requirements for  TTX binding to sodium channels.  In addition to using  molecular cloning techniques to determine the primary  structure of sodium channels from a sea anemone, and a  flatworm, the PI will use conventional lipid analysis and  protein biochemical techniques to determine the lipid  environment of the native sodium channels in these groups,  and the types of sugar moieties linked to these proteins.  The PI will compare these data with equivalent data  previously obtained from a jell yfish.",
