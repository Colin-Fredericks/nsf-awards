 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318203  Stetson         Research comparing the importance of the pituitary hormone  prolactin (PRL) in reproduction and pledge development in golden  hamsters, Siberian hamsters and collard lemmings will be  initiated in the year covered by this award. These species show  dramatically different physiological changes in reproduction and  pelage development on a seasonal basis. While Siberian hamsters  and lemmings molt to a white pelage during the winter (short day  response), golden hamsters do not. While both hamster species are  inhibited reproductively by short days, lemmings continue to  breed vigorously, despite the winter morphology induced by  these environmental conditions. In all three species, serum PRL  levels are high under long days and low under short days. Since  PRL influences both reproductive status and pelage  characteristics, we hypothesize that the importance of PRL in  these processes will differ in our 3 experimental species. Such  differences may indicate specific adaptive divergences in the  function of PRL; a divergence driven by the evolution of species  in environments with dramatically differing selective pressures.  ***",
