A common observation is that the fitness of a genotype in one environment is only weakly predictive of its fitness in others.  This situation, termed genotype-environment interaction, is often interpreted to mean that there is a \"trade-off\", so that the natural selection cannot produce a genotype with high fitness in each set of environments.  An alternative hypothesis that has received little attention is that individuals carry deleterious mutations that vary in the strength of their effects in different environments.  The latter hypothesis has very different implications from the trade-off hypothesis for such issues as why ecological specialization evolves, the factors maintaining genetic variations in populations, and how new species form.  The mutation hypothesis will be investigated using the fruit fly Drosophila melangaster.   Genotype-environment interaction is important in animal and plant breeding, because it means that lines that perform well under one set of conditions will not necessarily perform well under other conditions: for example, a cattle breed that does well in Texas climate may not do so well in Minnesota.  The full practical implications of genotype-environment interaction, however, depend on which of the above two hypotheses better accounts for it.  Under the trade-off hypothesis, large improvements in performance in any one environment should be possible, but only at the expense of performance of others .  Under the mutation hypothesis, in contrast, it should be possible to create lines that perform relatively well in a range of environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         v       ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !         !         !
