 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the renovation of aging chemistry research facilities on the  Camden Campus of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, the only public institution in the  southern part of the state. The Chemistry Department is located in the Science Building,  constructed in 1962, which has never been renovated.  The project encompasses repairs to the  ventilation, electrical and telecommunication systems, and modernizing research space and  support facilities to sustain research efforts in the Materials Science component of the Chemistry  Department.  The existing ventilation system, installed in 1964, will be upgraded and new fume  hoods installed, to support increased research activities.  Demands on electrical power  requirements are increasing dramatically as more instruments are being added to serve faculty in  conducting investigative studies, thus the existing power supply to all research labs will be  upgraded and new circuits will be installed.  Computer telecommunication wiring within  research space will be replaced by a system able to accommodate the immense volume of high  speed requirements of data acquisition devices for the research group.    Since the campus is located in area that has experienced rapid population growth, and has a large  concentration of chemical and pharmaceutical industries,  the department has decided to meet the  demands for a graduate chemistry program.  This project will enable the department to offer  facilities crucial for graduate study.  The improved facilities will also build upon the strengths of  continued excellence in the undergraduate program that serves  a large percentage of women and  minority students from the inner city and the outlying suburbs of Camden.",
