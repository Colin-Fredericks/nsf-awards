 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412117  Howe   The purpose of this research is to experimentally test hypotheses derived from a census and five-year recensus of >7500 mapped woody perennials of 26 species in Joshua Tree National Monument. Most of these species show strong intraspecific and interspecific aggregation, and herbivory of unknown effect. Experimental results will be interpreted in light of a 10-year re-census, scheduled for March 1994.    Using exclosures around members of the dominant woody perennial and in open areas nearby, we propose to distinguish effects of intra- and interspecific competition, granivory, herbivory, desiccation, and facilitation in establishment, growth, and/or mortality of new seedlings over two years, and in growth and mortality of seedlings, and juveniles already present. Using protected and unprotected transplants of seedlings, we expect to test effects of competition and facilitation of controlled samples of a long-lived perennial that is not browsed by vertebrate herbivores, a short-lived perennial that is heavily browsed by jackrabbits, against a standard seedlings of the dominant shrub, which suffer moderate to heavy vertebrate herbivory. Exclosures and transplants will distinguish processes that account for extensive bare ground and aggregated spatial dispersions of key woody perennials common at this site.   %%%  This dissertation research provides a nice integrate map data from permanent plots with field experiments to assess some of the important determinants of spatial pattern and plant associations in a desert community.",
