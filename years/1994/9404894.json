In this  project, the regulation and assembly of membrane skeletal  proteins are addressed in the model unicell, Euglena, in  which whole cell form, shape changes, surface growth and  possibly surface motility can all be assigned to a  peripheral membrane skeleton.  Two subprojects are outlined  that consider the general problems of regulation and  assembly of this membrane skeletal complex.  1.  The key  protein IP39 binds skeletal proteins to the membrane and is  both phosphorylated and has protein kinase activity.  The  substrates for IP39 and the protein kinases that  phosphorylate IP39 will be identified and characterized  biochemically.  Genomic clones that encode IP39 will be  sequenced to identify potential upstream regulatory motifs,  and potential splicing sites identified by comparison with  cDNA clones.   Full length cDNAs will be developed from the  partial cDNA clones by PCR using degenerate primers derived  from direct protein sequencing and from internal primers  determined from the cDNA sequence.  The effects of  endogenous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on IP39  will be tested with direct membrane binding assays and with  gel overlays.  Sites of phosphorylation of IP39 will be  determined by amino acid analysis and from signature  sequences determined from the cDNAs .. Endogenous protein  kinases that phosphorylate IP39 will also be identified by  selective enrichment of surface fractions.  2. The  interactions and functions of three stable microtubules  associated with the membrane skeleton will be addressed by  assaying for posttranslational modification of tubulin using  both an epitope library and by specific incorporation of  labeled precursors such as acetate.  Efforts to identify  proteins that bind both to the microtubules and to IP39 will  also be carried out in order to test the hypo thesis that  microtubules may direct the membrane distribution of IP39.  From these studies we anticipate that the mechanisms for the  formation of a membrane skeleton, the generation of cell  form and the creation of regional surface domains will be  substantially clarified.  %%%  The single-celled organism, Euglena gracilis, has a defined  cell shape, with distinctly differentiated regions at  various parts of the cell surface, which is maintained by a  structural array at the cell membrane, called the membrane  skeleton, that confers a semi-rigidity to the membrane.  This laboratory has been investigating the detailed  biochemical structure of this complex structural array, in  order to understand its organization and function.  The  lessons learned from Euglena about maintenance of cell shape  and maintenance of distinct specific surface domains can  shed light on how cell shape and regional surface domains  are maintained in a wide variety of cell types, ranging from  other protozoa (both harmless, free-living species and  pathogenic, parasitic ones) to cells in animal tissues.  This research will contribute fundamental information to the  knowledge base of cell biology about how cells are  organized.  ***",
