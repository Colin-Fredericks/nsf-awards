 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317062  Hoopes       Although it is known that the concentration of the general  transcription factors are important to gene expression in vivo,  very little is known about the expression of the yeast SUA7 gene,  which codes for the TFIIB protein of yeast.  Using gene fusions  and primer extension assays to assess promoter activity, we will  examine the regulation of SUA7 under a variety of conditions.   This study promises to provide interesting information both on  eukaryotic promoter structure and on the effect of the general  transcription factors on promoter activity.  %%%  Cellular regulation often involves the control of RNA synthesis  from the DNA template.  This type of regulation is essential to  maintaining the normal cell state, and understanding gene  regulation is important to advances in both medical science and  biotechnology.  Although we know much about the signals in the  DNA that control gene expression, we know less about the  regulation of the expression of the molecules (transcription  factors) that interact with the DNA.  Using yeast as an  experimental system, I propose to examine the regulation of a  particular transcription factor required for gene expression.   This research will contribute to our understanding of mechanisms  of gene regulation in higher organisms.  ***",
