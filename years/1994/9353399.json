 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353399  Clark    This is a three year collaboration between Brown University's  Institute for Secondary Education, the Roger Williams Park Zoo, and  the middle schools in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.   The emphasis of the project is to have science teachers doing  hands-on investigative laboratory work with university scientists  at the Zoo.  Thirty teachers each year will learn research  techniques as they work at the zoo, exploring themes such as  Diversity and Anthropology, Reproduction and Conservation and  Behavior-Morphology and Environmental Conditions.  Workshops will  include sessions on teaching for collaborative learning, using  essential questions to frame a curriculum, stressing inquiry-based  learning and using technology.  The project staff will observe and  provide support during the academic year.  The project is designed  to provide an opportunity for science middle school teachers to  experience the Zoo as a living laboratory and to encourage teachers  to use innovative methods which will enhance science education in  the classroom.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is  a leadership project designed to prepare middle school science  teachers to collaborate with a local zoo in developing an  innovative and research-based science program for students.  It  will also further the goals of Rhode Island's SSI project.    The cost-sharing amount is 41% of the amount requested from NSF.   ***",
