 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407084  Rankin-Hill     This project (which is collaborative with 9407124, Bates)  supports three cultural anthropologists studying how Puerto Rican  sufferers from chronic, incurable arthritis cope with their pain  and disability.  The researchers will identify a group of about  65 sufferers from arthritis and in a series of intensive  interviews will study how they cope with and manage their  diseases.  This information will be compared with the studies of  how Anglo populations cope with chronic disease.  Methods include  intensive life history interviews, examination of patient  records, and the administration of standardized questionnaires  dealing with pain management, coping strategies, and  psychological adjustment to chronic illness (the Arthritis Impact  Measurement Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Satisfaction With  Life Scale, Ethnicity and Pain Questionnaire, and Locus of  Control style.       This project is important because it broadens the model of  adaptation to chronic illness to include ethnic variables.  It  will add to our understanding of the human ability to adapt to  incurable chronic disease by determining what coping strategies,  resources, constraints and other factors in the subjects varied  environments affect their overall level of adjustment.  The  knowledge from this project will be useful to all health care  personnel seeking to develop culturally relevant health care  delivery procedures.  The project also involves the research of  handicapped and minority scientists, and therefore contributes to  the diversity of the active researcher population.",
