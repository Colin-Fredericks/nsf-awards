 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322152  Garey    This award will provide funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at Duquesne University to  establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site involving 8 students per year for 3  years.  Students from over 100 small regional colleges who might be reluctant to attend an REU site  at a larger university will be recruited.  Eight of the most enthusiastic, research-active faculty have  been selected to participate in the program.  Projects will be selected from the realm of the professor's  research and of sufficient quality and depth to be true learning experiences that will ask novel questions  and properly introduce students to research.  The students will spend ten weeks at Duquesne University  working in research laboratories in direct contact with faculty and other students.  Weekly  departmental-wide meetings will take place during the ten week program to exchange ideas about  scientific, philosophical, and practical aspects of research and careers in research.  These meetings will  also be used as peer review vehicles to ensure appropriate depth and scientific content of the students'  research projects.  The program will culminate in a poster session modeled after similar sessions  common in scientific meetings.  The effectiveness of the program will be monitored by participant  evaluations and long term monitoring of the students careers.  ***",
