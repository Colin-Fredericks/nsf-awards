 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312947  Dupuis    Research will be carried out to develop a fundamental  understanding of conventional and low temperature metalorganic  chemical vapor epitaxial materials growth and novel device  processing techniques for wide-bandgap III-V compound  semiconductors in the system consisting of the AlGaInN quaternary  and related ternary and binary alloys.  Lattice-matched and  intentionally lattice-mismatched heteroepitaxial heterostructures  will be grown in this materials system using both low-pressure  metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, and low-temperature  epitaxial growth by flow-rate modulation.  In addition, this  program will study the fundamental structural, electronic, and  optical materials properties, as well as the heterojunction band  alignments of these materials.  %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a  fundamental-understanding of the epitaxial growth, processing,  and properties of wide bandgap semiconductor materials so that  they can be exploited in the realization of a variety of advanced  electronic and photonic devices. This research program is  strongly coupled to direct collaborative efforts with US  optoelectronic industrial research and development groups.  An  important feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications.  ***",
