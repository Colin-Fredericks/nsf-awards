The 1989 ARG0 survey (Haymon/Fornari)  revealed an active hydrothermal field on EPR axis between 9016' and  9054' N  \"Tube Worm BBQ area\" . AdVenture I \"Alvin  diving on the Venture Hydrothermal Fields\"  in April 1991 and  AdVenture II in Feb/Mar'92 noted that eruptions are rapid  one  eruption took place within two weeks (dated in by 210Po/210Pb  diseq.-Rubin) prior to AdVenture II  and hydrothermal vents are  irregularly distributed. The P.I.s surmised that this system has  not yet reached steady-state.  They propose to go back to this area  with Alvin in an effort to monitor the evolution of the  volcanic-hydrothermal system. The work will include CCD imaging,  CTD measurements of water column and plume, biological activity  monitoring, volcanic rock sampling,on EPR axis between 9016' and  9054' N. Scientific Justification---The P.I.s feel that by         documenting the changes in volcanic and hydrothermal activities  they will be able to obtain broad constraints over the period  during which the system goes steady-state, and mesurement of fluxes  during-steady state would give a better handle on the hydrothermal  input into the chemical composition of sea-water. They will also  know more about how these systems evolve through time.",
