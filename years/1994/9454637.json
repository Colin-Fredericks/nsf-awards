Consortium members are:  Brevard Community College, FL;  Cuyahoga Community College, OH; Foothill College, CA; John C.  Calhoun College, AL; Pasadena City College, CA; Pearl River  College, MS; Prince George's Community college, MD; Thomas Nelson  Community College, VA; and Houston, TX - based Consortium Members  San Jacinto Community College, College of the Mainland, Alvin  College, and Lee College. These twelve community colleges are  linked through their involvement with, and long-term specialized  instructional support for nine NASA Field Centers.  Linkages are  established with area universities and school systems to maximize  articulation of technological education programs.The Center is  developing plans to establish a national clearinghouse for  curricular and faculty development programs as well as educational  media supporting these programs to infuse science and mathematics  into technological education programs.  Curriculum design, faculty  enhancement, outreach services, media development and product  dissemination activities are being designed to enhance the quality  of advanced technological education programs at community colleges  and technical institutions nationwide.  An advanced national  telecommunications and bulletin board delivery system is being  established to facilitate cost-effective sharing of information  among faculty on a national basis, and to support creative models  for distance learning.",
