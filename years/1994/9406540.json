Photosynthetic cells must be able to  accurately sort proteins between mitochondria and  chloroplasts.  Targeting specificity is mediated by transit  peptides which are present on cytosolic precursors and  removed during or shortly after import into the organelle.  Proteins that interact with the transit peptide during the  import process presumably discriminate between chloroplast  and mitochondrial precursors.  This project seeks to apply  the molecular and classical genetics of Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii to questions concening chloroplast protein  import.  Stable nuclear mutants that are non-photosynthetic  because they lack plastocyanin or the gamma-subunit of the  chloroplast ATPase (CF1-gamma) have been isolated and can be  transformed to photosynthetic competence using the  corresponding wild-type structural gene.  To define the  region of the transit peptide that is required for  chloroplast protein import in Chlamydomonas, the putative  import domain will be subject to extensive deletion and site  specific mutagenesis.  The mutated gene will be reintroduced  into the corresponding null mutant to determine whether it  is able to complement the non-photosynthetic phenotype.  The  same mutations will be tested in a homologous in vitro  chloroplast protein import assay.  The results should give a  detailed picture of the features of the transit peptide that  are required for in vivo and in vitro import.  A genetic  selection will then be set up to identify extragenic  supressors that are able to compensate for the transit  peptide mutation.  To minimize the number of revertants and  transit peptide-linked suppressor mutations that are  recovered, suppressors will be isolated using strains that  carry two copies of the specfiic transit peptide mutation,  one linked to the plastocyanin gene, the other linked to the  CF1-gamma gene.  Dep ending on the starting strain,  accumulation of one or both proteins will be required to  restore photosynthesis.  In either case, accumulation of  both gene products will be screened by immunoblot analysis.  Suppressors that are unlinked to the original transit  peptides will be of most interest since they may identify  components of the protein import pathway that interact with  the transit peptide.  Chloroplasts will be prepared from  candidate suppressors and tested in vitro for their ability  to import precursors with the corresponding transit peptide  mutation.  The cloning of genes that are altered in such  suppressor strains should define proteins that interact with  the transit peptide during import.  This work will provide  insight into the requirements for transit peptide function  and will identify proteins that interact with the transit  peptide during chloroplast import.  %%%  With few exceptions, life on earth is completely dependent  on photosynthesis, the process whereby light energy from  the sun is used to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide plus  water into sugar and oxygen.  Chloroplasts are the  subcellular site of photosynthesis in eukaryotic plants,  and as such are critical to life on earth.  Chloroplasts  are semi-autonomous organelles within the plant cell, in  which the photosynthetic machinery is separated from the  rest of the cytoplasm by a set of two concentrically  arranged cellular membranes.  Since most of the proteins  which comprise the photosynthetic machinery are synthesized  in the cytoplasm, a mechanism is needed to bring those  proteins across these two membranes into the chloroplast.  The mechanism must be selective, since there are other  membrane-bounded organelles in the cell, such as  mitochondria and peroxisomes, which have different  functions, and different protein contents in order to carry  out those functions, and whose proteins are also imported  from the cytosol.  This project represents a very clever  approach to two closely related question s: 1, what is the  \"signal\" on certain proteins which destines those proteins  specifically to the chloroplast?; and 2, what are the  proteins in the chloroplast which are involved in the  selective recognition of that signal and import of  cytosolic proteins destined for the chloroplasts?  If  successful, the project will provide major advances in the  understanding of chloroplast biogenesis and specificity of  subcellular targeting.  The information that will be  obtained has obvious potential utility in agricultural  biotechnology.  ***",
