 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is a chemically-based program to explore the natural products  chemistry and chemical ecology of marine plants and animals.  Chemical studies of new,  bioactive natural products from ascidians, gorgonians and bryozoans will be carried out,  involving the application of new methods in separation science and organic structure  determination.  Also studies to comprehend the regioselective reactivities and skeletal  interrelationships of selected secondary metabolites will be explored.  Working with marine  ecologists studies will be performed to illustrate the possible functions, such as chemical defense,  of secondary metabolites in competitive marine habitats.  The project emphasizes ecologically  relevant testing of pure substances using natural predators in controlled experiments in a natural  marine setting.    With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. William H.  Fenical of the Marine Research Division at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps  Institution of Oceanography.  Professor Fenical will focus his work on exploring the natural  products chemistry and chemical ecology of marine plants and animals.  The project will study  the sources, types and reactivities of molecules produced by marine organisms and will explore  the natural functions of these molecules in the interspecies interactions within marine habitats.   By creating a linkage of chemists and biologists, the program will allow one to understand how  these organic molecules influence the biological composition of tropical marine environments.",
