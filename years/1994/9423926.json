 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423926  Badura    Prolactin, a protein hormone secreted by the anterior  pituitary gland, is involved in a large number of  physiological and behavioral processes in mammals, including  estrus cyclicity, immune system activation, stress, milk  production, and maternal behavior.  While this hormone is  clearly involved in many different physiological systems,  the precise mechanism of action and the ways in which  prolactin secretion is controlled remains to be resolved.  It is difficult to study not only because of its multiple  modes of action but because prolactin surges and chronic  secretions appear to be differently regulated.  Dr. Badura  is using a clever model system to examine the neuroendocrine  regulation of prolactin release.  She is taking advantage of  the fact that prolactin shows a marked annual fluctuation  that corresponds with changes in photoperiod, most likely  daylength.  Dr. Badura will incorporate photoperiodic cues  to examine the factors the underlie the regulation of  prolactin secretion.  She will be concentrating on two  neuropeptides, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and  oxytocin.  These peptides hormones are likely modulatory  factors since they are located in the paraventricular  nucleus of the hypothalamus, a brain region that she has  previously shown to play an important role in the  stimulatory modulation of basal prolactin release.  Using  state-of-the-art neuroanatomical procedures,  Dr. Badura  will identify the sites of action and the relative  contributions of  modulatory factors in the expression of  photoperiodic changes in the neuroendocrine control of this  physiologically relevant hormone.  Dissecting the mechanisms  by which prolactin regulates apparently unrelated  physiological systems will increase our understanding of the  adaptive significance of evolving hormonal systems that  possess multiple targets and functions.  ***",
