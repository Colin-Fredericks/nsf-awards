 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316152  McClure    In solanaceous plants with gametophytic self-incompatibility  (GSI), S-allele pollen recognition and rejection are  controlled by a single genetic locus, the S-locus.  Pollen  is rejected if its single S-allele matches either S-allele  in the pistil.  Information is communicated about the  allelic constitution of the S-locus in the sporophyte and in  the gametophyte.  The products of the S-locus are the  carriers of this information.  The S-locus products  expressed in the pistil comprise a series of allelic  ribonucleases, the S-RNases.  It has been shown that each S-  allele encodes a different S-RNase.  However, it is not  known how these differences lead to S-allele specific  recognition.  No S-allele specific product has yet been  identified in the male gametophyte (i.e., pollen-S).  This  proposal seeks to develop an understanding of the molecular  basis for S-allele specific recognition and rejection.  The  first step will be to develop a system in which S-allele  specific recognition and rejection can be manipulated.  Cloned S-RNases from Nicotiana alata will be used to  introduce new allelic specificity into transgenic plants.  Using the expression system, it will be possible to  manipulate cloned S-RNase sequences in vitro and assess the  effects on pollination behavior in vivo.  The choice of  plant materials for use as transgene recipient is very  important.  The transformation efficiency of N. alata is too  low to generate the necessary number of transformants.  Therefore, transgenes will be introduced into a plant such  as Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and crossed into N. alata or  into a transformable F1 hybrid capable of S-allele specific  pollen rejection.  In either case, the inherent specificity  of the SI reaction provides excellent controls.  Dr. McClure  will look for the introduction of, or modification of, a new  specificity in the transgenic plants.  Identification of the  pollen-S product is a major goal of this proposal.  A  combined genetic and molecul ar biological approach is  proposed.  A large F2 population segregating for two S-  alleles has been generated.  Plants homozygous for a given S-  allele will be pooled.  Using these pooled materials,  subtractive hybridization and differential mRNA display will  be used to identify a putative pollen-S cDNA.  GSI has the  potential to help understand plant cell-cell communication.  To realize its potential, GSI research must move into an  analytical phase.  This proposal aims to accomplish this by  developing a system for direct analysis of the allelic  specificity function of S-RNases, and identifying the  product responsible for allele specific recognition in  pollen.  ***",
