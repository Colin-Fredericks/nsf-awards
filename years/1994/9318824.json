 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program provides  continued support for research on vanadium phosphates by Dr. Jon Zubieta of the Chemistry  Department, Syracuse University.  A variety of synthetic techniques will be used to produce  novel structures containing vanadium oxide and phosphate.  Hydrothermal methods will be used  to produce large polyhedral arrays of these components, and attempts will be made to  incorporate other metals such as Ti, Zr, Mn, Fe, and Mo into the arrays.  Arrays with different  arrangments will be prepared from vanadoarsenates and vanado-organoarsonates.  Polyfunctional  ligands will be used to connect clusters together into nanometer-scale structures.  All types of  arrays will be structurally and magnetically characterized, and tested for their ability to  incorporate organic cations.    The long-term goal of this research is to develop rational sythetic procedures for microporous  materials based on transition metal/oxoanion frameworks.  The synthetic conditions needed for  sythesis of these materials are not well known, but molecular arrays with a great variety of  structural features have been prepared.  Because these compounds are thermally stable, they are  attractive candidates for cataysts and catalyst supports, whose variety of structural forms could  produce catalysts of various selectivities and reactivities.",
