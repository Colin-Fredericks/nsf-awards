Planning activities will focus on development of a strategic plan  and institutional structures for achieving and maintaining  excellence in undergraduate SEM programs. This will include  defining excellence in the context of UTEP's mission and  determining what will be required to achieve excellence in SEM  programs. UTEP will carefully assess the strengths, impediments,  and potentials of undergraduate science, engineering and  mathematics programs at UTEP and identify those program areas and  those institutional and departmental strategies that have the  greatest potential for future improvement.",
