A number  of different explanations for the damage have been proposed,  including problems with welding, the material properties of  the steel, and the general design philosophy and lack of  redundancy and multiple lateral-resisting load paths in the  structural systems.  Coupled with these observations is the  fact that several recent experimental investigations have  highlighted the potential poor performance of large welded  steel connections under inelastic cyclic loading.  One  approach for improving the seismic performance of the types  of steel buildings is to increase the capability of the  structural system to dissipate energy by introducing special  devices for this purpose, and thus decreasing the energy  demands on critical regions of the primary structural  system.    A combined analytical and experimental study focusing on the  benefits of passive energy dissipation for steel frame  structures is undertaken in this project.  Four different  passive energy dissipation systems are investigated.  These  devices are representative of the main classes of passive  devices:  friction, metallic, pure viscous, and  viscoelastic.  Two devices are studied experimentally  (friction and pure viscous), and the results of the testing  are used to develop numerical models of the two types of  devices.  These numerical models are then utilized in  the  analytical study.  Two other types of passive dampers (shape  memory alloy and viscoelastic) are also included in the  study, but not investigated experimentally in the present  project.  Numerical models are developed for these dampers  based on the results of other pervious and current research.    An actual steel building, typical of those that suffered  damage in the Northridge earthquake is identified and used  as the basis of the analytical study.  A set of earthquake  ground motions are chosen, representing service-le vel,  moderate and severe earthquake shaking.  The selected  building is first analyzed in its existing (non-upgraded)  condition.  Upgrade schemes based on each of the four types  of damping devices are designed for the building and their  benefits investigated by a careful comparison of response  parameters.  The performance benefits are assessed by  considering ductility and energy demands on the primary  structural system, and also by evaluating damage to  nonstructural components and contents using appropriate  response parameters. The impact of the upgrade schemes on  the vulnerability of the building to economic loss due to  earthquake shaking is finally assessed.    Passive energy dissipation techniques represent a method for  seismic upgrading of existing structures that offers  performance and economic benefits over conventional  approaches.  This research project is designed to further  develop and refine the methodologies for upgrading using  these techniques.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
