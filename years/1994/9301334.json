 "awd_abstract_narration": "FREW  9301334      Surface-active organic matter produced by marine phytoplankton is  known to reduce the exchange of gases at the air-water interface.  Surfactants have a first-order effect on the gas transfer velocity-  wind speed relationship up to moderate wind speeds and the mean  square wave slope offers a parameterization of transfer velocity Kw  at different wind speeds and surface viscoelastic conditions. The  objective in this continuing research is to further refine this  parameterization for gas exchange in the presence of natural  surfactants and to use surfactants as a tool to examine the role of  small-scale waves and turbulence as agents affecting gas exchange.   New techniques for characterizing 3-dimensional wave spectra and  for measurement of viscoelastic damping will be applied to  measurements of Kw in two circular wind-wave tanks of different  scales.  A range of surface-active compounds, including synthetic  and natural surfactants, which yield films with different elastic  and viscous contributions to the dynamic surface viscoelasticity  will be used to modify the wave field during measurements of Kw and  the three-dimensional wave spectra and gas transfer and to  discriminate between mechanisms involving viscoelastic (marangoni)  damping of either small scale wave or near-surface turbulence.  The  research is relevant to models of upper ocean biogeochemical  processes in which gas exchange is an important component.",
