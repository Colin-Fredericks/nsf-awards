These projects involve VLSI chip design, switch fabric and congestion control device prototyping, theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and experiments on a high-speed ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network testbed.    In the first project, we plan to prototype a 32x32 ATM switch fabric based on our proposed MOBAS (Multicast Output Buffered ATM Switch) architecture in order to demonstrate the capability of growing the prototyped switch to a large switch (e.g., with several hundred input and output ports).  We will design and fabricate two application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips using the advanced CMOS 0.8-micron technology (available from the NSF funded MOSIS).  In the second project, we will first investigate the performance and implementation complexity of several different queue management control schemes that combine the priority cell discarding and the  priority cell departing schemes.  We will then implement one of the queue management schemes and integrate with the ATM switch.  In the third project, we plan to deploy an experimental ATM local area network (LAN) in Polytechnic University.  The ATM LAN will be connected to a wide-area network, called NYNET, through a SONET OC-3 optical link (155.52 Mbit/s), for conducting various experiments such as B-ISDN service applications, distributed processing, system performance measurement, congestion/flow control, and network  management.  ***",
