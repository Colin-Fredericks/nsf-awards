Duke University  Title: SGER: Paleoclimatic Research in Lake Titicaca    This award is in support of a Small Grant for Exploratory Research  (SGER).  Lake Titicaca (Peru/Bolivia) may contain the most  important sedimentary record of Quaternary climatic change in  tropical South America.  Previous paleoclimatic studies in the lake  have only involved analysis of shallow-water cores.  This is  because the recovery of sediments from central, portions of the  lake is a major undertaking, involving a sufficiently large vessel  for the rough sea conditions of the lake.  Extensive seismic  reflection profiling should also be done as part of this study as  an aid to core site selection and as a means for identification of  hiatuses and sedimentary facies.  Prior to requesting funds for a  major expedition to Lake Titicaca, it is appropriate and prudent to  make personal contact with government officials and scientists in  Peru and Bolivia to ensure the success of future research efforts.   This award supports travel to Peru and Bolivia in order to: (1)  contact government officials to obtain assurances that research  cruises will be approved; (2) communicate personally with South  American scientific colleagues to ensure that they will be properly  involved in this research; and (3) determine the availability of  technical facilities and supplies.",
