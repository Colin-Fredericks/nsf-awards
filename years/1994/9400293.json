Goodman (CUNY City College)  will continue their study of the interplay between the geometry  and the topology of Euclidean spaces by extending their recent  results (1) on a generalization to Grassmann manifolds of the  standard convexity structure of Euclidean spaces, (2) on the  classification of ordered configurations and their  generalizations, and (3) on related geometric and combinatorial  problems.  Building on their past work on allowable sequences and  order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of  their solution of the Vincensini problem for hyperplane  transversals to families of convex bodies and their recent  extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds, Goodman and  Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations,  arrangements of flats, and geometric transversal theory.       One of the most elegant things that Goodman and Pollack have  done recently is to extend convexity, as noted above, from sets  of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of higher dimensional  flats, for example lines in ordinary three-space.  One obtains in  this way \"convex\" sets of lines such as all the lines through a  particular point, or all the lines in a particular plane, and  there is nothing especially exciting about these.  However, one  also obtains such sets as all the lines which are surrounded by a  particular hyperboloid of one sheet together with one set of  rulings lying on the surface of the hyperboloid.  Since the  suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes available in  this new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new  geometric conjectures, proofs, and theorems.  ***",
