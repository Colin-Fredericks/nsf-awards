The program will be managed by the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR).  The  Program will focus its attention on this country's approximately 1,000 primarily undergraduate  institutions.  Because of their size and/or lack of a long tradition of undergraduate research at  these institutions, it has not been possible or practical to establish NSF-REU sites at many of  them.  Consequently, a major segment of the academic community is precluded from  participation in the NSF's REU program.  A special feature of these Fellowships is that the  participating students (and faculty) will be linked by a specially developed electronic bulletin  board which the students will use weekly to report progress on their research.  The bulletin  board will also enable students to share their experiences with each other and to pose  questions about their research as the summer progresses.  ***",
