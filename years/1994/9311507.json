 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311507  Dominguez  The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of central  bank policies on the behavior of foreign exchange rates.  Central  banks have at their disposal two instruments that can influence  exchange rates; monetary policy and sterilized foreign exchange  rate intervention policy.  Monetary policy can directly affect  exchange rates, but central banks appear to use monetary policy  primarily with domestic objectives in mind.  Sterilized  intervention operations, which change the composition rather than  the number of outstanding assets, affect exchange rates in a  somewhat less direct fashion than monetary operations do.   Nevertheless, central banks apparently rely heavily on sterilized  intervention policy.  The G-5 central banks have undertaken an  unprecedented number of both coordinated and unilateral  intervention operations in the last seven years.  The empirical  evidence presented in the literature on the effectiveness of  intervention is quite mixed.  This project will bring together  the this literature to examine the effects of U.S. and German  monetary intervention policies on the dollar-mark exchange rate.   The research will cover the period since the abandonment of the  Bretton Woods system.  This research is important because it will  determine the effectiveness of recent central bank intervention  as compared to past interventions, and whether intervention has  its greatest effect on the level or the variance of exchange  rates.  ***",
