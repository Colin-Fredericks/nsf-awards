 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the premise of this project that students become more  interested in learning, and retain more, in courses that rely on  active rather than passive teaching methods. If active learning  techniques are to be incorporated into science curricula  efficiently, they need to be developed and made available  nationally to undergraduate institutions. The goal of required  undergraduate science courses is to produce scientifically literate  individuals. Cooperative learning activities can be used to  strengthen the skills associated with a scientifically literate  citizen. Cooperative learning within a small peer group  necessitates an active effort on the part of each group member.   Astronomy is often the choice of undergraduate non-science majors  to satisfy a science requirement. This project is developing a  variety of cooperative learning activities which can be easily  incorporated into introductory astronomy courses nationally. An  activities sourcebook offered nationally has the potential to  impact a large number of undergraduates and to provide faculty with  teaching materials.",
