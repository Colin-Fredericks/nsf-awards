A useful class of mitochondrial mutants, giving rise to  the cytoplasmic male sterility phenotype, is available for the  study of these unusual nuclear-mitochondrial exchanges.  We plan to  take advantage of the useful features of the cytoplasmic male  sterility system in common bean to investigate the role of nuclear  genotype in the regulation of mitochondrial genome structure and  expression, with particular emphasis on the importance of these  intracellular events on the pattern of pollen development.  During  the course of our study, we plan to pursue two primary objectives.   We intend to further characterize the expression of a mitochondrial  sequence, pvs, that is associated with pollen sterility.  We have  developed a mitochondrial cDNA library that will allow us to  determine whether the expression of pvs involves transcript  splicing and to identify all encoded open reading frames  transcribed from this region.  We have available polyclonal  antibodies against the product of a co-transcribed second open  reading frame, pvs-orf98.  With the transcription information and  these antibodies, we will evaluate the temporal and spatial  expression of the sterility-associated mitochondrial segment.  This  will include transcription assays as well as immunocytochemistry.   Our second objective will be to evaluate the effects of two  different nuclear fertility restorer genes on expression of the pvs  sequence.  With information gained regarding transcription of pvs,  and with the use of anti-PVS antibodies, we will determine the  developmental and expressional consequences of introducing the two  different nuclear restorer genes.  Preliminary evidence suggests  that expression of pvs and its regulation are restricted to plant  reproductive tissues.  ***  Ou r final objective will be to use the information derived from  this study to identify additional nuclear genes that regulate  expression of the pvs sequence.  We have identified five plant  lines not previously studied by our lab, each containing nuclear  fertility restorer alleles.  Genetic and molecular analysis using  the information from this study will allow us to determine whether  these nuclear genes act by mechanisms distinct from Fr and Fr2, two  restorer genes already identified for CMS common bean.  %%%",
