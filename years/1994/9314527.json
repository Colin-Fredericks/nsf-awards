 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314527  O'Connor  The basic hypothesis of this research is that the practice of  constructability will be enhanced if a systems is available to  assist the user in conducting the analysis.  To test this  hypothesis the investigators will develop a decision support system  for the constructability analysis of industrial piping.  Computer  methods include a hybrid scheme consisting of  rule-based and case-  based reasoning for representing knowledge and a virtual reality  environment to serve as analysis and visualization platform.  In  addition to developing the system, this research will result in (i)  an investigation of the adaptations required to apply the computer  methods to the construction domain and (ii) definition of a  methodology for developing computer integrated construction  systems.  The first phase will identify the variables influencing   constructability and model the process in the form  of a decision  sequence.  The second phase will focus on the development of  schemes to represent the data and basic knowledge required for the  analysis.  In the third phase the representations will be  integrated with a virtual reality environment.",
