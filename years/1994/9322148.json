Life on this  planet is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis for its energy requirements.  At Arizona  State University, the center, comprised of faculty in the departments of Botany and  Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the  energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking  photosynthesis using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will participate in the  individual research programs of the Center faculty.  Projects will include organic  synthesis and spectroscopic studies of model compounds, spectroscopic studies of  bacterial and plant photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics  of photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction between faculty and student  participants, including the weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group meetings,  instrumentation workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium, will help educate  the students in the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of photosynthesis.   Student participants will be recruited from targeted colleges and universities in the  Southwest United States with the help of local departments chairs and individual faculty.  ***",
