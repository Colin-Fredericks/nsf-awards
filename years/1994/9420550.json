Of particular concern is  the increase in biologically damaging ultraviolet-B radiation as a  consequence of stratospheric ozone depletion. In response to these  concerns, several U.S. federal agencies are conducting ultraviolet-  monitoring and research activities to better understand trends and  effects of ultraviolet radiation. These efforts are coordinated  through the development of a U.S. interagency ultraviolet radiation  monitoring plan. The establishment of a National Ultraviolet  Radiation Calibration Facility is critical to the interagency  efforts. The mission of the facility is to insure that the data  archived by networks that utilize the facility's calibration  resources will not suffer from disparate and ambiguous calibrations  that could compromise the validity of scientific conclusions  derived from the use of the data. This award provides funds for  equipment for the facility, which is being supported through the  efforts of the National Science Foundation, the Environmental  Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
