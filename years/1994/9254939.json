This project seeks to advance  previously funded NSF research projects that emphasized  primary-level children's mathematical learning in these classroom  environments to consider the teachers.  The project has 4  interwoven goals which interrelate research and development to  create realistic classroom video-based instructional materials for  beginning teacher professional development.  The first goals is to  analyze the nature of instruction in classrooms in which teachers  have been teaching in a manner compatible with reform initiatives  for the past 6 years.  The second goal is to analyze the process by  which teachers starting to teach in this manner change their  beliefs about mathematics and teaching as they learn about  children's mathematical thinking, and how this process is related  to and enhances their own understanding of the mathematics they  teach.  The third goal is to use the information acquired from the  research analyses to develop prototype video-based instructional  materials to deepen and enrich beginning teachers' content  knowledge by developing an understanding of the mathematics that  underlies children's conceptual development and forms the basis for  their solution strategies.  The fourth goal is to create prototypic  video-based instructional materials to aid beginning teachers in  creating images for classrooms in which the reform initiatives  characterized by problem solving and mathematical reasoning are  illustrated.  The investigation of the nature of teaching is  accomplished in collaboration with 20 experienced teachers  currently teaching in a reform-based instructional materials for  beginning teacher development both as a source for exemplary  examples of classroom teaching and as collaborators in the  selection and design of the classroom-based materials.  These  materials will th en be used in a university teacher preparation  program, evaluated and revised.  ***",
