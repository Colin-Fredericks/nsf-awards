 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360313 Johnson          The use of powder metallurgy (P/M) for net or near net shaped formed parts is expanding at a very rapid rate.  This growth is due to the major savings in labor, materials and energy that can arise from the use of P/M technology compared to conventional metallurgical and machining processes.  P/M has the advantage of being a very rapid and economic producer of net shape and near net shape parts, while using less energy than casting, forging, or machining.  The quality and reliability of P/M parts could be improved dramatically by the development of a reliable and economic nondestructive inspection method capable of detecting cracks, laminations and other parameters effecting part performance.  Recent work conducted indicates that eddy current methods have excellent potential for nondestructive inspection of P/M parts.  It is also evident that eddy current responses from P/M parts are often much more complex than from conventional metallurgical parts and additional research is required to permit application of eddy current technology routinely to P/M parts, particularly green or unsintered P/M parts.          This research is to develop the eddy current technology (probes, instrumentation, data processing, and test procedures) necessary to permit routine inspection of P/M parts.  The test instrumentation will be based on a general purpose, computer based, multi frequency instrument.  The feasibility of using computer based eddy current methods to detect cracks and other anomalies, and measure density and other variables, in both ferrous and non ferrous, green and sintered P/M parts will be demonstrated.",
