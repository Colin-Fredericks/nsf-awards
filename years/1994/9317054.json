 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work has shown major similarities across a wide range of organisms in the biochemical mechanisms for olfactory reception.  The fruit fly, Drosophila, provides an excellent model system for study because of its accessibility for genetics, molecular analysis, behavior, and even some physiology.  This project combines these techniques to address the molecular basis for olfactory sensitivity.  Modern genetic technology and methodology is used to isolate particular mutant strains of Drosophila that show particular olfactory sensitivity or loss.  These mutants allow identification of particular genes by the pattern of proteins that are expressed.  Genes that are expressed specifically in olfactory tissue during development will be characterized, and their expression or deletion correlated to specific kinds of olfactory behavior.  One of these genes apparently is expressed differently in males and females, suggesting an important role in mate recognition or other important reproductive behavior.   Results will be important for understanding the mechanisms of olfactory reception at the fundamental level of molecular genetics, and will have a broader impact as well on sensory neuroscience and on genetics, with potential applications including pest control.",
