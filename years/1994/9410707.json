 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410707  Shene  Using a geometric approach, this project aims to completely solve  the problem of using Dupin cyclides as blending surfaces for  all pairs of CSG primitives, and to explore the possibility  that other tractable surfaces, such as the cyclide family, can be  used for blending purpose.    Initially, the project will investigate the role of Dupin  cyclides as blending surfaces for CSG primitives.  This includes  construction algorithms and characterization results for each  pair of CSG primitives and their generalizations.  Since  constructions are based on the geometric characteristics, not on  implicit/parametric equations, the construction algorithms would  be more robust.  Next, various generalizations of Dupin cyclides  (e.g., projective cyclides, general cyclides and quartics with a  double conics) will be examined to see if there are viable and  tractable classes of lower degree algebraic surfaces for blending  purpose.  Techniques from descriptive, algebraic and differential  geometry will be used to study the geometry of these surface  classes and to develop efficient construction algorithms.  Finally, some fundamental issues of general blending surface  construction will be considered by looking at the connection  between the geometry of the intersection curve, the clipping  curves, and the blending surfaces.  ***",
