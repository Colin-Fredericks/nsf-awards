Hankins of the New  Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and  Joel M. Weisberg of Carleton College, for work  at the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT)  in Pune, India.  They will collaborate with  Drs. G. Swarup, director of the GMRT and V.  Radhakrishnan, director of the Raman Research  Institute (RRI) in Bangalore, India. The GMRT  is a project under the auspices of the National  Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune.   The research will deal with pulsars, pulsar  emission, beaming and evolution, pulsar  microstructure, and pulsar timing and  polarimetry.  It will include broad  observational programs using the GMRT,  involving large and currently active teams from  the NCRA and the RRI    Scope: This project allows the three U.S.  scientists to collaborate with two of India's  most distinguished scientists in research on  pulsars, a topic of strong current interest.   They will use unique facilities including the  GMRT which, when completed later in 1994, will  be the largest collection area, fully steerable  telescope in the world, placed in a location  away from many man-made sources of  interference.  They will also use data  currently being generated using the Ooty Radio  Telescope (ORT) in India.  The project presents  a strong case of beneficial Indo-U.S.  collaboration in a scientific area which is  strong in both countries.  The project meets  the criteria of the Division of International  Programs.  ***",
