 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314747  Farvardin    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in communications and signal processing among three  investigators:  Nariman Farvardin of the University of Maryland;  Michel Barlaud of the University of Nice; and Patrick Sole of the  French National Center for Scientific Research in Valbonne,  France.  The objective of their research is to develop efficient  and powerful image and video compression signals by using wavelet  based methods.  The U.S. and French investigators will study the  problem using different approaches.  The U.S. investigator brings  to this collaboration expertise in perceptual image models,  trellis and structured vector quantization and combined source-  channel coding.  This is complemented by the French group's  experience in wavelet filters and lattice vector quantization  schemes.    The proposed research will advance our understanding of wavelet  based compression schemes and could lead to the development of  improved wavelet based image/video coders.  These coders have  numerous applications in medical imaging, geographical  information systems, video-teleconferencing, high resolution  television broadcasting, and archival and digital libraries.",
