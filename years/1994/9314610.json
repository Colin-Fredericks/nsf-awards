 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314610  Glibert  This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the  collaboration of Patricia Glibert of the University of Maryland  and Patricia Metzler, a Ph.D. student at the University of Sao  Paulo, Brazil.  The project aims to measure planktonic nitrogen  transformations off the coast of Brazil.    The importance of nitrogenous nutrients in marine primary  production has long been recognized.  Their regeneration is known  to be a major source of nitrogen for oceanic primary producers,  but it is the rate of supply of \"new\" nitrogen which ultimately  determines the amount of production.  There have been virtually  no direct measurements of the rates of nitrogen transformation in  the western South Atlantic.  In this project, the researchers  will apply 15N stable isotope tracer techniques to investigate  physiological and trophodynamic responses to nitrogen fluxes in  Brazil's coastal and offshore waters.  The experiments will  elucidate the relationship between size- and time-dependent  responses by plankton to new nitrogen inputs and the dependence  on new versus regenerated nitrogen.  These studies will benefit  both sides by producing data for an undersampled part of the  world's oceans, establishing a new area of research in Brazil,  and training a Brazilian student in methodology for these  experiments.  ***",
