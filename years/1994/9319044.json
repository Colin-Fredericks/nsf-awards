 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319044  Green  Lake Vanda is an ice-covered, permanently stratified lake.  The    water column, 69-meter deep, presents a wide range of geochemical  and microbiological environments.  The lake's 1200-year  stratification history and its water column stability make it a  model system for exploring the relationship between chemical  processes and microbial diversity and activity.  Of special  interest is the relationship between successive reductive and  oxidative zones and the microbial and chemical characteristics of  those zones.  Dr. Green and colleague plan the first simultaneous  study of chemical and microbial community structure using a  combination of measurements, including determinations of  microbial biomass and diversity as estimated by microscopy and  nucleic acid extraction and identification.  Central to this work  is the role played by manganese-reducing organisms in metal  cycling in the Vanda water column.  The capacity for microbially  mediated manganese cycling will be assessed by determining the  abundance of manganese reducers and the mechanisms involved in Mn  reduction. In addition, a detailed study of metal transport  mechanisms is planned along the 27-km course of the Onyx River,  the lake's sole inflow. Determination of metal loadings and  residences times in the lake will be made.   ***",
