The materials to be packaged  for deployment purposes are the results and outcomes of prior   research efforts by the principal investigator (PI) in the same   subject area.  The program will involve the development of a series  of teaching/learning modules.  The PI, along with a team of  graduates students, consultants, academia and government personnel,  and production and systems managers will be engaged in the  development.  The development of the series will be based on  multimedia approach and is expected to provide a rich learning   experience and promote better learning experiences and  understanding.        The modules to be developed will be incorporated into    introductory manufacturing and control courses, applied AI courses,  and training and re-training seminars for production and research   and development personnel in industry.  Ideas will be solicited  from professors at different universities to build, update, and  modify the modules to ensure wide acceptance.",
