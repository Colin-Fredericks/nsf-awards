 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321496  Davis       Oxidation products of organics in the atmosphere can be  expected to affect the thermodynamics of cloud droplets and the  rates of droplet growth and evaporation.  Automobile emissions of  olefins yield secondary organic aerosols such as glutaric, adipic  and phthalic acids, and a-pinene emissions from tree foliage  produce pinonaldehyde and pinonic acid upon oxidation.  Recent  experiments in this laboratory indicate that such difunctional  organic oxygenates are surface active and significantly alter the  physical and chemical properties of the surface on an aqueous  solution droplet.  This proposal addresses the surface chemistry  and the effects of the surface chemistry on  evaporation/condensation rate processes of aerosol droplets  containing organic solutes.       Preliminary experiments with aqueous solution droplets of  adipic and phthalic acids show that evaporation rates are lowered  by more than an order of magnitude eompared with water droplets at  the same ambient conditions of temperature and relative humidity.   These large effects have not been explored before, but their impact  on cloud physics can be expected to be significant.       The work plan includes surface tension measurements of aqueous  solutions for a wide range of concentrations and  evaporation/condensation rate measurements of electrodynamically  trapped aerosol droplets.  The droplet size will be measured as a  function of time by light-scattering techniques, and the light-  scattering data will be analyzed to determine the refractive index  of the droplet.  Facilities are also available to Measure inelastic  scattering (Raman scattering) by the droplets, which can be used to  chemically characterize the droplets.  ***",
