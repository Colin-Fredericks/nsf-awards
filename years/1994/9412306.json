Although previous research  indicates that the stigmatized do not generally experience low  self-esteem and psychological distress, there is considerable  variability in these reactions across stigmatizing conditions,  across individuals within stigmatized groups, and within  individuals across situations.  This program of research refines  the PIs' previous attributional analysis of this variability,  using principles of distributive justice to clarify reactions of  the stigmatized to social outcomes that they attribute to their  stigma. Specifically it tests the hypothesis that a critical  determinant of the effects of outcomes that are attributed to  stigma is whether those outcomes are judged to be deserved.  It  also tests the hypothesis that individuals will judge such  outcomes as deserved when they view their stigma as a relevant  input in the particular domain and that stigmatizing conditions  perceived as controllable are more likely to be judged as  relevant inputs in many domains than those perceived as  uncontrollable.  Other determinants of the belief that stigma-  associated outcomes are deserved include situational information  suggesting that the procedures for determining outcomes are fair,  a general belief that the system for allocating outcomes is a  meritocracy, or a belief that the world is just. These hypotheses  will be tested in experiments involving members of pre-existing  groups formed on the basis of race and ethnicity, gender, and  weight, as well as members of groups created in the laboratory.      Previous research has shown that individuals with stigmatizing   conditions, who are the targets of negative stereotypes or  prejudice, sometimes suffer from low self-esteem and sometimes do  not.  This program of research will determine when negative  stereotypes and prejudice lead to lower self-esteem among  stigmatized individuals and groups.  It is proposed that when an  individual is rejected or experiences a failure, he or she will  consider whether this outcome is due to the stigmatizing  condition and whether the outcome is fair, or deserved.   Stigmatized individuals are expected to experience low self-  esteem when they believe that negative outcomes due to their  stigma are fair, but not when they believe those outcomes are  unfair.  Several factors will influence this judgment, including  beliefs about whether they are responsible for their stigmatizing  condition, whether the condition decreases their qualifications,  whether they believe that the procedures followed are fair, and  whether they generally believe that the world is a just place  where people usually get what they deserve.  By increasing  understanding of maladaptive reactions to the disadvantages  associated with stigmatizing conditions, this research will place  us in a better position to ameliorate these reactions.",
