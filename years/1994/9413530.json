 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Utah State  University requests matching funds from NSF to purchase an  Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.   EPR is  a fundamental spectroscopic technique with applications that  span both chemistry and biochemistry.  The acquisition of an  EPR spectrometer by Utah State University would fill a void  in our current instrumentation facilities.  A new EPR  spectrometer would become the centerpiece for several  Chemistry and Biochemistry research programs and courses.  The current courses offered by the university that would  utilize an EPR spectrometer in their curricula are:  Physical Chemistry, Advanced Synthesis, and Instrumental  Analysis laboratories as well as Physical Biochemistry and  Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.  Each of these courses  would instruct students in the fundamental principles of EPR  spectroscopy as well as the applications relevant to the  course outline, with additional \"hands-on\" operation of the  instrument.  Instrument operation would include:  sample  preparation, data collection, and data processing.  The type  of data collected (i.e. organic free radicals or transition  metal complexes) would depend on the course objectives and  level.    EPR spectroscopy would also form a central element in  research projects across the University and the region.  Research projects of faculty members in Molecular Biology  and Biology at Utah State University would be minor users of  a new EPR spectrometer.  In addition, a faculty member in  the Biochemistry Department at Brigham Young University and  a faculty member in the Biochemistry Department at Oregon  State University would be periodic users.  Seven major users  and three minor users of an EPR spectrometer have been  identified in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  at Utah State University.  In each of these research  projects, graduate students and postdoctoral research  associates will be trained to record and process their data.  The specific re search projects described within the proposal  are listed below:    a. Elucidating the Mechanism of Coupling MgATP Hydrolysis to  Electron Transfer in the Metalloenzyme Nitrogenase.  b. Characterization of the Nickel-Iron Sulfur Center of  Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum.  c. EPR Investigations into the Function of the Dinuclear  Hydrolytic Aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica.  d. Mechanisms of the Light-Induced Inhibition of  Photosynthesis and its Relation to Photoassembly of the Mn-  Containing Water-Oxidizing Complex.  e. Elucidation of the Coordination Symmetry and Location of  the Binding Sites for Iron on Erionite.  f. Free Radical Mediated Oxidative and Reductive Reactions  Catalyzed by Fungal Peroxidases.  g. Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions of Radical Cations.",
