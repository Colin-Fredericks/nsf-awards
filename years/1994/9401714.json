 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401714  Browder       Research will be carried forward in the areas of cohomology  of groups, with applications to group actions on manifolds, and  various topics on symplectic manifolds.  Among the areas  considered are the Euler characteristic of central extensions by  Z of groups, such that the resultant group is finite dimensional,  the rank of symmetry of products of spheres, i.e. the calculation  of the maximal rank of products of Z/p which act effectively (or  freely) on products of spheres, and related problems on other  manifolds.  In symplectic geometry the research will focus on  Hamiltonian group actions, with particular attention to questions  on the cohomology of the reduced spaces, the symplectic quotient,  the ring structure of this cohomology, with applications to  moduli spaces of flat vector bundles.  Also to be considered are  obstructions to the construction of symplectic structures and  questions related to the algebraic topology of symplectic  manifolds.        Manifolds are the generalized spaces in which so much of  modern physics and engineering find their natural expression, and  whose topological (i.e. continuous) properties have been found to  play a crucial role in the expression of these theories.  In  particular, the symmetry properties or the dynamical properties  of these spaces, especially the spaces of mechanics, the so  called symplectic spaces, and the dynamics associated to them are  basic to understanding many physical and mathematical problems.   This project will make its contribution using means from  algebraic topology and differential geometry.  ***",
