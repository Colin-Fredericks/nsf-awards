 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303401  Ehmann    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Kornel F. Ehmann,  Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, to  pursue with Dr. Dong Woo Cho, Department of Mechanical  Engineering, Pohang Institute of Science and Technology, Korea,  for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on factors  relevant to process quality and efficiency monitoring of the  micro-hole drilling process in microelectronics manufacture.   Their objective is to develop and implement a technology for on-  line monitoring of gradual drill wear, breakage, and the  locational tolerances of through holes on both top and bottom  surfaces of multi-layer printed circuit boards (PCB's).  A  combined theoretical and experimental approach will be  implemented in this research.  A new theoretical approach will be  utilized based on (1) the mechanics of initial penetration, for  determining the state of the process, and on (2) the use of  neuro-fuzzy algorithms, for recognition purposes.  Practical  studies will take place on a unique instrumented high speed  micro-drilling testbed.    Micro-hole drilling is becoming increasingly important in a wide  spectrum of precision manufacturing industries including the  production of automotive fuel injection nozzles, watch and camera  parts, medical needles, air bearings, and thick multi-layer  printed PCB's in electronic circuitry.  Mechanical  micro-  drilling has proved to be superior to alternative methods such as  laser drilling.  The collaborators are recognized as experts in  the field of the proposal.  They will be assisted by graduate  students who are not supported under this grant.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science  Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between  U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is sup ported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No. DDM-9201144.  ***",
