It is a study  of  the  role  of  prominent  intellectuals  in  the  consolidation  of  the   Cuban  revolution  after 1959.  Data will be collected from analysis  of  newspaper  and magazine articles, from organizational  membership  lists,  and  through oral history interviews in order to  analyze  the  social  networks that linked Cuban intellectuals during  the  years  between  1959  and  1966.  The resulting  data  on  social  networks among Cuban intellectuals will be used to illuminate how  the  structures of power were altered in that society as a result  of the revolution.        Previous  work  on revolutions tends to underemphasize  the  processes   by  which  the  power  of  the  new  rulers   becomes  consolidated.    By   focusing  on  that   period   and   process  specifically,  this  project will help us better  understand  the  social  basis  and roots of the Cuban revolution.   This  project  will  also  form a useful basis for an attempt to understand  how  different revolutions compare and contrast.  In addition  to  the  scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award  will  materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student  in  completing  research for the Ph. D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the  future  scientific  manpower  of  the  nation  and  the  thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.  ***",
