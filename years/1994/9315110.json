 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315110   FROELICH    Recent advances in our understanding of minor biological  fractionation of Ge/Si by oceanic diatoms suggest that Ge/Si)opal  variations measured in late Pleistocene piston cores and Cenozoic  drill cores are recording whole ocean (Ge/Si)seawater variations  driven by rapid and large glacial to interglacial changes in  continental weathering intensity and river fluxes to the sea. If  so, then it is clearly important to produce high resolution records  of (Ge/Si)opal in cores with well-established  18 O and 14C  stratigraphies across transitions to establish the shape and timing  of the oceanic Ge/Si response relative to other climate and  weathering indicators.  In addition, in order to resolve whole  ocean changes in the face of small biological fractionation  effects, it is necessary to carefully evaluate and remove the  effects of Ge/Si fractionation in local records.  With the  development of a rapid and highly-sensitive HG-ICP-MS Ge-method,  these problems can be addressed and unraveling the causes and  timing and ocean chemical variations can begin.  As a result, this  is aimed at accomplishing two major goals: (1) Produce high  resolution late Pleistocene (Ge/Si)opal records in cores that  contain abundant diatoms and forams in collaboration with others'  measurements of the appropriate paleogeochemical tracers in the  same cores (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr); and (2) Provide tests to refine the  effects of Ge/Si biological fractionation with diatom cultures,  hydrographic and core top transects, and runs of the Hamburg ocean  Ge/Si model.  In addition, opal paleoproductivity work in the  Antarctic (expanding into the North and South Pacific Oceans), and  other ancillary programs will be continued.",
