 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine the role of attention in   acquiring automatic skills and transferring them within and between   tasks.  The main theoretical focus will be on developing a theory that   explains how acts of attention during training encode traces into memory   to build up a task-relevant knowledge base, and how acts of attention at   transfer retrieve traces from memory to support automatic performance.   The theory will build on existing theories of attention and   automaticity, extending and generalizing them.  The main empirical focus   will be on visual search, which is a dominant paradigm in research on   attention and automaticity that has important practical implications   (e.g., for driving, navigation, and supervisory control).  Experiments   will address how automatic skills acquired during training on visual   search transfer to and from other tasks (counting and categorization)   performed on displays similar to and different from the ones experienced   during training.   The proposed research is significant theoretically and  practically.  The ability to perform automatically is a major factor   underlying skilled performance and it is important to understand it   better.  The proposed research will increase our understanding by   distinguishing between competing theories of automatization and   integrating previously unrelated theories of automatization, attention,   and categorization.  The experimental and theoretical results on   transfer will have important implications for education and industrial   training, providing a principled way to determine whether experience   gained in one setting (e.g., the classroom) will generalize to another   (e.g., the workplace) and a principled way to design training programs   and select training examples to maximize generalization and optimize   skilled performance.",
