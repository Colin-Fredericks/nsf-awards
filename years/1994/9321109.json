 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321109  Phillips  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design  Projects Program category, and requests support for  undergraduate and graduate student engineers to provide  prototype \"custom designed\" devices and software to aid  persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust  is to provide meaningful design experience for the  engineering student that will directly aid a specific  disabled individual. A formal program is in place at Wright  State University which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on these projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects.  Thirty-five projects are planned during the five year  duration of this award, and a written report on the  completed projects will be submitted for an annual  publication.  Once completed, each project will be given to  the person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that this  \"real world\" experience will give engineering students a  sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve  the community, attract new students into engineering, and  raise student interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of  their undergraduate design requirements, and will also  benefit a population where customization is often needed for  rehabilitation devices.  ***",
