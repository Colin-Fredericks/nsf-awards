 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412509  Bosnich  Univ. of Chicago  Dr. Brice Bosnich, Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the synthesis of chiral, heterobimetallic complexes in which electron transfer from an encapsulated metal center to a second metal, in a coordinately unsaturated site, initiates a redox reaction involving an exterior substrate. The initial stages of the project will concentrate  largely on the synthesis of macrocyclic ligands which possess two compartments. One of these is designed to fully surround a metal. The second, contiguous site will be more open and designed to contain a metal at which reactions may occur. Bimetallic complexes of these ligands will be formed with the encapsulating site occupied by a metal which can of supply electrons to a second metal contained in the open site. The complexes will be developed into two-electron reductants for dioxygen and into catalysts for asymmetric olefin epoxidation.    Reactions in which electrons are transferred between reactants are of enormous importance in  virtually all areas of pure and applied chemistry.  Compounds to be prepared in this study will contain two metals. One of these will serve as a reservoir to hold electrons which can be transferred to a second metal where they can be utilized to perform a chemical reaction. This will permit reactions which require the addition of more electrons than the second metal can normally supply. These compounds will be used to enhance the versatility of many metal mediated processes, including some very important industrial preparations including olefin epoxidation.",
