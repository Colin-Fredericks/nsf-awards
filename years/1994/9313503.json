 "awd_abstract_narration": "Burnett          The Wistar Institute of the University of Pennsylvania is a renowned center for  biological and biomedical research.  The Institute occupies a building  constructed as an anatomical museum in 1894, and many areas of the building  do not provide an adequate environment for state-of-the-art research.   Four  laboratories in the area of structural and computational biology are being  consolidated into an interdisciplinary division on the third floor of the building s  west wing, which was last renovated in 1956.  In order to accommodate these  instrument- and computer-intensive research activities, this portion of the  building will require a new roof, installation of ductwork to the building s central  air conditioning system, installation of new fume hoods, and replacement of  plumbing and windows.  Rooms will be reconfigured to suit the research  activities, and modern lab cabinetry will be installed.        The renovation of the third floor of the Institute s west wing will bring  together a critical mass of researchers who share an interest in the structural  and molecular biology of proteins, and who share a need for instruments in the  areas of x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, image analysis, and  computers and graphical workstations for analysis of sequence and structure  data.  The renovated facility will support state-of-the-art instrumentation, enable  integration of research across these fields, and accommodate the training of  graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in these important scientific  disciplines.",
