Drs. Wagner and Paulaitis, in the  Department of Chemical Engineering, and Dr. D'Aguanno of the  Department of Computational Biophysics, propose to develop  massively parallel simulation algorithms for calculating ion  solubilities and mobilities in hydrated polymers with the goal of  applying these computational tools to design selective reverse  osmosis membranes based on the chemical composition and \"local\"  structural properties of the polymer.      A severe limitation in applying current science and technology to  predict ion solubilities and mobilities is the inability to  characterize quantitatively the unique restructuring of waters of  hydration.  The international collaboration will merge US  expertise in thermodynamics and massively parallel simulation  with the Italian expertise in large-scale simulations of water  and ionic solutions.  This collaboration will contribute to a  program recently established at the Center for Molecular and  Engineering Thermodynamics at the University of Delaware to  simulate water structures around hydrated ionic species to  predict their solubilities and mobilities in hydrated polymers.   This new collaboration will also foster closer interactions  between the Delaware Center and the Sardinian Center.  * * *",
