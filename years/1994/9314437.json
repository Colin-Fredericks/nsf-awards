Seferis,  Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, to  pursue with Dr. Ki-Jun Lee, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Seoul National University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on autoclave resin transfer molding (ARTM)  in high performance polymeric composite recycling.  Specifically,  the proposed research will focus on (1) ARTM feasibility studies  and process development, (2) resin flow modeling and processing  parameter characterization, (3) void formation phenomena in ARTM  processing, and (4) ARTM composite recycle studies.  This project  will be integrated into an overall processing-structure-property  characterization methodology facilitating composites technology  transfer in aerospace, automotive, and electric/electronic  industries.    Composite recycling has recently emerged in aerospace industries  as a critical issue resulting from serious concerns for cost  savings and environmental health problems.  The expertise of  Dr. Lee's team at Seoul National University in polymer rheology  and porous media transport phenomena will be combined, for mutual  benefit, with that of the PI's research team which is studying  process induced stresses in laminated polymer composites and  related problems in composite manufacture.  The collaborators are  recognized as experts in the field of the proposal.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No. DDM-9245052.  ***",
