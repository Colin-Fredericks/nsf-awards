 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404077  SHAW      Temporal variation in the particulate flux to the deep sediment  community drives variation in benthic respiration and the  deposition of particle bound nutrients and minor elements.  Particulate flux can be measured on a near continuous basis with  sequencing sediment traps.  However, particulate decomposition and  the resultant benthic flux of dissolved species has been measured  only for brief periods seasonally in the deep ocean.  To address  the need for more frequent measurements, a bottom transecting free  vehicle \"Rover\" is being built to collect near continuous data on  benthic community oxygen utilization.  Complimentary measurement of  the benthic flux of nutrients and minor elements will elucidate the  relationship between productivity and burial for particle bound  species. This project involves building a long development sampler  to collect and preserve benthic chamber sampler which will  \"piggyback\" the \"Rover\".  The sampler will be made up of the  controller and a series of syringe racks.  Each rack will have the  capability of collecting and preserving 18 chamber samples in  duplicate.  The controller will have the capacity to collect from  eight racks.  Four racks will be built for this project allowing  six collections each for twelve emplacements of the benthic chamber  over a six month deployment.  This sampling frequency will allow a  greater understanding of the seasonal variability of the  biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and trace elements at the  sediment water interface.",
