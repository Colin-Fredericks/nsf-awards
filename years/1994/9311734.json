 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311734  Drennan    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Ms. Cristiana Barreto  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. As part of a  larger archaeological project she will conduct excavation in the  plateau region of Central Brazil. From an ethnographic perspective  this region is well known and characterized by large groups of  hundreds of individuals who practice a mixed foraging and simple  agricultural way of life. They live in large villages, and have  complex forms of social organization. On the other hand they are  egalitarian and lack leaders with inherited offices. They also live  in a relatively unproductive environment and this combination of  traits is both unusual and unexpected. Many anthropologists have  speculated on the origin of this social system yet no concrete data  is available.     Ms. Barreto will attempt to trace its development archaeologically  and determine its cause. Work to date suggests that prior to 500 BC  small groups followed a strictly hunting and gathering way of life  and lived primarily in caves and rock shelters. The period between  500 BC and 800 AD marks a transition to village life and by 800 AD  large villages appear in the archaeological record. Ms. Barreto  will excavate one of each type of site. In particular she will  attempt to recover data which relates to subsistence activities and  to look for objects which indicate contact with other regions.    Some archaeologists believe that the ethnographically observed  pattern developed through outside stimuli. Others believe that  agricultural practices changed, that crops such as maize were  introduced and that these allowed for higher population densities.  A final hypothesis suggests that neither of the above occurred but  rather that large villages provide a means both to deal with  environmental unpredictability and to ensure adequate defence  against other human groups. Ms. Barreto's work should provide data  to distinguish among these hypotheses.    This research is important for  several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of how human societies, at a simple technological  level, adapt to a harsh tropical environment. It will provide data  of interest to many anthropologists and contribute to the training  of a promising young scientist.  ***",
