Dr. Van Keuren will be conducting research over  a period of six months on third-order nonlinear  optical properties of crystalline organic  materials with Dr. Hiro Matsuda, a senior  research investigator at NIMCR.    The crystalline organic materials to be  investigated are of interest due to their  potentially large third-order optical  effects, fast time responses and as model  systems for understanding the basic physics of  the molecular structure/optical properties  relationship. Dr. Van Keuren is very familiar  with the work being conducted by Dr. Matsuda,  having been a fellow at NIMCR supported by the  Japanese Science and Technology Agency. The  optical measurement systems recently installed  at NIMCR represent a broad spectrum of  available state-of-the-art measurement  techniques for third-order optical processes.  The collaboration will utilize the experience  of Dr. Van Keuren with optical systems and  nonlinear optical measurements with the  synthesis and optical characterization  facilities available at NIMCR, along with the  expertise of the participating Japanese  investigators.    The award is funded under the auspices of the  Center for Global Partnership (CGP) of the  Japan Foundation under the NSF-CGP Science  Fellowship Program.  ***",
