 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413241  Tirrell    This award to a group of 15 neurobiologist, cell biologists  and biomedical engineers will support a training program  focused on an important and as yet poorly understood area of  biology, the interaction of cells with collagen and other  matrices on which they grow.  The research and training  program will emphasize four aspects of this focus: one  addresses the fundamentals of these interactions in both  natural and artificial matrices, and the otheps address  interactions occurring in connective, neural and vascular  tissue.  The award will support training of undergraduate,  graduate and postdoctoral students through a mix of new and  existing courses, rotations and optional internships that is  sufficiently flexible to accommodate the needs of students  that enter with backgrounds in either engineering or  biology.  The trainees who emerge from the program are  expected to contribute to fundamental biology and to more  applied areas such as tissue engineering and the development  of biomimetic composite materials.    This award is also being supported by the Bioengineering  Program within the Division of Bioengineering and  Environmental Systems and by the Human Resource Development  Program within the Division of Engineering Education and  Centers.  ***",
