By showing  how science and math can be used to improve sport performances,  investigators hope to capitalize on the popularity of sports as a  vehicle for establishing scientific concepts and as a tool for  motivating students to study both science and math.  A total of 48  students from 16 schools in the North Carolina region served by  University of North Carolina Greensboro, known as the Piedmont  Triad region will be served by this program.  Science, mathematics  and physical education teachers from each school will participate  in intensive laboratory activities designed to teach basic concepts  about exercise physiology and sport biomechanics, along with  various physical activities designed to integrate performance with  science and math.  Teachers will attend a five day precamp workshop  as preparation.  Teachers and the principal investigators will work  together to design sport science experiences for the schools'  science clubs.  Students who were initially enrolled in the camp  will be brought back to the University's laboratories for special  enrichment activities during the academic year.  This project  builds on experience gained in a 1992 sport science camp designed  for high school students that was funded through the NSF-funded  Statewide Systemic Initiative Program.   ***",
