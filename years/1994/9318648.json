 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318646  Rundle    It has been recognized by the international community that it may be possible, through programs  of systematic study, to devise means to reduce and mitigate the occurrence of a variety of  devastating natural hazards (see appendix).  One of the most promising avenues of approach is  to develop the capability to simulate these physical processes in the computer.  Many of the  recent models are nonlinear in significant ways, including cellular automata-type or fractal  growth models, and can thus be analyzed in a framework familiar to workers in complex system  theory.  Moreover, it is often the case that the occurrence frequency of disaster events generated  by the models follow power laws.  While recognizing the importance of this new approach, at  this time earth scientists do not generally possess the skills needed to develop or analyze these  models.  Moreover, it is clear that a variety of workers in statistical mechanics, applied  mathematics, and other fields have developed significant interest in these nontraditional  problems.  The development and analysis of simulations for these problems would therefore  proceed most expeditiously in an interdisciplinary professional setting such as that provided by  the Santa Fe Institute.  A workshop be held at SFI to address these issues, and to allow a forum  in which earth scientists can interact with physicists and mathematicians developing techniques  to simulate and analyze complex systems.",
