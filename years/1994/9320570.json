 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320570  Ramirez  The research proposed in this application is the study of an  intravascular hybrid artificial pancreas (HAP).  The HAP  consists of  a cylindrical inert housing enclosing a single,  tubular hollow fiber membrane in a shell-and-tube mass  exchanger configuration.  Islets can be inoculated into the  annular space through a port in the housing.  HAPs have been  shown by other groups to reverse experimental diabetes in  animals, but have not undergone clinical trials to date.  Thus, scale-up criteria based on engineering principles are  currently lacking.  The goal of this project is to attain a  more fundamental understanding of the  factors which  determine the efficiency and durability of insulin release  from islets seeded in a HAP device.  Specific aims are to:  (1) quantify the flow and solute resistance in vitro  provided by both the membrane and the seeded islets, (2)  quantify the effect of membrane protein \"fouling\" in vitro  on the dynamics of solute transport within the HAP, (3)  determine the effect of islet packing density on the  performance of seeded HAPS, (4) determine the glucose-  induced insulin response of seeded HAPS perfused with media  containing different oxygen concentrations, (5) test for  periods of up to 2 months the best HAP configurations in a  small group of pancreatectomized rhesus monkeys, and (6)  develop comprehensive theoretical models for analysis of the  various transport experiments proposed.  ***",
