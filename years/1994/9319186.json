 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319186  Sides    This is an investigation of the kinetics of organometallic vapor-  phase epitaxy (OMVPE) of homoepitaxial cadmium telluride at both  the macroscopic and microscopic levels.  Macroscopic experiments  explore the effect of misorientation of substrates on the  morphology of OMVPE-deposited material.  Rate laws for step growth  and for hillock growth are developed in order to test the  hypothesis that steps are critical sites of reactions of the  commonly used sources dimethlycadmium and diisopropyltellurium.    A methodology will be developed to use rate laws to predict  conditions under which high-quality epitaxial films can be grown.   The effect of substrate surface microstructure on the elementary  reactions in the deposition mechanism is also investigated.   Scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and  other surface science techniques are employed.    Thin films of cadmium telluride and related compounds are  attractive for fabrication of devices involving light emitters,  radiation detectors, and optical switching.  At present, they are  prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a method that is slow,  cumbersome, and expensive.  Perfection of OMVPE techniques should  permit higher-volume, lower-cost production of these films, making  them acceptable for consumer applications.  It is to this end that  this effort is ultimately directed.  ***",
