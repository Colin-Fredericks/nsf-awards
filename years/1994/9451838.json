The scope of this project is  the development of laboratory course in experimental structural  engineering in order to expose students to modern methods.  Too  large-scale experiments will be conducted. The first experiment is  associated with the Reinforced Concrete Design course and is the  study of the behavior of a reinforced concrete column under static  and cyclic loading. Students will measure quantities of significant  importance in structural analysis and design, such as initial  stiffness, yield point, ultimate strength, dissipated energy,  member ductility and stiffness deterioration. The second experiment  is associated with the Reduction of Natural Hazards course and is  the study of determination of damping of a structural component.  Students will conduct oscillatory tests at different frequencies to  extract the dynamic mechanical characteristics of structural  component.  A capstone project will complete the course.  The  objectives in offering the course are twofold: a) to increase the  physical understanding of students, about structural behavior, in  a systematic and comprehensive way that will support and clarify  their theoretical knowledge, and b) to familiarize them with  current experimental techniques used in the state-of-the-art  industrial and academic laboratories.",
