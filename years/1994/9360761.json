 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360761  Sudarshan  Current processes for manufacturing  sapphire introduce a number of   defects such as die marks and growth  artifacts in the as-grown sapphire   blank. Thus these materials will need to  be polished prior to use in  optics. The  objective of this Phase I effort is to  develop a high  quality, high speed,  cost effective technique for polishing  sapphire  based optics. The two  methods currently used for polishing  sapphire are:  mechanical and  mechanochemical, both of which  involve scraping, grinding  and using  abrasives such as diamond or colloidal  silica. These methods  are expensive  because of the long times required for  polishing. Further,  due to the  application of mechanical pressure,  heat is generated at the  polishing  interface leaving behind defects that  affect optical  performance. Phase I will  establish the proof of concept by using  a dual  stage non-contact method to  remove planar layers of the sapphire  thus  achieving surface roughness on  the order of angstroms in both flat and   curved blanks. Optical characterization  will be performed on the polished   samples and correlated to the  processing parameters. In Phase II, we   propose expanding this technique for  optical domes. This technique can  also  be used for other applications involving  optical components such as  laser  cavity mirrors, laser beam mirrors,  lenses, windows with high  optical  transmission, components in floptical  disk drives and magnetic  disk drives.  **",
