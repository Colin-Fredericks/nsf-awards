His research area  is arithmetic algebraic geometry.  The specific problems to be  investigated focus on questions about algebraic cycles in  algebraic-geometric varieties associated with automorphic forms.   One goal of the research is to determine the Hodge structure,  and verify the Hodge conjecture, for particular special  constituents of these varieties.  A second goal is to analyze and  understand the groups of algebraic cycles modulo rational  equivalence for some Kuga-Shimura varieties.     Scope:  This project will be very beneficial to Prof. Gordon's  research by providing vital contact for an extended period with  some exceptional Indian theorists with whom he has had limited  contact at meetings and via e-mail.  He anticipates significant  interaction with two groups at  TIFR and one group at the new  Mehta Research Institute having common interests and expects  that after the necessary incubation time specific plans for  collaborations will develop.  Indian scientists excel in theoretical  mathematics and many mutual benefits may be expected to  result from the interaction.  Project corresponds with INT  guidelines by supporting a new activity that benefits a U.S.  scientist.      ***",
