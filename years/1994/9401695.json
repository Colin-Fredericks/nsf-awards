 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401695  Hu       This proposal concerns geometric and topological questions  on symplectic reductions, moduli spaces of vector bundles over  algebraic surfaces, and arithmetic quotients.  The investigator  plans to study the behavior of a symplectic reduction when  varying its defining datum (i.e. a symplectic form) and compare  its Gromov invariants with the equivariant Gromov invariants of  the original space.  He also plans to study the behavior of the  Gieseker and Uhlenbeck compactifications of the moduli space of  stable vector bundles on an algebraic surface when varying their  defining data (i.e. ample divisors).  Finally, he intends to  compare the cohomology of a toroidal compactification of an  arithmetic quotient with the intersection cohomology of the  Baily-Borel-Satake compactification.       Algebraic Geometry studies the geometry of the set of  solutions of a polynomial.  Symplectic Geometry is motivated by  Theoretical Physics, which studies the geometry of some  mathematical models originally coming from Physics.  The current  proposal deals with some questions on the structures of certain  important models in Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry.  These  models depend on a choice of parameters (such as numerical data).   It is natural and important to find out how the structure of a  model changes when we change the parameters.  A deep result  toward this will clarify the mysterious relation among the  structures of these models, leading to new insight into some  other important problems in the two fields.  It will have  numerous interesting applications to Physics, because Symplectic  Geometry was developed out of physical models.  ***",
