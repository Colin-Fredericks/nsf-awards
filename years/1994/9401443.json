In recent  years, McDuff has devoted her energies to developing the tools of  symplectic topology with the main aim of understanding the  topological structure of compact symplectic manifolds.  She  intends to continue working in the same general direction in the  next three years, in an attempt to solve some of the very  interesting problems which still remain.  Lowell Jones: Jones  will continue his collaborative efforts with F. T. Farrell,  investigating rigidity properties of the classical closed  spherical manifolds.  In prior work they have shown that closed  nonpositively curved manifolds and closed double coset manifolds  are topologically rigid, in dimensions > 5.  In work in progress  they show that any closed complete affine flat manifold is  topologically rigid, in dimensions > 5.  They have also  constructed many examples of strictly negatively curved closed  manifolds which are homeomorphic to one another but not  diffeomorphic, thus verifying that the class of nonpositively  curved manifolds does not enjoy smooth rigidity.  Whether or not  the class of closed double coset manifolds, or the class of  closed complete affine flat manifolds, are smoothly rigid remains  an open question which Jones intends to pursue.       Dusa McDuff: A symplectic structure is a very basic kind of  geometric structure which underlies all the equations of  classical and quantum physics.  In the last ten years, new tools  have been developed which allow mathematicians for the first time  to gain some understanding of the global meaning of this kind of  structure.   One focus of McDuff's work is the geometric  explora tion of the concept of energy.  In physics this is the  driving force of movement (of systems ranging from the planetary  system to plasmas).  The new methods of symplectic topology make  it possible in some cases to estimate the minimum energy required  to accomplish a certain movement.  This work is very basic and  should eventually have important implications in the study of  physical systems.  Another focus of her work is the attempt to  understand what a symplectic structure really is by investigating  the geometric properties of the spaces which are symplectic.  The  idea is that these spaces are the embodiment of the abstract idea  of a symplectic structure.  Lowell Jones: In 1829 and 1832 the  mathematicians N. Lobachevsky and J. Bolyai independently solved  a two thousand year old mathematical problem by verifying that  Euclid's fifth axiom for plane geometry is independent from the  first four of Euclid's axioms.  They did this by investigating a  new type of geometry having \"negative curvature.\"  Today the  2-dimensional geometries of Lobachevsky and Bolyai are important  special cases of the larger class of geometric structures having  \"non-positive curvature,\" which can occur in all the higher  dimensions, and which have been the focus of a tremendous amount  of research over the last forty years.  An important theme in  this research has been that each such geometric structure has an  associated algebraic structure (called the \"fundamental group\")  which acts as a sort of genetic code for the underlying geometric  structure.  Although it is far from true that the fundamental  group always determines the underlying geometric structure, this  is true in some special cases.  Jones has recently verified that  the fundamental group always does completely determine the  \"topological nature\" of the underlying geometric structure.  To  paraphrase this, Jones has shown that the fundamental group  determines the rough outline of the underlying geometric  structure, even though it does not de termine all the details of  the geometric structure.  ***",
