 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316627  Nunn    A large portion of the sediments within the northern Gulf Basin are  over pressured (i.e., contain pore pressures in excess of  hydrostatic).  In some areas, pore pressures may be more than 80%  of lithostatic pressure.  Development of geopressure is  permeability sediments in the miocene and particularly the Plio-  Pleistocene.  Water and carbon dioxide generated by thermobaric  chemical reactions, such as clay dehydration and hydrocarbon  maturation, may also contribute to the formation of excess pore  pressure.  Numerous studies have examined the formation of  geopressure in sedimentary basins and/or expulsion of geopressured  fluids into the overlying into the overlying hydropressured zone.   However, very little attention has been given to fluid flow within  the geopressured zone itself.  A number of priori considerations  make it likely that regional scale thermohaline convection may be  occurring within geopressured zones: 1) sediments are  undercompacted and therefore porous and permeable; 2)  undercompacted sediments have low thermal conductivities which  increases the conductive geothermal gradient; and 3( in the Gulf  Basin, dissolution of stratigraphically high salt in the form of  domes or allochthonous sheets produces dense saline brines which  further destabilizes the water column.  Movement of oils from  source rocks to reservoirs in the Gulf Basin requires as much as 10  km of vertical migration in a few million years.  Precipitation of  large amounts of quartz and calcite cements in some geopressured  sediments also implies fluid flow on a massive scale.  We propose  to carry out a two year study on the following aspects of  thermohaline conviction and theoretical diagenesis in heterogeneous  sediment sequences: 1) modify our existing numerical models to  simulate thermohaline convection beneath allochthonous salt sheets:  2) examine the effects of heterogeneous sediments (e.g., growth  faults and is continuous sand/shale layers) on fluid flow patterns;  3) dev elop and couple the physical models for thermohaline  convection to numerical models for quartz and calcite diagenesis  assuming that solubility is a function of temperature and salinity  only;  and 4) compare results from the numerical models to the  pattern of diagenesis in the Gulf Basin including the formation of  vertical or horizontal chemical seals.  ***",
