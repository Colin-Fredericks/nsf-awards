Sometimes such groups use  brainstorming procedures in which they try to generate as many  ideas as possible without concern for quality in a noncritical  atmosphere. It is presumed that such an approach will yield both  large numbers of ideas and a number of high quality ones. However,  research has demonstrated that brainstorming groups generate fewer  ideas and fewer high quality ideas than a comparable number of  individuals brainstorming alone.  Recent studies by the  investigator have provided evidence that social influence factors  may play a critical role in the performance of interactive groups.  There is a tendency for individuals in interactive groups to match  each others' performance. In laboratory groups with previously  unacquainted members, there also appears to be a tendency for the  low performing members to have a greater impact than high  performing ones. The social influence model suggests that the poor  performance of brainstorming groups results in part from their  tendency to develop low performance norms or standards. On the  other hand, the presence of productive group members may stimulate  the other group members to be more productive. In several  experiments using brainstorming groups of four individuals, the  ability of two of the participants to generate ideas will be  varied. In some conditions these two participants will be able to  generate many ideas, and in other conditions they will be able to  generate only a few ideas. It is expected that the variation in  rate of co-worker activity will influence the activity level of the  other participants during the brainstorming session as well as in  a subsequent session with new participants. This series of studies  will increase our understanding of the processes involved in group  brainstorming and group task performance in general. It is likely  that the  social processes observed in group brainstorming will  occur whenever group members combine their intellectual resources  with those of others in an attempt to achieve some product or goal.  Since much idea generation in science and industry involves group  interaction, this series of studies will provide important  information about the factors that influence both the productivity  and creativity of such groups. The results of this research may  suggest ways to enhance the effectiveness of groups on such tasks.",
