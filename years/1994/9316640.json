 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to understand the unimolecular reaction dynamics   of the ground electronic states of small molecules and hence of their   thermal unimolecular reactions.  Three kinds of experiments will be   conducted: 1) infrared spectroscopy of molecules activated with   sufficient vibrational energy to dissociate, 2) direct measurement of   dissociation rates in the range from 1 million to 100 billion per second,   and 3) measurement of product energy state and  angular momentum   distributions and their scalar and vector correlations as a function of   the initial quantum state of the activated molecule.  Special emphasis   will be given to two qualitatively different, prototype molecules- formyl   fluoride and ketene.    The dynamics of chemical reactions stands at the forefront of    investigations in contemporary physical chemistry.  The primary purpose   of these investigations is to obtain a detailed, molecular level   understanding of the energetics and dynamics of reaction processes.     This involves the preparation of a molecule in defined electronic,   vibrational, and rotational quantum states and  observing not only the   products of a reaction, but also how the total energy and angular   momentum redistribute themselves among the various possible reaction   channels followed by the parent molecule as it dissociates into   fragments. In contrast to conventional methods in which chemical   reactions can be only crudely controlled through variations of   temperature and pressure, and in which all possible reaction channels are   followed, a detailed, molecular level understanding of the reaction   dynamics offers the possibility of close control of a reaction and   thereby maximizing  the efficiency of producing the desired reaction   products.  The present research will provide critical data which will   allow the testing and further development of state-of-the-art theoretical   models for various aspects of chemical reaction kinetics and dynamics.",
