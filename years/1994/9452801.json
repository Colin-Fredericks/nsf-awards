Before the trainees can begin a serious       career as educational innovators, they will have solid content       mastery of a science area.  2.   The process of knowing - develop a sound understanding of the       research methods and results in cognitive science -       participate in the workshop developed by Robert Karplus and       others entitled Physics Teaching and the Development of       Reasoning.  3.   Educational research methods - become familiar with a variety       of educational research both quantitative and qualitative       methods.  4.   Hypermedia - learn how to develop instructional lessons using       hypermedia including including applications software,       interactive digital video and microcomputer-based laboratory       interfaces.  5.   Varied teaching experiences - serve as an assistant in a       physics course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,       participate in a workshop entitled Developing Student       Confidence in Physics - serve one semester as a teaching       intern in the Department of Physics of the United State Air       Force Academy.  6.   Global perspective - spend one semester as research assistant       in the physics education group in the Department of Physics of       the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.   7.   Dissemination and teacher training experience.  The trainees       will spend a semester as an intern in a mulitmedia        dissemination and teacher training company, The Learning Team       in Armonk, NY.",
