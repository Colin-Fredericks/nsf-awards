 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Kravaris - 9403432      The chemical industry is dominated by processes that exhibit nonlinearities.  For example, polymerization reactors, high-purity distillation columns, bioprocesses, etc. are highly nonlinear processes.  The digital computer-based implementation of nonlinear control laws in industry has motivated the development of nonlinear, discrete-time process control methods.  The cornerstone of all the discrete-time control algorithms is the inevitable time-discretization of a continuous-time, nonlinear dynamic system, which is an open problem.  The development of a reliable discretization procedure for nonlinear, continuous-time systems, especially when the sampling period becomes large, based on the fact that in many industrial control problems, certain measurements are performed at low sampling rates.  For example, chemical composition measurements are usually performed under a much lower sampling rate (e.g. gas chromatography) compared to temperature measurements.    The overall objective of this research is the development of methods for analyzing the behavior of nonlinear chemical processes subject to slow sampling and synthesizing stable and robust, digital control systems that meet design specifications.  The conceptual framework of differential geometry will be use to:  1.  Develop a time-discretization procedure for nonlinear, continuous-time systems, especially where the sampling period becomes large.  2.  Study the effect of sampling and the particular discretization procedure upon the nonminimum-phase characteristics of a nonlinear, discrete-time process model.  3.  Develop nonlinear multirate control algorithms which use the infrequent and frequent measurements effectively in order to induce a desirable closed-loop behavior for the process under consideration.  4.  Design discrete-time, nonlinear state estimators which will be used to reconstruct the unmeasurable state variables.  5.  Experimentally verify these control strategies by application to polymerizat ion reactors.",
