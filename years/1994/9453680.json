 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453680  Watson    Texas A&M University will develop a model program in science, engineering and mathematics  (SEM) for women undergraduate and graduate students, with courses and activities, including  mentoring, to encourage them to complete degrees in SEM fields, and consider careers in  research.  The courses will be connected with special team training activities for women in  SEM.  Seminars on gender issues, as they relate to students in these fields, will be planned and  facilitated by students for their peers, faculty, employers, and public school educators.  The  project will involve students, faculty, and staff in the planning and presentation of Faculty  Workshops relative to the classroom, laboratory and general environment for women in SEM.   The overall goal is to improve the retention of women in these fields by enhancing their sense  of belonging and acceptance, and to begin to change the faculty/staff who have created the  environment contributing to women's lack of retention in SEM.  Particular attention will be  given to issues which concern women who also must deal with professional barriers to  development or added burdens imposed by society.    To effect retention of women in SEM, courses which apply toward degree credit will be  developed at the freshman, junior, and graduate level.  The freshman course will cover the  history of women in science, engineering and mathematics, and fulfill a three-hour humanities  requirement for any curriculum on campus.  The course will have a weekly laboratory  component which will be linked to the achievements of one or more of the women studied in  class.  The junior course will cover the Sociology of Women in non-traditional fields, especially  science, engineering, and mathematics, and will fulfill an upper level social science requirement  in any curriculum on campus.  It will cover topics such as:  social structure of gender and  knowledge, the law, access and opportunities, and politics and unwritten policies.  The intent  is to he lp develop professional and personal skills which can enhance careers in SEM.  The  graduate courses, two one-hour seminars, will discuss procedures and politics, as well as make  suggestions for excellence in university research and teaching careers.  Course materials, (texts,  instructor manuals, and laboratory manuals) will be prepared for dissemination of the courses  to other campuses.  ***",
