The study will concentrate on  the fundamental problems of welding and connections.  Some  subassemblages will be tested to study:  1.   The effect of backing bars.  By experiments with  backing bars and with such bars removed and weld roots  cleaned and rewelded, the extent of improvement in behavior  would be documented.    2.   The effect of dams and run-off tabs at the ends of full-  penetration groove welds.  A few experiments illustrating  the influence of such dams versus run-off tabs would be  valuable.    3.   The general use of FCAW high deposition electrodes.  Although the FCAW high deposition electrodes are almost  universally used, laboratory experience using GMAW (stick)  often shows better results.    4.   The contribution of preheat and controlled cooling to  the integrity of joints.  Cases where AWS guidelines are  exceeded or violated would indicate sensitivity to this  parameter.    5.   The effect of size on joint integrity.  In many of the  failed joints during the Northridge Earthquake, steel member  sizes, driven by desire for long clear spans, were very  large.    6.   Improved details for large-size connections.  Some  possible details will be studied for enhancing such joints  by forcing the critical plastic hinge away from the face of  the column.  Testing of several specimens of different size  is contemplated.  This may include specimens with concrete  slabs.  Capacity analyses will be used in establishing  member sizes, as well as in developing design requirements.    7.   Residual Stress Distribution.  The residual stresses  together with those imposed by dead and live (earthquake)  loads that can cause failures of the type repeatedly  observed in steel building joints in the damaged area.    8.   Cantilever Beam-Column Subassemblages.  It is planned  to fabricate and test two conventional beam-column  subassemblages.    9.   Cantilevers on Both Sides of Col umn.  Due to limitation  of the funds, only a single specimen is contemplated.  The  main purpose of this test is to study the panel zone, as  well as beam connections.    This project is coordinated with companion projects at the  University of California at San Diego and at the University  of Texas at Austin.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
