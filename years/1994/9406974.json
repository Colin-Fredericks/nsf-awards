 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406974  Lucas  This award supports studies on the molecular and cellular  characterization of higher plant plasmodesmata (PD).  The capacity  of plasmodesmata to engage in macromolecular trafficking of  proteins and nucleic acids will be studies using a combination of  techniques.  Functional and mutant viral movement proteins (MPs)  will be used in microinjection studies to examine the molecular  basis of the interaction between these MPs, their cognate viral RNA  (vRNA), and plasmodesmata.   This powerful combination of molecular  virology and cell biology opens the way for the identification of  the molecular determinants of virus-plant host specificity, as well  as the elucidation of the functional domains on the viral MPs.  The  MPs of four plant viruses will be used in these studies; red clover  necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), sunn  hemp mosaic virus (SHMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV).  In order  to more fully understand the role played by plasmodesmata in the  orchestration of plant development and physiological function, it  is important that the sub-structural component (proteins) be  isolated, cloned and sequenced.  To this end, secondary PD will be  isolated from TMV MP transgenic tobacco plants.  The physiological  and molecular basis for the TMV MP-induced alteration in carbon  partitioning will be investigated using a range of experimental  approaches.  The reduction in root-to-shoot ratios observed in TMV  MP transgenic tobacco will form the diagnostic basis for these  studies.  Tissue grafting experiments will permit the  identification of the plant tissue involved in this reallocation  phenomenon.  The hypothesis that macromolecular (protein)  trafficking through PD plays a role in plant development will be  tested using the maize Knotted-1 mutant system.      Results from these studies on the molecular determinants of viral  MP-PD interaction will provide us with greater insights into the  requirements for PD macromolecular trafficking.  Purifica tion and  identification of PD proteins will provide the foundation for a  detailed structure/function analysis of this unique intercellular  organelle.  Details on the molecular events underlying the TMV MP-  induced alteration in carbon partitioning will provide the  foundation for the identification and study of endogenous  signal/regulatory pathways that mediate in the integration of  physiological processes from the tissue to the whole plant level.   All such data on macromolecular transport through PD will  contribute to testing the hypothesis that plants function as  supracelluar rather than multicellular organisms.  ***",
