 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404430  Schumaker  This proposal describes four major projects. (1) Stochastic  dynamical models will be developed for the multi-ion permeation  of Cs+ through Gramicidin A. A starting point for this study will  be the single-ion permeation models of Jakobsson and Chiu.  Appropriate physical interactions between each ion and the pore,  and between multiple ions in the channel, will be included.  Results will be compared with experimental data available for Cs+  permeation through Gramicidin. (2) Preliminary analytical results  on an \"orientation independence\" symmetry of the shaking stack  reversal potential will be generalized to include general  single-vacancy models. The symmetry will also be tested  numerically, and its sensitivity to surface charge effects will  be studied. The proof of the symmetry will also be extended from  a discrete state (Markov chain) formalism to a new diffusive  formalism. Recent K+ channel mutagenesis experiments can be  interpreted in terms of structural models compatible with the  shaking stack mechanism. Therefore, results on the orientation  independence symmetry will be compared with experimental data  available for K+ channel reversal potentials. (3) Preliminary  work, using a discrete state formalism, shows that a class of  symmetrical shaking stack conduction mechanisms predict a  specific relationship between conductance measurements (in the  presence of only a single permeant ion) and bi-ionic reversal  potential measurements. This relationship could provide an  important experimental test of the shaking stack or related  mechanisms. The result will be generalized to a broader class of  conduction mechanisms, and a sensitivity analysis performed to  see how it persists in the absence of certain simplifying  assumptions. (4) The nonlinear Boltzmann equation is used in  combination with Stern condensation to model the distribution of  ions in an electrolyte in the presence of fixed charges.  Variational methods will be used to minimize free energy and  ob tain formulas for the Stern association constant in both planar  and spherical geometries.  %%%  Ion channels are proteins found on the surface of cell membranes  which allow certain kinds of ions to pass through those  membranes. These channels are important both fundamentally,  because of their vital role in the electrical properties of  membranes, and also practically, since they are the targets of a  large class of pharmaceuticals. This study is especially  concerned with ion channels that appear to hold two or more ions  within their conducting pore at one time; these are known as  multi-ion channels. Several biologically important potassium  channels are believed to be examples. The proposal includes four  major projects. (1) Computer simulations of the permeation of Cs+  through the antibiotic ion channel Gramicidin A. Although Cs+ is  not an important biological ion, the Gramicidin pore can  apparently hold two Cs+ ions at once. This is probably the  simplest experimental model of a multi-ion channel. (2) A  mathematical and computer study of a qualitative property  (\"orientation independence\") which characterizes the conductance  of a class of mechanisms (\"shaking stack\" models) that have been  proposed to explain conduction through potassium channels.  Orientation independence can be tested experimentally. (3) A  mathematical and computer study of a second relationship that  certain symmetrical shaking stack models predict will hold  between certain kinds of conductance measurements. This second  relationship is particularly distinctive. Finding it  experimentally would provide strong evidence for the shaking  stack or related conduction mechanisms. (4) A theoretical study  of the direct condensation of ions on charged chemical groups  which appear on the surface of ion channel or biological  membranes. This condensation process is known to alter the  conduction properties of ion channels.  ***",
