 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9407267  Diane Matesic      This research will investigate a very novel idea proposed by this young scientist, Dr. Matesic. She has observed that there are increases in the connections (gap junctions) between cultured neurons containing an important hypothalamic hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) when those cultured neurons are treated with chemicals known to increase the levels of an intracellular messenger molecule called cyclic AMP. LHRH-containing neurons in the hypothalamus secrete LHRH in a coordinated, pulsatile manner. The mechanisms that establish coordinated secretion of LHRH by these neurons are unknown. Dr. Matesic's idea is that electrotonic coupling via gap junctions located at points of interconnection between LHRH neurons may play a role in coordinated LHRH secretion. This is a novel idea and, therefore, support of preliminary research of this work is particularly critical. To do this work, Dr. Matesic is capitalizing on her training in gap junctional intercellular communication in rat liver cells to extend these ideas to the nervous system. This work will increase our understanding of the role of gap junctions in the coordinated activities between many types of neurons within the central nervous system.",
