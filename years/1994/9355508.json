During the  three years of this project two groups of 24 physics teachers,  selected from the San Francisco Bay Area schools, will take part in  a two summer teacher enhancement program involving a total of six  weeks of instruction along with ten one-day workshops distributed  over two academic years.  Participant will have the opportunity to  fabricate some equipment of their own design based on their  curriculum needs.  During the academic year, special workshops for  participants will be conducted by faculty from nationally  recognized MBL facilities.  Each participant will receive a variety  of teaching materials and $400 in interfacing equipment for use in  their respective schools.  Participants may earn 16 units of  academic credit.",
