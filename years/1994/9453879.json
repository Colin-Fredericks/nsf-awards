HRN currently produce and  distribute two Spanish language radio programs.  Their plan is to  incorporate into these programs information about ways parents  and other adults can help children improve their math and science  skills; about educational resources, scholarships, and career  opportunities in the sciences; about the importance of science in  everyday lives; and other information on current topics in  science and the environment.  Special attention will be paid to  information relevant to Hispanic migrant workers.              The PI for the planning grant will be Jeff Kline, General  Manager of HRN.  Key HRN staff to be involved in the planning  include Consuelo Luz, producer of \"Buscando la Belleze,\" and  Enrique Gil, co-producer of \"Salvemos Nuestro Planeta.  Vincente  Llamas, Principal Investigator for the Comprehensive Regional  Center for Minorities in Las Vegas will be a principal  consultant.",
