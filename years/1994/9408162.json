 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408162 Mahin Considerable research is underway throughout the world to identify effective, practical and reliable methods for evaluating the seismic safety of existing bridges and for reducing their vulnerability through retrofit.  The U.S. and Japan are at the forefront of these activities, as well as of their practical implementation.  It is important for researchers and practitioners from the U.S. and Japan to meet periodically to exchange technical data as well as to identify issues of mutual concern and opportunities for cooperative study.  The project convenes a second U.S.  Japan Workshop on Seismic Retrofit of Bridges.  This workshop will be held in conjunction with the U.S.   Japan Workshop on Earthquake Protective Systems for Bridges.  This seismic retrofit workshop will focus on recent research and applications of retrofit technology, rather than state of the art reviews.  Topics to be covered during the workshop include: (1) advanced assessment and prioritization techniques; (2) design methods for seismic retrofit of bridges; (3) issues related to foundation evaluation and retrofit; (4) case studies of bridge assessment and retrofit; (5) recent research; and (6) the development of comparative retrofit examples.  Both steel and reinforced concrete bridges will be covered and issues related to the broad spectrum of bridges found throughout  the U.S. and Japan are addressed. ***",
