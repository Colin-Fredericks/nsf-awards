The  program is a three-week summer residential Young Scholars project  in mathematics with follow-up activities during the academic year.  The program is designed to accomplish the following objectives:  enhance students' positive attitudes toward mathematics and  statistics; develop confidence in their potential in the field of  mathematics; encourage the female students to pursue careers in  mathematics; and to incorporate mathematical skills and thinking in  their everyday lives. This will be accomplished through classroom  discussions, field trips and participation in hands-on laboratory  activities. Instructional classroom activities will be conducted by  professors from the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics on  the campus of the University of Michigan.",
