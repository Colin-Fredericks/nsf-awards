 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405117  Jenson       Unstable ice-sheet behavior is now recognized as an important  characteristic of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during the last  glaciation, and it played a crucial role in forcing abrupt climate  change in the circum-North Atlantic region and perhaps globally.   In this collaborative work, we propose to evaluate mechanisms of  unstable ice-sheet behavior based on the late-Pleistocene  sedimentary record of the Des Moines and Lake Michigan lobes along  the southern margin of the LIS.  This behavior is far better  documented by well-dated records of these lobes than for any other  sector of the ice sheet, thus providing the best opportunity to  explore mechanisms of such behavior and it relationship to abrupt  climate change.  Results from this research will have significant  application to other areas where unstable behavior of the LIS  occurred, but which are less well-constrained by the geologic  record (for example, Hudson Strait).       Models of ice-sheet instability thus far have treated the  sources of the instability as arising from internal ice-sheet  dynamics involving saturated, deforming subglacial sediment.  The  Des Moines and Lake Michigan lobes advanced across fine-grained  sediments that, when water saturated, would have deformed under the  shear stress applied by the ice.  Additional studies, however,  suggest external (climate) forcing mechanisms for unstable ice-  sheet behavior.  We will continue our collaborative work of  integrating field, experimental, and modeling studies to  investigate potential forcing mechanisms.  Our field studies will  center on those aspects of the sediment record that offer the most  information on subglacial processes with respect to mechanisms of  ice-sheet behavior as well as for comparison to modeling studies.   Our experimental work will involve using geotechnical analyses of  fine-grained diamictons deposited by the lobes to define the range  in rheological parameters of different till sheets that are needed  in the co nstitutive sediment flow law we use in modeling studies.   We will use a one-dimensional coupled ice-sediment numerical model  that integrates results of experimental work to investigate  mechanisms of unstable ice-sheet behavior due to internal ice-sheet  dynamics or external climate forcing.  Finally, we will focus on  intercomparison of results from field and modeling studies of  subglacial hydrology, subglacial sediment processes, and sediment  transport fluxes.",
