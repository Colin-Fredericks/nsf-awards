The meeting  will be held at the Casa Sirena Marina Hotel, Oxnard, California,  January 29 - February 3, 1995.  Funds will be used to defray the  expenses of junior scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers), and invited speakers.    The 1995 Gordon Research Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants  will be the sixth meeting of the conference; it was first held in  1984, and since 1989, has met on a biennial basis.  The overall  goal of the conference is to foster the exchange of ideas and  research findings among a diverse group of scientists studying  plant temperature stress from a wide variety of perspectives.   Scientists who attend this meeting include agronomists,  horticulturists, plant breeders, ecologists, plant physiologists,  biochemists, biophysicists and molecular biologists who are  affiliated with universities, private and governmental research  laboratories, and commercial companies from both North America and  overseas.      As in the past, the 1995 Gordon Conference will include sessions  covering the latest developments in fundamental aspects of plant  temperature stress (e.g., temperature stress proteins, temperature  signal transduction, whole plant responses to temperature stress,  breeding for increased temperature stress tolerance).  In addition,  the 1995 conference will have two novel features.  One will be the  development of a particular theme over the course of the meeting:  the role of membranes in temperature stress tolerance.  The  objective is to explore the current state of knowledge of the  regulation and function of plant phospholipids and potential  strategies to modify phospholipid composition to improve the  temperature stress tolerance of plants.  The other novel aspect  will be the inclusion of a \"cross-over\" session examining the  similarities and differences in mechanisms of temperature  and  drought tolerance.  This session will involve presentations by  investigators working on tolerance to drought and desiccation and  provide a bridge to plant scientists working in related areas of  environmental stress, but outside of temperature per se.  ***",
