The types of samples to be investigated include  single element ultra-thin films on single crystal substrates,  ferromagnetic bi-layers, wedged samples and superlattices.  The  properties to be investigated include enhanced magnetic moments at  surfaces, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of ultrathin films, and  coupling between ferromagnetic layers.  Novel magnetic properties  found in these materials will be related to possible applications  and improvements in magnetic devices.  A newly developed x-ray  magnetic circular dichroism microscope will be used for fundamental  studies of interlayer exchange coupling in wedged samples and to  understand micromagnetic interactions in spin-valves, magnetic  memory devices, and spin transistors.    %  %  %  %    Magnetic ultrathin films of transition metals will be studied using  a variety of surface sensitive techniques including polarized beams  of soft x-rays.
