There has  been  considerable effort devoted to exploring correlations  between  such physical properties as diffusional relaxation times,  conductivity and sound velocity, and the hydrodynamic  permeability and dispersion coefficient.  These macroscopic  constants are linked because they arise by solving similar  equations on the same microstructure.  We will construct  bounds  and estimators of permeability and dispersion coefficient  based  on knowledge of more easily measured properties.  This  problem  has been studied for some time, and was pioneered in work by  Schlumberger scientists.       The transport and dispersion of solutes in porous media  will  be analyzed through analysis and numerical calculation of  different microstructures, e.g. networks of capillaries or  intergranular space.  We will perform theoretical and  numerical  studies in which we will concentrate on the following  issues: i)  building efficient numerical algorithms for modelling 3D  transport in porous media, ii) modelling porous media which  are  bi-periodic or contain two or more characteristic scales,  iii)  studying flow and dispersion in partially saturated porous  media.",
