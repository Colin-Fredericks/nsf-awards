 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with development, analysis and  evaluation of algorithms for signal/image processing in addition  to, or in lieu of, the usual second order statistics.  Both time  series (only system output is observed) and system identification  (both input and output are observed) formulations are being  considered; and both one-dimensional and multidimensional signals  and systems are being investigated.  Whereas the second order  statistics of signals are a function of only the underlying system  transfer function magnitude, higher order Statistics (HOS) of the  data carry useful information about the phase characteristics of  the underlying signal/system which is crucial in deconvolution  problems such as those arising in digital communication channel  equalization, seismic wavelet processing, and image restoration,  analysis and synthesis.    Time domain as well as frequency domain methods using higher order  cumulant functions and higher order cumulant spectra (or higher  order integrated cumulant spectra), respectively, are being  pursued.  Among the applications being investigated are: (i) image  texture synthesis and classification, (ii) differential time-delay  and doppler estimation in unknown spatially correlated Gaussian  noise, (iii) blind deconvolution with unknown, possibly nonminimum  phase, channels including image restoration, and (iv) system  identification with noise inputs.",
