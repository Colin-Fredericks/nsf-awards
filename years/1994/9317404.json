Stein, Department of Polymer Science and  Engineering, University of Massachusetts,  Amherst, and Professor Tisato Kajiyama,  Department of Chemical Science and Technology,  Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.  Professor  Muthukumar Murugappan, University of  Massachusetts, will also be involved in the  project.  The joint research will focus on the  use of polymer dispersed liquid crystals as  display and light control devices.  The  investigators will study the phase diagram for  polymer-liquid crystal mixture and the kinetics  of phase separation.    The studies will involve two phases:  (a)  discrete systems and (b) bicontinuous systems.   Preliminary studies have already been carried  out on the discrete systems.  The purpose of  the present project is to extend these studies  to bicontinuous systems, to more fully explore  the liquid crystals orientation distribution  within domains and its change with applied  fields, to study surface anchoring forces  between the liquid crystals and the domain  walls and the effect of surface modification on  these, to study and explain the time dependence  of orientation changes and its effect on  scattering and to theoretically model these  phenomena.         ***",
