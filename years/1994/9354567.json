The  instructional materials include detailed lecture outlines and notes,  problems and examples, laboratory units, computer software, audio/video  recordings and instructor's guides. The University of Pittsburgh is  teamed with four other institutions, the Iowa State University, the  University of Minnesota, the Pennsylvania State University and the  University of Texas (Austin), to develop this undergraduate curriculum.  Faculty members from these five institutions, representing chemical,  petroleum, and mechanical engineering, and mineral processing, together  with a diverse group of industrial partners, are working as an  interdisciplinary team to ensure a balanced approach to the curriculum  development. A network of corporate members of major engineering  societies, including AFS, AlChE, AIME, ASEE, ASME, and SPE, is also  included in the project. The role of these professional societies is to  help promote the importance of the curriculum, and to assist in achieving  the ultimate goal of wide dissemination and adoption of the educational  materials.  ***y",
