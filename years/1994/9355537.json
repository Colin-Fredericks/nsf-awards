The four original sites are Mason City,  Davenport, Chariton and Creston.  The six new sites which will  provide statewide coverage areCharles City, Hampton, Denison,  Johnston, Iowa City and Fairfield.  These latter sites will test  the transportability of the Iowa SS&C model.  Frameworks and  approaches will be completed for grades 6-8 and continue the work  started in grades 9-10.  At each of the four sites 30 teachers will  participate.  Different leaders 6-8 will be involved as the middle  school programs are completed.  Ninth grade teachers will be the  major focus for 1994-95 and tenth grade teachers for 1995-96.  Over  the three year period of the project 120 teachers in grades 6-10  will participate.    The Teacher Enhancement activities follow the Iowa Chautauqua  inservice model: a two week leadership conference including  teachers from each site and all grade levels; a 3-week summer  workshop at each site for all teachers at a given grade level, with  representative teachers from preceding and following grades; two  day courses each academic semester for site leaders and other  personnel; weekly meetings of teachers at specific grade levels in  each participating school; and, monthly 2-day inservice meetings  involving all teachers at each site.    As part of the project evaluation student learning is assessed in  6-domains via pre- and post-test methods.  The cost-sharing support  comes from local schools, intermediate school districts, the Iowa  Utility Association, other industries and the University of Iowa.",
