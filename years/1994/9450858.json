 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geologists are using personal computers in all phases of work in  both academic and industrial applications. It is imperative that  undergraduate students be exposed to many computer-oriented  applications in order to have a smooth transition to graduate  school or the work place in a more professional, efficient, and  less stressful manner. The use of portable computer equipment in  geology field camp, a required undergraduate course in an unique  environment (full time work with real problems), is an ideal  educational opportunity. The following applications are being  initiated: stratigraphic analysis, structural analysis using stereo  nets, computer-generated contour maps (use and pitfalls),  geological map and cross section preparation, and graphical  illustrations and geological report writing. In addition, the  portable nature of the hardware allows use of this equipment in  mineralogy, petrology, economic, structure, hydrology, and  geophysics labs during the rest of the year. This allows students  to solve geological problems without leaving the lab and the  instructor in order to go to computer cluster locations. Overall,  the enhancement not only allows for quicker and more professional  products, but most importantly, old exercises are updated to a new  level of modern geology and geological analysis.",
