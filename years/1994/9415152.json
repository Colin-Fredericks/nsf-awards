 "awd_abstract_narration": "St. Norbert College, a liberal arts institution established in 1891, is the  recipient of ARI funds to renovate John Minahan Science Hall, a 27 year old  facility, to improve research space for the Division of Natural Sciences.   Students engage in original research, learn to use sophisticated equipment,  and author papers and present results at professional conferences.  Active  learning and research training in environmental science, biology, chemistry,  and geology, and independent and collaborative senior thesis projects,  mandate efficient use of laboratory space and the college is committed in  accommodating this type of space.  Existing research and research training,  and support space will be reconfigured, providing greater opportunities for  students to  conduct research on a daily basis.  Once renovations are  completed, dedicated laboratory space will support research training in  ichthyology, environmental chemistry and measurements, ecology,  limnology and hydrology.  This award will enable the Division to increase its  ability to conduct quality research and research training and to attract  additional faculty and students.  An enhanced facility will help students  appreciate and understand the scientific process.  The College is committed to  science education, which cannot be obtained without an integral research  component.  St. Norbert's goal is to continue to train scientists of the highest  caliber for the 21st century.",
