 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224946 Cangellaris  Numerical techniques for the modeling of electromagnetic wave interactions in linear and nonlinear photonics devices will be developed.  These numerical techniques are for the solution of the full wave vector Maxwell's equations coupled with microscopic and macroscopic materials models and will emphasize massively-parallel computing environments for any actual calculations.  The techniques to be developed includespectrall and hybrid spectral/finite difference time domain (FDTD) schemes, aimed at the rigorous, efficient and accurate modeling of time-harmonic and pulsed wave propagation over long distance in linear and nonlinear media.  More specifically, emphasis will be placed on two specific topics: a) the use of spectral techniques for the solution of the scalar and vectorial Helmholtz equation in inhomogeneous, anisotropic domains with applications to time-harmonic wave propagation in integrated optics waveguides and diffraction by two-dimensional gratings; b) the use of hybrid spectral/FDTD techniques for the numerical integration of the nonlinear time-dependent Maxwell's equations in two dimensions with application to optical pulse propagation in nonlinear Kerr media. These numerical techniques will be benchmarked against analytical theory in simple geometries and experimental results involving more complicated configurations. The direct products of this project will be the numerical methods and associated computer codes, validation analyses, and supporting document.  The anticipated results will lay a foundation for a more rigorous and more efficient set of numerical methods that will be used eventually to create realistic numerical simulators for the engineering design of integrated optics devices and systems.",
