 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361440  Bartz  Root research is conducted to improve the drought resistance of food crops, to study  root response to soil conditions and contamination, and for research on disease  mechanisms.  Improving food production is of major importance in the United States and  a matter of survival in many third world countries.    Early studies correlated the roots observed in these views with samples of roots dug up  destructively in soil samples and meticulously washed and measured.  Recent system-  improvements cut the average time to take each picture and increased the amount of  data that could be gathered by 500%.  New cameras allow higher magnification for  viewing fungi and micro organisms.  More accurate movement of the microscope is  needed.    This research will apply computer control and automation to the video microscope in  order to:    1.  Decrease the time and labor required to gather the photographs.  2.  Improve the accuracy of registration so the photo is of the same place.  3.  Make the index depth intervals easily adjustable in the program.  4.  Improve the marking of each picture to take the data back off the tape         faster and with less operator input.  5.  Produce a system designed for an attainable price.  ***",
