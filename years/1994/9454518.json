 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University Middletown, in partnership with the major chemical  industries in Ohio and a regional consortium of two-year and  four-year colleges and high schools, is establishing a regional  consortium for Chemical Technology Education. By bringing academic  courses into closer touch with today's industrial chemistry, the  project is attracting additional students to careers in chemistry  and improving the quality of education of chemical technicians.   Four categories of activities are envisioned for the project:  1) Curriculum Development; 2) Instructional Materials Development;  3) Faculty and Teacher Enhancement; and 4) Student Enhancement and  Outreach. High school and college faculty are eligible for a  Teacher Industrial Internship Program in which participants spend  a summer or part of an academic year working in partner industries.  Similarly, master high school teachers and two-year college faculty  are working in collaboration with industrial chemists in developing  curriculum and instructional  materials. Symposia and special topic  seminars are also being organized on a regular basis.  The project  is being built upon the nationally known eight-year old Partners  for Terrific Science industrial/academic partnership and programs  housed in the Center for Chemical Education at Miami University  Middletown, as well as existing collaborative efforts of the  consortium members. This project is serving as a model for regional  and national development of improved chemical technician education.",
