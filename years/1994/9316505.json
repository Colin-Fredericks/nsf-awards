 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to develop and refine analytical  techniques to characterize and date volcanic ash, or tephra, that  is often found in ice cores from large ice sheets.  Tephras  layers in ice sheets are particularly valuable because, if they  are from large eruptions, they form unique time-stratigraphic  markers.  The chemistry of the tephra can be used to determine  the provenance, or origin, of the material and 40Ar/39Ar dating has  potential to provide an absolute age of the layer.  However,  because the amount of material in tephra layers is very small,  both in total mass and in terms of particle size, it is important  to develop appropriate analytical techniques that can  successfully characterize and date small samples.  Refinement of  the laser fusion technique for argon extraction prior to isotopic  analysis of is a significant challenge.  However, if successful,  this work would be a substantial benefit to studies of ice cores  as an independent dating tool.  Furthermore, characterization and  dating of tephra from ice cores will provide important  information to climate models.",
