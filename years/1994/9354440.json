 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354440  Roy  This project responds to a documented national need for enhanced  expertise in the area of materials synthesis and processing by  developing two courses on ceramic materials synthesis. The courses  consist of lectures by eminent scholars in the field of materials  science and engineering which are videotaped. The videotapes are  available to other institutions, and each course features a weekly  one-hour call-in period for students to ask questions of the  lecturer. The videotapes are also to provide continuing education  to faculty members who act as tutors at remote sites where the  courses are offered. This approach is significant for faculty  enhancement in fields where there is an identified shortage of  faculty with adequate expertise in the field. This is true both of  ceramics in general and ceramic materials synthesis in particular.  In addition to the videotapes, the tutors and students receive  copies of overhead transparencies, scripts, homework problems and  solutions, and examinations. The videotapes and instructional  materials are disseminated by the Materials Education Council  located at the Pennsylvania State University.",
