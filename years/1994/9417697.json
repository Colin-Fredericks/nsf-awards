 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative project with Argentine  geologists and paleontologists to study late Cretaceous to early Tertiary marine  fossils in southern Patagonia.  The US contribution will focus on decapod  crustaceans (crabs).  Studies of Cretaceous an dTertiary decapod crustacean  faunas from several sites in the southern hemisphere has provided clear  evidence of faunal relationships between New Zealand and Antarctica, and less  well understood relationships between those faunas and the decapods of South  America.  Recent study of Paleocene decapods from La Pampa and R o Negro  provinces, central Argentina, has suggested affinities of these organisms with  tropical and subtropical Atlantic communities.  Thus, the biogeographic  boundaries between the Atlantic and southern circum-Pacific regions must lie  within southern Patagonia.    This award will allow the US investigators to join an Argentine field program that  is being planned to study Cretaceous and early Tertiary fossiliferous marine  rocks in remote regions of southwestern Patagonia.  This is a unique  opportunity to gather valuable information about the distribution of these crabs  in a remote region.  The objectives of this project are: 1) to collect, describe,a  nd classify the decapods crustaceans from Cretaceous and Tertiary exposures  in southern Patagonia; 2) to determine the implications of this fauna for the  paleobiogeographic evolution of the southern high latitudes; and 3) to assess  the significance of these organisms to our understanding of the origin and  evolution of modern decapods.  This work is important to creating a  paleoenvironmental framework for interpretation of the important Cretaceous  and Tertiary faunas from Seymour Island, Antarctica.",
