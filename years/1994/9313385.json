 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stensel         The problems in environmental engineering and science have become broader,  more complex and more sophisticated over the past 10-15 years.  Water and waste  water treatment issues have been joined by concerns about ground water  contamination, sediment contamination, pollution prevention and recycle, handling of  toxic and hazardous substances, drinking water quality, sludge reclamation and  disposal, nutrient removal and air quality.  Thus, environmental engineering problems  are multi media requiring knowledge of the behavior of contaminants and their  interaction in air, soil and water.  The University of Washington has first class  research and research training programs that focus on these environmental engineering  issues.  This award will support the renovation of their environmental engineering  laboratories which is an area of about 9500 square feet.  The renovation will  reorganize lab areas, provide improved ventilation for toxic compounds and reaction  studies, improve the heating and air conditioning systems, improve bench tops and  cabinets, and provide proper areas for analytical equipment.  This renovation project  will impact about 15 faculty and 100 graduate students.  Finally, this more modern  facility will add capability and capacity to  researchers involved in biotransformation  and bioremediation research, research integral to understanding environmental  transformations.",
