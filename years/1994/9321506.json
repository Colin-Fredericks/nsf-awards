 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321506  Bekaert  Despite the importance of exchange rate movements in an  increasingly integrated world economy, we have not developed  good economic models that guide our understanding of the  behavior of exchange rates over time. This has lead to a  widespread belief that currency markets are inefficient.  This research develops several exchange rate models in an  attempt to explain various empirical regularties of exchange  rates without having to resort to market inefficiency  arguments. The models assume that markets are efficient and  the market participants are rational but risk averse.The  empirical part of the study examines how well the models fit  actual exchange rate data.       The first model concentrates on high variability of  exchange rates and how this variability changes over time.  The second model focusses on the predictability of  international asset returns. In an extension to this model,  the effect of the credibility of monetary policy on asset  markets is examined. The third model examines why, for  example, is the dollar amount to buy a comparable basket of  consumption goods in the United States versus Japan so  different?  Here, the study explores whether non-traded  goods, such as houses, and the existence of a sizable  government sector are the main source of the puzzling  behavior of exchange rates and consumption prices across  countries.  ***",
