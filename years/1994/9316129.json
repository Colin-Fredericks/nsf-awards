 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316129  Mathez  The large layered mafic complexes are important because they  contain evidence for fundamental processes in igneous  petrology and because several contain economic deposits of  various metals, including the platinum group elements  (PGEs).  The essential question addressed by this project is  what is the role of post-cumulus, magmatic processes, in  particular metasomatism, in the formation of  PGE-rich  horizons.  In order to investigate this question, two  related studies will be conducted.  The first involves a  detailed study of trace element contents of pyroxene and  other major phases of the Merensky reef and adjacent rocks  in the Atok area, northeast Bushveld Complex.  A second  study involves the PGE-rich horizon of the Great Dyke.  The  horizon, which is known as the MSZ, exhibits a  characteristic geochemical stratigraphic profile whereby the  maximum concentrations of Ni, Cu, S and Au are found  approximately 15 to 30 cm higher in the stratigraphy than  the maximum concentrations of Pt, Pd and the other PGEs.  A  relationship will be sought between the profiles for the  chalcophile elements and incompatible element contents of  pyroxene, which again will be determined by ion probe.  Se/S, As/S and Te/S ratios may help to distinguish whether  the sulfides were concentrated by mainly cumulate or  metasomatic processes.",
