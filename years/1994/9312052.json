Singh of Kumaun University, Nainital, India, to  collaborate in a project to study the moisture  stress in Himalayan tree species under various  conditions.  The study has three goals: to  determine the degree to which forest types in  Kumaun, in the Indian central Himalaya are  differentiated by their degree and seasonal  pattern of moisture stress; to determine  mechanism of adaptation to drought by forest  trees in Kumaun forests, and; to improve  general understanding of the place of water  relations in physiological ecology of forest  trees, by providing data from forests in a  climate seldom studied, and through exchange of  information among scientists working in  different climates.  Measurements will be made  of the degree of morning moisture stress across  a range of forest types from 1000-2200 m  elevation, and of the components of water  potential and the degree of stomatal opening,  during leaf development before the wet season  begins, for mature leaves during the wet  season, and for mature leaves during the dry  season in fall and winter.    Scope:  This project complements research being  made in other parts in the world on different  climates, and provides information, not  available, for temperate areas with a wet-  summer, dry winter climate, and is necessary to  eliminate the regional bias in models of  adaptation to water availability.  The work  involves close collaboration, and division of  work by the U.S. and the Indian scientists.  It  meets the objectives of this collaboration.  ***",
