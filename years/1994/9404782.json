 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404782  Pflugrath  The training course in Macromolecular Crystallography will train 16  students yearly in both the theoretical and the practical aspects  of macromolecular crystallography through lectures and actual  experiments.  With this training, students are then prepared to use  crystallographic techniques in their own structural biological  research.  Such complete immersive training in crystallography is  unavailable elsewhere.  Four principal instructors along with about  12 additional speakers give numerous lectures that guide students  through laboratory experiments and computations which ultimately  lead to the complete structure determination of an actual protein -   the 129 residue hen egg white lysozyme.  Specific experiments are  performed in protein crystallization, heavy atom derivatization,  crystal mounting & freezing, space group determination, diffraction  data collection & analysis, phase determination by both multiple  isomorphous replacement & molecular replacement, Patterson &  Fourier transform calculation, solvent flattering, anomalous  scattering, phase combination, electron density map interpretation,  restrained least squares refinement, different Fourier analysis and  presentation of results.  The instructors also present structures  recently determined in their own laboratories with an emphasis on  the methods used.  In addition, students are encouraged to bring  their own protein and data to try out the techniques and software  available during the course.  The course curriculum is evaluated  and updated annually in order to remain abreast of the latest  development in crystallography.  ***",
