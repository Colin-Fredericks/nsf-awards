Goverment documents, the business  press,  and  other  sources  of  data  will  be  used  to  test   an  explanation drawn from resource mobilization theory in order  to  explain these merger movement upsurges.  All four of the  peaks  of  corporate  merger activity in  the  last  century  (circa 1897, 1929, 1968, and 1985) will be examined in light  of this theory.        Up until now the periodic upsurges of corporate merger  activity  in  the United States have been seen  as  akin  to  earthquakes  or  hurricanes--unpredictable  and   mysterious  events  that wreak havoc on a wide scale.  Case  studies  of  individual mergers abound, but these contribute little to an  understanding of why mergers are common in some periods  and  rare  in  others.   To  the  extent  that  this  project  is  successful, it will make upsurges in corporate mergers  less  mysterious and more interpretable.  Those who feel  that  at  their peaks such merger movements generate substantial waste  and  disruption  should  find  that  this  project  provides  information that can be used to moderate these problems.  ***",
