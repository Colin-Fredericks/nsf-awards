The AOS is a  collaborative effort with Canada that involves approximately  60 scientists participating on a Canadian and a U.S.  icebreaker during a 55-day field program in the summer of  1994.  The AOS is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems  Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and research  is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences, the  Office of Polar Programs and Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Data collected should be relevant to improving our under-  standing of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing  global climate conditions and how it affects the physical,  chemical, and biological features of the more temperate  oceans and regions.    This specific research project encompasses part of the  hydrography program.  Precision temperature, conductivity,  oxygen, and nutrient profiles will be collected at intervals  along the cruise track.  Resulting data will be analyzed to  increase understanding of the structure and circulation of  the Arctic Ocean.  Research will focus on three areas: 1)  the structure of the halocine, wherein density differences  between masses of seawater may drive the circulation and  mixing of deep Arctic Ocean water with water from other  parts of the world's oceans; 2) seawater properties and  gradients near major seafloor features, and 3) the  horizontal and vertical structure of the water column below  1500 meters.  ***",
