Through TEAMS-BC,  Wheelock College faculty are developing new courses and revising  existing courses in science and mathematics education in order to  develop a coordinated science and mathematics program for students  in elementary and early childhood education.  In addition, Wheelock  is working closely with professional development schools in Boston  and Cambridge to assure that the field experiences of students  support their learning in science and mathematics for children.  This project focuses on the implementation of an intensive  formative assessment process within the courses undergoing change,  to both document and analyze student growth, and to develop  assessment practices that are embedded into the design of the new  courses.  This project also supports collaborative efforts with the  Martin Luther King, Jr. School in Cambridge to build a professional  development school.  Teachers and faculty are working closely  together to build the science teaching capacity at the school, to  provide the clinical experience for students that will enhance  their skills in teaching science to children, and to reach out to  the community of the school.",
