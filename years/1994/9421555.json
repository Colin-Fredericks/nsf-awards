 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new mutation has been discovered in a strain of rats,  which produces a fundamental reorganization of the  forebrain.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will  establish a stable breeding colony of these mutants, and  begin to characterize the cellular organization of the  forebrain.  It is essential to breed the new strain of rat  immediately to preserve the mutation, and make it accessible  for experimentation in a variety of studies.  Histological  analysis of the brain of these animals will identify the  types of cells in the novel structure.  The established  colony will provide a valuable novel model system as a  resource for the community.  Research on this mutation has  potentially very high impact across neuroscience, because  such a large change in structure suggests novel tests for  structure-function relationships, as well as novel tests  about neural development.  Its potential impact extends  beyond neuroscience to developmental biology and to  biopsychology as well.",
