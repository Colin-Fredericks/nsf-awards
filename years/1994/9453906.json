Philadelphia, PA  19103-1294    \"A Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities for the   Greater  Philadelphia Region\"    The National Science Foundation's Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities (CRCM) in Philadelphia as a representative of the  Greater Philadelphia Consortium and PATHS/PRISM:  The Philadelphia  Partnership for Education, is composed of four metropolitan school  districts; seventeen universities, colleges, and community  colleges, museums; corporations; non-profit partnerships;; and  minority professional and community organizations.  The goal of the  CRCM is to significantly increase the number of minority students,  (specifically African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans,  preparing for science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) education  and careers.  The fulfillment of the CRCM's mission and goal is  being accomplished through the integration of three principal  components:  pre-college professional development programs, pre-  college student programs, and college student programs.            The CRCM has functioned to strengthen the educational pipeline and  to indirectly create systemic impact through strategic intervention  in the region.  As of the end of year III, the CRCM has serviced  approximately 4413 students and 300 teachers.  In year IV, the CRCM  is taking the strengths and experiences of the first three years  and applying these best practices to a K-12th grade cluster of  schools, as well as continuing programs which have been successful  in meeting our goal.  The CRCM is working very closely with the  school District of Philadelphia and other Consortium partners to  develop strong mathematics and science school clusters.  The real  value of this system of strong  clusters across the district will  be to sustain the long-term goals of moving students successfully  through the pipeline and strengthening teachers in future years.  ***",
