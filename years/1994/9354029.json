The courses involved at each of the four campuses  are chemistry, physics, and earth/spaces sciences.  The  project explores an integrated exposure to teaching  strategies and content by folding pedagogy into selected  topics in each of the disciplines.  NJIT and FDU are working  with topics in chemistry courses, MSC is focusing on physics  topics, and JCSC is working with earth/space science.   Evaluation methodologies concentrate on assessing students'  understanding of the topics affected.  The science courses  will become part of the reform curriculum for teacher  preparation, yet recognize that every student is a  prospective educator in any of a variety of settings.  The  concept that college courses combine pedagogy and content  should be the basis for all science and mathematics courses  that serve all students as part of the core  curricular/general requirements of the collaborating  institutions.  ***",
