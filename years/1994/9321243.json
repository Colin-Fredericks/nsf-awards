 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321243  Hellberg    Closely related species of marine invertebrates commonly  occur together and often spawn simultaneously, yet hybrids  between these species rarely form.  Proteins on the surface  of the gametes control species-specific fertilization.  Three lines of evidence suggest that changes in these gamete  recognition proteins may be involved in the evolution of  reproductive isolation:  1)  non-fertile heterospecific  crosses usually result from the failure of sperm to attach  to heterospecific eggs, 2)  closely related, reproductively  isolated species often show little overall genetic  divergence, and 3) selection promotes the divergence of  sperm-borne gamete recognition proteins found in different  species of abalone. This project will examine two critical  questions which remain unanswered:  1)  Are interspecific  differences in gamete recognition proteins greatest in  geographical areas of species overlap, and 2)  How variable  are gamete recognition proteins within species?  These two questions will be addresses by documenting  nucleotide sequence variation of the sperm borne gamete  recognition protein bindin from both co-occurring and  isolated populations of Pacific sand dollars.  The   project  will focus on members of the genus Dendraster, whose  geographical distribution (both overlapping and non-  overlapping regions) and very recent origins (1 May) should  facilitate discrimination between alternative evolutionary  mechanisms driving bindin divergence.  Finally, the  functional significance of both inter-and intraspecific  variation in bindin will be examined using pairwise  fertilization assays.  This research project should produce  novel insights into the role of the potential for  interspecific hybridization in  promoting the divergence of  gamete recognition proteins.  ***",
