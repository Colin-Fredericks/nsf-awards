 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411036  Redd  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design  Projects Program category, and requests support for  undergraduate and graduate student engineers to provide  prototype \"custom designed\" devices and software to aid  persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust  is to provide meaningful design experience for the  engineering student that will directly aid a specific  disabled individual. A formal program is in place at Utah  State University which will ensure satisfactory progress is  attained on these projects.  A group of students and the  investigators on the grant will work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects.  Forty projects are planned during the five year duration of  this award, and a written report on the completed projects  will be submitted for an annual publication.  Once  completed, each project will be given to the person for whom  it is designed.  The hope is that this \"real world\"  experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose  and pride, help engineering schools serve the community,  attract new students into engineering, and raise student  interest in graduate education.    This type of undertaking is important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of  their undergraduate design requirements, and will also  benefit a population where customization is often needed for  rehabilitation devices.  ***",
