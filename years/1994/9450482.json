 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450482  Numbere    This proposal seeks to establish a Senior Undergraduate Research  Experience Program (SURE) at the University of Missouri-Rolla  (UMR).  Junior and senior minority students majoring in engineering  and science will participate in a comprehensive and structured  program of quality research, mentoring and advising designed to  expose and interest them in research careers in engineering and  applied sciences.  This 4-year project will handle 10 students  annually.  During the first 24 months, 10 UMR students will  participate annually.  The second 24 months will involve UMR  students as well as minority students from traditionally Black  universities in the Midwest and South that do not have graduate  programs or research activities of the caliber offered at UMR.    The program goal is to increase the number of students from  underrepresented minority groups pursuing research careers in  engineering and science.  Our strategy is to maximize students'  development of skills ranging from theoretical analysis to  practical hands-on laboratory experience.  Each month during the  spring semester of their junior year, SURE students will tour major  research facilities on campus and attend presentations made by  research faculty.  After that, the bulk of their activities will  involve doing research in collaboration with a faculty mentor and  graduate students, preparing a research paper, mentoring by a  researcher, discussing career plans with mentor, receiving  goal-setting training, and becoming familiar with careers in  research.  SURE participants will receive feedback on their  performance monthly from their mentor.  Research assistantships  will be given.  Students will be expected to fulfill all agreed-  upon laboratory responsibilities, to submit a weekly electronic  mail journal, to prepare and present results of their project, and  to contribute to the evaluation of the program.  To enhance to the  impact of SURE, students will visit high schools from which UMR  attracts m inority engineering students and present their research  to a sophomore science class.    The university has pledged to support the SURE program by  cost-sharing in the amount of $127,768 over the 4 year period.   Other forms of support include providing needed laboratory  supplies, planning the continuance of the SURE activities following  NSF support, pursuing private funding sources, and coordinating the  activities.    A separate team of evaluators including a psychologist and engineer  will conduct the evaluation.  It will include weekly feedback from  participants in the form of journals, monthly reports from  mentors, and follow-up of all participants three months following  their participation.  Students' academic performance during and  their participation and their plans following graduation will  be interviewed on an annual basis.  Recommendations for improving  will be made and implemented on an ongoing basis.",
