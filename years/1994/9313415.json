The building under renovation was built in 1965 and  has not undergone significant renovation since it's construction.  The plan is to  replace the roof; completely upgrade the mechanical systems to current standards for  air flow; provide a central chiller facility; upgrade and modernize the electrical  distribution system; test for and remove asbestos; eliminate city water cooling  systems; and comply with requirements for overall accessibility under the Americans  with Disabilities Act.  This renovation project will greatly enhance the ability of  researchers to perform complex research in a safe and productive manner.  The key  research areas that will be impacted by this project include materials and  environmental engineering, chemistry, and biology.  Within these fields, strong  synergy has been developed and has become a spawning ground for new technologies  and their applications.  Within this building there are hand-on laboratories for  graduate skills training as well as the integration of engineering and science for  development of an energy and environment initiative crucial for emerging  technologies.  This building renovation will directly change the research and training  environment of 29 faculty, 12 postdoctoral fellows, 121 graduate students and 136  undergraduate students.",
