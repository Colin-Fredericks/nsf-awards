Dr. Richard L.  Leary of the Illinois State Museum will serve as the U.S.  organizer.  His Czech counterpart is Dr. Zbynek Simunek of the  Czech Geological Survey.  The workshop will focus on topics in  1) Carboniferous fossil plant taxa, assemblages, taphonomy,  paleoecology, and evolution;  and  2) their paleographic  implications.  Results are expected to yield refined dating of  first known occurrences that will aid research on plant  migration.  Better knowledge of similarities and differences in  species common to both the U.S. and Czech coal basin regions will  aid in measuring rates of evolution and should contribute to our  overall understanding of global climate change.    This joint workshop in paleobotany fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.  It is expected that the meeting will  foster new U.S.-Czech research partnerships as well as promote  dissemination of information on current research and methods in  Carboniferous Euramerican paleobotany.   ***",
