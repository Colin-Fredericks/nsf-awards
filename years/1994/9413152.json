 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to explore use of a common database by a group of investigators in many  different countries who will be participating in a Pilot Project of the Human Genome  Diversity Project (HGDP).  The larger HGDP Project is still in the planning stages but  informatics will clearly play a crucial role; acknowledging that, the HGDP organizational  structure includes an Informatics Committee (chaired by Dr. Tom Marr, Cold Spring  Harbor).  That Committee has recommended that prototype development is an important  aspect of informatics at this early stage of the project.  At Yale we have developed a  client-server database to handle our own data which are very similar to the data that will be  collected in the Pilot Project and in the full HGDP.  Therefore, the Informatics Committee of  the HGDP recommended that we consider adapting our database as a prototype for use in the  Pilot Project.  This proposal is for the funds to make that conversion.  The existing database  uses 4th Dimension on a Macintosh as the client and Sybase on a Sun Sparcstation-2 as the  server; communication is over the Internet.  The adaptation process proposed will involve  wide consultation on an initial modification, distribution of the subsequent prototype to  groups in several different countries, a second cycle of modification, and distribution and use  by a minimum of ten laboratories participating in the HGDP Pilot Project.  Laboratories in  California and Connecticut, in Japan, in England, in Germany, and in Italy have already been  identified as participants.  Those labs will use the client software produced at Yale on their  local machines to enter their data into the Sybase database resident at Yale.  Among other  aspects the database will be critically examined to see how it could better facilitate local  management of data an the data collection process and how it might better promote the  interactive/collaborative nature of the project.  The final dataset will be publically available  and will se rve as a testbed for further exploration of informatics relevant to the larger HGDP.   This project is funded by both the Physical Anthropology Program and the Database Activity  in the Biological Sciences.",
