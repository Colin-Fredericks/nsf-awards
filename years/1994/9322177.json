 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an REU Site at the Konza Prairie/Long-Term Ecological  Research Site.  The program will offer ten undergraduates the opportunity to study tall  grass prairie ecology.  Foci of Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project on Konza  Prairie include the study of fire and grazing on native tallgrass prairie.  To facilitate  investigation of these impacts, watersheds on Konza Prairie have been assigned to  different burn regeims.  Additionally, native and domestic grazers have been introduced  to many watersheds.  Thus, Konza Prairie offers a unique opportunity for the study of  many aspects of prairie ecology.  The REU project will involve several components  including, independent student research, rotation through existing LTER core research  projects, student journal discussion groups correlated with faculty seminars, an eight-  week ethics course, and several field trips.  In order to enhance their professional  development, students will participate in two national scientific meetings.  Each REU  student will have both a faculty and graduate student mentor to support their research   research efforts.  At the conclusion of the summer, students will make an oral  presentation of the results of their research and, in conjunction with their mentors, will  prepare and submit projects to journals for publication.  The Konza Prairie REU  experience will offer students a unique opportunity to study the ecology of the tallgrass  prairie in a productive and supportive environment.",
