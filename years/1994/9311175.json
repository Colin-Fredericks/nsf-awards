 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311175  Bron  Changes in the index of refraction of compound semiconductors will  be measured after optical injection of coherent optical phonons and  polaritons.  The injection of the phonon/polariton states occurs on  a subps time scale through a coherent Raman excitation (CRE)  process.  The injected phonons are nearly monochromatic, have known  wave vectors and polarizations, have initially fixed relative   phase, and are initially spatially localized to the overlap region  of the two pump lasers.  A beam deflection or a photoinduced  grating technique will be used to monitor the changes in the index  of refraction.  The effect will be studied as a function of the  intensity and frequency of the pump lasers, the relative  orientation of the propagation vector of the coherent phonon state  and the crystal axes of the semiconductor, and the effects of  lattice defects.  Other measurements of interest include the  coherent phonon/polariton dephasing time and the measurement of the  real and imaginary components of the third order nonlinear  electronic susceptibility.  In a related experiment, the effect of  plasma excess energy on the dephasing time of coherent LO phonons  will be measured for GaP using a pulsed (50 fs), tunable laser  source.  %%%  Changes in the optical properties of a compound semiconductor will  be measured on extremely short time scales.  These changes are  induced by two laser pulses which are focused to overlap the same  region of the semiconductor.  The frequency of the two lasers  differs by an amount which is exactly equal to a characteristic  frequency of certain vibrational modes of the semiconductor.  These  vibrational modes will in turn alter the transmission or reflection  of another light beam which is incident on the semiconductor.  The  experiment can yield important insight into the basic mechanisms  which are essential to the development of ultrafast optical  switching devices.  ***",
