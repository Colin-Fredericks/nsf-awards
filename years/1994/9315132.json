The joint research involves the  development of next generation soft x-ray (SXR)  optical components and systems needed for such  critical areas as SXR projection lithography,  third-generation synchrotron radiation research,  space platform telescopes and spectrometers,  lithographic production of micro-machine parts,  microscopy, and nonsynchrotron radiation SXR  light sources.  The project also involves  Professor Howard Milchberg, University of  Maryland, Professor John McNeil, University of  New Mexico, and Japanese scientists at Tokyo  University, Osaka University, and Tohoku  University.      The research deals with various problems  associated with (1) optical and physical  properties of new SXR optical materials  (multilayers, etc.), (2) properties of new SXR  optical devices (imaging and projection system,  microscopes, telescopes, etc.), (3) evaluation  and testing of SXR optical elements (aspheric  surface figure, roughness, etc.), and (4)  improvement to intense laboratory (non-  synchrotron) SXR light sources.  The U.S. and  Japanese investigators' work is complementary and  the joint research will provide a unique  opportunity for mutually beneficial research.  ***",
