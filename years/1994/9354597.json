 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354597  Sitaraman  Demand for trained software professionals continues to be on the  rise. Introductory undergraduate courses in computer science do not  provide an appropriate context for motivating the importance of  good design, precise and abstract specification, and efficient and  correct implementations in software construction. These and other  key component and software engineering principles are therefore  introduced only much later in the curriculum as \"add on\" ideas,  rather than as central themes in problem solving. The relatively  late exposure leaves computer science students with little time to  master key concepts. Non-computer science majors are left in total  darkness with respect to software engineering issues and  principles.  Using software reuse as a motivating context (but not  as the dominant theme), we propose to introduce software  engineering principles in introductory computer science courses  while retaining the problem-solving techniques traditionally taught  in these courses. Specification-based reuse readily motivates the  need for traditional principles such as abstraction and new  principles such as software design. Having seen and used software  built the \"right\" way early, the students master the ideas by  applying them in projects in the rest of the curriculum. A major  objective of the project is to evaluate the long-term influences of  this proposal in multiple programming paradigms in multiple  institutions.  ***y",
