 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few years, the investigator and his colleagues  have developed numerical techniques with esoteric and even  speculative features.  The common theme in these techniques is the  use of mathematical machinery and algorithms from one area in a  seemingly different arena.  In particular, the investigators have  used methods from statistical physics and geometry to attack  seemingly unrelated problems in computational physics.  The  problems under investigation in this proposal are both  technologically interesting and among the most difficult in  computing.  The work encompasses: (1) applications of statistical  mechanics to fluid mechanics and turbulence theory; (2) the  analysis of stochastic systems with filamentary subsystems, in  particular polymers and quantum vortices; (3) the exploitation of  variable temperature and annealing techniques to untangle and  recognize knots and possibly fold proteins; (4) the analysis of  kinking in moving filaments and singularities in moving surfaces  by interface algorithms based on hyperbolic conservation law  theory and differential geometry; and (5) coupling these moving  interface algorithms with mean curvature flow analysis to design  algorithms for grid generation.       Through this work, a considerable body of state-of-the-art,  powerful mathematical and numerical techniques will be transformed  into practical tools of importance in manufacturing, energy  processes, and material science.  Sophisticated advancing interface  algorithms will be used to compute detailed processes in the  manufacture of microelectronic components in computer chips.  Research on statistical mechanics and fluid turbulence will be  used as part of computer simulations of fluid mixing in combustion  processes.  Finally, surface advancement techniques for grid  generation are aimed at automating a key component of  computational fluid mechanics simulations present in modeling and  designing flows past aircraft, in engines, and in hydrodynamic  devices.",
