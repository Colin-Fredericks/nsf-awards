A key feature of the experiments  is the achievemenr of a very high temperature stability and very  low thermal gradients.  Studies include the following:  uncovering  new surface critical phenomena through chemical tuning, determining  the effect of weak thermal convection on the delicate liquid  structure necessary to achieve gravity thinned wetting in  equilibrium, investigate potential of non equilibrium methods to  when limited by long equilibration times in polymer solution  studies, and search for correlated motion statistically in the  dynamics of colloidal particles subject to intense thermal noise  and slight long range intermolecular forces.    Non-technical abstract:  We have recently discovered details about  how fluctuations in a thermal system behave near a boundary.  Up to  now the effect of the boundary has always been so great in  microscopic observations that increasing its influence would not  lead to any new information.  The situation is like listening to a  radio that is so loud that one can make out the rhythm of a song  but not the words.  A potential solution is to reduce the strength  of the boundary through chemical means.  Reflected light is used to  detect changes at the surface.  With accurate temperature control  the sensitivity of amplifying the effect of thermal fluctuations is  equal to the experimental precision of a few parts in a million.  ***",
