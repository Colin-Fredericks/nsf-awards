 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to continue the study of the statistical  properties of multivariate normal models determined by lattice  conditional independence (LCI) assumptions and/or group symmetry  assumptions on the covariance matrix, augmented by compatible  linear restrictions on the mean. LCI models have been shown to be  applicable to the analysis of multivariate normal data sets with  nonnested missing data patterns. A new application of LCI models  will be emphasized here: their application to the analysis of a  collection of nonnested dependent linear regression models, known  in econometrics as a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model.  A SUR model may be thought of as a finite nonnested collection of  linear regression subspaces with correlated errors across  regressions. For a given SUR model, the least restrictive LCI  covariance model compatible with the mean structure can be  determined, leading to explicit maximum likelihood estimates for  the SUR model. To date, LCI models have been studied only for  multivariate normal distributions. Another new aspect of this  proposal is the application of LCI models to categorical data in  multiway contingency tables. As in the case of normal data, such  LCI models should allow explicit maximum likelihood estimates for  contingency tables with nonnested missing categories.   Many familiar statistical models occurring in classical  multivariate analysis (the study of correlated data) can be  viewed as special cases of models defined in terms of natural  algebraic conditions on the means and/or covariances. This  viewpoint will (a) lead to a unified and explicit (non-iterative)  analysis of these models, and (b) expand the scope of  multivariate analysis by allowing the application of classical  methods to many new models, as well as allowing the possibilities  of missing data occurring in nonnested patterns and of nonnested  regression subspaces.",
