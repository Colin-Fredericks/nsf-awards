 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaw  9407937   Research supported by this grant will determine if mating between related individuals of the moss, Ceratodon purpureus, results in offspring that are less fit than mating between unrelated individuals.  In addition, actual patterns of interbreeding within two populations will be investigated in order to relate experimental results to plants in natural habitats.  The research involves growing plants of known familial pedigree, conducting crosses, and measuring both viability and fertility in offspring from different matings.   Because the study organism is haploid   (i.e., cells contain one set of chromosomes rather than two as in most plants and animals), new insights into the genetic consequences of consanguineous mating are expected.  Although this research addresses basic scientific questions, understanding the effects of different mating patterns is critical to a range of applied issues including the conservation of rare and endangered plants and animals, and the most effective breeding strategies for increased agricultural production.   Funding for this research also provides critical support for involvement of undergraduate students in biological research.  In addition to research opportunities during the academic year, funding supports full-time collaboration between undergraduate students and the Principle Investigator during two summers.  Active undergraduate involvement in research is the most effective way to promote the development of promising young scientists.",
