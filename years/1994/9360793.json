 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360793  Bilanin  The  erosion  of  the river bed around bridge piers  is  commonly  known as local scour and is induced by the recalculating juncture  flow  at the intersection of the pier and the river bed.   Bridge  failure  caused  by  this phenomenon has long been  an  important  issue  with respect to both public safety and maintenance  costs.  Average  total losses from the resulting damage can run up  to  a  hundred  million dollars annually.  Nearly half a million bridges  nationwide  are  potentially affected by local scour.   A  robust  protective  system is needed that can be retrofitted to  existing  bridge  piers  to  mitigate  the sediment  transport.   Recently,  Continuum  Dynamics,  Inc.  has  made  considerable  progress  in  designing  large-scale flow modification  devices  based  on  the  successful  in-house  development of vortex  control  technology.  The proposed effort will adapt these techniques together with the  appropriate application of scaling and boundary layer analyses of  the vortical flow near the river bed to the development of vortex  alleviation systems for local scour mitigation.  Various  designs  will   be   tested  experimentally  with  sub-scale   models   to  demonstrate  the  potential  of the proposed  vortex  alleviation  techniques  in mitigating local scour and to identify a  feasible  design for Phase II.  ***",
