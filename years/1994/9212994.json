Although considerable  effort has been devoted to measuring the patterns of species  diversity, the evolutionary forces which have generated the deep-  sea fauna remain poorly studied. In order to estimate gene flow and  the potential for population differentiation and speciation,  studies of the genetic patterns of geographic variation are  required. Yet only a handful of such studies have been done in the  deep sea. One of the major obstacles to quantifying genetic  population structure in deep-sea species has been the difficulty of  obtaining sufficient quantities of appropriately preserved tissue  for genetic studies. Most of the deep-sea benthos is comprised of  small, sparsely distributed organisms which are recovered dead or  moribund during typical sampling; these specimens have been  inadequate for the standard techniques of allozyme electrophoresis.   However, with the advent of new molecular biological techniques  which make possible the characterization of DNA sequences from  ancient, dried, and alcohol-preserved tissues, studies of the  population genetics of deep-sea species are now feasible. In  particular, the extensive collections of specimens from dozens of  deep-sea sampling efforts provide a wealth of potential information  ready to be analyzed. This project will apply the techniques of the  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize genetic variation  from alcohol-preserved specimens of deep-sea amphipods, with the  goal of estimating genetic population structure and gene flow at  intra-ocean and inter-ocean geographic scales. To accomplish this  goal, this project will,  1.) with PCR, amplify rapidly evolving  portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 15-25 individuals in  each population with universal primers constructed from mtDNA  sequences of Drosophila; 2.) inspect amplified segments for  hypervariable regions; 3.) identify 15-20  base pair regions where  most variation is confined to 1 or 2 polymorphic nucleotides and  design allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes for each  allele; 4. hybridize ASO probes to amplified hypervariable regions  from 100-200 individuals per population; 5) calculate allele and  genotype frequencies in each population and evaluate population  structure.  The results of this project should provide the first  detailed examination of genetic population structure across deep  ocean basins and between world oceans. In addition, this project  has the potential to demonstrate the applicability of molecular  biological techniques to problems in deep-sea ecology and to  promote further use of available resources in addressing important  evolutionary issues in the oceans.  ***",
