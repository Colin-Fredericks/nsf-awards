 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409941  Kroll       The goal of this project is to develop a manual procedure for   generating assembly sequences of products to be used in conjunction   with teaching concurrent design to undergraduate and graduate   mechanical engineering students.  The developed procedure will be   based on two research projects in computerized design for assembly   and assembly planning, and will be adapted for manual use.  The   assembly planning method will be tested in a senior-level   undergraduate design class and a graduate elective course.    Participating students will be able to take with them to industry   the learned methodology and written materials in the form of   handouts and laboratory notes.       Concurrent design of product and processes has resulted in   significant cost savings in industry.  Yet, methods for teaching   these subjects in engineering schools fall short in providing both   a comprehensive approach to the problem and a systematic design   procedure.  This project focuses on the assembly planning aspect of   concurrent product design, with the premise that product structure   and configuration are more important than minute part details.",
