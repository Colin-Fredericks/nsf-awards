We will focus on the areas of uncertainty  estimation and development of parallel algorithms for  simulation of flow and transport processes.  During the  course of the fellowship, the PA will develop and apply flow  and transport parallel sofware (including rescaling  techniques) combines with software for reservoir  characterization, gridding, and  uncertainty estimation to  an actual  BP reservoir.  The software will be used in  analyzing production performance of the reservoir.       The participants in this fellowship include Rice  University, where the mentors will be Professors Clint  Dawson and Mary F. Wheeler, and British Petroleum, where the  mentor will be Dr. Michael Christie.  The PA will be exposed  to several techniques which are part of BP's and Rice's  current activities.  In particular, Rice has expertise in  parallel computing and algorithm development, while BP has  expertise in rescaling techniques, reservoir  characterization, and well management.       The PA will be trained in the engineering and  mathematical aspects of the emerging areas of uncertainty  estimation and parallel computation.  This will equip the PA  to work as a specialist in reservoir simulation, hydrology,  or any other areas where estimating uncertainty and/or  parallel computation are low key.",
