 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317020  Morison  The proposed work is part of an integrated research program  (\"Anzflux\") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer  of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is to make high resolution measurements of the  horizontal variability of temperature and salinity to help  determine the three-dimensional structure of coherent convection  features.  The measurements will be made with instruments on a  remotely operated free-ranging underwater vehicle (the Autonomous  Conductivity Temperature Vehicle -- ACTV).    The postulated high oceanic heat flux values in the eastern Weddell  Sea require the existence of a mechanism that enhances the vertical  heat flux.  Possible such mechanisms are coherent roll  instabilities in the mixed layer, convection under leads and other  openings in the ice, or internal waves.  Single point measurements  can only suggest the existence of these mechanisms; the  identification of the particular mechanism requires information on  their horizontal variability.    The ACTV, which is 160 centimeters long and 9 centimeters in  diameter, is capable of one hour of operation at a speed of two  meters per second.  It can be programmed to dead reckoned course as  far as 1.5 kilometers from a homing beacon, and can cover about  five kilometers per run.  It carries commercially available  thermometers and conductivity sensors whose precision is better  than one thousandths of a degree and one part in thirty thousand  salinity units.  The vehicle will be operated from a small, light-  weight hut set up on the sea ice, and will be deployed and  recovered through a one meter diameter hole.    ***",
