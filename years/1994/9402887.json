This spectrometer is to be installed on an existing  transmission electron microscope. Ancillary equipment that includes a TV  camera, cold stage, hot stage and scanning transmission device are also  requested. Current research is being performed on synthesis of: 1) novel  electrodeposited shape memory alloys that cannot be produced by the standard  thermal process, 2) ceramic superlattices that have unique electrical and  optical properties, and 3) new rare earth magnetic materials that are  technologically important.  %%%  An energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer capable of detecting light elements and  a computer work station with software capable of performing quantitative thin  film chemical analysis is requested. This spectrometer is to be installed on an  existing transmission electron microscope. Current research is being performed  on electrodeposited shape memory alloys and ceramic superlattices, and new rare  earth magnetic materials.  Materials processing is a central theme in each of  these projects and an analytically equipped transmission electron microscope is  essential for the characterization of these new and exciting materials.",
