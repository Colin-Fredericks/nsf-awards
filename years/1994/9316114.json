 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316114  Jonas  This project will result in the identification of genes transcribed  by alternate sigma factors in the Gram positive prokaryote,  Bacillus subtilis.  Genes having promoters recognized by a  particular sigma factor will be identified using a transposon  engineered to contain a reporter gene (Tn917lac), which should  generate random insertional mutations (and transcriptional fusions)  in the chromosome of B. subtilis.  These mutations will be screened  in strains of B. subtilis containing inducible copies (under  control of the spac promoter) of the structural genes for the  active forms of B. or E. genes bearing insertion that are induced  by IPTG in such a system will be mapped, cloned, and sequenced.   The promoter regions of these genes will be analyzed, providing  information concerning regulatory sequences used by alternative  sigma factors.  The functions of these genes may be revealed by the  phenotype of the insertional mutants, or by homology with the  sequences of genes with known functions.  We will attempt to  determine the role the alternative sigma factor plays in vivo by  recognition of the function of the genes in the regulon.  %%%  The knowledge gained concerning genetic regulation may prove useful  to the fermentation industry, which could benefit from using  alternate sigma factors in over producing gene product in bacteria.  ***",
