C. and James Harold    \"Sacramento Schools/MESA Partnerships For Minority Student  Achievement\"    Building on a ling-standing collaborative relationship, the  Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD) and Sacramento MESA  (Mathematics, Engineering, Science and Achievement) propose to  undertake a systemic reform of K-12 science and mathematics  education in 50 high-minority schools.  Multiple allies in this  concerted effort are from industry, government, education agencies,  universities, the statewide MESA network, community groups and  parents of the 17,000 underrepresented minority students who are  the SSM-PMSA project's focus.  Among the changes that SSMA-PMSA  proposes to effect are:  increases in quality and quantity of  hands-on science and math instruction, availability of and access  to college-preparatory courses, use of technology in educational  delivery, multilevel curricular articulation, and parent  involvement and empowerment; inclusion of cross-cultural curricula  free of gender bias; heightened multicultural understanding and  sensitivity among constituents in the school environment;  institution of improved testing, measurement and assessment  techniques; and a strong emphasis on college preparation, academic  counseling, and math-based careers and career paths.  Project  activities will include a variety of student enrichments;  educational and training opportunities for teachers, principals,  parents, and students; provision and use of hands-on math and  science materials, summer programs; and industry participation.  By  year V, over 35,000 students in SCUSD will have benefited directly  and indirectly from SSM-PMSA activities and the number of  underrepresented students who are motivated and qualified to enroll  in SEM majors will double or triple.  NSF/PMSA funding will enable  the partnership to initiate, expand, and continue meaningful and  lasting reforms that its individual member s could not successfully  accomplish.  the accelerated standards, enriched education program, and upgraded  teacher skills.",
