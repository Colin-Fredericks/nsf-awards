 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302923  Feferman  Modern programming languages manipulate potentially infinite  objects (streams, arbitrary precision reals, etc.).  Examples  include: Haskell, ML, and other functional languages, Ada (for  example tasks and processes), and C++ (objects being essentially  higher-order entities).  Real-time applications have  specifications that involve both analog/continuous and discrete  entities and relations between these domains.  To develop formal  methods for functional programming languages for such  applications, and to enforce modular construction of  specifications and programs for programming-in-the-large, one  needs more general (non-algebraic) notions of abstract data types  (ADTs) than have been treated in most of the literature.  Several  questions must then be addressed, including the following:  How  can the notion of ADT be enriched (generalized ADTs) to encompass  such objects?  What does it mean to compute with these objects?  It is important to have an understanding beyond just manipulation  of finite representations.  What is a suitable formal notation  for enriching logical theories by declaring such ADTs?  This  research would focus on the following three closely related  topics: computation over generalized ADTs, systems for definition  of generalized ADTs, and substantial verification examples worked  out within the generalized ADT setting.  The project will  continue work within the framework of variable type (VT)  theories.  ***",
