He will work on the Riemann-Roch problem  which is to compute the cohomology groups of high multiples of a  line bundle on a projective variety.  He will also work on the  local analogue of this problem which is the computation of  Hilbert functions of valuation ideals determined by vanishing to  high multiplicity along fixed valuations.  In addition, the  principle investigator will study ramification and the  equivalence of homomorphisms of modules.                This research is concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.",
