Garsia, to be held July 26-29, 1994, in Taormina,  Sicily, Italy.  The purpose of the conference is to advance the  use of methods from algebra and algebraic geometry in  combinatorics, and particularly to provide exposure to these  methods for graduate students and researchers beginning their  careers.      The conference will be small and highly focused, with a workshop-  style format.  It will be strongly international, with  participants from the U.S., Canada, six European countries, and  Israel.  The speakers have been chosen for the influence of their  innovations in shaping present research activity in algebraic  combinatorics; they represent the leaders in the field.  The  conference is expected to result in an exchange of new ideas and  techniques.  With the eventual publication of the conference  proceedings, this meeting could have a lasting impact on several  parts of mathematics.  * * *",
