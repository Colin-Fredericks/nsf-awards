The  workshop will bring together statisticians and computer vision  researchers for discussion of improvement of the reliability of  computer vision algorithms by use of robust statistical estimation  methods which tolerate partially incorrect data, and methods for  estimating the confidence in the output of a computer vision task  by either analytical or computer-intensive methods.  This topic is  very important to the computer vision field, as it should help to  improve the linkage with knowledgeable statisticians, and lead to  more cogent application of statistical knowledge to computer vision  research.  The funding will provide partial support for many of the  attendees, who will also be attending the Computer Vision and  Pattern Recognition Conference just prior to the workshop, and will  enable a number of others not involved in the CVPR conference  (primarily statisticians) to travel to the workshop.  A proceedings  will be made available to requesters at a modest handling cost  following the workshop.",
