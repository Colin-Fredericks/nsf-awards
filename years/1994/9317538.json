 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317538  Nelson  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short, but  intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in many  Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early in the  season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  This component will test the closely related  hypotheses that: (1) phytoplankton growth is controlled primarily  by the relationship between solar irradiance and mixed-layer depth  throughout the spring (2) diatom growth rates are much higher in  spring than at any other time of year, in response to the more  favorable irradiance/mixing relationships, and (3) persistence of  diatom blooms in summer results from the diatoms' ability to  outcompete other groups under the light-limited conditions that  develop in turbid, high-biomass waters.    These hypotheses will be tested by (1) obtaining the first reliable  estimates of the Sverdrup \"critical depth\" in the Antarctic so that  the changing relationship between the critical depth and the mixed-  layer depth in spring can be defined, and (2) estimating diatom  growth rates and the gross and net production attributable to  diatoms throughout the spring.  The results will provide  information critical to an understanding of phytoplankton bloom  dynamics in the Ross Sea.",
