 "awd_abstract_narration": "Varaiya  9417370  Hybrid systems are models in which a discrete event system  supervises a continuous time system.  These models are especially  appropriate for describing situations in which a computer or  human symbol-processing system provides high level supervision of  a continuous process.  One example is an automated vehicle whose  maneuvers are planned and coordinated at a logical level, but  they are executed using continuous feedback laws that determine  the throttle, braking and steering actuator signals.  Another  example is our daily use of \"common sense\" rules to successfully  control sophisticated processes such as microwave ovens,  automobiles and copying machines, without understanding the  physical and engineering principles that govern the behavior of  those processes.    The study of hybrid systems is beginning to receive serious  attention, but our knowledge is very poor compared with what we  know about continuous time systems and discrete event systems,  considered in isolation.  The primary goal of this proposal is to  extend our understanding of decidable or computable hybrid  systems.  Informally, a hybrid system is decidable if important  questions of its behavior can be answered by finite algorithms.   Specifically, we propose to:         1.   Extend the class of decidable hybrid systems;         2.   Design finite decision algorithms that attenuate the            \"state space explosion\" problem;         3.   Apply those algorithms to problems of control of            automated vehicles.    Our initial plan for meeting these objectives are as follows.   First, we will extend the range of nonlinear dynamics of the  decidable hybrid models and determine the class of hybrid systems  these models can approximate.  Second, we will attempt  to formalize the user-directed refinement procedure which  succeeded in containing the state space explosion.  Third, we  shall continue to verify the design of hybrid system controllers  for automated vehicles both as a test of our algor ithms and as a  guide to theory development.  ***",
