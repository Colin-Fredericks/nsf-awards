 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this research is the number  theoretic  aspects of computational problems.  In recent years there has  been a  resurgence of interest in this area.  Ancient problems  have been solved (e.g.  primality testing), new subdisciplines  have been spawned (e.g. public-key  cryptography) and deep  mathematical tools have emerged (e.g. Abelian varieties,  class  field theory).  One area of particular interest is the new  ``number field  sieve`.  This collection of algorithms, developed  by many researchers, is the  most significant advance in integer  factoring in the last quarter century.  This work continues  to investigate improvements and generalizations of this  method,  in particular, to the function field setting.  The new ``function  field  sieve` is used for the calculations of discrete logarithms  over finite fields  and shows promise for supplanting existing  algorithms for finite fields of  appropriate form.  A second area  of interest is the application of recent  results to public-key  cryptography.  The United States Government has recently  proposed  a national ``Digital Signature Standard` (DSS).  The proposed  scheme  relies for its security on the difficulty of computing  discrete logarithms.  The DSS is controversial and this research investigates the potential of  several methods, including the  number field sieve and the function field sieve,  for breaking the  proposed system or for introducing ``trapdoors`.    Another  area of investigation involves the development of new  mathematical tools.  Finally, the  relationships between biological systems and computation is   explored. One  aspect of this relationship concerns computer viruses.",
