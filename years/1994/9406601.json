 "awd_abstract_narration": "Browning  9406601  The specific objectives of this proposal are to:  1) Determine the  functional domains of the subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F and  EIF-4F.  The subunits of eIF-(iso)4F have been expressed in E. coli  and recombined to form an enzymatically active complex.  Mutations  will be made in the subunits of eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4F and tested  in an in vitro wheat germ translation system and several in vitro  assays that measure partial reactions, i.e., ATP hydrolysis, RNA  unwinding, cross-linking to the mG cap and binding of mRNA to 40S  ribosomal subunits.  2) Complete the partial cDNA sequence of wheat  eIF-4B and express this protein in E. coli.  The missing portion  (~100-200 nucleotides) of the cDNA for eIF-4B will be obtained by  RACE-PCR, inverse PCR or genomic sequencing.  The cDNA will be  expressed in E. coli and the enzymatic activity determined in the  assays described above (Specific Objective 1).  3) Complete the  cDNA sequence for the subunits of Arabidopsis eIF-4F, p28 of eIF-  (iso)4F and eIF-4B and express these proteins in E. coli.  We will  continue to screen using antibodies to wheat factors and wheat cDNA  sequences.  Different regions of the wheat cDNAs will be used to  prepare probes for screening.  The cDNAs for Arabidopsis factors  will be expressed in E coli.  The activity of the expressed  Arabidopsis factors will be measured in the assays described above.   The completion of this goal will set the stage for future work in  vivo exploring the control of expression of the inhibition factors  and regulation of protein synthesis in plants.  %%%  The long term goal of this project is to elucidate the steps in the  initiation of protein synthesis in plants.  Specifically we want to  determine the structural aspects of plant protein synthesis  initiation factors (eIFs) that are important for the interaction of  the factors with each other, with mRNA and ATP, and for the binding  of mRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits.  The project goals are to: 1)  Determine the fun ctional domains of the subunits of eIF-(iso)4F and  eIF-4F using mutagenesis.  2) Complete the cDNA sequence of wheat  eIF-4B and p220 of wheat eIF-4F and express these proteins in E.  coli.  3) Complete the cDNA sequence for the subunits of  Arabidopsis eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4F and eIF-4B and express these  proteins in E. coli.  The results of this research will enhance our  understanding of these important proteins and provide valuable  information about their structure and function.  ***",
