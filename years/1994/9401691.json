 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hales       This award supports the work of Professor Thomas Hales in the Langland's  Program.  The Langland's Program is central to modern number theory by providing  structure to the idea that discrete geometric information can be studied analytically.  Prof. Hales works on establishing special cases of the trace formula.  He is also  interested in studying some unsolved problems in real groups.  These problems are of  interest in a number of different areas of mathematics.       This research falls under the general heading of Number Theory. Number Theory  is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished the driving  force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the discipline. The  Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing  applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory. ***",
