 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361882  Dockterman    Falling test scores, a struggling economy, an ethnically  diverse population, and changes in the global marketplace  have brought the American educational system under  increasing scrutiny and attack. The need for new skills in  the Information Age has prompted reform efforts in all areas  of the curriculum, but with a special focus on science. In  concert with curricular change, reformers have also targeted  assessment. They have recognized that what is evaluated  often drives what is taught. Thus, there is a very pressing  need in K-12 education today for practical programs and  materials to help all schools plan and implement alternative  assessment approaches. In response to this need, Tom Snyder  Productions, working with the Coalition of Essential  Schools, proposes to prototype and evaluate a  technology-based package designed to engage teachers and  administrators in informed discussion and practical ongoing  action in the area of alternative assessment in science  instruction. The centerpiece of this package will be a  CD-ROM based simulation, Dealing with Assessment: Science  Education, that simultaneously introduces the issues and  provides a foundation of skills for independent action by  teachers and administrators.  ***",
