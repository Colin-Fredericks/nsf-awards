 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319409  Subramanian       A new computational prototyping tool is proposed for  conceptual design and simulation of opto-electromechanical devices.   The primary objective is to improve the quality of designed  products and to reduce the number of physical prototyping  iterations by using this tool in early design.  A compositional  technique of constructing complex design topologies by putting  together known design fragments in a systematic manner is used.   This process is grounded in a set of primitive design fragments  which are parameterized solutions to specialized sets of design  constraints.  The focus is on multi-domain designs, in particular  designs with electrical, optical and mechanical components; instead  of single domain designs.  Constraints are a unifying  representation in the design process.  The behavior of multi-domain  devices is specified as sets of constraints, the process of  generating alternate conceptual designs is that of constraint  solving, and the design tool as a  whole is embedded in a  constraint programming environment.  The constraint-based  unification achieves rapid generation of conceptual alternatives,  and tight integration of design with fast simulation to verify  behavior.",
