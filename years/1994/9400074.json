About half of the students will come from  Williams and half from other schools.  Each student will work at  Williams for ten weeks, during which time she or he will be a  member of a small research group consisting of between two and  five undergraduates and advised by one faculty member.  The  students will be divided about equally between experimental and  theoretical physics.  The particular projects we have in mind are  in the following areas: quantum information theory, optical fiber  lasers, laser cooling, and cryogenic masers.  In addition to  their research projects, the students will participate in daily  teas and weekly seminars provided specifically for the REU  students, as well as weekly lunch and lecture open to all science  students and faculty at Williams.  ***",
