The primary purpose of the project  is to study QED (quantum electrodynamics) of  strong external fields and its ultimate goal is  to resolve the puzzle of peak structure  observed in the GSI experiments.  Professor  Alan Chodos of Yale University and Professor  Yee Jack Ng, University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, will also participate in the  project.    The investigators will study several aspects of  the QED vacuum in the presence of a strong  external field:  (1) collective modes in the  QED vacuum? (2) chiral transition in the QED  vacuum? and (3) Dyson equation approach.  With  the beginning of the operation of the APEX  experiment at the ATLAS facility at Argonne  National Laboratory and the resumption of  experiments at GSI, interest in the physics of  QED in strong external fields is growing again.   The international collaboration will contribute  to the development of these experiments, as the  collaborators bring varying and mutually  supportive individual expertise to the effort.  ***",
