In particular Prof. Sundaram will  the homology of subposets of the partition lattice.  She will try  to establish that Whitney homology modules associated to certain  posets are in fact permutation modules.  This conjecture has  implications regarding refinements of the tangent and Genocchi  numbers.       This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,   which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting and  arrangement.  Counting can be incredibly difficult when the  objects are difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for  general methods for overcoming these difficulties.  Today's  combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced  and modern mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back  several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in  the past few decades.  This growth comes from its importance in   communications and information technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems of counting.          ***",
