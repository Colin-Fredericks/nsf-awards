 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321457  MacAyeal  This award is for support for a project to conduct a finite-element  modeling study of the mechanism for Heinrich Events (brief, but  violent episodes of iceberg disgorgement from the Laurentide Ice  Sheet occuring approximately every 7000 years).  The research  assumes that Heinrich events were caused by free-oscillations in  the flow of the Laurentide ice sheet (\"binge/purge\" oscillator  theory) which arose because the floor of Hudson Bay and Hudson  Strait is covered with soft, unconsolidated sediment that forms a  slippery lubricant when thawed.  The modeling work will be novel in  the sense that two separate finite-element grids, each designed to  optimize computational performance under the restrictions of  diverse ice flow mechanisms, will be used to asynchronously advance  the ice thickness distribution (and other fields) of the Laurentide  ice sheet through time.  The outcome of the proposed research will  include: 1) a verification of the binge/purge oscillator theory of  Heinrich Events through comparison of model output with the  geologic record, 2) estimation of the ice-rafted debris flux  associated with various methods of basal debris entrainment, and 3)  determination of the pre- and post-Heinrich Event ice topographies  for use in atmospheric circulation models.  ***",
