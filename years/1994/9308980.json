 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308980  Segnan    This one-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperation between Romeo  Segnan, American University, and Drs. Gianfranco Albanese and  Cesare Bucci, University of Parma, Italy.  They will perform  detailed Mossbauer Effect (ME) measurements in rare-earth-iron  compounds that exhibit huge magnetoelastic interactions.    Magnetostriction processes cannot be explained easily by  currently available models and theories.  It is possible that the  proposed Mossbauer Effect studies will provide the data and the  information that will elucidate this problem.  There may be  technological benefits as well in fields such as active vibration  control and precision machining, where large forces and small  displacements are required.    The Mossbauer measurements will be performed at the University of  Parma and will complement the magnetization and magnetostriction  measurements carried out in the U.S. at the Naval Surface Warfare  Center (NSWC).  This laboratory will provide samples of the  desired composition for the collaboration.  Dr. Segnan, who has  worked extensively in Mossbauer spectroscopy, has collaborated at  NSWC in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction  measurements.  The Parma group is known for its research in  Mossbauer spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hyperfine  interactions.  * * *",
