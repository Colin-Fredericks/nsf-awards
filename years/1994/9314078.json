 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314078  Conlon        This proposal is to partly fund a conference entitled \"Hard Problems in  Mathematical Physics\".  It is to be held at the University of Michigan on May  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 1994.  The meeting will feature up to 18 fifty minute lectures  together with contributed posters.         The conference concentrates on problems and ideas in mathematics which  are motivated by intuitions from theoretical physics.  The unifying theme is  the renormalization group philosophy which emerged in the physics literature  in the 1960's.  It is a way of analyzing a physical system by comparing the  behavior of the system on different length scales.        Many apparently diverse problems have been analyzed within the framework  of the renormalization group philosophy.  Among these are important  technological problems of image reconstruction from radiation data -- in the  health field MRI and CAT scans, in the energy field detection of oil wells.   Another example is the analysis of signals propagating through a random medium  such as the ocean.  This is a way of determining average ocean temperature - a  key factor for environmental planning.        This conference is unusual in that most of the speakers have a deep  understanding of physics as well as being excellent mathematicians.  It should  motivate the mostly mathematical audience to interact with physicists and  other scientists for problems and ideas which are both mathematically  interesting and scientifically important.  ***",
