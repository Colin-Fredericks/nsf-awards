 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401251  Friedman       This project is concerned with free boundary problems for  systems of partial differential equations.  Three classes of  problems are to be investigated: (i) Stefan type problems for a  reaction-diffusion system of nonlinear parabolic equations, (ii)  free boundary problems for Navier-Stokes equation (with a free  boundary which separates from the fixed boundary), and (iii)  plasma-type problems (reminiscent of the vortex patch problem)  arising when the motion of charged mass distribution is coupled  to the electric field generated by charged mass.  Some initial  progress has been made in each of these problems areas, but new  ideas and methods need to be developed for further progress.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  oftendevelops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
