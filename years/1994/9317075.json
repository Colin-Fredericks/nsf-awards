 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317075  Kettler       Despite the importance of Al and Cd chemistry to the  geological sciences there are few measurements of the association  quotients of their oxalate and malonate complexes.  The  investigator will measure the association quotients of Al-oxalate,  Al-malonate, Cd-oxalate, and Cd-malonate complexes in solutions  with ionic strengths ranging from 0.1 to 5m and at temperatures  ranging from 0-125 C.  These measurements will be made using  potentiometric methods by titrating oxalate or malonate solutions  into aqueous solutions of Cd or Al.  Na-trifluoromethanesulfonate  will be used as a non-complexing supporting electrolyte.  The data  obtained during these titrations will be regressed and equations  relating the relevant association constants to temperature and  ionic strength will be derived.       Al is the third most abundant element in the earth's crust.   Problems related to the dissolution of silicate minerals and the  environmental and public health effects of acid rain are  fundamentally problems of al speciation in aqueous solutions.   Although Cd is a trace metal, its toxicity and its ubiquity in  landfill leachates, sewage sludge, sulfide ore deposits, and fossil  shells give it great environmental and geologic importance.   Oxalate and malonate are difunctional carboxylic acid anions that  form strong complexes with metals.  These acid anions are  ubiquitous in soils and the by-product waters produced during  enhanced oil recovery and synthetic fuels operations.  They may  also be present in large amounts in some sedimentary basin brines.   This work should be of interest to a wide variety of researchers in  the geological and environmental sciences.",
