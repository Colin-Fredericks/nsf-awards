 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides supports the Fifth International Conference  on Hydrogen Effects on Material Behavior, scheduled in September  1994 at Jackson, Wyoming.  The only conferences in the United  States devoted solely to hydrogen embrittlement over the last  twenty years have been the preceding conferences in this series  in 1973, 1975, 1980 and 1989.  Earliest conferences concentrated  on new hydrogen phenomena and efforts to test existing  hypothesized mechanisms of embrittlement.  Recent conferences  have focused on mechanisms of behavior, refinements of  experimental approaches, and needs for future research to further  understanding.  The intent of this conference to provide a clear  statement of progress in understanding problems of hydrogen,  including those related to intermetallic alloys and other new  materials; to evaluate the prospects for corrective or preventive  approaches for hydrogen damage and/or embrittlement; and to  identify needs for future research.  This conference series has  clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of interaction among  university, industry, and government laboratory scientists and  engineers in addressing these problems and creating a stimulating  forum.    Materials specialists and designers are concerned with respect to  the behavior of new materials in environments containing sources  of hydrogen.",
