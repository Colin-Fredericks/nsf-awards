 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420356  Calvert       The research is for development of a solid freeform  fabrication system based on extrusion of a fine jet of  polymerizable slurry.  Three-dimensional parts are build up as a  series of layers under computer control, based on part geometry  data stored in the computer.  Preliminary results have been  obtained in conjunction with a local small business.  The  researched work will use two joined heads so that two-component  reagents can be used, allowing parts to be formed from a wide range  of strong polymers and from organic/inorganic hybrids by  coextrusion of alkoxide/monomer mixtures and water/monomer  mixtures.  It will also allow composite materials to be formed with  compositional gradients, or with short-fiber reinforced composites,  such that mechanical properties can be locally optimized.   Reinforced composites will be designed using finite element methods  to seek optimal distributions of reinforcements.       Rapid prototyping to near net shape offers numerous advantages  in terms of reducing cycle time, waste, and thus manufacturing  costs.  The ability to make complex composites should open the way  to biomimetic and intelligent materials which can achieve levels of  damage resistance and responsiveness found in biological materials.",
