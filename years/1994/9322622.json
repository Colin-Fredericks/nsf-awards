 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Bruce Ault of the University of Cincinnati will use   matrix isolation spectroscopy to study intermediates formed during   Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes.  Through these studies Ault   hopes to identify the initial steps in the mechanism of CVD as well as   the role of gas-phase versus surface-mediated reactions.  Along the way   he will characterize the structure and bonding of unusual species   isolated during these experiments.  Ault will use quantum-mechanical   calculations to help identify and characterize new intermediates.  %%%  Chemical Vapor Deposition is used to produce a wide range of insulating,   semiconducting, conducting, and superconducting thin films having great   societal and commercial importance.  In this project, very low   temperature experiments using materials dispersed through rare-gas   solids, thin films, or solutions will be conducted to isolate and   preserve the intermediate products of the chemical reactions involved in   CVD processing.  Knowledge of these products and of the mechanisms of CVD   can allow improvement in both the efficiency and the quality of the final   products in thin film manufacturing.",
