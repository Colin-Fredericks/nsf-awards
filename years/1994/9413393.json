 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413393, PI-Garmire:  This proposal is to develop a testbed to advance the state of the art in 10-90 GHz optoelecetronic devices for fiber and wireless communications as part of the emerging national information highway.  The tested will enable study of the high speed switching capabilities of functional, mode-locked semiconductor laser.  Monolithic mode-locked devices, in the range form 10-90 GHz, and achieve functionality by digitally switching mode-locked frequencies.  To minimize switching time and optimize efficiency, it is necessary to understand the interplay between nonlinear gain and the cavity resonance structure.  Ultra-fast optical pump-probe experiments are needed on multi-functional RF-modulated lasers, with time resolution much faster than the modulation rate.  The 1.3 um and 1.5 wavelength regions are needed because of their application to local area network and long-haul communications.  Development is needed for this testbed because there is no system in existence that combines ultra-short pulse generation at wavelengths of interest for optical communications with the electrical timing required to study modulated semiconductor lasers.  One developed, the proposed testbed will provide the basis for collaboration between investigators at University of California, Berkeley and University of Southern California.  These researchers combine expertise in optical pump-probe studies and expertise in advanced semiconductor lasers and cavity dynamics.  Also involved in the development will be experts in tunable solid state lasers.  A single mode-locked Nd:YAG laser will be used to pump both a Cr4+:Forsterite laser near 1.3 um and a Cr4+:YAG laser near 1.5 um.  New crystals and new approaches will also be sought to active greater wavelength  tuning and greater ease of operation.  Mechanisms for timing synchronism between the optics and electronics will be designed and built; the aim is to achieve the most practical and reliable systems to use in opto-electronic device studies.  If sufficient funds can be found, a synchronously pumped mode-locked optical parametric oscillator will also be built and its performance compared to tunable mode-locked lasers.  The outcome will be a unique testbed, located primarily at the Center for laser Studies at USC, with complementary facilities at UC Berkeley, designed for study of opto-electronic devices.  This testbed will be made available to researchers form other universities, industry, and government laboratories.  Research using the testbed  should result in new functional opto-electronic laser designs, along with definition and demonstration of performance measures in multi-GHz communication systems.  This testbed will be made available to researchers from other universities , industry, and government laboratories.  Research using the testbed should result in new functional opto-electronic laser designs, along with definition and demonstration of performance measures in multi-GHz communication systems.  This testbed will also further the basic science of carrier dynamic as a function of time and position within functional semiconductor lasers.  Matching support will come form several compainies, the Center for Laser Studies Industrial Affiliates Program, and from USC's gift program for research.",
