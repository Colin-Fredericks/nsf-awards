 "awd_abstract_narration": "Raskin  9410476  This is an award to provide support for research on the causes  and control of foaming in aerobic and anaerobic, suspended growth  bioreactors. The investigator plans on designing oligonucleotide  rRNA-targeted probes that are specific for identifying several  foam-causing microorganisms.  The probes will be used to study  and characterize the conditions that lead to foaming and the  microbiological flora associated with foaming in bioreactors that  are used in waste treatment processes.    Foaming is a problem commonly associated with bioreactors used in  wastewater treatment processes and in the processing of residuals  produced during the treatment process.  The foaming problem is  frequently associated with conditions that result in dominance by  filamentous microorganisms in the reactors.  Results of this  research are expected to provide new insights into the causes of  foaming and the potential for its control.  This knowledge is  expected to be applied in improving the operation of existing  bioreactors and in improving the engineering design of systems  utilizing bioreactors.  The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards  Program.  ***",
