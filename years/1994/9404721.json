 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9404721  Promoters in higher eukaryotes tend to have complex structures.  In  Saccharomyces cerevisiae the upstream activating sequence (UAS)  elements of glycolytic enzyme genes closely resemble enhancers and  proximal promoter elements of higher eukaryotes in that they are  composed of multiple binding sites for several different  transcription factors. Each protein binding site by itself displays  little UAS activity, but together they form powerful UAS elements.   The transcription factors believed to assemble at the UAS elements  of glycolytic genes include Abflp, Reb1p, Rap1p, Gcr1p, Gcr2p, and  Ga111p.  The individual roles of the proteins and how they interact  to form the strongest promoters in yeast are not known.  The goal  of this study is to provide information as to the precise roles  played by several of these transcription factors.  Specifically: i)  The  hypothesis that binding of Abflp and Reb1p functions to clear  nucleosomes from adjacent binding sites, thereby allowing other  proteins access to their binding sites is tested.  ii) The  importance of spatial relationships between Rap1p- and Gcr1p-  binding sites in the UAS elements of glycolytic genes is  investigated.  iii) Yeast strains with mutations in gcr2 and gal11  are utilized to assess the roles of the co-factors Gcr2p and Gal11p  in displacing nucleosomes from the TATA-box.  iv) Environmental  factors which may influence the ability of transcription factors to  bind at glycolytic gene promoters are investigated.  These  experiments will provide important new information as to how the  individual activator proteins interact in a combinatorial fashion  at eukaryotic promoters to mediate high-level expression.  ***  One of the major control points of gene expression is the  regulation of transcription.  An enzyme known as RNA polymerase is  responsible for converting the genetic information from DNA to RNA.   Promoters are regions in the DNA which are required to bring RNA  polymerase to genes so they can be t ranscribed.  They are made of  sequences known as the TATA-box, proximal promoters, and enhancers  or upstream activating sequences (UAS).  Proximal promoters and  enhancers or UAS elements are sites in the DNA to which proteins  bind.  Proteins that bind at these sequences activate transcription  by influencing events that occur at the TATA-box.  The focus of  this study is to elucidate the precise roles played by the proteins  that assemble at the UAS elements of glycolytic enzyme genes in the  yeast, Saccharomyces cervisiae.  In yeast, genes encoding  glycolytic enzymes are the most highly expressed.  A number of  abundant, multifunctional proteins are required for full expression  of yeast glycolytic genes.  While combinatorial interactions  between these proteins at the UAS elements of glycolytic genes has  been well documented, the mechanism(s) governing their interactions  have yet to be established.  The aims of this study are: i) To test  a sequential binding hypothesis.  ii) To determine the importance  of the spatial relationships.  iii) To investigate the role of  cofactors which are believed to influence events at the TATA-box.   iv) To investigate environmental factors which may influence the  ability of transcription factors to bind at glycolytic gene UAS  elements, thus regulating expression.  %%%",
