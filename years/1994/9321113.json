 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hegg       Because the precipitation of clouds is low, sulfate particles  go through several cloud condensation-evaporation events before  they are removed.  This processing within the cloud, involving the  absorption of gaseous SO2 into cloud droplets and subsequent  oxidation to SO4, has two important effects.  First, initially small  particles gain mass during cloud condensation-evaporation cycles  and are thus able to reach activatable size at lower cloud  supersaturation.  This enables them to impact a much wider range of  cloud type, e.g. the low supersaturation marine stratus clouds that  are so important climatically.  Second, an increase in mass occurs  even for larger particles (r 0.1 um) that have served as cloud  condensation nuclei (CCN) during several could cycles.  These  particles grow into the Mie scattering regime and become more  effective light scatters.  In summary, the aqueous phase production  of sulfate in clouds (followed by evaporation) potentially produces  aerosols that are better CCN and more efficient light scatterers.       In this SGER study, an attempt is to be made to quantify in-  cloud sulfate production in marine stratiform clouds at the Cheeka  Peak Research Station on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state.   The consequences of the amount of sulfate production observed for  direct and indirect radiative forcing of climate will then be  examined.  This will be done both through diagnostic modeling  studies to relate the observed sulfate production to changes in CCN  activity and light-scattering, and by comparing the results with  those of colleagues who will be simultaneously measuring the  particle size distribution, and light-scattering properties of the  sulfate aerosols.",
