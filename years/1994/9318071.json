 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this application, we propose to upgrade the existing  Department of Biology Optical Sectioning Microscope (OSM)  Facility.  We are requesting several pieces of equipment  that will facilitate the use of the instrument and provide  new capabilities that will enhance the facility.  The OSM  uses the computational methods of out-of-focus light removal  to provide high resolution 3-D images of both living and  fixed specimens.  Its main advantage over confocal  microscopy is that is uses far lower levels of illumination  to generate high quality images, thereby minimizing the  damage to living specimens.  Our request for upgrading the  facility has four main components.  First, we wish to add  confocal and partially confocal optics to the OSM, so that  depending on the sensitivity of the specimen, we may choose  to apply computational methods to either non-confocal,  partially confocal or fully confocal images.  Second, we  propose to add the capability for producing video output so  that we have a means to store many movies of 3-D time-lapse  sequences for our own analysis, and also a means to record  representative movies for presentation to seminar audiences.  Third, we request improvements that will facilitate the  storage, retrieval and hard copy output of the massive data  sets that we work with, so that the data are more easily  accessible.  Fourth, we seek to add the capability for  microinjection to the OSM, so that several different sorts  of in vivo injection experiments can be performed  expeditiously,  The main purpose of all of these  enhancements is to make the instrument more accessible to  the users and to remedy current shortcomings in the  facility.  With the addition of these components, our OSM  facility will remain on the forefront of biological imaging  and continue to facilitate our research for many years to  come.",
