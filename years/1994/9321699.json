 "awd_abstract_narration": "McGovern  9321699      Approximately 50% of the active bacteria that can be counted  in seawater resist attempts to culture.  One reason may be  that bacteria are capable, under natural conditions of  stress, of entering a viable but nongrowing state.  The  viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state involves a metabolic  program in which the cell remains viable and maintains a low  level of metabolism, but cannot be cultured.  Understanding  the factors that govern entry into this state may provide a  window of entry into the biology of the uncluturable  bacteria of the ocean,  The best characterized system for  studying entry into and exit form the VBNC state is the  marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus. V. vulnificus enters  the VBNC state in response to temperature downshifts.  Entry  into the VBNC state poses problems at the DNA level:  the  chromosome-associated DNA binding proteins (sometimes called  \"histone-like\" proteins) may play an important role in the  VBNC state.  One of the these proteins,  HNS, has been shown  to silence transcription in vivo and to stabilize and  ordered DNA structure in vitro.  Its pleiotropic effects  indicate that this protein plays a role in allowing cells to  sense various types of environmental change. HNS is an  abundant, cold-inducible protein that varies in  concentration over the course of a cell's growth cycle,  reaching its maximal concentration during stationary phase,  a period of relative metabolic quiescence.  This project  will test the hypothesis that during a temperature  downshift, the V. vulnificus homolog of HNS is induced,  silencing expression of genes needed for normal growth and  leading to the VBNC state in that bacterium.  Such a system  could account for a significant portion of the nonculturable  bacteria present in the ocean environment.    ***",
