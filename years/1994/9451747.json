GMI students and their employers represent a broad spectrum of  manufacturers. For many of these manufacturers the control of noise  and vibration has become a major concern as public demand has  increased for smoother and quieter appliances, vehicals, etc.   Employees in industrial firms also require protection from  potential harmful industrial noises and vibrations.  The intent of the Acoustics, Noise and Vibration course is to  convey physical insight into these processes by covering the theory  of acoustics and vibration while presenting practical examples of  solutions to frequently encountered noise and vibration problems.   This project supports this course by the creation of a laboratory  which will have exercises developed around a Modal/Spectrum  analyzer capable of both bodal and acoustic data acquisition and  analysis.  These exercises will give students hands-on experience  with the equipment and procedures used in industry for noise and  vibration measurement while demonstrating underlying physical  principles. Exercises will include tests to determine: noise  generated by mechanisms and machine components; noise attenuation  in materials, and active and passive silencers; and the  cross-correlation of noise with modal vibrations in structures.",
