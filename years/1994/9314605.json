 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314605  Greenblatt  Experience shows that materials with novel behavior are likely to  be discovered when competing electronic interactions exist. In  low-dimensional materials, the interplay of competing electronic  interactions is enhanced. The object of this project is the  synthesis and characterization of new reduced transition metal  compounds with quasi-low-dimensional properties. Systems of  interest include: (1) transition metal (Nb, Ta and W) bronzes and  (2) molybdenum, niobium, and rhenium cluster compounds. The focus  of the experimental program is to synthesize new materials of  strongly-correlated electron systems that are on the verge of  electronic and structural instabilities, and to fine tune the  competing electronic interactions through the unstable region in  a controlled way. Particular emphasis will be placed on the  preparation of single crystal specimens to study the structural  and orientation dependent physical properties. Single crystal  measurements of the electrical resistivity, magnetic  susceptibility, specific heat as a function of temperature, DTA,  ESR, FTIR, optical and XANE spectroscopies will be used to  characterize samples of interest. Structural and physical  property relationships will be stressed. Transitions associated  with the onset of charge density waves (CDW) and/or  superconductivity will be sought and characterized. These studies  are expected to yield novel materials, provide fundamental  insights into correlated electronic behavior and uHimately allow  the enhancement and control of electronic instabilities that lead  to interesting and useful macroscopic properties.  ***",
