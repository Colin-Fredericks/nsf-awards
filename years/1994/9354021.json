In the evenings each participant  builds a versatile PC interface box with A/D converter,  instrumentation amplifier, strain gauge, and magnetic field  detector.  Comprehensive software packages have been developed  at Rose-Hulman for all interface hardware.  Participants get an  overview of these packages, and a look at recently developed  classroom and demonstration software.  All of the source code  for this software is provided to the participants.A $500  commitment is asked of each participant's institution for the  purchase of physics laboratory interface equipment.  One  potential gain is the 'recycling' of older PCs to the physics  laboratory where even 8088 machines can still be useful.  ***",
