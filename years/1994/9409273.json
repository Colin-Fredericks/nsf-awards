 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409273  Ray       The author proposes to investigate several open problems in  nonlinear time series analysis, with the goal of combining  techniques from nonparametric regression modeling and linear time  series analysis and extending them to the nonlinear time series  framework. In particular, the author plans to investigate the  appropriateness of nonparametric regression techniques for  modeling nonlinear processes having very slowly decaying serial  correlation, known as long-range dependence.  Modifications of  existing procedures that take into account the amount of  correlation in a series will be investigated.  Additionally,  the author will investigate appropriate methods of testing  model assumptions underlying the use of nonlinear regression  algorithms when the algorithms are applied to time series.       The author also plans to extend existing methodology  concerning tests of nonlinearity in univariate series to the  multivariate case. Data-driven methods for obtaining full  multivariate nonlinear models will be investigated.  Finally, the  author will consider the advantages, in terms of forecasting,  of using a data-driven nonlinear model for data which suggests  a nonlinear generating process.  ***",
