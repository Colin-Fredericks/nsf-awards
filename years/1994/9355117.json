The focus of the program is  \"human-accelerated environmental change.\"  Our program will expose  doctoral students to problems of human-accelerated environmental  change and their potential solutions, and encourage cross-  disciplinary collaborative research while retaining strong,  flexible training in ecological research.  We will accomplish these  goals through a mix of traditional and novel programs, including  coursework and seminars, apprenticeships with environmental  management agencies, and an annual long-term monitoring exercise.   In addition, students in the program will be exposed to the policy  and management implications of ecological research.  Students will  be encouraged to work on the \"big problems\" of environmental  change, but at scales suitable for doctoral research.         The program will create a community of bright, concerned  students in a supportive atmosphere in which to pursue thesis  research on important environmental question.  By both formalizing  and expanding on the goodwill and the many existing interactions  between Cornell and the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the  proposed consortial arrangement offers an exceptional opportunity  for a new group of graduate students to work in a nationally  important area of science.    ***",
