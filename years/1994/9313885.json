 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kleppa is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Metals,   Ceramics, and Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials   Research to continue his research in the study of high temperature   calorimetry of refractory materials.  The major emphasis of this work is   on the thermochemistry of binary intermetallic compounds.  The research   emphasizes the following areas of high-temperature reaction calorimetry:   1) Thermochemistry of alloys of the lanthanide elements with late   transition metals and with noble metals; 2) Thermochemistry of alloys of   Group V transition metals with the late transition metals; 3) Mixing   calorimetry at 1473 K, above temperatures where fused silica refactories   can be used; and 4) New applications of high temperature direct synthesis   calorimetry for studies of the enthalpies of formations between basic and   acidic oxides.    There are a number of applications which require materials which maintain   their structural integrity at extremely high temperatures even beyond the   temperature at which silica melts.  Binary intermetallic alloys between   transition elements, and between lanthanide elements and transition   metals have excellent refractory properties.  Kleppa 's research group is   one of the few remaining groups in the United States which performs   systematic calorimetric studies of binary intermetallic compounds.  This   research provides important fundamental insights into the way in which   properties of these materials depend on electronic structures of the   metals involved.",
