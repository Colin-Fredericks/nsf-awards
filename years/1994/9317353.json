 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317353  Meltzer    Under the direction of Dr. David Meltzer, Mr. Frederick Sellet will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze lithic  material collected from the site of Hell Gap Wyoming. Discovered  over 30 years ago this site is crucial for understanding the early  prehistory of the Western United States because it contains well  preserved faunal and lithic remains which span approximately half  the recorded length of known human occupation in the New World. The  site has provided an important input into the definition of  cultures and lithic types. Because Hell Gap is located in close  proximity to stone source areas, the assemblage is particularly  rich in stone tools and manufacturing byproducts. Unfortunately  because of the untimely deaths of the two main excavators the  materials have not been properly analyzed and published. Mr. Sellet  will help to remedy this problem through his work on one important  class of data: the lithic materials. He will study both the raw  materials themselves in an attempt to determine stone utilization  and examine how tools were manufactured. Taken together, these data  will provide insight into Paleoindian mobility and subsistence  strategies and how these changed over time.    Stone tools serve as cultural markers and can often differentiate  one group or time period from another. Traditionally archaeologists  have examined lithic materials with such goals in mind. In recent  years however it has been recognized that additional information  such as how people move over the landscape, how they schedule their  activities and whether they curate materials or practice an  expedient technology could also be addressed. Taken together such  information provides insight into cultural adaptation. While  techniques to address such goals are now well developed in Europe,  they have been little applied in the United States. Mr. Sellet's  research will both provide information about the Hell Gap site and  potentially serve as a methodological g uide for New World  archaeologists.    The project is also important because it will provide valuable data  of interest to many archaeologists and increase understanding of  U.S. prehistory. It will assist in the training of a promising  young scientist.  ***",
