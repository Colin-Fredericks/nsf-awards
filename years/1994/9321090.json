 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 9321090    Boysen      Linguistic, numerical, and some other cognitive capacities have long been believed to be uniquely human, but recent studies of animal behavior have revealed some surprising parallels.  In order to understand how and why our ancestors developed these capacities, it is important to find out how widespread such abilities are in the animal kingdom and to learn what roles these abilities play in the natural lives of the animals that have them.  Procedures developed for studying these abilities in animals have been put to use in the training of people with brain injuries and developmental disabilities.    Dr. Boysen has been successfully studying numerical capacities of chimpanzees.  Now she will explore number-related skills of capuchin monkeys with procedures that parallel her previous work on counting by chimpanzees.  Capuchins are known to use tools in their natural habitat, such as rocks to pound nuts until they open and sticks to extract sap and insects.  Because of this demonstrated expertise, capuchins are excellent candidates for exploring complex conceptual abilities such as counting and other number-related skills.  The monkeys' training and testing will be completed using a computer touch-frame system that will permit them to make responses directly to a computer screen, automatically recording all data.  Each monkey will first be trained on matching one, two, or three marks to an array of the same number of candies.  Once the monkey can do that, the marks will be replaced with Arabic numerals, and the monkey must select the numeral that corresponds to the number of candies presented.  Number comprehension will also be tested by showing the monkey a numeral on the computer monitor and having it choose an array composed of the same number of items.  These phases of training directly parallel Dr. Boysen's earlier studies with chimpanzees, and thus will permit a direct comparison of the abilities of monkeys and apes with the emergence of numerical competence and cou nting in young children.",
