Current injection molding investigations  conducted in the polymer processing laboratory implement the use of  electromechanical controls, which are satisfactory in illustrating  basic interactions between process variables and part quality. The  addition of injection molding experiments which allow for the  isolation of a wider selection of parameters using microprocessor  adaptive control will prepare students for typical polymer  processing situations seen in industry. Further, the proposed  equipment will be capable of interfacing with a computer integrated  manufacturing (CIM) environment, allowing for further enhancement  of both the polymer processing and the CIM programs at GMI.  Use of the proposed equipment will extend through all levels of  secondary and postsecondary education. Junior and senior level  Mechanical and Manufacturing Systems Engineering students will be  provided with injection molding experiences which will enhance  their understanding of theoretical relationships between processing  variables and part quality. They will also receive microprocessor  control experience appropriate to their work experience. All  freshman engineering students at GMI will benefit from experiences  on the proposed equipment during the course of Introduction to  Manufacturing Processes. Finally, high school women and minority  students working with the Principal Investigator will be exposed to  modern polymer processing equipment certain to inspire them in the  pursuit of further education in science, technology, and  engineering.",
