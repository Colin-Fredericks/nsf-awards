To effectively implement such a program we need  computers directly interfaced to the experiments.  We presently  have nine Zenith 486 work stations for data analysis, but we need  the interfacing equipment.  The heart of the project will be the  development of new experiments or the modification of existing  experiments for the explicit purpose of creating a true laboratory  environment in which the students can participate in the discovery  and rapid analysis of physical phenomena.  The significance of the  project is the introduction of computers so that the students will  be able to collect the data, analyze it immediately, and then  proceed further with additional measurements and analysis, while  they are still in the lab and not at home.  This approach is  further enhanced by interfacing some of the experiments each  semester.  It makes it possible to perform more experiments in the  allowed time frame and to perform experiments in real time not  possible at all at this level before.  This principal users of this  laboratory will be biology majors, and as such several integrated  biology/physics experiments will be implemented, the physics being  motivated by the biological application.  This course is considered  intermediate in level among the introductory laboratory courses  offered in the physics department, therefore making it easier to  implement the methods in the other courses.",
