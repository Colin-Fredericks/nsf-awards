 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Field Programmable  Interconnect Devices (FPIDs) allow the integration of thousands of  logic gates on a small board and completely rearrange their  interconnections rapidly for different applications.  A major  obstacle to using such reconfigurable systems is the lack of  software tools to aid in designing applications to run on the  system forcing the designers to manually partition their design to  match the architecture of a particular reconfigurable system.  This  project aims at modifying the Anyboard design environment to  support many types of FPGAs and FPIDs.  Additionally the basic  algorithm to partition the design will be redesigned with a faster  and more sophisticated version.  The design tools developed by X  Engineering Software Services Corporation would aid digital  designers to experiment with alternate designs using different  types of FPGAs and FPIDs.",
