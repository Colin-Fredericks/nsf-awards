 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416175  Henke  The aim of this project is to help advance the Nation's  ability to engineer freeway structures to resist  earthquakes.    The main objective is to provide detailed information on in  situ undegraded nonlinear inelastic shear stress vs strain  characteristics for the soil deposits at the sites of the  three freeway structures that collapsed during the 1994  Northridge earthquake.  The information is expected to be of  value to analytical investigations aimed at identifying the  roles of soil conditions in the collapses.  The sites are  the I-5/Highway 14 Interchange, Highway 118 close to  Woodley, and I-10 at La Cienega.  Local soil conditions may  have amplified ground motions at these sites.  The main  feature of the project is that uncertainty caused by test-  related disturbances to in situ conditions is expected to be  held to a relatively low level.    Data is to be measured using a field prototype simplified in  situ torsional cylindrical impulse shear testing system  currently being constructed for the Federal Highway  administration (FHwA). This method provides detailed  information on in situ undegraded nonlinear inelastic shear  stress vs strain characteristic for soil deposits.  The  method addresses the well known, but not yet fully-resolved,  problem of obtaining detailed information on the soil  characteristics of interest without disturbing in situ  conditions excessively.  This problem can cause considerable  uncertainty in the results of earthquake analyses.    This project is being co-funded with the FHwA.  ***",
