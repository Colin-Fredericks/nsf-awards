Museum educators and adolescent  interns act as multi-cultural role models in exhibit areas and  facilitate hands-on learning.     Every year the exhibit will serve over 500,000 children, parents  and teachers in Chicago's inner city and metropolitan  neighborhoods.  A large percentage of this audience is under-served  minority children drawn from CCM's alliances with diverse ethnic  community agencies.  This exhibit provides a safe haven where young  multi-cultural, often disadvantaged children  may find support for  science learning and be encouraged to grow and participate in the  many science fairs, science clubs, and invention conventions  available to adolescents in the Chicago area.  ***",
