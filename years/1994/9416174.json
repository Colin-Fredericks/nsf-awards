 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416174  Iwan  The objective of this project is to determine the nature and  importance of potentially serious structural response problems  associated with near-field earthquake ground motions such as  those observed during the Northridge earthquake.  Measured near-  field ground motions from the Northridge earthquake indicate very  high velocities and pulse-like ground displacements.  These  motions are capable of causing high levels of demand for a wide  range of different types of structures including base-isolated  buildings and multi-story buildings.    The high velocity pulses observed in the near-field of the  Northridge earthquake are of great concern for the performance of  taller multi-story buildings.  The stress waves in the structure  that are caused by these high velocities can result in very high  story drift that may, in turn, cause failure of structural  elements.  Preliminary indications are that story drifts induced  by near-field velocity pulses during the Northridge earthquake  may have significantly exceeded the code allowable values.  In  light of the poor performance of a number of steel moment  resisting frame buildings in the earthquake, this is an issue  that demands urgent resolution.  In this project, simple linear  shear-beam model is employed to determine the magnitude of the  problem and to identify the factors that are most important in  developing solutions to the problem.    The results of this investigation will provide insights in to  whether changes are needed in the seismic design of multi-story  structures to account for the near-field effects.  If changes are  needed, they need to be identified as quickly as possible before  more serious consequences occur.  ***",
