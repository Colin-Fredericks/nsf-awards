Two major areas  of study will be undertaken.  Both are concerned with  interpretation of renormalized characteristic classes and their  relation to analytic problems on complex manifolds with boundary.    The first involves uniformization and structure of complex  hyperbolic manifolds.  The uniformization question is that of  determining when a component of a complex manifold which is a  compact, connected, spherical CR-manifold can be realized as a  domain of a ball in n-complex variables modulo a properly  discontinuous group of CR-automorphisms.  The second line of  investigation considers certain linear partial differential  equations with the goal of finding analytic interpretations of  characteristic numbers which are finite for Riemannian or Kahler  manifolds of infinite volume.  Work will also be done in an  effort to prove a converse to a recent result on Grauert tubes.   Namely, to show that all biholomorphisms of these manifolds are  induced by isometries.       Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the  century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one  complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory  differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms.",
