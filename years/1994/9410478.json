The dielectric spectroscopy  will be conducted over 14 decades in frequency.  The nature of the  singularity in the interface that occurs when a singlr drop of  liquid splits into two or more separate sections will be probed  using photographic techniques.  The observations will be modeled  with detailed numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.   In addition, simulations of patterns (temporal as well as spatial)  that occur in a variety of geophysical contexts will be simulated.    Non-technical abstract:  An investigation will be carried out by  which glasses are formed by the cooling of a liquid.  Many  different spectroscopies will be used and compared to each other.   Another investigation is concerned with how a single drop of liquid  splits into two or more components.  This study will be done using  photographic techniques coupled with detailed numerical  simulations.  Finally, a study will be continued in which  simulations are carried out of patterns that occur in a variety of  geophysical contexts such as earthquakes and river formation.  ***",
