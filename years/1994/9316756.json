 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9316756  We propose to build upon the progress we have made in this system  towards understanding how the circadian clock effects changes in  the transcription of the Arabidopsis cab2 gene.  In particular, we  wish to further characterize a 78bp DNA fragment that we have shown  to be able to confer circadian regulation upon heterologous  promoters.  We wish to dissect at the nucleotide level the precise  genomic targets for the signal transduction pathways that emanate  from the circadian clock and phytochrome.  These studies will be  greatly enhanced by using a cab2-luciferase gene fusion that  provides a bioluminescent marker for monitoring cab2 transcription  in living transgenic seedlings.  Furthermore, we have identified  three specific DNA binding activities that recognize conserved  targets within the cab2 5'upstream region.  We propose a detailed  characterization of these proteins that will define their  contribution to regulated transcription and will ultimately result  in cloning the genes that encode these factors.  This will provide  a first step from the genomic targets towards the signal  transduction components that regulate cab2 transcription.  %%%  This proposal describes experiments that address a central question  in biology:  What is the mechanism of action of the circadian  clock?  Given the ubiquitous presence of circadian-regulated  processes, advances in one particular system should have broad  impact.  We have chosen higher plants as our model system, and we  will focus our studies in Arabidopsis thaliana.  ***",
