 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355760  Baumann    The Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary requests $58,414 from the Informal  Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation to  infuse an environmental education message with innovative  approaches to visitor self-instruction, through the two elements  which comprise our Communities and Connections in the World of  Nature project.  This $364,097 project is an ambitious attempt to  introduce and involve BBWS visitors with the fascinating  interactions of life which hold all living communities together.   Fine and coarse grain examination of 11 ecological concepts (e.g.,  habitat, human impacts, energy flow, etc.)  central to these  interactions is achieved through a creative blend of innovative  public programs, museum-style interactive exhibits, engaging  graphics and habitat-oriented live animal displays.    Specifically, NSF funding will allow BBWS to:    1)  Develop and conduct participatory educational programs (Jr.  Naturalist/ages 5-8, Jr. Ecologist/ages 9-12) that introduce  ecological themes and concepts to families and school groups.    2)  Develop and produce a 180 sq. ft. computer-based interact  exhibit (Habitat Puzzle) that encourages visitors to explore  ecological concepts of habitat composition in depth.",
