 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311657  Mingst  This award supports the participation of six U.S. social scientists  in a workshop with European colleagues to plan a collaborative  research project on the factors that affect national cooperation in  European integration.  The meeting is co-organized by Karen Mingst of  the University of Kentucky, Margaret Karns of the University of  Dayton, Bengt Sundelius of the University of Stockholm, Sweden and  Volker Rittberger of the University of Tubingen, Germany.  They will  be joined by a small but diverse group of senior and junior scholars  and students from Sweden, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and the  United States.  The participants are specialists in international  organizations, foreign policy analysis, theories of cooperation and  the European Community.    The workshop project will apply a common conceptual framework  developed by the co-organizers for a set of systematic, focused case  studies utilizing both cross-time and cross-national comparisons.   Past efforts at integration and institutional development and reform  have been products of an elite alliance of transnational officials  and pan-European business groups.  The difficulties experienced in  more recent stages demonstrate the influence of domestic interest  groups and citizens.  The studies will use three types of domestic  societal variables and four types of cooperation problems to examine  the domestic factors propelling, constraining or inhibiting  cooperation.    Previous work in cooperation theory has largely treated states as  unified actors and has ignored the interactions between domestic and  international politics.  Efforts to broaden the European Community  have made it obvious that domestic support is important and is  affected by a number of variables.  This project will advance the  state of knowledge in cooperation theory by examining how different  levels and patterns of domestic support affect the dynamics of the  cooperation process.  The organizers are active members of the  Internatio nal Studies Association (ISA), and are involved in its  recent efforts to stimulate greater international scholarly  interaction and cooperation.  This transatlantic workshop is  intended, in part, to serve as a demonstration project for future  ISA-sponsored workshops.  ***",
