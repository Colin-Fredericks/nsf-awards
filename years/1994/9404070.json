 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404070  Deng  The traditional role of the applied mathematician is to take a  real system and find out what its properties are. However, the  properties of the specific system cannot be discovered unless one  knows what the possibilities are, and the possibilities are often  revealed only by the general abstract theory. Practice and theory  progress best hand-in-hand. Three projects are proposed in this  proposal.  They all deal with basic mechanisms by which complex  and chaotic structures arise in real systems. The theoretical  results are useful in giving better understanding to experimental  and numerical results from a system of chemical reaction, insulin  secretion in pancreatic beta cells, and electrical pulses along  nerve axon. They are also important in guiding future experiments  and practical applications of these systems.    Three projects are proposed. The first project concerns a type of  degenerate heteroclinic loop bifurcation with application to the  existence of pulsing waves in a two-phase flow through a packed  column.  The second project concerns the orbit-flip homoclinic  bifurcation in the Rinzel-Terman model for the electrical  activity of pancreatic beta cells.  The bifurcation is related to  the transition from continuous spiking to intermittent spiking of  the membrane potential.  The third project concerns strategy and  numerical technique for locating bifurcation values of a  diffusion parameter in a system of bistable reaction diffusion  equations.  These values are such so that a heteroclinic loop  corresponding to traveling front and back waves changes its twist  type, which often signals the generation of chaotic dynamics.",
