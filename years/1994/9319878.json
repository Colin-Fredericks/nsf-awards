 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402392  Aktan  PIs obtained permission from the City of Cincinnati to install an  active vibration control system under the ballroom floor of the  Cincinnati Convention Center.  Highly perceptible floor vibration  has occurred during large dance events, causing concern to ballroom  patrons.      The control system which will feature several electromagnetic  actuators, several dozens of different types of sensor and a  modular open hardware system will remain installed over a  sufficiently long time period in order to permit other researchers  in the national program to participate in many of the basic,  system-integration and experimental demonstration aspects.      The research will make use of the multiple sensor/actuator  availability for developing an validating failure detection and  accommodation algorithms which will have the capability to detect  any hardware/software failures.  The algorithms will be based on  the adaptive modal filter concept which was used successfully for  the active-control of the highway bridge.  Also to be explored is  the development of a secondary capability of the control system to  continuously monitor itself for accommodating the deliberate or  random changes which will occur in the structural characteristics.   Such a continuous monitoring of the facility characteristics will  permit to uncouple the changes in the structural dynamic properties  due to occupation/owner intervention from large fluctuations caused  by ambient condition changes.  As importantly, a realistic multi-  output installation is expected to reveal as-yet-undiscovered  phenomena such as those related to inter-component interactions.   Such issues will have to be identified and addressed in order to  bring this technology forward to widespread industry acceptance.",
