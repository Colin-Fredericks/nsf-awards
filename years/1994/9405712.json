As part of a  project studying peasant agricultural production in Nigeria, the  investigator, a senior professor, will study the use of  Geographic Information Systems, mapping software, and the  analysis of remote sensing imagery at Indiana University.  The  research questions involve explaining how peasant farmers  exploited a newly farmed region in Nigeria with traditional hoe  farming technologies, what their economic efficiencies are, and  how they maintain food self-sufficiency as well as market  production.  The learning process will rely mainly on analysis of  three Landsat scenes spanning a number of years using ERDAS (an  imaging software), three series of aerial photographs from 1963,  1972, and 1978, and ARCINFO (a GIS program).  The integration of  ethnographic information with remote sensing is still  experimental and innovative, rather than routine, for social  scientists.  The training will take place at the Center for  Training and Research on Global Environmental Change at Indiana  University.     This project is important because it strengthens the scientific  expertise of American social scientists in this new technology at  the same time that the training involves dealing with critically  important research questions involving food self-sufficiency in  sub-Saharan Africa.",
