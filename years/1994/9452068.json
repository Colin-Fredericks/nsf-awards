 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452068  Qazi  The Research Foundation of the State University of New York, for  and on behalf of the SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome,  requests $51,496 from the National Science Foundation to develop  a cost effective, real-time multimedia communication facility. We  propose to link the Institute's image processing and fiber optic  communication laboratories by an optical network to improve  undergraduate instruction. The SUNY Institute of Technology has  committed $25,748 in matching funds for this project.  The  proposed project is intended to serve the needs of undergraduates  enrolled in the five electrical engineering technology (ETC)  courses that will be enhanced through this project. Undergraduate  students majoring in electrical engineering technology, computer  technology, photonics, and telecommunications will also benefit  from the improved curricula. The enhanced laboratory environment  will permit students to acquire hands-on experience using a  real-time system for the transmission of voice, video, and data;  to study the design of this facility; and to evaluate its merits.  Students will also learn how to capture, store, playback, and  process multimedia data on a personal computer using a fiber  optic local area network. Students will gain knowledge in the  areas of fiber optics, image processing, data compression, and  networking, all of which have become vitally important to  business and industry today with the emergence and rapid growth  of multimedia technology. Real-time lab experiments with software  and hardware will be used to achieve a stimulating hands-on  education.  The duration of the project will be 30 months.",
