The goal of the program is to  attract and retain qualified female and minority students in  science, mathematics and engineering, by reforming aspects of  introductory science courses--content, climate and  pedagogy--that discourage capable students from further study  of science. The program is founded on the assumption that  incorporating new scholarship about gender, science and  pedagogy into the design of introductory curriculum will  increase the quality of introductory courses in ways that will  be attractive to female and minority students.  The program  supports Distinguished Visiting Professorships of Women in  Science on host campuses selected from among the universities  of the UW System. Visitors are scientists (from inside and  outside of Wisconsin) who have successfully implemented race-  and gender-friendly teaching innovations at their home  institutions. Visitors teach model introductory science courses  and participate in extensive faculty development activities  with their hosts. The program also offers Faculty Fellowships  to release host faculty to develop new curricula.  In addition,  faculty development workshops are sponsored at various UW  System institutions. The Visitors and Fellows develop new or  revised courses that will affect thousands of students in the  near future. Faculty development activities will enhance the  content, climate, and pedagogy of introductory science courses  more broadly throughout the UW System.  A comprehensive  evaluation of the program in underway.  Findings and curricular  materials will be disseminated nationally.  ***",
