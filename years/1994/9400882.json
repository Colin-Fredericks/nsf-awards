This  work is in keeping with a major theme in modern number theory,   that discrete geometric information can be studied analytically.   This approach seems to be very effective for problems in number  theory, particularly diophantine problems.         This work falls in the general area of Number Theory.   Number Theory is the study of properties of the whole numbers and  is the oldest branch of systematic mathematics. Number theorists  often study diophantine problems where equations are required to  have exact numerical solutions. In modern days, these diophantine  problems have furnished the driving force to creation of new  theories in many other parts of mathematics. Recently Number  Theory and diophantine methods have found astonishing  applications in theoretical computer science and communication.",
