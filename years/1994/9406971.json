 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406971  Rodl    This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research in Probabilistic  Combinatorics is between Drs. Vojtech Rodl and Dwight Duffus of  Emory University and Drs. Michal Karonski, Tomasz Luczak, and  Andrzej Rucinski of the Institute of the Department of Discrete  Mathematics of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan.  The  problems addressed in this research belong to probabilistic  combinatorics.  They either deal with properties of random  structures or are expected to be solved by probabilistic means.   The Polish investigators are experts in the theory of random  graphs, which, besides its own interest, provides powerful tools  for solving many hard problems.  Specifically, the researchers  will examine: (1) extremal and Ramsey type properties of random  structures; (2) probabilistic approach to some extremal and  Ramsey-type problems; (3) matchings in random graphs and  hypergraphs; (4) phase transition in graph processes with bounded  maximum degree; and (5) enumeration of order preserving maps.      This proposed research in mathematics and computer science  fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling  leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.  ***",
