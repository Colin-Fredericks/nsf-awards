 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appendage morphology and numbers are the keys used to define  arthropod subgroups and on that basis, insects are thought to have  evolved from a myriapod-like animal which had identical limbs on  each of many trunk segments. In a dipteran insect, Drosophila  melanogaster, a gene named distal-less (Dll) is expressed in  developing limbs. A homologue to that gene was cloned from Precis  coenia, a lepidopteran insect. That gene is also expressed in all  developing limbs, except the mandible, but in distinct patterns in  different limb types. These results suggest that Dll could be a  useful probe with which to examine the relationships between the  appendages of different arthropods and   to determine the origin of appendages in arthropod ancestors.  Representative myriapod and crustacean species will be chosen.  Homologues of Dll will be cloned from each species chosen and the  expression pattern of these genes in developing embryos and  appendages will be determined.   %%%  Although we have some understanding of how simple molecules might  have evolved to more complex forms, there is complete mystery  surrounding the evolution of complex structures such as limbs or  wings. The results of this work should give insight on appendage  (and arthropod) evolution and, perhaps, suggest mechanisms for the  evolution of such structures.                                                                                                                                                Review Analysis  Form 7          BIR 9411213  Grace R. Panganiban        Dr. Sean Carroll is striking out in a new direction in his interest  in molecular evolution of appendage development. He is an  outstanding scientist and this is an excellent environment for Dr.  Panganiban to continue her studies in this area. She has been in  his lab for 2 1/2 years, first working on a molecular study of  neuroblast formation and then switching to this project. (She is  tied to this area for personal reasons.) Her references were all  positi ve and this is an exciting and novel area of research. The  one panelist that was relatively lukewarm in his assessment of this  proposal felt that \"this proposal lacks a compelling evolutionary  motivation\" but his colleagues disagreed. Support is recommended.",
