 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vertebrate neuroendocrine system, using information  derived from both internal and external environments,  controls development, growth, and reproduction.  The brain  integrates this information and secretes neurotransmitters  and neurohormones to alter pituitary function and bring  about endocrine based events and behavioral changes.  Such  changes are very important in mediating major life events  that help animals adapt to environmental changes.  Because  of the varied modes of reproduction that exist in teleost  fishes, fishes are a useful system to look at how both the  internal and external environments influence sex  determination and sexual behaviors.  One particularly useful  mode of reproduction is a sexual plasticity known as  sequential hermaphroditism where an individual can begin  life as one sex, reproduce as that sex for at least one  breeding season and subsequently undergo sex reversal and  reproduce as the opposite sex.  Such a change is accompanied  by drastic changes in behavior.  This system allows for  investigation into the role of the brain in sex  determination and sex-specific behavior.  The purpose of the  proposed research is to identify changes in monoamine  neurotransmitters in the brains of a protogynous coral reef  fish (Thalassoma duperrey) throughout the process of sex  reversal and in relation to daily, semi-lunar and annual  influences.  Because there are relatively few vertebrates  that exhibit a natural sex reversal once sexual maturation  has been achieved, this system is an excellent model in  which to look at changes in behavior and neurochemistry that  accompany sex reversal and possible control mechanisms for  such a reversal.  This work will contribute to a better  understanding of the relationship of neural control  mechanisms for sex specific behaviors.  By using animals  which can act as both sexes in one individual at different  times in the life history, one can gain a better  understanding of how changes in sexual behavior may be  controlle d in other animals, including humans.  In addition  the presence of diandry (two different male phenotypes, one  being a male throughout the life history and the other being  first female and then male) offers the opportunity to  compare behaviors of two different types of males.  The  proposed work will provide information on the changes in  monoamines associated with sex reversal and accompanying  behavioral changes as well as some insights into possible  cause-effect relationships.  This system provides a unique  opportunity for the study of neural correlates of sex  determination and sexual behavior.",
