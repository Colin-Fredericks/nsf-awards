 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401139  Thistlethwaite       Using the vastly improved computer power now available on  workstations, the investigator has recently classified knots up  to 14 crossings.  He will continue the compilation of knots  through 15 or 16 crossings.  This computational work is being  done jointly with J. Hoste (Pitzer College).  The investigator  will endeavor to answer various theoretical problems which arise  naturally from the classification process.  In particular, he  will seek to complete the computation of the mapping class group  of an alternating link pair, and he will look into questions  concerning primality of knots and questions concerning  homomorphic images of knot groups or subgroups of knot groups.   He will search for a second proof of the Tait Conjecture and for  possible extensions of this conjecture.  These extensions could  be used to answer conjectures concerning the asymptotic density  of alternating knots.       Thistlethwaite's research treats the topology of knots and  links.  A knot is a simple closed curve, which one may think of  as a closed loop of string, situated somehow in space; a link is  a more general kind of object, consisting of one or more separate  loops.  The mathematical interest lies not so much in the  intrinsic loop, but rather in the way in which it is situated in  3-dimensional space, i.e.  in the way in which it might be  \"knotted.\"  Topologists consider that two knots (or links) are  equivalent if it is possible to maneuver one to the other by  bending or stretching; no cutting is allowed.  One of the  fascinating aspects of knot theory is that it contains many  problems which are easy to state and easy for the layman to  understand, yet which persistently resist all attempts at  solution.  One such problem, which William Menasco (SUNY Buffalo)  and Thistlethwaite solved last year, was the hundred-year old  Tait  conjecture on alternating links.  The comprehensive table  of knots up to 16 crossings which Thistlethwaite and Hoste are  currently producin g will be used to test and formulate other  conjectures.  In addition, Thistlethwaite will investigate the  unknotting number of an alternating knot, this being the minimal  number of times it is necessary to pass a knot through itself to  render it trivial.  His search for an alternative proof of the  Tait conjecture will involve \"non-Euclidean\" geometry.  ***",
