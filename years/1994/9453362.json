The project has a strong educational  component which involves both undergraduate and graduate students  in  the  research. The research addresses structural and magnetic  order in so-called quantum disordered solids that only exhibit  a  magnetic  phase transition in the limit of zero temperature.  The  systems  include  one-dimensional linear chains,  two-dimensional  antiferromagnetic  sheets, heavy-Fermion metals  and  transition-  metal   oxides.  The  research  is  of  considerable  fundamental  interest, but has potential technological importance since it may  shed   light   on   related  fields  such  as  high   temperature  superconductivity.    This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a project  to  study  magnetism  and electrical properties  of  materials  which  exhibit  quantum  effects. The project has a  strong  educational  component which involves both undergraduate and graduate students  in  the  research. The research seeks to study phase  transitions  that only emerge as the materials reach \"absolute zero\". This can  be  contrasted  with  non-quantum  materials  such  as  ice  that  undergoes  an  ordinary phase transition, melting  a  32  F.  The  systems  include  linear  chains  or  two-dimensional  arrays  of  magnetic atoms, complex metal alloys and transition-metal oxides.  The  research  is of considerable fundamental interest,  but  has  potential  technological importance since it may  shed  light  on  related fields such as high temperature superconductivity.",
