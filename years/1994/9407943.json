 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407948  Abstract  A circadian system was described which controls sperm release and  maturation in the make reproductive tract of the gypsy moth. The  system was characterized at both the chrono-biological and  physiological level, including a time-table for its development  during adult metamorphosis. Study of this system at the molecular  level was initiated and resulted in the isolation of three clock  related(cr) genes whose transcript abundance appear to fluctuate in  a circadian fashion. A determination will be made as to whether and  how CR genes are involved in the clock mechanism. Changes in the  abundance of the three CR genes will be examined during the course  of development of circadian system after resetting of the circadian  mechanism by light or temperature, and in conditions which disrupt  rhythmicity using an RNAse protection assay and reverse  transcription-PCR. In addition, cellular localization of mRNAs  corresponding to CR probes will be studied by in situ  hybridizations.  %%%  Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in living organisms at every level  or organization, from gene transcription to behavior. Despite the  fundamental importance of circadian rhythms, the molecular identity  of the clock that drives them remains one of the significant  unanswered questions of modern biology. In this study, a simple  circadian system of an insect, sperm release and maturation in the  male reproductive tract of the gypsy moth, is used to explore the  molecular basis of the biological clock.  ***",
