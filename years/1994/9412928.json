It will  also provide access to state, regional, and national computing  resources and databases; and foster communication and  collaboration among teachers, students, scholars, and researchers  at these institutions and their peers within the worldwide  education and research community.    The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture for  NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in  education and research.  This cooperative network will provide  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and  will be consistent with their standards.  It will further the  institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development  through a well-educated workforce, accessible training  opportunities, and research and development partnerships.   Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including  those outside the state.",
