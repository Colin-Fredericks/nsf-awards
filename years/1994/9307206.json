 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson  9307206  The isolation of prostaglandin(PG) was achieved by von Euler in  1932.  In these experiments the first of many biological effects of  the compound was discovered; the contraction of uterine smooth  muscle.  Since these early studies, PG has become recognized as a  specific, highly active, short-lived local hormone synthesized in  all mammalian cell systems.  The local hormone is involved in lipid  metabolism, insulin release, the regulation of cardiac function,  body temperature and nervous system control, and the tissue  inflammatory response.  The overall objective of this research  program is to determine the molecular mechanisms which operate in  the regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX).  The COX enzymes play  central roles in PG biosynthesis by catalyzing the conversion of  arachidonic acid and certain other 20 carbon polyunsaturated fatty  acids.  Additionally the role of factors IL-1 and TGF-Beta will be  examined for their special effect on COX enzyme levels and turnover  relative to PG synthesis.  IL-1 and TGF-Beta are cytokines which  appear to regulate transcriptional regulation of the COX genes.   The present study will use human embryo lung fibroblasts and bovine  pulmonary artery endothelial cells.  Results will provide important  information about regulatory mechanisms which govern PG synthesis.  %%%  This is a research project to study the complex mechanism which  operates in mammalian systems to control prostaglandin formation.   Prostaglandins are so called local hormones that are produced  quickly in local tissue cells as a result of corporal stress, such  as temperature changes, fatigue, or wounding.  To begin to  understand how the body produces the hormone and controls its  level, we need to learn about the action of key enzymes that  operate in its production.  This control systems seems to be very  complicated and involves the action of special components that  operate to control reading messenger RNA(mRNA).  mRNA contains the  information the cells need t o form the enzyme for prostaglandin  production.  This research will help in our understanding about how  the mammalian body controls its temperature and combats fatigue,   how fat is formed and used, and how tissue becomes inflamed and  irritated.  ***",
