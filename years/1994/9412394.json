The goal of this  conference is provide a forum for active discussions on state-of-  the-art experimental and modeling techniques aimed at understanding  complex damage phenomena that evolve in metals over long times.   Such damage often involves the coupling of microstructural changes,  surface chemical or electrochemical reactivity, plastic  deformation, solute segregation, microdamage evolution and hydrogen  interactions leading to crack formation and growth.  The speakers  and discussion have been organized around critical topics,  including microstructural evolution under applied stress and  strain, crack formation and growth at elevated temperatures, the  interaction of environment with such cracking, the effect of solute  elements on deformation and fracture, environmentally-induced  cracking, as well as localized corrosion under stress.  A focus of  this program is the integration of physical and mechanical  metallurgy perspectives which have been separated in previous  years.  %%%  There is a pressing need to consider these problems from an  interdisciplinary and scientific perspective because the national  infrastructure is aging and long-life systems are being  contemplated and designed with advanced materials.  Although such  problems are complex from a scientific viewpoint, researchers in  universities, industry and national laboratories are now addressing  them with exciting high resolution experimental tools, theory and  simulation modelling.  ***",
