Prof. Gouvea will study the arithmetic of modular forms and the  arithmetic of diagonal hypersurfaces over finite fields.  The  central topic in the first part of the work is the study of two  operators introduced by Atkin.  In the second part the  investigator will study the simplest cases of arithmetic on  abelian varieties.            This research falls under the general heading of Number  Theory. Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole  numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the  beginning problems in number theory have furnished the driving  force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the  discipline. One of the philosophies of modern number theory is  that many facts about numbers can be studied using calculus and  geometry.  This approach is very evident in the work of this  project since modular forms are studied using calculus and  abelian varieties are studied using geometry.  This kind of  number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory. ***",
