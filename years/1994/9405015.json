 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal from two members of the faculty in the  physics department at Rutgers to continue their research in  the analysis of polarized Z decays using the SLD detector  and the linear electron collider at SLAC.  The accelerator  has achieved a 62% polarization of the electron beam and the  stated plan is to collect 1,000,000 Z decays over the next  several years.  This will allow the SLD group to make what  is expected to be the world's most accurate measurement of  the Weinberg Angle by a technique which is different from  that at LEP.  The difference between the measurements at the  two accelerators will be an important measure of the  radiative corrections in the standard model.  The  polarization of the Z will also allow them to make  significant measurements of Bs mixing.  The Rutgers group  has been instrumental in the installation of the END CAP  CRID (Cerenkov Ring Imaging Detector) and they are now  engaged in its calibration and in the improvements to the  tracking which are necessary to use the CRID for particle  identification.",
