 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401087  Narendran  This award supports Paliath Narendran, Deepak Kapur and two  graduate students of the University of Albany, to interact with  Professors Freidrich Otto of the University of Kassel and Klaus  Madlener and Jurgen Avenhaus of the Computer Science Department  of the University of Kaiserslautern.  All of them are widely  recognized for their outstanding contributions to various areas  among their mutual interests, which include symbolic  computation, theorem proving, unification and algebraic issues  related to term rewriting.  The U.S. participants are  particularly strong in automated deduction and symbolic  computation, and they have been active in both theoretical and  practical aspects of these fields.  Their interests and  expertise are well matched and complemented by their highly  regarded German colleagues.     This work has direct relevance to theorem proving and  constraint solving, which are emerging as crucial technologies  in future programming systems.  Therefore the results of this  collaboration among these innovative mathematicians and  computer scientists are very likely to be theoretical advances  that will have practical value in designing and using  programming languages and symbolic computation systems.  The  involvement of the two graduate students will be a valuable  experience at an early stage in their research careers.  ***",
