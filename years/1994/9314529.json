 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314529  Norlander    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in materials theory between Peter A. J. Norlander at Rice  University and Jean-Pierre Gauyacq and Dominique Teillet-  Billy at the University of Paris, Orsay.  The objective of their  research is to increase understanding of the dynamics of negative  ion formation in atom-surface scattering.  This investigation  will also include the study of effects such as the polarization  of the atom and the image force near a metal surface.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in  surface theory.  This is complemented by the French  investigators' expertise in atomic and molecular physics.  The  project also takes advantage of two complementary, yet  contrasting methods for calculating energy shifts and the  lifetimes of atomic states which were developed respectively by  the U.S. and French groups. The development of a theory on how  atoms/molecules interact with surfaces is fundamental to our  understanding of processes such as catalysis and corrosion.  This  project will advance that theory and the field of surface physics  in general.  ***",
