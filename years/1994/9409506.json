 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409506  King       The goal of the projected research is to develop rigorous  theoretical and computational methods for optimal sensor and  actuator design. The investigation will concentrate on systems  governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Many feedback  control design methods yield a solution (i.e., an optimal  control) which is written in terms of a feedback operator and the  optimal state. For finite dimensional systems, this control can  also be written as a product of gains and states and decisions  regarding sensor design can be made using the form of the gains.  In many PDE control problems, the gain operator is a bounded  linear transformation between Hilbert spaces. Representation  theorems often can be applied to obtain an Rintegral  representationS of the gain operator that provides the basis for  numerical approximations and analysis.      Initially, the investigator will consider the problem of  finding the optimal gain operator without prior assumptions  regarding actuator type. Robust control designs will be used to  formulate the corresponding sensor design problem. The optimal  sensors/actuators for the PDE systems may be spatially  distributed, though one may wish to approximate the optimal  designs and implement a finite number of sensors and actuators.  This requires approximation theorems for the various types of  control operators.  ***",
