The main goal of the proposed research is to conduct a  comprehensive study of non-monotonic formalisms and logic  programming semantics for the purpose of developing and  implementing formalizations that achieve greater expressive power  by allowing various forms of disjunctive reasoning.  Specifically,  the following objectives will be achieved:  1) Study the basic  principles on which disjunctive reasoning should be based and  develop extensions of non-monotonic formalisms capable to properly  represent disjunctive information.  Investigate relationships  between different approaches and determine their application  domains.  2) Bridge the gap between non-monotonic reasoning and  disjunctive logic programming by investigating and developing  semantics for disjunctive logic programs and deductive databases  that naturally correspond to non-monotonic formalisms.  Attempt to  develop proof-theoretic characterizations and computational  techniques for these semantics and identify classes of theories in  which they are tractable.  3) Develop methods of translation of  broad classes of non-monotonic formalisms into disjunctive logic  programs and implement an experimental inference engine for non-  monotonic reasoning based on translation into disjunctive logic  programs.  4) Apply the resulting techniques to the domain of  software engineering by using disjunctive logic programming as a  tool for software specification and verification of program  correctness.  If successful, the proposed research program should  not only improve our understanding of basic foundations of non-  monotonic reasoning, but it also should move us closer towards the  actual implementation of common-sense reasoning systems by applying  the increased expressive and computational power of disjunctive  logic programming.  It should also facilitate the extension of the  logic programming paradigm to the class o disjunctive programs.",
