Prof. Regev will study the asympotics  of character sequences,  PI algebras and Kronecker products.   This work has implication for combinatorics, representation  theory and algebra.       This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,  which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting.   Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods  for overcoming these difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes  use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern  mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several  centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past  few decades.  This growth comes from its importance in  communications and information technology and from the success of  modern techniques to problems of counting.",
