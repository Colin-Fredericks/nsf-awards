Ms. Hammond's is studying the events leading to  the formation of the Society as well as influences which the  Society's activities and publications had on developments in  various disciplines, particularly in terms of the relationship  between biological, psychological, and sociological sciences during  the period from 1950-1979.  The Society is representative of  several general trends which characterize this period, including  efforts to overcome the increasing fragmentation of disciplinary  specialization through interdisciplinary approaches to problem  solving and a belief that the social sciences could benefit from  the same kind of intensive research effort that had proven so  successful in the physical sciences during World War II.  Ms.  Hammond is evaluating the contributions of this particular group in  the context of similar and parallel developments in other fields.  ***",
