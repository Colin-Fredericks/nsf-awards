 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 547  Pitts  Microfabrication of Advanced Radiation Detectors    The project will develop and produce ionizing radiation detectors  using modern microfabrication techniques.  The scientific  motivation of this project is the production of silicon  semiconductor detectors and micro-strip gas counters for nuclear  physics experiments at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility  (IUCF), \"Cooler\" light ion storage ring, and the MIT-Bates South  Hall Ring.  The microfabrication aspects of this project will  include the application of advanced micromachining and  electrostatic bonding techniques to the design of radiation  sensors.  These techniques will be developed with the assistance  of the Center for Microelectronic Sensors and Microstructures at  the University of Cincinnati.  The design and testing of these  detectors will be carried out in collaboration with the IUCF Wire  Chamber group.  The educational goal of this project is to train  our students in the techniques of these rapidly evolving fields.   Support for four students is requested as an integral part of  this proposal.  Participation in this project will give our  students a new path to industry and graduate school.      The project is driven by the need to improve two types of  ionizing radiation detectors, the silicon semiconductor detector  and the micro-strip gas counter.  Large area silicon microstrip  detectors have excellent position, timing, and energy resolution.   These detectors suffer from a sensitivity to radiation damage,  however, and are very expensive in customized versions.  Local  fabrication will allow the customization of these detectors to a  much wider range of experiments and applications, and do so on a  more cost effective basis.  The second type of detector to be  developed is the micro-strip gas counter (MSGC).  First described  in 1988, the MSGC is a miniaturized multi-wire proportional  chamber (MWPC) with the wires of the MWPC replaced by metal  traces on an insulating substrate.  Micromachini ng techniques  such as preferential etching of crystallographic planes will be  utilized to further develop these detectors and electrostatic  bonding techniques will be applied to their mechanical packaging.   The latter feature will result in hermetically sealed MWGCs  compatible with operation inside the ultra high vacuum chamber of  a storage ring.",
