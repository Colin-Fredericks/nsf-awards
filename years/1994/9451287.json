 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451287  Laws  This project will continue the development of a complete university  introductory physics laboratory program called RealTime Physics  (RTP) begun under a previous ILI-LLD grant.  This program is  centered around the use of microcomputer-based laboratory tools for  observations and analysis of physical phenomena.  This project will  help institutions with conventional course structures to  incorporate interactive teaching approaches in their programs  without restructuring the entire program.  RTP labs share a common  philosophy with two previous programs, Workshop Physics and Tools  for Scientific Thinking: 1) belief that development of scientific  literacy is as important as traditional textbook problem solving  skills, 2) emphasis on the processes of oral and written  communication and peer learning, and 3) extensive use of  microcomputers, not as tutorial devices or teaching machines, but  rather for the acquisition of both qualitative and quantitative  information about physical phenomena.  The development of RTP  materials has made this holistic, learner-centered teaching  philosophy available to many more institutions by concentrating on  using the laboratory portion of traditional introductory physics  courses more effectively.  Our ultimate goal is to develop  sequenced sets of laboratories, spanning a complete range of  introductory physics topics.  We propose here to develop two  additional RTP laboratory activities guides, thermodynamics and  optics, to complement the guides already developed in mechanics and  circuits.",
