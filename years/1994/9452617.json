Traditionally, many students  lack intuition for the underlying physical concepts, and as a  result the physics and calculus courses present a major hurdle for  beginning students, especially women and minorities. This project  will improve the learning, retention, and application of physics  concepts and principles by physics and calculus students at Diablo  Valley College. This will be accomplished by the  microcomputer-based laboratories developed by Thorton and Laws and  a video projection system.  This project will create mobile units  of computers that will serve different areas and functions in  teaching physics and calculus and will augment the  \"Interdisciplinary, team-teaching Calculus and Physics Project\" at  Diablo Valley Co lege.  This project will improve calculus and  physics instruction, increase science literacy, and stimulate other  colleges to adapt this approach.",
