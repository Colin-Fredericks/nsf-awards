The research was designed to test  the hypothesis that language/thought interactions are  bidirectional, i.e., cognitive and linguistic relativity are  inherent in the acquisition process. Previous research on  conceptual development has show that the form of space/time  representations changes during the period from about three to  four years of age. In the early phases of development, spatial  schemas are egocentric, routelike, and landmark-oriented, and  temporal schemas contain event-to-event sequential linkage. In  the late phase, children acquire the potential to construct  representations with properties which are abstracted from the  experience such as an allocentric/coordinated perspective on  space and a higher order/scheduled perspective on event  structure. Prior research by the PI and others on child language  has uncovered a transition in the form of spatial/temporal  location from mono- to bi-referential. Within the monoreferential  system, the primary object/event (or figure) is related to a  single referent object/event, and with the emergence of the  bireferential system, children acquire the potential to relate  the primary object/event to two or more referent objects/events.  Regarding cognitive relativity, the research was designed to  determine if the development of coordinated representations  establishes a state of conceptual readiness for the linguistic  transition to bireferential location.       This research is relevant to a number of basic questions  concerning the process of language acquisition. It has been  proposed that the spatial systems are more primitive then  temporal systems, and the inference has been made that spatial  location will precede temporal location in development. This   inference has never been tested directly, and this research will  do so. Currently, cognitive relativity is likely to be accepted  as a demonstrated fact in the spatial domain but not the temporal  domain in spite of the fact that supporting evidence is equally  scarce in both areas. This research will provide a balanced  perspective on this issue. The question of linguistic relativity  is the most difficult to evaluate. This research takes advantage  of some general differences between Slavic and Finno-Ugric  languages to probe the potential effect of linguistic complexity  on the acquisition process.  ***",
