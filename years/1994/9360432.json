The research  will examine the feasibility of using a database of problems and  solutions with special attributes and classications to make a  highly reusable computer-assisted learning (CAL) module that is  efficient and appealing to students.    The research represents an attempt to stimulate the entry of  nontraditional students into engineering by assimilating vast  engineering problems and solutions resources into one readily  accessible knowledge base; at the same time, it invokes a concept  applicable to any student and to other subject areas with problem  solving objectives.  ***",
