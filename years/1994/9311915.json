 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311915  Kumar    The primary focus of this research is to understand the  practically important question of the miscibility of polymeric  systems from a molecular view point.  An argument is made that  the bulk thermodynamics of polymeric systems are poorly  understood at this time since they are strongly dependent on  local aspects, such as chain structure, stiffness and packing,  which are not captured accurately by coarse-grained polymeric  theories.  Consequently, computer simulation on realistic chain  models would represent an accurate technique to capture the  effects of local structure and unpacking on thermodynamics  properties.  In addition to PVT equation of state properties,  which can be obtained through standard computer simulation  methods, newly proposed techniques will be used to enumerate the  thermodynamic properties, especially the phase behavior, of  these systems.    In parallel the effect of film thickness on the phase separation  in ultrathin polymer blends films will be studied.  It is  emphasized that a good understanding of this fundamentally  important physical phenomenon is predicated on understanding,  not only the surface behavior of polymeric systems, but also the  bulk thermodynamics.  This issue has already been studied in  some detail from a theoretical viewpoint and experimental  investigations are currently in progress.  Finally, a good  understanding of this situation also requires knowledge of the  steric penalty associated with confining molecules near  surfaces, and these aspects will be examined through a study of  the alignment of liquid crystalline molecules in the vicinity of  flat surfaces.  ***",
