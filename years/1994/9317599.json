 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317599  Lewellen       Tornadoes are among the most powerful of natural disasters.   Over several years of research, general characteristics of the  dynamics of tornado vortices have been described and many aspects  of their parent storms have been defined.  Nonetheless, some basic  questions still remain as to the nature of the flow within tornadic  vortices and what factors control their structure.       The Principal Investigator proposes to further knowledge of  tornadoes using an advanced numerical model and observational  information.  The type of numerical model to be used is called a  large eddy simulation model (LES) and marks the first time this  technology has been applied to the study of tornadic vortices.  The  major advantage of this model is that its high resolution allows  the resolution of enough of large turbulent eddies to that sub-grid  parameterizations of turbulent transport is not nearly as critical  as it is in lower resolution simulations.  Model boundary  conditions will be determined from available field data and  numerical simulations of thunderstorms.         It is anticipated that the project will result in better  definition of the distinctive features of the turbulent wind field  associated with tornadoes.  It should permit the answers to such  questions as: (1) how is the probability of reaching a given  extreme speed at a given height related to values of convergence  and vorticity averaged over this tornado vortex domain; (2) what is  the sensitivity of the tornado wind field to various boundary  conditions; (3) what sub-grid parameterizations for this type flow  provide the proper interactions for simulations over larger domains  with lower resolution?   ***",
