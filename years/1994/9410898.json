 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides partial support for the Twenty-second Annual  Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, scheduled for  October 1-3, 1994, in Solomons, Maryland.  The Conference convenes  national and international scholars in basic and applied research  from engineering, economics, operations research, law,  communications and information science, and public policy; leaders  in communications and information industries; specialists from  public-interest organizations; and government policymakers.         Rapid growth in the field of communication and information  science and policy -- from initiatives in high speed networking to  changes in the traditional approach to communications and  information regulation -- provides few opportunities for the  research and public policy communities to exchange information.   Yet the significant interaction between national and international  policy, on the one hand, and the successful development and  improvement of communications and information technology, on the  other, are critical.  The Conference seeks to facilitate  communication of the results of the best available current basic  and applied research on communications and information topics, and  to foster the development of effective, coherent national and  international communications and information policy.  The  Conference also seeks to develop a salient basic and applied  research agenda for emerging issues, to encourage interdisciplinary  research early in the basic research process, and to integrate  basic and applied research from other countries.  In addition, the  Conference serves a highly effective educational role in informing  and encouraging new young researchers in communications and  information research and policy.",
