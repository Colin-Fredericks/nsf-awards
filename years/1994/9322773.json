 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is a series of  investigations of the detailed mechanisms of redox   reactions that occur at electrode surfaces. These studies will include a   detailed analysis of multielectron transfer reactions, a study of the   derivatives of the fullerenes, and an inquiry into the nucleation   processes involved in electrochemical polymerization reactions.  The   latter study will involve the use of atomic force microscopy to detect   and characterize the particles formed in the early stages of the   electrodeposition of organic compounds. The results of the research will   have direct applications in such technologically significant areas as   electrosynthesis, electropolymerization, and homogeneous redox catalysis.    This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   will increase our understanding of the fundamental aspects of the   oxidation and reduction reactions of organic compounds at electrode   surfaces.  Novel features of the research include the use of atomic force   microscopy to image the surface of the electrode during the   electrodeposition of organic compounds, a study of the electrochemistry   of the recently discovered fullerenes, as well as the investigation of   electrode processes involving multiple electron transfer reactions. The   results of the research will have direct applications in such   technologically significant areas as electrosynthesis,   electropolymerization, and homogeneous redox catalysis.",
