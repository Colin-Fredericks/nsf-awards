 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413123  Kaufman       Various direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC)  procedures developed by the proposed investigator is especially  attractive because they do not require full state feedback or  adaptive observers.  Other important properties of this class of  algorithms include (1) their applicability to non-minimum phase  systems, (2) the order of the plant may be much larger than the  order of the reference model, and (3) this approach considers  plants with multiple inputs and outputs.         However, it is important to note that in order to guarantee  asymptotic model following or even boundedness, it is sufficient to  demonstrate the satisfaction of a positive real type constraint.   Although various augmentation schemes have been developed to  alleviate this constraint, it is not straightforward to design the  needed (usually feedforward compensation to satisfy the positive  real condition over the desired (or a maximal) range of parameter  variations.  Thus, it is proposed to consider recent robust  compensation techniques that appear relevant to the design of such  compensation.  These include a robust feedforward compensator  developed for single input-single output adaptive systems which  will be extended to multiple input-multiple output systems and the  Kharitonvoc polynomial analysis, which will be considered for use  in single input-single output systems.         The resulting augmentation procedures from this proposed  effort in conjunction with the MRAC algorithms should result in  easily implementable procedures for designing and synthesizing very  robust direct adaptive controllers that are applicable to many  systems with significant uncertainty.  ***",
