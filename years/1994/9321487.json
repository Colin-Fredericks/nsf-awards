The method  employs petrographic analysis of lithic fragments, heavy minerals,  and reflected light petrography and microprobe analysis of iron-  opaque grains in a comparative study of sediment cores and  potential source areas around the Arctic.  Comparison of the  petrographic and chemical data from the sediment cores and  potential source areas is facilitated by statistical methods to  ensure best-fit matches of sediment and source for determining the  origin of sedimentary material.   Sediment provenance determined in  this way forms the basis of inferences about transport pathways and  the petrographic characteristics are used to infer transport  mechanisms.    This project will use existing material as well as cores to be  collected during the Arctic Ocean Section cruise in the summer of  1994.  The goals are to 1) determine the source of ice-rafted  sediment for the latest major glacial and deglacial events and to  infer Arctic Ocean surface circulation patterns during the last  18,000 years; 2) infer the drift patterns for older ice-rafting  events; 3) assess the potential distribution of contaminated  sediment from Russian rivers which are redistributed by sea-ice  rafting; and 4) expand the database from which sediment provenance  for the Arctic Ocean is derived.  This work is basic information  about sedimentation in the Arctic Ocean and represents a  significant investment in geologic information that will be  valuable for other projects focusing on past climates and recent  geologic processes active in the Arctic.  ***",
