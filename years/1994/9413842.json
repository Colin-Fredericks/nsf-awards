Twenty-six chemical oceanography candidates will meet for  six days in formal and informal sessions to present their  dissertations, to broaden their perspectives in the field, and to  participate in working groups to develop recommendations concerning  chemical oceanography research and education. The sponsors will  delineate the federal government programs in chemical oceanography  and present avenues for support. The proceedings will be published.   This will be the twelfth in a very successful series of symposia  supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), office of Naval  Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA).  These symposia have helped advance  knowledge by fostering young investigators' enthusiasm, broadening  their outlook of the problems in the field, and helping their entry  into the science network, nationally and internationally.",
