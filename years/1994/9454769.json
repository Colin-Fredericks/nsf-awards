 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454769  Huntley    The proposed Testbed partnership, led by BBN, University of California, Irvine, and Global  SchoolNet Foundation, includes over 1000 schools, within nearly 500 school districts and 19  states. Over 60 Testbed partner organizations represent elementary and secondary schools,  school districts and regional collaboratives, state education agencies; vocational-technical  schools, community colleges; colleges and universities; science centers and museums: several  thousand homes; educational publishers; business/industry organizations; and educational  research organizations and service providers, collectively working on all aspects of educational  reform.  The Testbed builds synergy among partners sharing a common spirit of constructivism  and a quest for equity. The goal of the Testbed partners and activities is to achieve significant  impact on educational networking by providing empirical evidence to taxpayers, governments  and private industry that \"scaling up\" the NII requires active participation, not just access, for  everyone. The Testbed partnership will provide concrete understanding of the design,  construction and management of communications networks and information services to support  educational innovation in local schools and communities.  The Testbed will help communities  make appropriate investment in full-scale, self-sustaining educational networking by: 1)  developing tools and services to empower individuals and local groups to produce value on the  network - enabling the user-constructability essential to reform in math and science; 2)  organizing information access for people who share one computer, 3) establishing and assessing  technical and training support models through a Testbed Exchange; 4) developing an evaluation  framework and cost-benefit assessments; 5) combining a wide range of high-quality educational  applications within and across schools and districts; 6) pro actively disseminating the learnings  of the partners to decision makers at loca l, state, and national levels and linking to information  agencies such as the InterNIC and Ask ERIC.    The partners bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the collective test bed infrastructure  through investments from local tax and bond levies, state legislatures, private foundations,  industry contributions, and conservatively contribute $20 million to the Testbed agenda over  three years through many forms of cost-sharing.",
