This upgrade will  permit maximum utilization of the facilities and fuller  exploitation of experimental techniques recently developed  in this laboratory.  The experiments, all of which rely on  sequential excitation of atoms using multiple laser beams,  are aimed at elucidating fundamental properties of atoms.  Recent work has exploited new experimental techniques  developed in this laboratory for measuring atomic parameters  with unprecedented accuracy.  Two of these techniques,  precision dc Stark spectroscopy and Floquet spectroscopy,  are based on the dc and ac Stark effects respectively.  Both  employ highly excited atoms to magnify atomic responses to  the fields. A third technique, developed for the study of  photoionization of excited atoms, employs a variety of laser  beam polarization schemes to acquire data which, in  conjunction with angular momentum algebra, make it possible  to determine the cross sections for photoionization to  specific final angular momentum states.  The increased range  of available laser wavelengths will greatly expand  experimental capabilities.  The new state-of-theart device  would make it possible to study a wider variety of atomic  processes in considerably greater detail than currently  possible.  The narrower bandwidth would permit finer  resolution of spectral features while the higher available  intensity would allow excitation of atomic transitions that  cannot currently be accessed.  As with all laboratory resources, the requested system would  provide experience and training for the many undergraduate  students who participate in this research.  It would also  benefit the secondary school teachers who gain valuable  laboratory experience during summer training sessions.  Thus, this equipment, in addition to its intrins ic value as  a laboratory tool, would serve an educational function,  training students and teachers in the operation of state-of-  the-art instrumentation. ***",
