 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321799  Dey  This project seeks to develop efficient algorithms for  triangulating spaces (polytopes, point sets), to design efficient  topological algorithms for triangulated spaces, and to understand  the combinatorial aspects of triangulated spaces.  Triangulated  spaces appear in many applications, and have immediate  theoretical interest as well.    The focus will first be on algorithms for polytope triangulations  and point set triangulations in higher dimensions.  Finite  element methods apply triangulations to decompose the domains,  while computer graphics and solid modeling use them to represent  objects with simpler components and to manipulate them  efficiently.    Next, the investigation will concentrate on  topological  algorithms with triangulated spaces for two problems: (i)  determining the homology groups of simplicial complexes in  arbitrary dimensions, (ii) detecting if two given cycles on a  simplicial complex can be continuously deformed to one another.  Computational topology, an emerging field, examines the  computational aspects of topological problems.  The constructive  approaches would inject algorithmic theories into topology,  making it more useful in practical applications.    To understand triangulated spaces, one needs to know more about  their combinatorial behavior.  The focus in the latter half of  the project will be on such combinatorial questions as counting  the number of crossings in a set of simplices and counting the  number of combinatorially different triangulations for a point  set.",
