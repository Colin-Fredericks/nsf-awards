 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer, and  the upgrade of the existing Varian VXR-500 to UNITY Plus  500, XL-400 to UNITY Plus 400 and the addition of  accessories to the UNITY 500 MHz NMR spectrometers at  Rutgers University, and at the University of Medicine and  Dentistry (UMDNJ), are crucial for the successful execution  of the research projects of the Structural Biology community  at these universities. The major users of the NMR facility  are: Prof. Jean Baum, Chemistry, Rutgers; Prof. Gaetano  Montelione, MBB, Rutgers, and CABM; Prof. Roger Jones,  Chemistry, Rutgers; and Prof. Stephen Anderson, MBB,  Rutgers, and CABM. In addition, there are many Rutgers and  UMDNJ faculty who are using, or planning on using, high  field NMR in their research, either independently or via  collaborations with the major users.           The recruitment of Drs. Montelione and Baum to  Rutgers University established  multidimensional NMR as a major priority on campus. Numerous  investigators at both universities are currently  collaborating with these two groups. In addition, Drs.  Anderson and Jones have been expanding their own research  efforts using high field NMR. As a result, all of the  existing NMR instruments are in constant use (24 hrs/day, 7  days/week), and the development of independent NMR programs  by other investigators has been prevented because of  insufficient instrument time. The lack of a 600 MHz  spectrometer on the campus and deficiencies in the existing  equipment severely limit research efforts with larger (10 -  30 kD) proteins and complexes. In addition, the NMR  instruments used to recruit Baum and Montelione are now out  of date. The 500 and 400 MHz spectrometers in the Chemistry  Department lack triple-resonance and PFG capabilities which  are essential for heteronuclear NMR of macromolecules. None  of the instruments are equipped with deuterium decoupling  capabilities required to exploit random deuteration  techniques for overcoming short 13C relaxation rates   encountered in larger proteins.           The NMR research and research training of the four  major users require direct access to NMR instrumentation for  about 40 researchers. In addition, the independent users,  mentioned above, have on the order of 40 graduate students  and postdoctorals doing 'hands on' NMR experiments. The NMR  facilities will also have a significant impact on research  and teaching for some additional 40 faculty, students, and  postdoctorals at Rutgers and UMDNJ through the research  programs of collaborators. In total, approximately 120  scientists will be affected by the proposed NMR hardware  upgrades and acquisition of a new 600 MHz NMR spectrometer.           The research activities of the major users of the NMR  facility are in structural biology with emphasis in the  following areas. 1) development of new NMR experiments which  facilitate and automate the protein structure determination  process; 2) structure determination of small biomedically  important proteins (sizes range from 7 to 30 kD); 3)  conformational studies of denatured or partially denatured  proteins to understand the mechanism of protein folding; 4)  atomic details and dynamics of molecular recognition; 5)  studies of nucleic acid structure and interactions. In  addition, a number of independent users are interested in  the analysis of organic and inorganic compounds. The  acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR and the upgrades of the  existing facility will greatly improve the scientific and  engineering infrastructure of Rutgers and UMDNJ. In order to  maintain the momentum of this developing dynamic scientific  community in structural biology, the NMR facilities must be  brought up to the cutting edge of the field.",
