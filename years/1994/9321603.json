 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321603  Ringle    With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Ringle, Bey and  colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological research at  Ek Balam, a Mayan site located in the Yucatan peninsula of  Mexico. Ek Balam was occupied during the height of prehistoric  Mayan development and is one of the half-dozen largest sites in  this region. Settlement size is paralleled by architectural  investment and the largest mount measures 165 by 65 meters at the  base and rises 31 m in height. Drs. Ringle and Bey wish to  understand the internal organization of the city, how the core  area of monumental architecture relates to more outlying regions  and how Ek Balam itself interacted with other such entities. To  accomplish these goals they will carry out four related  activities. They will continue past mapping work at the site  center and survey and record architecture. Surface materials such  as ceramics will also be collected. Secondly, excavation at the  site center will be begun. Stratigraphic excavations will provide  information on ceramic chronology, architectural style and the  sequence of building construction. Third, a survey will be  conducted of Ek Balam's hinterland - the region within 10-12 km.  of the site - and both architectural constructions and associated  agricultural fields will be noted. Finally a preliminary  reconnaissance will be made within a 20 km wide corridor between  Ek Balam and the large site of Chichen Itza. The results,  hopefully, will shed light on the relations between these two  large Mayan cities.    In the Yucatan peninsula and adjacent regions of Central America  Mayan peoples were organized into units which approached state  level in size and thousands of people subsisted in areas which  are only sparsely inhabited today. Large sites such as Ek Balam  served as centers and populations arrayed themselves around such  places. Over the last several decades archaeologists have gained  much understanding of how these \"centers\" and associated  hinterlands fun ctioned. However how such units were organized -  or not organized - on a larger scale has been little investigated  and is little understood. Drs. Ringle and Bey wish to examine  this issue. Because Ek Balam is located in the region of Chichen  Itza, another large center it will be possible to study the  interaction between the two.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of how, at a regional level large scale societies  emerge and interact. The project will also help to foster  research at an undergraduate institution and actively involve  undergraduates in the work.  ***",
