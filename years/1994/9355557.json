 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355557  Lake    This is a five-year project to enable 100 teachers from Wisconsin  to learn and be involved in scientific research.  The plan is to  have teachers involved in staff development activities of at least  five days and then to actively been involved in up to 30 days of  hands-on scientific research.  This research will be (a) on an  individual basis under the mentorship of specifically selected  scientists, or (b) within a team, or (c) both.  The team projects  will be (a) an examination of water quality using biotic indexing,  and (b) trails aimed at the effective use of milkweed as an  indicator of ozone pollution.  Both team projects will be in  collaboration with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.    The project's goals include (1) improvement of the teaching of  science by enabling selected teachers to become experienced in  scientific research, (2) formation of partnerships with scientists  for on-going mentorship, (3) performance of valuable studies and  (4) providing selected with the local opportunity to be research  assistants in a research project.    The project has its foundations in Field Involvement: Research by  Science Teachers (FIRST), an NSF-funded program.  This proposal  benefits from the lessons learned from FIRST, the expertise it  created amongst teachers, and the weaknesses that became apparent.   The project also benefits from the experience gained, especially in  terms of the leadership, pedagogy, and networking components, from  Earth Science Resource Associates (ESRA), a currently NSF-funded  project of the Wisconsin Academy.    The project requested $743,745 from NSF with institutions/Agencies  and school districts providing $172,841% of the National Science  Foundation portion in cost sharing (this does not include  miscellaneous supplies, space, phone, contributed by school  districts).",
