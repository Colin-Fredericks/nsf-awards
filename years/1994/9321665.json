 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321665  Winglee  MHD is one of the main tools used to model the dynamics of the  magnetosphere.  We show both analytically and numerically that the  resistive Ohm's law on which MHD is based is not appropriate for  the magnetosphere because much of the plasma and energy transport  occurs across thin boundary layers  and as a result gives an  incomplete description of the magnetospheric current system.  We  are able to identify for the first time the intrinsic particle  effects that control (i) the structure of magnetospheric boundary  layers, (ii) the dissipation in current sheets needed for  reconnection and (iii) the currents that map into and out of the  dayside and nightside auroral regions.  These effects are  determined from particle/two fluid simulations that provide an  advancement over single fluid MHD by removing ambiguities arising  from the imposition of anomalous resistivity and by resolving the  mapping of the region 1 nd 2 auroral currents.  The proposed work  seeks development of (i) regional particle simulations in both 2-D  and 3-D to identify the structure, current system, and properties  of the particle distributions within the magnetopause, LLBL and  magnetotail, (ii) modified two-fluid simulations in 3-D to provide  full global mapping of the currents emanating from these regions  into the auroral region and their effect on the global dynamics  through the dissipation they produce on the magnetopause and  magnetotail current sheets, and (iii) cross-calibration between the  particle and fluid simulations with the Tsyganenko model to test  the accuracy of the modeling and, more importantly, to aid in the  construction of a model that predicts the average response of the  magnetosphere and the auroral currents.  The 3-D global simulations are to be based on a modified set of  two-fluid equations that have been test calibrated against particle  simulations.  It uses a modified version of the generalized Ohm's  law and incorporates an additional equation describing the electron   motion responsible for the dayside and nightside auroral currents.   The particle simulations will incorporate a new finite-difference  algorithm for the field solutions that can enable variable grid  spacing and thereby enable large scale regional modelling of  kinetic processes.  The proposed work will have important applications to  magnetospheric physics by providing global mapping of both magnetic  field lines and currents into and out of the magnetosphere, and by  identifying the structure and particle distributions associated  with critical boundary layers.  It has the potential of providing  a direct link between ground-based observations of magnetic field  perturbations and the motion of the auroral oval with in-situ  spacecraft observations of magnetic field perturbations and the  motion of the auroral oval with in-situ spacecraft observations of  energetic particles.  In addition, through the comparison with the  Tsyganenko model we will be able to construct an average  magnetospheric model that can be used to predict the magnetospheric  activity as determined by Kp for prevailing solar wind conditions.   All these applications meet important objectives of NSF's  Magnetospheric Program.  ***",
