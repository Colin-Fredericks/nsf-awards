 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mr. Carl-Henry Geschwind, working under the direction of Dr. Sharon  Kingsland, is examining the emergence of seismology as a powerful  scientific tool for controlling the threats posed by earthquakes to  modern civilization.  In treating the history of American  seismology during its formative period (1880-1935), Mr. Geschwind  is focusing on three broad topics:  the interactions between those  seismologists primarily interested in protecting the public from  earthquakes and those more interested in studying earthquakes for  purely scientific purposes; the relative importance of natural  events, scientific developments and broader cultural changes in  bringing about the gradual emergence and popular acceptance of  seismology; and the overall place of seismology within larger  political and cultural trends on both the local and the national  level.  This dissertation promises to be of interest not only to  environmental historians and historians of science, but also to  geologists, environmental scientists, and science policy makers  seeking to enhance the social relevance of science.",
