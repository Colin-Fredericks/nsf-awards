 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hydrology program at the University of Colorado has recently  been added as a new option within the existing interdisciplinary  Geophysics Ph.D. Program, which previously included only solid-  earth geophysics.  Eight academic departments participate in this  program.  In this proposal we outline an interdisciplinary  educational and research plan to attract new graduate students to  the hydrology program.  The interdisciplinary component of our plan  is developed jointly with the faculty from the Program in  Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (PAOS) and the solid-earth  geophysics.  The main focus of this plan is to address fundamental  scale issues in hydrology as they relate to climate change and  water quality.  A common theme of this effort is the use of  statistical-dynamical techniques and non-linear dynamics to address  these scale issues in heterogenous natural systems.  Our efforts  will be focused on the following topics:         (1)  Scaling and statistical-dynamical characterization of            precipitation        (2)  Modeling of energy and moisture exchange at the land            surface       (3)  Scaling and runoff prediction from ungauged basins       (4)  Scale effects in subsurface transport in heterogeneous            aquifers       (5)  Subsurface flow in fractured rocks.    The proposed curriculum has the following innovative structural  components:  multidisciplinary education that crosses departmental  and college bounds; opportunity for students to participate in  related national and international field experiments and program;  and interaction of senior Ph.D. students with the faculty to design  and teach new innovative courses.",
