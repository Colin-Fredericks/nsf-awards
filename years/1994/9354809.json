 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354809  Stearns         Faculty in the sciences and engineering in cooperation with the  Teacher Preparation program at Princeton University are developing  teaching field experiences for undergraduates.  Students, working  with University faculty, prepare a teaching unit related to  science, technology, or mathematics, then teach the unit to  students in public schools.  Students in three courses in  technology, physics, and engineering and environmental geology work  with their professors to develop mini-units for presentation in  pre-college classrooms in lieu of writing a research paper.  The  staff of Princeton's Teacher Preparation Program supervise the  field experience and instruct the undergraduates in appropriate  pedagogy.  This project brings undergraduates' skills acquired at  the University into classrooms with young students and also  provides a bridge between the university and the pre-college  classroom by offering school children access to lessons on science  and technology that enrich their academic experience. It offers  undergraduates direct experience with teaching, a career path many  do not now consider but might with early encouragement and  satisfying encounters with young students.  The teaching experience  enhances the undergraduates' learning by having to present the  material to others.  This field experience is a new component in  the Princeton curriculum, affording undergraduates the opportunity  to hone their communication skills and apply their studies to a  significant area of social concern, upgrading the science and  technology content of the pre-college curriculum.  ***y",
