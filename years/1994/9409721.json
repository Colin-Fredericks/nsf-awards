 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth-Associated Protein-(GAP)-43 has been implicated in a  wide variety of phenomena in the nervous system.  The  physical characteristics of the molecule, together with its  elevated expression during periods of neuronal growth and  regeneration, suggest that it might play a role in the  extension of nerve fibers toward their targets.  GAP-43 also  appears to be involved in some way in the regulation of  neurotransmitter secretion in the mature nervous system,  perhaps because it modulates several biochemical signaling  systems within the nerve cell.  Despite the accumulation of  a large amount of experimental information on GAP-43, the  precise function of the protein remains elusive.    We have used a model cell culture system consisting of two  closely related neuroendocrine cell lines which express GAP-  43 at dramatically different levels to investigate further  the role of GAP-43 in neurotransmitter secretion.  Our  initial experiments demonstrated that the secretory response  is highly correlated with the levels of GAP-43 expression in  these cells.  Subsequently, we have used molecular genetic  approaches to manipulate GAP-43 expression and have obtained  more direct evidence for a role of this protein in  secretion.  Our experiment system will thus permit us to  determine the molecular basis of this role; this information  may be relevant to the other postulated functions of GAP-43  as well.",
