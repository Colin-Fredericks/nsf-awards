 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstarct 744  Happ  EPSCoR States Information Network    The project, involving four EPSCoR states (Vermont, West  Virginia, Idaho, and Arkansas), will establish a pilot electronic  document delivery network utilizing transmission of digitized  information over networked telecommunications systems to meet the  information needs of over one hundred widely-disbursed EPSCoR  researchers.  By providing immediate access to high-quality  copies of articles from scientific journals in multiple research  collections, the base of scientific and technical information  accessible to these researchers will be greatly enhanced, thus  stimulating the development of competitive research in many  arenas.    Rapid access to essential scientific information is a critical  component in the development of a fully competitive research  environment.  Although the resources of major research  collections in other states have long been available to  institutions supporting EPSCoR projects through conventional  interlibrary loan arrangements and systems such as OCLC, the time  involved in processing such requests often lessens their  usefulness in the conduct of competitive research.  Commercial  document delivery services based upon fax technology have  recently emerged, but their viability is limited by restricted  coverage of the scientific/technical literature and dependence  upon a transmission medium which lacks the high resolution  necessary for accurate copying of critical plates, photographs,  formulae, and tables.    The enhancement of existing resource sharing networks in the four  participating states with electronic transmission technology will  be a one-time investment with a lasting effect upon the quality  and timeliness of information delivery in support of research.   Extending this access to the four states' pooled collections and  strengthening research journal holdings in specialized targeted  areas in each of the lead institutions will further augment the  base of available information.  Once the i nitial investment in  journal backfiles and transmission equipment has been made, the  enhancements introduced  in this project will be maintained by  the institutions' base budgets, bringing about a systemic change  in the information infrastructure necessary for competitive  research.  Once tested, this concept will be developed in later  phases to include the remaining fourteen EPSCoR states, many of  which have expressed interest in joining this project in the  future.  In addition, the opportunity for placing receiving  equipment directly into the laboratories of EPSCoR researchers  and partner corporations in the private sector may be considered,  enabling information delivery to the researchers' desktops.",
