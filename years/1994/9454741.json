The Regional Technology  Planning Project will bring together representatives of those  interested in improving K-12 education in our region into a formal  consortium that will develop a plan of action for creating a  flexible regional networking infrastructure and for using that  infrastructure to enhance teacher professionalization, student  achievement and school restructuring in the K-12 education  community.    Project Objectives         1.   To create a formal regional consortium out of the            Technology Steering Committee.         2.   To conduct an assessment of what is currently available            in terms of networking/distance learning hardware and            software in the 10 intermediate units in western            Pennsylvania.         3.   To conduct an assessment of the attitudes of teachers,            administrators, parents and students toward technology  and            its role in educational innovation and reform.         4.   To evaluate other regional technology initiatives in            terms of how we can apply their experiences to a plan of            our own.         5.   To write a formal plan for implementing a flexible            regional networking infrastructure including            recommendations on equipment, personnel, teacher            training, cooperative projects among consortium members,            projects for diverse student populations, connecting to            statewide, national and international networks,            administration, and funding.",
