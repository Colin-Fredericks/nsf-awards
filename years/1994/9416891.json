The  workshop, supported by a prior NSF grant, is organized by the  International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics of  Iowa State University, under the leadership of Dr. James P. Vary  and Dr. Bing-Lin Young, in cooperation with the Institute for  Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under  Director Victor A. Matveev.  The CTEQ (Project on Collaborative  Theoretical and Experimental Studies in QCD) Collaboration is a  research group having the goal of advancing Quantum  Chromodynamics (QCD) theory, experiment and phenomenology in a  systematic manner.  The CTEQ workshop will cover topics in  electroweak theory, not covered during the CTEQ summer school.       This proposed research in theoretical physics fulfills the  program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.  ***",
