The data base would be made available to researchers whose studies can benefit detailed information about the organizational structures, management practices, R&D resources allocation decisions and business outcomes of technology intensive firms operating in business sectors that are of substantial  importance to the U.S. economy.    This data base will provide useful contextual information about R&D investment levels, innovation management practices and outcome of technological innovation activities in specific sectors of industry.  This contextual information, which can be used to describe innovation management \"norms\" for these sectors, is intrinsically valuable, since such data does not presently exist at the business sectors level.  Additionally, the data base will be helpful in interpreting the results of research on innovation management practices and business performance in these industrial sectors.      This project is carried out jointly by the Center for Innovation Management Studies (CIMS) at Lehigh University and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI).  The data base employs information provided to CIMS by large R&D performing firms who are members of the IRI .",
