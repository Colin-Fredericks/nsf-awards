 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301043  Lysak       The primary goals of the first GEM campaign are an  understanding of the mapping of dayside magnetopause processes to  the ionosphere and a determination of the ionospheric signatures of  such processes.  Although previous attempts have been made to  consider the static mapping of magnetopause processes to the  ionosphere, the fact that the Alfven transit time from the  magnetopause to the ionosphere is comparable to the evolution time  of magnetopause processes suggests that the dynamics of this  coupling is important.  This proposed work focuses on an  investigation of these effects by means of a three-dimensional  model of coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere by means of  Alfven waves which considers the global, linear response of the  magnetosphere and ionosphere to perturbations at the magnetopause.   In this model, perturbations representing magnetopause processes  such as transient reconnection, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities or  dynamic pressure pulses can be imposed on the magnetopause, and the  resulting ionospheric signature can be self-consistently  calculated.  This model will be extended to include finite pressure  effects, finite ionospheric conductivity and a generalized magnetic  field geometry.  This project will be supported by two related  projects, one of which considers a localized model of a diverging  auroral flux tube which includes nonlinearities, ionospheric  dynamics and parallel electric fields.  The other related project  is an investigation of transport processes at the magnetopause and  their role in the generation of field-aligned currents.  The  numerical results will be compared with data from ground  magnetometer arrays in order to determine the most likely source  for the observed magnetic vortices.       ***",
