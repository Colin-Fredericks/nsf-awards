 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is focused on the measurement of  stable isotope ratios in several important atmospheric gases,  that is, ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO),  and water (H2O) vapor.  The previous NSF-supported project  demonstrated from precise isotopic measurements of oxygen-17 and  oxygen-18 in stratospheric ozone samples that a chemical link  exists between stratospheric ozone and carbon dioxide.  In  addition, the results from this prior research revealed that  stratospheric ozone is enriched in the two oxygen isotopes of O-  17 and O-18, and that this isotopic enrichment is transferred to  CO2 by its reaction with excited oxygen atoms  O(1D)  derived  from the photolysis of this isotopically enriched ozone.         During the next three years this same research team will  continue to expand their isotopic measurement program so as to  isotopically analyze air samples collected from ground level to  30 km and from 68oN to the south pole.  These measurements will  address the questions of the global and altitudinal variations of  the CO2-O3 interactions; the chemical and dynamical processes  responsible for the observed isotopic fractionations of molecular  oxygen (O2), O3, CO2, CO, nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor;  the possibility of an unknown stratospheric source of N2O; and  the potential utility of CO2 with its unique stratospheric  isotopic signature for quantification of mesosphere-stratosphere-  troposphere mixing.  The gas samples will be collected in  collaboration with a number of national and international  scientists who are performing vertical atmospheric measurements  with aircraft and balloon platforms,  The samples will be  analyzed with the isotope ratio mass spectrometers that are  available in the Department of Chemistry at the University of  California--San Diego.  Two graduate students will participate in  this research under the direct supervision of the senior  scientist.",
