 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422688 Qian   This award is made in support of the NSF initiative ENG-CISE-IITA94,  National Challenges.  It  is a joint initiative between the Engineering Directorate and the Computer Information and Engineering Directorate.  SRI International, in collaboration with Stanford University Department of computer Science and Medicine, and Inova Health System,  will develop and demonstrate techniques for the trusted interoperation of autonomous heterogeneous health care databases containing sensitive data that mismatch in semantics, representations, and security/privacy policies.  This effort will be built on the query mediation framework developed under ARPA and Rome Laboratory sponsorship.    The framework supports the automated and efficient mediation of queries between autonomous heterogeneous databases.  Semantic connections between component databases are encoded in a knowledge base, which are then used by a mediator to automatically resolve mismatches and transform queries between component databases using the local language and schema, making a local database access data in multiple databases using the local language and schema, making interoperable both the data and the applications accessing the data in legacy databases. Technique will be developed and demonstrated for solving three critical problems that hinder the trusted query mediation of autonomous heterogeneous health care database containing sensitive data that mismatch in semantics, representations, and security/privacy policies.  In particular, the following questions will be answered:   1. A security/Privacy Policy Framework.  What is the relationship and   difference between security and privacy? How can the security/privacy   policy of a health care database be characterized and formalized?  How   can we compare the security/privacy policies of autonomous    heterogeneous  health care databases?   2. Trusted Query Mediation.  When autonomous heterogeneous health care   databases are interoperating through query mediation, how c an we   guarantee the autonomy and security/privacy of component databases. In   other words, how can queries be mediated such  that neither the rights nor   the security/privacy of components databases are compromised?   3. Schema Mediation.  In constructing a physician's workstation as a uniform   interface to multiple autonomous heterogeneous health care databases,   how can a consistent view (schema) be constructed that (1) captures   exactly the data that are relevant to users of the workstation, and (2)   resolves all the mismatches in the relevant data?  These techniques will be implemented in a demonstration system that leverages off an existing one developed for the query mediation framework, which demonstrates query mediation between an clinic database and a hospital database ( adopted for the T-helper database for Stanford University School of Medicine).  Health care databases form Inova Health System and Stanford University School  of Medicine will be used in the demonstration.  This effort will contribute to the goal of developing and providing technology by which health care providers can access and share patients medical records while protecting the accuracy and privacy of  those records.",
