As a cornerstone to the  program of study, the students 1) use leading edge computer  technologies, including solid modeling, finite element analysis,  mold flow, mold cooling and polymer flow, 2) have a comprehensive  laboratory experience resulting in a understanding of the operation  of processing machinery and proper processing condition to produce  high quality parts, 3) are required to develop and manage an  engineering project, 4) present the project before their peers and  professionals in their field.  The purpose of this proposal is to  obtain modern laboratory plastics processing equipment that will  substantially enhance the undergraduate plastics processing  laboratory experience. The requests consists of an extrusion blow  molder, a set of blow molds to demonstrate process capabilities,  and the acquisition of a computer simulation package to relate  simulation analysis and laboratory experience. The justification  for this equipment is based on the innovative way in which it will  be used to improve undergraduate students learning experience in  plastics processing.",
