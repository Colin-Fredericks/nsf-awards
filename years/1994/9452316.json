Powder X-ray  diffractometry is one of the most widely used methods for crystal  structure analysis and mineral/rock/material identification. UNCA  long ago had a diffractometer, which became obsolete when it could  not meet tightening safety standards and the repair costs exceeded  its value, so currently we have no facilities here or in the  community with which to teach students X-ray methods or to analyze  mineral/rock/material samples. The acquisition of an X-ray  diffractometer will allow the faculty authors,  all of whom who  have had prior experience with X-ray diffraction, to include  experiments and techniques based on X-ray methods and theory in  solid state chemistry, geology, physics, and soils classes. Topics  that would be covered in classes and used in student and/or faculty  research include crystal structure analysis and X-ray techniques in  combination with Mossbauer, NMR, and other analytical methods;  mineral/material identification and determination of relative  amounts in rocks, heavy mineral sediments, and materials (such as  synthesized inoraganic compounds and municipal incineration ash);  chemical analysis of specific mineral species by peak shifts in  diffraction patterns; and characterization of clay minerals, soils,  and soil components.",
