 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452189  Browne  There is a very significant need to educate Mechanical Engineers in  fatigue failure of materials and associated components. In general,  consumer markets are expecting mechanical components and  machines--such as automobiles--to be safer, longer lasting, and of  higher quality. Freedom from fatigue--or repeated cycles--failure  is essential for all of these. At present in the Mechanical  Engineering curriculum at Mankato State University, fatigue is  covered in lecture but there is only one limited laboratory bench  top experiment to test fatigue failures. This project will use a  general purpose fatigue test machine as the focus of a new fatigue  laboratory which will allow students to conduct experiments and  student research projects, with the goal of providing them with a  strong working knowledge in this important area.  An innovative  feature is the use of short term experiments to predict long-term  behavior of materials.",
