 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355506  Shavelson    Over the years, gender differences in science have been evident in  two significant ways.  First, as early as elementary school, males  outperform females on traditional measures of science achievement.   Second, there is persistent evidence that in comparison to males,  females express more negative affect in science (e.g., lower self-  concepts, lower performance expectancies) and report fewer positive  experiences in the science classroom (e.g., fewer student-teacher  interactions).  Currently, there is a general belief that if  science teaching and testing change to parallel methods of science  itself (e.g., hypothesis testing, hands-on experimentation),  females will have the opportunity to show more clearly what they  know, leading to increased achievement, positive classroom  experiences, and positive student affect.  In turn, female students  may come to view science as a field that is open to them rather  than a domain reserved for males.    Although advocates of science curricular and testing reform propose  that such positive outcomes for females will occur, there is little  to no research which has explored this issue.  The purpose of this  study is to examine whether new methods of teaching will, indeed,  result in narrowing or eliminating the existing gender gap in  science.  Therefore, this study aims to assess the educational  experiences of male and female students in performance-based  classrooms (i.e., those stressing inquiry, scientific methodology,  and \"hands-on\" experimentation) and to identify the instructional  methods within classrooms that may give rise to or eliminate gender  differences.",
