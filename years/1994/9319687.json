 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319687  Curdts    This award will provide a research fellowship for Thomas Curdts  to spend a year at the International Center for Antarctic  Information and Research (ICAIR) located in Christchurch,  New Zealand. While at ICAIR, Mr. Curdts will be working under  Dr. Steven M. Smith, the Director of the Center, which is  primarily concerned with assembling, processing and supplying  research and general information relating to Antarctica and its  environs.    During the past few decades, the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica  has witnessed increased utilization by both the scientific and  non-scientific communities. In order to minimize negative impacts  to the region, ICAIR is developing a management plan for Ross  Island. Integral to the design of this plan is the use of remote  sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies.  Specific objectives to be addressed by Curdts are to identify  and evaluate available data for the Ross Sea region,  to develop a GIS database for this area, and to conduct  preliminary GIS analyses relevant to the development of a  management plan for Ross Island. The benefits of this project  extend beyond the cooperating countries of New Zealand and the  U.S.  An effective management plan will assist in coordinating  the activities of all nations utilizing the Ross Island region.      A well designed digital database will help facilitate the  exchange of information concerning the Ross Sea region and  perhaps may also set a precedent for the entire Antarctic region.  The travel is supported under the U.S.-New Zealand Junior  Investigator Research Fellowship activity.",
