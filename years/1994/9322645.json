Rajamani of Jawaharlal Nehru  University (JNU) in New Delhi on geochemical  study of the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) in  South India.  The study is aimed at a  hypothesis that the EDC is made up of  accretionary terranes and that gold  mineralization occurred associated with  accretion of the terranes.  If there are  different terranes, it is intended to determine  the histories of the rocks within the various  terranes and determine the timing of their  assemblage.  The field work will continue  geological studies in the Ramagiri Schist Belt,  and begin studies of the Hutti-Maski Schist  Belt 500 Km north of the Kolar Schist Belt  along regional structural trend.  The work will  include collecting samples by the U.S. and  Indian scientists in the field, to be followed  by chemical analysis mainly at the SUNY  laboratory by the U.S. and Indian co-  investigators.  Some of the chemical analysis  will be done at JNU by Dr. Rajamani and his  students.    Scope:  This project is building on a well-  established working relationship by the two  scientists.  They have several joint  publications as a result of their previous  work.  This project is likely to continue this  productive scientific cooperation.  U.S.  Graduate students and post doctorates, from the  SUNY at Stony Brook, are involved in the field  work, and are expected to gain experience in  international research efforts.  ***",
