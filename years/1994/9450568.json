 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 568  Thibeault  Advanced Communications Mentor Network for Enhancing Research     The Maine Science and Technology Foundation (MSTF), in  collaboration with the Maine Development Foundation and the Maine  Department of Economic and Community Development, proposes a pilot  network that will provide one-on-one mentor firm-researcher  clusters for access and utilization of advanced communication  technologies.  The immediate goals of this project are:    o  Identify, develop, and implement user-specific solutions  involving the application of advanced communication tools to  increase research and technology development productivity and  competitiveness.    o  Evaluate approaches by which the research and development  productivity and competitiveness of end-users in a cluster  partnership are enhanced through applications of advanced  communications tools.    o  Foster extended industry/faculty collaborations among cluster  members.    o  Evaluate the efficacy and sustainability of local mentoring  capabilities for advanced communications in the Portland, Orono,  and Presque Isle regions in Maine.    o  Develop and implement a systematic approach to maximizing the  creation and sharing of knowledge available with Maine, as well as  throughout the world.    With assistance from the host institution and mentors, each  industry/faculty cluster will be exposed to a variety of advanced  communications technologies which support four key task areas; they  are basic tasks, but capture what needs to occur more often in  Maine:  (a) mail and file transfer; (b) informational retrieval and  bulletin board development; (c) teleconferencing technology use  related to collaborative research and development partnerships  among business, higher education, and not-for-profit research  organizations; and (d) distance-based research and employment.   Cluster members would develop research collaboration opportunities  to be supported by appropriate advanced communication technologies  they would select after a n intensive awareness process.  Each  collaborative pilot research proposal would be peer reviewed under  the direction of the Research Excellence Partnership, Maine  EPSCoR's Steering Committee.  Funds would be made available, on a  competitive basis, to go through a planning effort with the end  point of developing a comprehensive proposal to an appropriate  federal agency.  A component of the effort would specifically  encourage submission to the Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.
