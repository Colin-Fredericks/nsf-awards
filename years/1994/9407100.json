In these studies the focus  is on combs and branched polymers.  The aim of the research is to  determine how the entropic, as well as energetic, contributions to  the free energies of mixing are affected by the architectural  complexity of the macromolecules.  In particular, the formation of  micelles from comb copolymers in solution will be studied, as well  as the creation of miscible blends with combs and linear or other  comb copolymers.  An additional goal is to tether linear and comb  copolymers onto surfaces and create interfaces which mimic  biological systems.  The objective is to design channels from  synthetic polymers that can display simple gating and switching  behavior or act as receptors for certain chains in solution.  %%%  This largely computational study will investigate the properties of  mixtures of polymers which are shaped like combs.  These type of  polymers have unique properties, especially relating to adhesion,  enable a variety of structures to form.  Applications to biomimetic  systems which will simulate simple electronic behavior will be  studied.  ***",
