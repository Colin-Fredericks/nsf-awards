 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319842  Davis  The posted-offer trading institution is one in which sellers post  prices on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Posted-offer results  provide a basis of comparison with trading in less structured  double-auction experiments.  This project is motivated by three  stylized facts from posted-offer experiments.  The first involves  explicit price-fixing conspiracies which can raise prices in  laboratory posted-offer settings.  The ineffectiveness of seller  conspiracies in comparable double-auctions motivates the proposed  work on whether collusion in posted-offer markets is undermined  by opportunities for sellers to offer private discounts.  Related  experiments will examine the effects of contractual restrictions  on discounting and on trade association reports.  A second  stylized fact is the poor response of posted-offer markets to  demand shocks.  One implication of this observation is that the  price-posting process could generate price rigidities with  Keynesian macroeconomic consequences.  The proposed experiments  involve simultaneous posting of wages and prices in a general  equilibrium framework with fiat money.  One goal is to study the  real effects of nominal monetary shocks.  The third issue arises  from the generally weak competitive tendencies of posted-offer  markets which suggest that prices might be raised sharply by the  addition of small imperfections, such as search costs.  The  proposed experiments will evaluate several recent theoretical  resolutions of this (\"Diamond\") paradox, i.e., that small  imperfections can produce monopoly prices.",
