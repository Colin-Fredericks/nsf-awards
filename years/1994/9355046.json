 "awd_abstract_narration": "High performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) is evolving  as a critical enabling technology for the sciences.  We propose a  program to integrate HPCC into selected research areas in the  physical sciences.  The program will be based around a core group  of faculty who collectively span the required knowledge base and  who are currently involved in joint interdisciplinary research  programs.  The primary mechanism will be the joint supervision of  a student's research by two of the PI's.    The PI's for this proposal will be faculty members in three  departments:  Aerospace Engineering Sciences (AES),  Astrophysical, Planetary and Atmospheric Sciences (APAS) and  Computer Science (CS), joined by a Co-I in Physics, J. Dreitlein.    These four departments are nationally recognized by their active  and productive graduate programs.  Inter-departmental  collaboration has increased with the award of a prestigious,  multi-disciplinary HPCC Grand Challenge Applications Grant by NSF  in 1992.  HPCC awards from ARPA and NASA have further increased  opportunities for interaction and outreach.  These awards have  provided state-of-the-art HPCC facilities available to GRT  trainees.    The graduate trainees will spend substantial residence periods at  national supercomputer centers, government and industry research  laboratories and international HPC centers.",
