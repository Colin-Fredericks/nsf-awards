Several facets of distributed control will be  investigated.  One aspect of the research will focus on the  development of models and methodologies to characterize and compare  alternative distributed control architectures and theoretical  prediction of information and communication system performance and  requirements.  A second aspect focuses on the development of  robust, real time distributed control algorithms that differ in  terms of the definition of customers and contractor nodes, the  nature of interaction between devices and the control policies that  relate to how devices decide whether to participate in an auction.   This aspect of research will also investigate how bids are  contracted and evaluated by devices, and how the devices react to  unexpected events.  The algorithms will be evaluated through  discrete event simulation of manufacturing systems models and  through emulation of such a manufacturing system by a network of  computer.       The research will facilitate the development of a new class of  high-performance intelligent manufacturing systems that can  possibly provide more flexibility and responsiveness to system  changes.  New control algorithms that enhances system performance  and flexibility may result from the research.  Enhanced systems  performance can increase the competitiveness of such a system.",
