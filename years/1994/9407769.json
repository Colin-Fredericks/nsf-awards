 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407769  Handa     Steroid hormones are key modulators of the intracellular  communications network used by the nervous system.  These simple  hormones potentially influence virtually all neural functions,  from the organization of neural circuits during development to  the activity of individual synapses of adults.  The circuits  affected by steroid hormones include those involved in  neuroendocrine physiology, reproductive behaviors, and non-  reproductive behaviors such as emotion, aggression, feeding, and  learning and memory.  This action is to provide support for a  Young Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1994 Workshop on  Steroid Hormones and Brain Function in Breckenridge, Colorado on  April 1-5, 1994.  This workshop brings together scientists using  different approaches to address important and timely issues  concerning steroid regulation of brain function.  Molecular  biologists, neuroanatomists, neurophysiologists and behaviorists  will be examining such issues as sexual differentiation of the  brain, neuroplasticity and steroid action, and alternative  mechanisms of action.  These are fundamentally important  questions in an field that is rapidly advancing and changing.   The format of the workshop and the inclusion of a Young  Investigator Symposium provide the appropriate mechanism to  nurture young talent and facilitate collaborative efforts that  may significantly enhance our understanding of the basic  neurobiological mechanisms where steroid hormones can affect  various neural systems.    ***",
