 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9405746  Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a general phenomenon which  occurs in the development of many cell types in many organisms.   Anti-CD3 antibody (antibody specific for the T-cell receptor  complex) can induced apoptosis in mouse T cell hybridomas and  immature T cells form the thymus but not in mature T cells from the  spleen.  We recently showed that a high level of protein and mRNA  of an orphan steroid receptor Nur77 correlates with the activation  induced apoptosis of mouse T cell  hybridomas and immature  thymocytes.  Introduction of a dominant negative Nur77 into T cell  hybridomas protected the cells from activation induced apoptosis.   Transcription of Nur77 gene reflects the apoptotic state of the  cells; a high level of Nur77 transcription is observed in apoptotic  T cell hybridomas, whereas only transient transcription of Nur77 is  detected in activated growing T cells.  Glucocorticoid can rescue  T cell hybridomas from activation induced apoptosis and at the same  time, represses the induction of Nur77 gene transcription.  This  effect is manifested through a calcium ionophore responsive  element, which is also essential in maintaining a high level of  Nur77 transcription during apoptosis.  In this project we plan:   (1) To characterize this Nur77 promoter element essential for the  sustained transcription during activation induced apoptosis and  responsiveness to the glucocorticoid suppressive effect;  (2) To  perform in vivo studies of the relationship between Nur77 promoter  and apoptosis using transgenic mice;  (3) To identify protein  mediating the Nur77 responsiveness to calcium ionophore and  glucocorticoid suppressive effect (protein X) and (4) To assess the  function of the protein X identified above in apoptosis and in T  Cell development.  The findings should significantly enhance our  understanding of the apoptosis process at the molecular level.  ***  Programmed cell death is a critical part of the development of  multicellular organisms.  An unde rstanding of the genetic  regulation of this phenomenon will allow more insight into the  developmental process as well as, in a more practical sense, the  disease process which results when cells do not die as they should.  This work, to characterize a promoter element involved in such  regulation and to assess the function of involved genes should  contribute to that insight.  %%%",
