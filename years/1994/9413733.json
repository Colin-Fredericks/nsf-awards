 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fisher    With support from the National Science Foundation and industrial  collaborators, Dr. Donald Fisher and his research team will  develop a state-of-the-art video based eye tracker, a research  level driving simulator and a virtual acoustic environment which  are fully integrated with one another. The system consists of an  advanced eye tracker to be developed by Applied Sciences  Laboratory, a driving simulator developed by Illusion  Technologies Incorporated and an acoustic environment which  mimics or simulates the reverberant characteristics of an  automobile. The planned system would supersede a current  instrument which makes use of a \"moving window\" paradigm, and  which permits a wide range of research in psycholinguistics,  reading comprehension, visual scanning and scene comprehension.     The research and research training that will be undertaken with  the level driving simulator and sound equipment will nicely  complement and extend the ongoing laboratory activities. It  would, for the first time, allow the study of the basic cognitive  processes in complex, dynamic displays using window and boundary  paradigms that have been successfully employed in more simple  situations. The range of potential behaviors to be examined will  also expand. Researchers and psychology and communications  disorders can use the eye and head tracking equipment to study  sound localization and detection. Exercise scientists can use  detailed information on driving responses to study the slowing of  motor processes with advancing age. Increased understanding of  visual scanning of complex dynamic displays and dynamic decision  making in realistic, highly stressful conditions will also be  possible. On a more practical level, the basis research proposed  will provide a first step in the development of in-vehicle  collision avoidance devices.",
