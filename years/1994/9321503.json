 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321503  Ashmore    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Wendy Ashmore and  her colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological  research in the Belize river valley, Belize Central America. Work  will center in the vicinity of Xunantunich, a Mayan civic center  which was occupied from approximately 650 to 1000 AD. Two field  seasons have been completed at the center itself and Dr. Ashmore  will now conduct archaeological and geomorphological  investigation beyond the area of monumental architecture to  document the distribution of local population in time and space.  Archaeological survey and test excavation will be conducted to  document the nature and variability of local economic production,  consumption and general standard of living at the homestead  scale. Extensive excavation at one elite residential cluster will  provide insight into organization at this social level.  Geomorphological research will document changes in the local  landscape itself, especially the evolving human use of alluvial  soils and how changing hydrological regimes affected preservation  and detection of archaeological remains.    Archaeologists wish to understand how Mayan peoples achieved a  high level of social complexity which allowed for the production  of monumental architecture and the support of large populations  in a difficult and harsh tropical lowland environment. Recent  data indicate that Mayan prehistory was turbulent and  characterized by abrupt changes in political order and settlement  organization.  Because the site of Xunantunich spans much of this  period and underwent several such shifts, it provides an  excellent context to examine this question. Dr. Ashmore  postulates that a great deal of independence and continuity  existed at the household level, that these units provided the  basic building blocks of Mayan society and that they remained  relatively unchanged during major political upheavals. Data  produced by this research will allow her to examine this issue.    This  research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will provide new  insight into the development of complex society and shed light on  methods of organization adapted to tropical lowland environments.  ***",
