The new introductory statistics  curriculum is being developed for science, engineering and  management students at WPI and as a model for such curricula  nationwide.  Focusing on the goals of teaching students to think  critically about data and having them experience the role of  statistics in scientific investigation, the curriculum has among  its features: division of the material into one-week modules, each  based on a laboratory and project experience; a complete  restructuring of course content emphasizing exploratory, graphical,  and computational approaches to data analysis and inference; and  the incorporation of alternative teaching strategies such as  cooperative learning.  The modular course structure allows flexi-  bility in customizing the course to student and instructor needs,  and ensures portability to other institutions.  The labs and  projects provide students with hands-on experience in using  statistical methods in scientific experimentation, data production,  and data analysis.  The significance of the project is that it  provides a setting for trying new and innovative approaches to the  course content and delivery of introductory statistics at the  college level.",
