The intrinsic defect structure of the starting materials will be  fully characterized using a broad array of advanced x-ray  diffraction methods, with particular emphasis given to high  resolution triple crystal diffraction and diffuse scattering  measurements. We will also explore the usefulness of anomalous  transmission and short wavelength x-ray diffraction measurements as  alternative methods for defect characterization. In addition to  analyzing as-grown samples of Cadmium Telluride and its ternary  alloys, samples will be annealed under Group II and Group VI  overpressures to alter the defect structure and optical behavior in  a controlled fashion.    %%%   The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental-  understanding of the growth, processing, and properties of wide  bandgap II-VI semiconductor materials so that they can be exploited  in the realization of a variety of advanced electronic and photonic  devices.  In addition to these fundamental research goals, the  proposed research will lead to a better understanding the  relationship between overall II-VI materials growth and processing  methodologies and the physical properties of II VI semiconductors.   An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications.    ***",
