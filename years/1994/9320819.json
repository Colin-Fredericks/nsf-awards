This area, which  is considered to be one of the world's \"hot spots\" in terms  of its rich biodiversity, is now undergoing massive human  intervention in the form of agricultural colonization by  spontaneous flows of migrants along roads built by petroleum  companies. Currently, the conflicting aims of protecting the  environment and economically developing the country are  dramatically apparent; satellite photos of the region taken  over the past decade vividly show rapid deforestation. This  project builds on a previous grant from NSF which was used  to collect critical information from 419 colonist  households. This project will analyze those data using Tobit  estimation procedures to explain the proportion of settlers'  lands devoted to different categories of land use. These  proportions will be explained using three major sets of  variables: (1) household demographic and socio-economic  characteristics, (2) natural resource conditions on the  farm, and (3) the policy and institutional context.       This research will provide important new insights into  the factors influencing the behavior of colonists in one of  the world's most important and sensitive environments. Thus  it will contribute to our basic understanding of the  interaction of factors in a developing area with a deep  tension between environmental preservation and economic  development. Results of the research should contribute to  the development of more appropriate policies to promote  sustainable development in the region.",
