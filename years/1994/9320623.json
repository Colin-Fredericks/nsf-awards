 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320623  Scudder         In this proposal the PIs seek funding to develop direct  theoretical arguments that the base of the transition region is an  especially fertile site for the suprathermal tail formation assumed  by the velocity filtration theory.  The vehicle that \"carries\" the  embryonic coronal gas is the suprathermal tail of the fully ionized  gas as it leaves the top of the chromosphere and that the mechanism  for the emergence of hot gas overlying cooler gas is the  concentrating effect velocity filtration has on the spatial  evolution of non-thermal distributions in an attractive potential  well.  In this view, the combined effects of (1) the copious waves  leading up to the TR base, (2) the convolution effects possible in  a stratified fully ionized plasma below the base, and (3) the  quasi-neutrality in the presence of coulomb collisions all leave  their \"imprint\" on the velocity distributions that are the boundary  conditions for the fully ionized extension of the solar atmosphere.   The velocity distribution functions evolve above the TR base in the  electric and magnetic force fields above this region as if they  were in a \"velocity dependent reflecting transmission line\" that  preferentially filters out the low energy particles in deference to  the higher energy particles of the initially suprathermal  populations.  These populations by velocity filtration get  concentrated and their dispersion and hence their temperature  increases without any further energy addition above the base of the  transition region.  ***",
