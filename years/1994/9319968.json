 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of small freshwater fishes are known as weakly electric fish, since they have an electric organ like that of the electric eel, but produce only a small voltage with it.  Their electric organ discharge, the EOD, has a particular waveform and temporal pattern, and produces a spatially patterned electric field around the fish.  A sophisticated system of electroreceptor organs in the skin allows them to investigate their environment by detecting changes in this electric field produced by objects around them, and the signals of other fish.   By analogy to the bat and the dolphin auditory echolocation system, this electrosensory behavior is called electrolocation.  This project incorporates electrical field measurements into computational simulations to produce novel three-dimensional reconstructions of the electrosensory images detected by the fish.  Detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal organization of these electric fields will help to better understand both the mechanisms by which they are generated, as well as their possible significance for object recognition.   Development of a simulator capable of accurately reconstructing the fields will allow a quantitative investigation of the electrosensory consequences of fish movements during exploratory behavior.  This combined mathematical, physiological and behavioral approach will clarify how the external environment is \"imaged\" by a whole sensory system, and how that image is used to guide spatially oriented behavior, which is a major general issue for sensory neuroscience.  There is potential impact in two other fields, one in bioengineering development of sensing systems for robotics or aids to handicapped, and the other in field ecology where the this software for mapping electric field potential data could be used for analyzing aquatic salinity data to track critical changes in estuarine ecosystems.",
