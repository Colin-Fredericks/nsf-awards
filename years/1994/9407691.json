Aggressive behavior in this species is sterotypic, but there  is both interseasonal and intraseasonal variation.  Thus  these lizards provide an ideal system for investigating how  long term and short term gradations in aggression can be  physiologically controlled while the animals are behaving in  their natural environment.  The focus for these studies will  be the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) which is known  to influence reproductive behavior.  A primary technique  employed in the proposed research will be  immunocytochemistry, which, through the use of image  analysis techniques, will be used to compare concentrations  of AVT within the brains of animals displaying varying  levels of aggression.  This technique will also allow  identification of brain regions that may be associated with  short and long term changes in aggression, as well as any  morphological changes in AVT immunoreactive cells or fibers.  Because of seasonal variation in the natural patterns of  aggression and testosterone in S. jarrovi it will also be  possible to uncouple the effects of testosterone and  aggression on the expression of AVT-ir within the brain.  Finally, the effects of artificially increased levels of AVT  on territorial aggression will be examined while the animal  is in its natural environment.  These studies will begin to  examine if AVT influences aggression in a strongly  territorial species and how tightly coupled AVT is with  testosterone and aggression.",
