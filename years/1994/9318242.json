 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318242  Bier      The goal of this proposal is to understand the function of  the rhomboid (rho) gene that is required for several  distinct developmental events including : early dorsal-  ventral pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo, the  formation of embryonic sensory organs, and the formation of  adult wing veins. rho is one of several genes (referred to  as ventro-lateral group genes) required for the formation of  these diverse structures. Other ventro-lateral group genes  encode an EGF/TGF alpha type of growth factor (spitz) and  the Drosophila EGF-receptor (egf-r). rho is the only known  member of the ventro-lateral group of genes expressed in a  spatially localized pattern corresponding to the cells  requiring the activity of ventro-lateral group genes. rho  encodes a membrane protein (Rho) and may act by amplifying  EGF-R signaling in response to binding the Spitz growth  factor. Because the EGF-R signaling pathway has been highly  conserved during evolution it is likely that these studies  in Drosophila will be directly relevant to other species,  including humans. The following are specific research goals  for this proposal: 1) Determine the subcellular localization  of the Rho protein. Is the Rho protein located on the cell  surface as predicted for a protein functioning as part of a  receptor complex? Is Rho located at sites of intimate cell-  cell contact? 2) Investigate how the Rho protein functions  biochemically and determine whether Rho physically interacts  with other proteins. Does the Rho protein physically  interact with other proteins (e.g. components of the EGF-R  signaling pathway)? Is Spi a ligand for EGF-R? Does Rho  mediate differential cell adhesion? 3) Determine whether rho  is dedicated to amplifying Spi-EGF-R  signaling or are other  signaling pathways also activated by Rho? Does  transcriptional down regulation of components of the EGF-R  pathway depend on rho?  ***",
