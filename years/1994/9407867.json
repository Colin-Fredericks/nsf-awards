The aim of the  project is to develop maize meiocytes as a useful system for  studying the dynamics of cytoskeletal elements during  meiosis.  In collaboration with her sabbatical hosts, the PI  will establish a culture system for maize meiocytes that  will allow their observation by differential interference  microscopy in the living state as the cells undergo meiosis.  Specific antibodies will be microinjected, or specific  reagents known to disrupt microtubules or actin  microfilaments will be applied to the cells, and the effects  of these perturbants on meiosis, division plane  determination, and cytokinesis in wild-type and male-sterile  mutant maize will be assessed.  %%%  This is a Career Advancement Award to support research  activities during Dr. Wick's sabbatical.  The process of  meiosis, or \"reduction division,\" is critically important to  sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, but is very poorly  understood.  Meiosis is a specialized , complex, multi-step  type of cellular division, in which a diploid cell gives  rise to a haploid gamete.   In this process, the genetic  material of the diploid progenitor cell, which is present as  pairs of chromosomes one each of which was originally  derived from each parental gamete, is very accurately split  into two separate but functionally equivalent portions, each  portion containing one each of each of the pairs.  The  ultimate fate of the resulting gamete is sexual union with  the corresponding other-sex gamete, to give rise to a new  diploid zygote which then develops into a new organism.  In  this project, the model organism under study is maize  (corn), which is not only a potentially useful model system  for higher plant meiosis in general, but is in its own right  an important subject of study given the agricultural and  nutritional significance of hybrid corn.  The experiments  proposed will provide important insights into  the cellular  mechanisms whereby the meiotic chromosomes are separated  from each other.  ***",
