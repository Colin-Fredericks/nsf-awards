Each workshop will be 10 days in length,  and will consist of NMR lectures, laboratory and problem  solving sessions, keynote speakers, and round table discussions  to aid the faculty in incorporating the new knowledge into  their research efforts and into their courses.  The first  workshop will focus on the physics of NMR experiments, and how  raw data is received and processed.  The second workshop deals  with the interpretation of one dimensional information received  from the instrument, with emphasis on chemical applications.   The last workshop covers the most advanced two-dimensional  experiments that are presently being used to solve current  chemical problems in industry and in academia.  An annual  reunion will be held for participants in these workshops to  exchange successes, failures, and ideas for improving the  implementation of these NMR methods into the undergraduate  curriculum.   ***",
