 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416525  Breen  The main objective of this project is the evaluation of the  potential effects of vertical ground accelerations, when combined  with the horizontal components of motion, on the seismic response  of highway bridges.  The effects to be examined are the stresses  in the piers and girders or the maximum ductility requirements if  there is inelastic action, and the potential slippage and  permanent displacements at the seats of the girders.  Recommendations will be made to incorporate appropriate  provisions in bridge design codes to account for them in the  seismic design.    A series of parametric studies will be conducted on simplified  models of highway bridges, assuming first completely linear  behavior, incorporating next the nonlinearity associated with the  behavior of the bearing pads and the possibility of sliding or  uplift of the girders' ends, and including finally the  possibility of nonlinear material behavior in the girders and  piers.  Two-dimensional, in-plane, models and t a more limited  extent with three-dimensional models will be used.  The  parametric studies will be complemented with the analyses of some  selected bridges from the Northridge area to compare the  theoretical predictions with the observed patterns of behavior  and reported damage.  Design recommendations will be made in  consultation with bridge designers and engineers involved in the  code writing process.    This study is expected to contribute to a better understanding of  the potential effects of vertical ground acceleration and of the  conditions under which these effects may become important and  should be accounted for in the design.  If the results were to  indicate that revisions should be made in the present bridge  design codes to improve the safety and reliability of highway  bridges in the epicentral area, the outcome of the project would  have a significant impact on the seismic design.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
