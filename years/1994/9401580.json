 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401580  Catlin       This award supports mathematical research directed at  problems arising in the field of several complex variables.  The  work focuses on three problem areas.  The first concerns Stein  spaces of dimension n with isolated singularities.  It is  proposed to investigate whether or not any relatively compact  subset can be mapped biholomorphically into an affine algebraic  variety of the same dimension.  This is not necessarily the case  if the singularities are not isolated, thus the result would be  best possible in this sense.  The second goal of the research  concerns points of finite type on smoothly bounded pseudoconvex  domains.  These are points on the boundary at which the tangent  space acts reasonably like Euclidean space.  It is planned to  show that at each point a peaking function can be found.  These  are functions which achieve their maximum (modulus) at the given  point and nowhere else.  Finally, it is planned to examining  smooth pseudoconvex compact CR-manifolds with strictly  plurisubharmonic functions.  Then, work will be done to show that  the manifold can be extended to a smoothly bounded integrable  almost complete manifold in which the original appears as the  inside boundary.       Several complex variables grew from the classical theory of  functions at the turn of the century into a separate and profound  discipline of its own.  The problems of interest are  significantly different from those which originally motivated the  field: to find that part of the one-variable theory which  generalized to several.  Most of the generalizations turned out  to be false.  The subject now focuses on applications toward  understanding the geometry of higher dimensional spaces, partial  differential equations and certain parts of control theory.  ***",
