The goal of this  curricular enhancement project is to improve the scientific  literacy of students. Cooperative group-learning activities will be  incorporated into the lab and classroom assignments. This collegial  approach will be facilitated by the use of computer workstations  that will be utilized by groups of 5-7 students. A microscope/video  system will be used to provide more effective instruction  concerning the proper usage of microscopes. This system will enable  faculty to illustrate, for the class as a whole, important  techniques for understanding and mastering skills necessary for  proper and effective microscope usage. A laser disk player/TV  monitor system will also be utilized to fully integrate a system of  study and reference during lecture and group time. This pedagogy  incorporates the three elements of an exemplary biology program: an  investigative laboratory; use of biological techniques; and use of  computers. It also accommodates a variety of learning and teaching  strategies, fosters critical thinking and problem solving, includes  collaborative learning and fosters active student participation.",
