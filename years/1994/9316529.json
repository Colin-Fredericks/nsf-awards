 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316529    Puckett       The central focus of this research is the design and  development of a numerical method for modeling complex nonlinear  wave interactions in condensed matter at high pressures and  temperatures.  This numerical method is based on a collection of  numerical algorithms that have been used with great success to  model shock wave refraction in gases.  The extension of these  algorithms to problems involving condensed matter involves  modifications to accommodate a realistic condensed phase equation  of state, the inclusion of realistic constitutive relations for  modeling the strength effects in solids, and the development of  robust algorithms for describing vacuum states.  It is also  expected that a better understanding of wave phenomena in  condensed matter gained from the numerical computations will  contribute to the understanding of the wave structure that  characterize solutions of more general systems of hyperbolic  conservation laws than those that govern the flow of gases, and  thus aid in the mathematical analysis of these equations.  This  work includes extensive experimental validation of numerical  results.       This project is concerned with developing advanced  computational methods, based on methods originally developed to  address aerospace and defense problems, and applying the new  methods to important problems in the geosciences.  These new  computational methods are used to design an improved experimental  technique for determining sound speeds in geophysical materials.  Accurate knowledge of sound speeds is important for the correct  interpretation of seismic data.  The new computational methods are  also used to model the effect the impact of a large comet or  asteroid would have on the Earth.  Such impacts have been proposed  to explain the mass extinction of species (e.g., dinosaurs) and  may have been responsible for the periodic loss of the Earth's  early atmosphere.  The specific nature of such large shocks, and  the consequences they might hav e for the atmosphere and the  Earth's magnetic field, are addressed.  The use of the  computational methods to model explosive volcanic eruptions is  also investigated.  The computational methods developed in this  research will have a wide range of applications in other areas of  science and technology.",
