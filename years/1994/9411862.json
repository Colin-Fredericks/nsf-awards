 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the Progressive Era and the reforms in educational institutions during those years had a great influence on the development of genetics in this country.  In response to the emphasis on useful knowledge, may biologists developed research programs in \"experimental evolution.\"  Best conceived as an approach to inquiry, experimental evolution aimed to solve the riddles of evolution and to predict its workings.  The ultimate goal, however, was to manipulate and control evolutionary forces.  This pragmatic goal led American studies in heredity and evolution to assume very distinctive characteristics, especially a pronounced theoretical and methodological eclecticism.  Researchers did not profess allegiance to any particular school of thought because they were not interested in building theoretical systems, but rather in finding practical applications.    Dr. Vicedo is exploring how the interests and goals behind experimental evolution changed over two decades in such a way that the field of genetics was identified with studies about the structure of  the genome, the type of research program so successfully developed by Morgan's group at Columbia University.  She is analyzing how this change took place through an analysis of the work of W.E. Castle and E.M. East at Harvard along with other work done by a number of other biologists.    This study promises to enhance our understanding of the history of genetics and lead to a reassessment of current interpretations of the development of Darwinian and Mendelian ideas.  It will also help us to understand the roots of Morgan's work and the interests and problems that led towards the Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology.  The role of national context in shaping styles of scientific thought will also be examined.  This study promises to enrich our understanding of how social, institutions, pragmatic, and intellectual factors interact in the development of a scientific discipline.",
