 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319352  Michel  We propose to investigate the applicability of robust control  theoretic results in the qualitative analysis of power systems.   Thus far, only a few isolated applications of robust control  theoretic results to power systems have appeared in the literature.    The proposed work consists of two principal areas of inquiry:   (a) modeling of power systems, and (b) robust stability properties  of an equilibrium of a power system.    We will develop models for contemporary power systems which include  some of the latest devices and some of the most current  technologies (e.g., flexible 'AC transmission systems (FACTS),  static VAR compensators (SVC), and so forth).  This research will  build on previous NSF supported work by the principal  investigators.    The second part of the proposed work consists of two segments.  In  the first segment we intend to conduct robust stability analysis  investigations of linear models of power systems in the state  space.  Among other areas, results of this kind are important in  synthesis procedures (such as stabilizer design).  Our approach  will rely on Hurwitz stability investigations of interval matrices  which arise in the modeling of power systems subjected to parameter  perturbations.  In the second segment we extend that above proposed  work to nonlinear models of power systems in a state space setting.  The work proposed above (in both segments) will rely on stability  results developed by the principal investigators and their co-  workers with prior NSF support.  ***",
