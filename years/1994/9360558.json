 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360558  Wang       In the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a  multi-zonal approach greatly simplifies the resolution of  complex geometrical details and the application of different  flow physics in different zones of the flow domain.  Previous multi-zonal patched and overlapped approaches  suffered from one or both of the following problems.  In the  proposed approach, one of the overlapping boundaries is used  to divide the physical flow domain into non-overlapping  regions and flux conservation is enforced on this  overlapping boundary locally and globally.  The proposed  approach unifies the treatment for arbitrarily patched and  overlapped meshes.  The interpolation of flow variables from  one zone to another is not necessary.  The proposed approach  is fully conservative, highly accurate, suitable for both  steady and unsteady flow problems and easy to implement in  finite-difference/finite volume CFD codes.       In Phase I, the proposed methodology will be  implemented and assessed for several 2D and 3D problems  without relative mesh movement.  Further extension to  viscous flow and unsteady flow with relative mesh movement  and implementation of the proposed methodology in a  production-level flow analysis code will be carried out in  Phase II.",
