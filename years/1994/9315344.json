 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315344  Lin  Discrete event systems (DES) are used to model man-made systems  that are not readily described by the differential or difference  equations used in traditional control theory, but rather by  interactions of events that record significant qualitative  changes in the systems.  Several approaches to modeling, control,  and optimization of DES have been proposed, each addressing a  specific issue and providing an important piece of the entire  puzzle of DES.  However, these pieces are as yet separate and  disconnected to a large extent.  Furthermore, some approaches  suffer from exponential computational complexities.  To overcome  these obstacles, the aim of this proposal is to develop a  comprehensive theory of DES.  In this theory, efficient  implementation of on-line control will be provided; component  failures will be diagnosed; hard time constraints will be  satisfied; temporal performance will e evaluated; and hybrid  systems will be considered.  If successful, this comprehensive  theory will bridge the gap between two major approaches in DES:  qualitative approach addressing the logic issues and quantitative  approach addressing performance issues.  It will also connect  research results in discrete event systems with those in  continuous variable systems.  It will further provide  computationally efficient ways to implement control.  All these  will greatly enhance the applicability of DES methodologies.  ***",
