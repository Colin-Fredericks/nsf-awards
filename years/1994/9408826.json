 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408826  DellaPenna  A long-term goal of this research is understanding the functional  significance of developmentally regulated, polyuronide  modifications in plants.  As part of prior NSF funding, the Beta-  subunit of polygalacturonase (PG1) was purified; cDNAs encoding the  protein were isolated and characterized.  Beta-subunit mRNA  accumulates to high levels in developing fruit and is to a large  degree temporally separated from catalytic PG2 expression.   Homologous sequences have been identified in a wide variety of  plant species suggesting a broad functional role for the protein in  plants.  The current working theory is that the Beta-subunit  defines a new class of bifunctional plant cell wall proteins that  interact both with structural components of the wall and catalytic  proteins, to localize and/or regulate metabolic activities within  the cell wall.  This hypothesis can now be tested in transgenic  tomoto fruit in which Beta-subunit expression is inhibited by  antisense RNA.  The proposed research will further address long-  standing questions of how pectin-degrading enzymes are targeted and  regulated in plants and what the functional significance of pectin  degradation is in various tissues and cell types.  ***",
