It is a study of social attachment in  early childhood across two generations, and it uses current  observation (via videotape) and recollections via an interview  and questionnaire.  It is a cross-cultural study in that  comparable data have been previously obtained from Icelanders,  Korean-Americans and Bengali-Americans.    The purpose of the study is to address the issue of cultural  relativity versus cultural universals with regard to mother-child  attachments.  The study will address a series of questions: Are  there recognizable, culture-specific patterns of mother-child  attachments?  Are cultural patterns of mother-child relationships  resistant to change across generations?  Are historically based  societal shifts sufficient to change such patterns?  If mother-  child relational patterns prove resistant to change, or if they  do not, which theoretical framework best accounts for the facts?",
