 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411212  Tough    The flow of superfluid helium is limited at high velocities by a  random tangle of quantized vortex lines that fills the fluid.  In  uniform flows, when the tangle is homogeneous, this state of  turbulence is well understood both experimentally and  theoretically.  A fundamental microscopic theory, supported by  computer simulations, gives many properties of the tangle in  excellent agreement with experiments.  It was therefore surprising  when preliminary experiments on weakly inhomogeneous superfluid  turbulence gave results that cannot be understood as a simple  extension of the homogeneous case.  This experimental project  extensive new data on the static and dynamic properties of  superfluid turbulence in nonuniform flows where the tangle is  inhomogeneous.    % % % %    Understanding and controlling turbulence in the flow of fluids is  an important and long-standing problem in science.  From the  behavior of aircracts and ships, to predicting the weather and  increasing the efficiency of flow through pipelines, turbulence  plays a critical role.  Enormous progress has been made recently in  understanding a kind of turbulence in the simplest fluid:   superfluid turbulence in liquid helium.  A fundamental theory gives  results in excellent agreement with experimental observations as  long as the turbulence is the same in every part of the fluid.   When the turbulence is inhomogeneous however, there are surprising  discrepancies.  The experimental project will produce extensive new  data on the properties of inhomogeneous superfluid turbulence,  proving a rigorous test of our theoretical; understanding.  ***",
