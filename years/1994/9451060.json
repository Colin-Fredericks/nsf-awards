 "awd_abstract_narration": "The the molecular biology component of the plant biochemical and  physiological curriculum at LSU-Shreveport will be enhanced by  providing students enrolled in laboratory class at several levels  with the cell and tissue culture facilities necessary for plant  physiology and plant molecular biology laboratory work.  The  requested equipment will be used in a series of experiments  designed to enable students to formulate and test hypotheses  related to the understanding of important concepts in plant  physiology and molecular biology. In the 100 and 300 level courses,  students will investigate phenomena regarding the phytohormone  ratios necessary to initiate the growth of callus tissue and to  regenerate plants from callus tissue. Students enrolled in the 400  level class will gain experience in genetic transformations using  Agrobacterium tumifaciens and conduct experiments in gene  regulation using plant tissue that has been transformed with the  GUS reporter gene system under the control of constitutive and heat  shock promoter elements.  In addition to serving a pivotal role in  the instructional laboratory classes, the requested equipment also  will enable undergraduates engaged in research projects to conduct  individual investigations.",
