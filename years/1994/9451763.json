 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451763  Chelberg  This project is intended to improve the laboratory experience for  Augsburg College biology majors in the study of cell biology.  Students will gain an appreciation of the relationships between  intact cells, functioning cell organelles, and their components  through investigations designed to improve both their thinking  skills and their laboratory skills. Effects of the project will be  felt in lab exercises and student projects in introductory and  advanced cell biology courses and in independent student research.  A rapid cycling ultracentrifuge, a multipurpose preparative  centrifuge, electrophoretic equipment and a refrigerated water bath  will be used for separation and analysis of subcellular components.  For colorimetric and spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial  function, vacuolar proton pumping, nucleic acid and protein  determinations and a variety of related procedures we propose to  acquire six student grade spectrophotometers and a versatile high  quality spectrophotometer with plotting and analytical capability.  Students will use a very sensitive pH meter and a \"cool\" high  intensity light source to monitor pH changes as isolated  chloroplasts pump protons in the light reactions of photosynthesis.  All our planned improvements are designed to give our students  experience in framing questions in cell biology and then learning  how these may, and may not, be answered with modern analytical  tools.",
