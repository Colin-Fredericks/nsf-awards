Topics to be presented at the plenary lectures  include: the use of halophytes in arid zones;  mechanisms used by halophytes for overcoming  salinity; population biology of halophytes;  genetic diversity in mangroves; mechanism of  salinity tolerance in mangroves; genetic  transformation of halopytes as a technique for  improvement of crops; salt tolerance of  lacustrine and coastal varieties of dune  plants; mechanism of salt tolerance in  herbaceous halophytes; and seed bank ecology.   The symposium will also include submitted  papers from some 30 countries.  A proceedings  of the refereed papers and other presentations  will be published after the symposium and will  be available in the U.S., Pakistan, and other  countries.    Scope:  The project supports a symposium in an  area of major importance to many countries that  have large irrigation systems, including the  U.S. and Pakistan.  Research in this field  combines several important scientific  disciplines including biophysics, biochemistry,  genetics, as well as engineering and irrigation  practices.  Scientists from Pakistan, who have  made significant advances in experimenting with  salinity-tolerant plant varieties in the last  two decades, will be able to share their  insight in the field.  Participants from the  U.S. and from the U.K., Germany and Australia  will provide expertise in the basic mechanisms  leading to the desired salinity-tolerance in  plant varieties.  The exchange of information  during the symposium should lead to better  collaboration and integration of results, and  possibly to significant improvements,  worldwide, in understanding how to increase  crop yields in salt-affected or marginal lands.  ***",
