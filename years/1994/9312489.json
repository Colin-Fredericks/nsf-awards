 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abtract - Manousiouthakis - 9312489    In recent years, the lack of major capital investments in the process industries has made the implementation of control projects one mode to increased plant profitability.  These economic benefits are typically associated with the improved dynamic performance offered by advanced controls.  In a regulatory control context, a quality variable is desired to stay within control limits and is not allowed to exceed specification limits.  If one control strategy can achieve tighter control limits than another, then the setpoint of this quality variable may be changed so as to enhance process economics.      Dynamic performance is not one criterion in selecting a control system.  Uncertainty, complexity and reliability are also critical issues.  Chemical process models are often empirical, neglect complex physicochemical phenomena or lack information on process parameters.  Consequently, high levels of uncertainty are associated with these models.  Chemical processes are also large scale interconnected systems in which a large number of variables are measured and/or manipulated.  The geographical location of these interconnected unit operations would necessitate the installation of a complex communication network for the purpose of transferring information from the measurements to a central location and then to the manipulations.  The installation and maintenance costs and the complexity of such a network often prevent the implementation of such a centralized control system.  Instead, control system simplicity is attained by: 1) the use of a decentralized control system in which measurements and manipulations are classified into subsets and information is exchanged only between corresponding subsets, and 20 the use of simple low order control strategies with which human operators are familiar.  Reliability is another criterion in control system design.  Failures of control system elements such as sensors/actuators often lead to the manual operation of control loops .  It is desirable that the control system be such that it can be readily reconfigured so as to maintain plant operation albeit with degraded dynamic performance characteristics.    The objective of this research project is the development of a methodology that addresses the question: What is the best achievable dynamic performance that a decentralized and/or low order simultaneously stabilizing and/or reliable feedback control system can deliver in the presence of external disturbances.  The formulation of these control problems leads to quadratically constrained, infinite dimensional optimization problems.  The investigation of computational techniques for the global solution of such problems is one of the main issues that will be addressed.  Branch and bound, decomposition, interval arithmetic techniques and combinations thereof and computational implementations will be sought.",
