The study will examine the effect  of political reform on rural social conflict in Columbia.  During  the past decade, Columbia has presented contradictory trends  toward democratizing reform and escalating political violence, a  paradox that defies the predictions of prevailing theories of  democratic transition and guerrilla movements.  New theories  suggest that elite-sponsored violence may escalate in reaction to  increased peasant control over rural institutions, or that in  some cases more representative institutions can now mediate  peaceful, institutional resolutions to conflicts.  This research  will study the effect of a specific reform, allowing the direct  election of county executives, on several rural conflicts.  The  four stages of the investigation will focus on: 1) the national  context of violent democratization, 2) the causes of rural social  conflict, 3) the effect of reform on these conflicts, and 4) the  mechanisms accounting for these effects.  %%%       This research will contribute to political sociology and to  the sociology of development.  The key international issues for  policy makers today revolve around the success or failure of  various routes to democratization, so the findings of the study  should have substantive significance.  In addition to the  scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will  materially assist a highly promising student in completing  research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the  future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough  training of the next generation of social scientists.    ***",
