It will be discovery based in  that students will observe phenomena in the laboratory, then use  those observations to develop an understanding of the chemistry  involved.  A principal goal of the project is to provide an  exciting learning experience for the students.  Many science  courses deny students access to the joys of discovery and  understanding that so delights both young children and practicing  scientists. While for individuals, this situation is regrettable,  for aspiring teachers it is disastrous since they are the ones who  will shape the understanding of tomorrow's leaders.  This project would put the joy of discovery back into science  courses.  For example, atomic structure and bonding would start  with a hands-on examination of the material properties of a variety  of metal samples. The brittle ones have restricted spatial  directionality in the bonding with few nearest neighbors while the  soft, ductile ones have expanded bonding spheres with many nearest  neighbors. Students will be sent into the laboratory for an  adventure in exploring first. The class will then be encouraged to  develop an hypothesis for their observations. Only after this  process, will the instructors, through directed questions, guide  the students to realize the importance of bonding and structure.  The class will then be encouraged to extrapolate and extend this  understanding to materials not examined.  A educational evaluator is a member of the project team.  Initial  contact with a publisher could lead to widespread dissemination via  a textbook.  ***",
