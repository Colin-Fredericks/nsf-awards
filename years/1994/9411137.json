 "awd_abstract_narration": "The larvae of tent caterpillars display a diversity of lifestyles,  ranging from solitary individuals to simple aggregations to highly  integrated societies.  There are six Malacosoma species in North  American as well as five European species.  Social complexity in  this group is defined in terms of interaction and communication  between group members, and is thought to be correlated with  patterns of host plant utilization and foraging.  The diversity of  social forms in this genus provides a model system for the  elucidation of ecological correlates to the evolution of sociality,  as well as of the ways in which sociality may influence host plant  use.  Phylogenetic relationships among species of the social tent  caterpillar genus Malacosoma (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) will be  assessed through application of cladisitic methods to gene sequence  data to investigate patterns of social-behavioral evolution in this  group.       Some tent caterpillars are economic pests and better knowledge  of the group-living characteristics of this group is of important  economic interest to homeowners and farmers.",
