The endeavor will be  carried out in the Philadelphia area by PISEC, a partnership of The  Academy of Natural Sciences, The Franklin Institute, the Thomas H.  Kean New Jersey State Aquarium at Camden and the Philadelphia Zoo,  joined for this project by the University of the Arts.    To achieve the goal of fostering science literacy by encouraging  families to engage in successful learning strategies while visiting  science museums, PISEC has identified the following objectives for  the project:       -    To increase understanding of the processes and potential            of science museum-based family learning.       -    To apply this understanding to the development and            implementation of effective program and exhibit            enhancements in four science museums.       -    To involve existing staff so that evaluation and research            become an ongoing component of program and exhibit            development in the participating museums.       -    To utilize a multi-institution team approach designed to            maximize impact, be cost-effective and be replicable in            other regions across the country.    The project has three phases.  First, a research study using  ethnographic data collection and focus groups will be conducted at  the participating museums.  This study will lead to the formulation  of a set of criteria for successful family science learning and  hypotheses about what is needed to facilitate this behavior.   Second, utilizing these findings, the four institutions will  develop four distinct programs and/or exhibit enhancements designed  to foster positive family learning experiences.  Formative  evaluation and inter-museum collaborative will be integral parts of  this process.  Finally, the summative findings of the individual  efforts will be compared  to look for constants in successful  programming across the sites.  Results will be assembled in a  handbook which will be widely disseminated to the field.    In carrying out this study, the project will fill in the body of  existing museum-based family learning research.  The knowledge  gained will give science museum professionals a new set of tools  which can be used to increase the frequency of positive learning  experiences in their facilities, and to broaden the diversity of  visiting families as well.  Because the subject matter under  investigation represents a wide range of scientific disciplines,  the results of the projects should prove applicable to many  different types of informal science learning environments,  including science centers, natural history museums, zoos, aquariums  and botanic gardens.  The collaborative nature of the project will  serve as a model for similar partnerships among cultural  institutions and universities in other large metropolitan areas.",
