 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408937  Kenoyer    Under the direction of Dr. Jonathan Kenoyer, Ms. Heather Miller  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Working at the  site of Harappa, located in the Indus Valley of Pakistan, she  will conduct a surface survey of this large urban center. The  fieldwork consists of two parts. First she will note and map the  location of craft activities such as smelting, ceramic and shell  production, and stone tool use. She will then conduct a proton  gradiometer survey to plot the distribution of underground  pyrotechnological indicators. These data taken together will  allow her both to reconstruct the organization of craft  activities and to determine the relationship between subsurface  and sub-surface materials.    Sites such as Harappa are of major archaeological interest  because they attest to the rise of a civilization, apparently  independent of those from China and the Near East. By the third  millennium BC large urban centers arose in the Indus valley,  flourished and then disappeared. It appears that salinization of  fragile desert soils played a major role in their demise. The  trajectory of development appears different in the Indus than  other regions because, in contrast to the latter, it is not clear  that an elite ruling class emerged. Archaeologists wish to  understand what factors led to the rise and maintenance of this  phenomenon. Through her analysis of craft production, MS Miller  will look at one aspect of this issue. Through an examination of  the production process and its spatial distribution, MS Miller  hopes to determine the extent to which it was subject to  centralized control.    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on an extremely important archaeological site. It will  increase our understanding of the processes which led to the rise  of complex society and will assist in the training of a promising  young scientist.  ***",
