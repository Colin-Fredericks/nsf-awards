 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415482 Kou  The Bridgman process has been widely used for growing  single crystals of electronic and photonic materials, but dopant  segregation along the crystal, which degrades the crystal quality,  has been a significant problem.  Materials science research on bulk  crystal growth will be carried out to develop a better fundamental  understanding of  the processes associated with segregation of  dopants in the Bridgman growth process.  Two modified Bridgman  crystal growth processes will be studied, and their effectiveness  in segregation reduction will be evaluated in single crystals of  Indium Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride.  Flow visualization  of the transparent melt during the growth of Sodium Nitrate  crystals will be conducted using a transparent crucible and furnace  will be employed in these experimental studies to obtain additional  information on the mechanisms operative in dopant segregation in  electronic and photonic materials.   %%% The primary goal of this  program is to develop a fundamental understanding of the bulk  crystal growth of Indium Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride, two  important electronic and photonic materials.  Greater control over  the process of dopant segregation will allow higher quality  crystals to be produced, which, in turn, will lead to improved  device and circuit performance and reliability.  An important  feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general perform ance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and tele communica tions.  ***",
