 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mayaguez  Gustavo Lopez is supported by a Minority Research Initiation Research   Planning grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program   to study the behavior of clusters adsorbed on surfaces.  Computer   simulations will be used to study the structural and thermodynamic   properties of various clusters adsorbed on model surfaces as a function   of temperature and cluster size.   Examination of free energies as a   function of cluster size will be used to determine whether \"magic number\"   clusters are to be expected.  Characterization of phase transitions will   be investigated by looking for heat capacity discontinuities as a   function of temperature.    Heterogeneous catalysis is a very important industrial process which   involves reactions of chemicals adsorbed on a catalytic surface.  A   number of physical processes are involved such as sticking probabilities,   surface diffusion and mobility, interaction of the adsorbates with the   surface, etc.  Computer simulations of clusters adsorbed on model   surfaces provide molecular level insight into processes which may have   important industrial catalytic significance.",
