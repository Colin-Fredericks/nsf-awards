 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with the quantitative  characterization of materials at the highest levels of  spatial resolution. This award will be used to purchase an  imaging energy filter, which will be added to a high-  resolution transmission electron microscope. The addition of  such a filter will open the path to many new observation  modes such as elastic bright field imaging, electron  spectroscopic imaging and diffraction and electron  spectroscopic convergent beam electron diffraction. The  filter is to be mounted after the microscope lenses and  hence all previously available observation modes will remain  accessible. The filter will permit researchers to obtain  chemical information at near atomic resolution. Among the  projects which will benefit from the energy filter are:  extension of the point resolution of the existing instrument  down to the information limit by means of energy filtering  and wave function retrieval techniques, analysis of the  structure of fullerene nanotubes and magnetic nanocrystals,  determination of the degree of Cr-segregation in Cobalt  alloy thin films used for magnetic recording, in-situ  observations of the formation of titanium disulfide  platelets from sulfides, in-situ observation of diffusion  processes in polycrystalline films, and characterization of  the chemical structure of pressure-induced amorphous phases.  %%%  Quantitative characterization of materials requires not only  a complete crystallographic description of the structure,  but also a detailed chemical understanding of all defects  and internal interfaces at the highest levels of spatial  resolution. The addition of this imaging filter to the  transmitting electron microscope will permit researchers to  obtain chemical information at near atomic resolution for  technologically-important materials such as crystalline,  quasi-crystalline and amorphous solids, fullerene nanotubes  and magnetic nanocrystals, and alloy thin films used for  magnetic recording.",
