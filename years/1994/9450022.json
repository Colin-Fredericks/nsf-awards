 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450022  Scantlebury    This project will study the impact that incorporating gender equity  training into the secondary science education program has on the  teaching practices of preservice and cooperating inservice  teachers.  Both groups will participate in summer workshops,  coursework, seminars, and meetings which will have gender equity in  the sciences as a central theme.  Key components include:   providing gender equity training for preservice and cooperating  inservice teachers; providing professional development for both  groups; utilizing inservice cooperating teachers in teaching  preservice methods courses; examining the effect this involvement  has on the cooperating teachers' gender-sensitive classroom  practices; mentoring of preservice teachers by cooperating teachers  and university faculty; establishing dialogues between university  science faculty and teachers.    Preservice teachers need specific training in equitable teaching  strategies and supervision by high school science (\"cooperating\")  teachers who are sensitive to gender equity issues.  The project is  aimed at encouraging preservice and cooperating teachers to develop  the characteristics of gender-sensitive science teachers through:  changing current coursework for preservice teachers; working  directly with cooperating teachers; including scientific research  opportunities for preservice teachers; transfer of educational and  scientific research to the classroom; linking programs to other  ongoing state and local efforts; providing integration between the  Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Education, and local school  systems; and presenting research at national meetings.  ***",
