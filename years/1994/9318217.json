 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how animals choose mates is both a theoretical and   a methodological challenge.  Many studies on diverse organisms   have shown that females choose mates and that this choice is   based on variation among males in physical and behavioral traits.    However, little is known about how the choice is made and how it   is affected by genetic and environmental factmrs.    Drs. Kodric-Brown and Nicoletto will develop and apply a video-  imaging technique that will allow assessment of the relative   importance of courtship displays and color patterns of male   guppies in attracting females.  Advantages of using such an   imaging technique are:  (a) precise control of male color   patterns and courtship behavior, (b) high degree of   repeatability, because the same male images are presented to   females, (c) ability to manipulate individual behavioral and   morphological components independently of each other and in   combination, which will allow assessment of their relative   importance in female choice, and (d) ability to present exactly   the same choices to different females in the population or to the   same female at different stages of her life or experience.    The research should yield answers to such important questions as:    (a) How much variation is there in mate preferences among females   within and between populations?  (b) How consistent are the   preferences of individuals. and do they change with age or   experience?  (c) How do different traits combine to produce   attractive courtship signals?  Results of this project will also   be relevant to other areas of behavior, such as the use of   signals in communication systems.",
