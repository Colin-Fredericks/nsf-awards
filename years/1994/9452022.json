 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452022  Kerner  The primary goal of our introductory chemistry laboratory is to  allow the students to experience how chemical principles are  derived from data and engage the students in scientific processes  and ways of thinking. Our approach has been to develop \"discovery\"  based experiments in which students explore a wide range of  parameter space with little advance guidance from the instructor as  to the expected outcome. Our emphasis is on qualitative reasoning,  which we have found is particularly fostered when students work in  collaborative groups with data management handled by computer.  Different groups of students investigate the same properties (e.g.,  reactivity, solubility, etc) for a different and specific set of  reagents. The discovery of trends is facilitated by presenting  students with multi-instances of the same phenomenon. A networked  computer system (CoLABnet) pools and summarizes the largely  qualitative data for all of the varying group investigated  reagents. Student groups are assigned specific questions to answer  which require them to utilize and/or organize the summarized data  using commercial graphing software. Groups present their findings  during post-lab discussion. Preliminary tests have shown that  computer can significantly improve the effectiveness of the course.  Computer production of a class data base shifts the focus from data  collation and organization to data analysis and interpretation. The  use of computers permits data pooling on a scale that would be  otherwise impossible. The model emphasizes the uncertainty inherent  in science and the importance of statistical variance. The present  computers are limited to several rooms and do not allow multi-  tasking (students can either enter data to the network or plot data  using commercial software, but not both). Funds are requested to  purchase computers capable of multi-tasking for all of the  laboratory rooms.",
