 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two modalities of injury can result in wedge fractures of the  vertebrae:  atraumatic, osteoporotic fracture and seat-belt induced  fracture during vehicular frontal impact.  To reduce occurrence of  these fractures, enhanced knowledge of the fracture mechanisms and  determinants of vertebral strength is required.  The objective of  this research is to improve the current understanding of these  areas of biomechanics.    Ultrasound technology will be used to determine material properties  for developing finite element models of spinal functional units,  and the contributions of cortical and trabecular bone to vertebral  strength will be assessed.  Whole body and regional impact  experiments will be conducted to determine the correlation between  fracture mechanics and mechanical properties.  Computational and  experimental results will be compared for validation.    Interactive activities will include teaching a combined  undergraduate/graduate course in biomaterials during each of the  first two years and an advanced course in biomaterials the third  year.  Additionally, seminars will be organized featuring experts  in bioengineering.  About 50 percent of the speakers will be women  researchers.  Workshops will be organized and opportunities for  male and female students to visit research laboratories of women in  industry, hospitals, and other universities will be offered through  the Society of Women Engineers and ASME.",
