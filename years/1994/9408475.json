 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408475  Adair    This grant permits Dr. Mary Adair to obtain radiocarbon dates on  domesticated maize specimens excavated from the archaeological  site of Trowbridge. The materials were collected from an ancient  trash pit which was excavated by an amateur archaeologist.  Ceramics also recovered in the pit suggest a date of Middle  Woodland times, ca. A.D. 250-400. However such contextual dating  is not definitive and a series of radiocarbon dates on the maize  itself will solve the issue. If the material in fact is Middle  Woodland, it will represent the earliest domesticated maize found  on the Great Plains. Small quantities of maize associated with  the late Woodland period (ca. A.D. 700-900) have been recovered  but earlier materials are unknown.    Archaeologists know that a high degree of social complexity  developed in prehistoric North America and that sites such as  Cahokia brought together large numbers of people at places that  may be termed \"cities.\" They believe that the local domestication  of some crops and the importation of others such as maize played  a central role in this process. However because floral materials  are not well preserved in the archaeological record, it is  difficult to substantiate this hypothesis. The Trowbridge maize  kernels and cobs which were discovered in an unexpectedly early  context will shed new light on this issue and provide data of  interest to many archaeologists.",
