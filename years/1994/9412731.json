 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the conference is to bring together a  diverse group of scientists working on all phases of calcium  and its role in cell function.  In addition to its role as  an essential mineral for bone growth, regulation of calcium  levels inside cells and the action of calcium on  intracellular targets impinges on virtually every primary  biological activity in cells from both prokaryotes and  eukaryotes.  The action of calcium in cells is critical for  regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle function, neuronal  communication in the brain, the response of immune cells to  infection and in most other critical cellular functions. The  field provides the intersection of well established  physiology and pathophysiology with new findings at the  molecular level that provide insights into calcium and cell  function.  In addition to the formal sessions, informal  workshops will be arranged during the meeting to discuss  current questions in calcium research.  Poster sessions will  be held to allow all attendees to exchange new information  and participate in the conference.  Speakers will be from  various fields including physiology, cell biology,  biochemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology and genetics.  This meeting is an important mechanism by which scientists  funded by government grants exchange information that  reduces redundancy in research and increases the speed by  which new discoveries are incorporated by other scientists  across the calcium field.    The topics to be covered are:  Structure and function of  calcium-binding proteins--these are the calcium sensors that  indicate to cells when they have been stimulated; Molecular  properties of calcium channels--these proteins regulate  entry of calcium into cells that trigger cell excitation;  Calcium signaling in the cell and the nucleus--how changes  in calcium levels in cells is used to provide information  within the cell and how this information is transmitted  throughout the cell to regulate cell division and the  produc tion of protein products from specific genes; Calcium  in human diseases--findings from the studies on cell biology  above have enabled muscular dystrophy, stroke, Alzheimer's  and other diseases to be better understood at a molecular  and cellular level and allows for design of new therapeutics  which will be discussed.",
