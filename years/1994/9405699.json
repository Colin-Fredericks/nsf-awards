 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405699  Kuang       One of the central problems in cell biology is the  control mechanism regulating the initiation of mitosis and  meiosis (M phase) during the cell cycle.  Maturation  promoting factor (MPF), which is an M phase-specific  activity functionally defined by its ability to induce  Xenopus oocyte maturation (meiotic division), is  hypothesized to be the mitotic inducer in all eukaryotic  cells.  Although currently MPF activity is attributed solely  to the p34cdc2 kinase/cyclin B complex, this proposal has  provided evidence for the working hypothesis that MPF  activity is due to an autocatalytic system consisting of  p34cdc2/cyclin B, and at least three distinct proteins  recognized by the anti-phosphoepitope antibody MPM-2, and  the kinase(s) that phosphorylate these MPM-2 antigens.  The  three MPM-2 antigens with MPF activity include the  identified activator of cdc2 kinase, cdc25, and two  unidentified activators of cdc2 kinase, designated MPF-QE1  and MPF-QE2.  The kinase(s) that phosphorylate these three  MPM-2 antigens are in turn activated by p34cdc2/cyclin B.  To examine this hypothesis, the proposed research is aimed  at the purification and molecular cloning of MPF-QE1, MPF-  QE2 and the kinase that phosphorylates the MPM-2 epitope on  them.  Availability of their cDNA clone will facilitate the  generation of the purified proteins and antibodies against  them.  These reagents will allow the characterization of  their respective contribution in the activation of cdc2  kinase and M-phase induction.  It is likely that information  generated from the molecular characterization of the  additional components of MPF activity will significantly  facilitate our understanding of the regulation of M-phase  induction during the eukaryotic cell cycle.  %%%  This proposal concerns the study of the process called cell  cycle, by which all cells proliferate.  Cell proliferation  under normal conditions gives rise to the multitude of cells  that living organisms are composed of and allows  for their  growth and regeneration.  Conversely, uncontrolled cell  proliferation often results in disorders such as cancer.  Thus the control of cell cycle is one of the most  fundamental problems in biology.  This proposal addresses  the control of cell cycle, the molecular mechanism that  regulates the initiation of mitosis.  The driving hypothesis  of the proposal is that MPF is a multicomponent system that  plays the role of the \"decision committee\" for the  initiation of mitosis.  The ultimate goal of the proposal is  to identify all important components of this  process and to  determine their interaction in the cell cycle process.  ***",
