 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 557  Surdam  Knowledge Transfer to Stimulate Exploration for Wyoming Natural  Gas    The program is designed to be the first stage in a major long-  term effort to forge mutually beneficial linkages between the  University of Wyoming and Industry, an effort given high priority  by the State of Wyoming.  The program is focused on knowledge  transfer in the natural gas industry in Wyoming as representing  the best available opportunity to model University-Industry  interaction.    Wyoming's immense natural gas resource occurs in accumulations  unconventional in form, emplacement, and history.  Exploration  techniques designed to locate conventional stratigraphic and  structural traps are blind to these unconventional, subtle traps.   Personnel at the Institute for Energy Research (IER) are  developing techniques to identify, delineate, and predict the  productivity of hydrocarbons in subtle traps, and these  techniques have been applied successfully in several hydrocarbon-  producing areas, resulting in significant reduced risk and  increased profitability for industry.  These areas have extensive  databases to work with and company research staff with whom to  interact.  The petroleum industry in Wyoming is sparse and  dispersed, and is composed generally of small operators without  research staff.  It is vital at this time that the IER  communicate the knowledge necessary for finding and developing  natural gas accumulations in subtle traps in Wyoming basins.   This will require that a means of crating linkages and  transferring knowledge be developed that takes into account the  particular conditions of exploration and production in Wyoming:   the industry is dispersed; and knowledge transfer must be careful  and direct, truly understandable and  applicable in the field,  and truly interactive so that optimum research benefits are  derived.  An interactive program of knowledge transfer is  proposed, in which the IER strategy will be demonstrated in  developing the Jonah gas field and a  series of workshops will be  implemented through collaboration between the IER, the Wyoming  Geological Association, and McMurry Oil Company.  Research at the  IER is ongoing; and the accelerated development of Wyoming's  natural gas resource brought about by the knowledge transfer made  possible by this initiative will increase the capacity of the IER  to guide its research on the basis of feedback from Industry and  to compete successfully for  federal R&D funding.  At the same  time, this program will be the model for establishing and  nurturing University-Industry linkages that will be extended to  other industries in Wyoming as the importance of these linkages  is recognized and actively supported.",
