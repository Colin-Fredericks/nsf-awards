It is  directed by a Strategic Planning Steering Committee that is broadly  representative of the community, educators, business, and policy  makers.  The self-study will begin with an examination of goals for  the city's science and mathematics programs leading to a statement  of those goals and a plan for their attainment.  The committee will  be staffed by research, mathematics, and science specialists from  the Memphis City Schools, with the Coordinator of Research Services  as the staff person in charge of the self-study.  Data collection  will include a variety of coordinated procedures, observations, new  data collection, and analysis of existing information among them.   A broad range of participants will be involved in goal  clarification, study design, measurement, analysis, and reporting  thereby insuring ownership and \"buy-in\" by a broadly representative  group of Memphians.  The results will be broadly disseminated using  the network of individuals and groups involved in the study itself.   The committee will continue to review the status of mathematics and  science education periodically and will issue reports on the state  of mathematics and science education in the City of Memphis.    The cost-sharing for the project will be 19 percent of the NSF  portion.  ***",
