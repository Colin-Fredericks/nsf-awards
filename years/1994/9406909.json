 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406909  Copley  Tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone dehalogenase catalyzes the reductive  dehalogenation of tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone (TCHQ) and  trichloro-1,4-hydroquinone (TriCHQ) in a glutathione-dependent  reaction this enzyme is found in the pathway for pentachlorophenol  degradation in the soil microorganisms Flavobacterium sp. strain  ATCC 39723 and Sphingomonas sp. strain RA-2.  Enzymes that catalyze  reductive dehalogenation reactions, usually carried out by  anaerobic microorganisms in sediments and soils.  Since these  reactions are generally very slow, highly halogenated compounds may  persist in the environment for decades.  Despite the importance of  reductive e dehalogenatiion, no mechanistic or structural  information is available about the enzymes that catalyze these  reactions.  the only reductive aryl dehalogenasae that has been  purified is TCHQ dehalogenase.  This proposal describes the first  mechanistic experiments of this novel enzyme.  The specific goals  of the work described in this proposal are 1) to determine whether  metal ions, cofactors, or cysteine residues on the enzyme are  involved in transfer of reducing equivalents from glutathione to  TCHQ;2) to determine the effect of the chlorine and hydroxyl  substituents on catalysis; and 3) to measure kinetic isotope  effects to determine whether transfer of hydrogen to the aromatic  ring or carbon-chlorine bond cleavage are involved in the rate-  determining step.  These experiments will allow us to propose a  mechanism for TCHQ dehalogenase for more detailed studies in the  future.  A critical question in the field of biodegradation is how  microorganisms have evolved the ability to degrade compounds such  as pentachlorophenol which were not present in large quantities in  the environment until relatively recently.  One approach to the  question of he evolutionary origin of enzymes involved in  degradation of halogenated aromatic compounds is to compare the  enzymes and corresponding gene sequences in a number of  micro organisms.  The second part of this proposal focuses on a  comparison of the TCHQ dehalogenase enzymes and the corresponding  genes in Flavobacterium sp. strain ATCC 39723 and Sphingomonas sp.  strain RA-2.  %%%  During the last fifty years, large quantities of chlorinated  aromatic compounds have been introduced into the environment as a  result of manufacturing processes, inadvertent spills, poor  disposal practices and increased use of pesticides.  Many  chlorinated aromatic compounds are degraded only very slowly by  naturally-occurring microorganisms.  The degree of resistant to  biodegradation usually increases with the number of chlorine  substituents.  Thus, highly chlorinated compounds such as  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene and  pentachlorophenol tend to persist in the environment.   Biodegradation of highly chlorinated aromatic compounds begins with  dechlorination reactions that replace chlorine atoms with hydrogen  atoms.  Once a sufficient number of chlorine atoms are removed form  the ring, these compounds can be degraded relatively quickly.       Despite the importance of this type of dechlorination reaction, no  mechanistic or structural information is available about the  enzymes tht catalyze these reactions.  The first part of this  proposal describes the first mechanistic experiments of this type  of enzyme.  A critical question in the field of biodegradation is  how microorganisms have evolved the ability to degrade compounds    such as pentachlorophenol which were not present in large  quantities in the environoment until relatively recently.  One  approach to this question is to compare the enzymes and  corresponding gene sequences in a number of microorganisms.  the  second part of this proposal focuses on a comparison of  dehalogenase enzymes in two different soil microorganisms,  Flavobacteium sp. strain ATCC 39723 and Spingomonas sp.strain RA-2.  ***",
