The two main targets of the research  are (1) Luttinger correlations among carriers in wires at low  carrier density and high magnetic field and (2) chaotic response  from specially designed cavities.  In both cases gates will cover  the entire device to aid in screening by the electrostatic  potentials and to allow control over carrier concentration.   Separate gates will control transmission coefficients in the probes  feeding and sensing the wires and cavities.  This will allow, for  the first time, individual control over these two critical  parameters, which in turn will allow more detailed exploration of  these two new areas of transport physics.    % % % %    The Principal Investigator build new kinds of ballistic electrical  devices where the electrons travel in perfect, disorder-free  crystals and collide only with features created by the architects  of the devices.  The devices will allow more complete control of  the electrical parameters than has been attempted before.  The  devices will be used to understand two newly discovered electronic  effects of current and fundamental interest to the physics  community.  The first is a subtle way in which electrons repel each  other in the midst of a sea of electrons that is confined so that  the electrons cannot easily escape the repulsive forces.  The  second is the chaotic motion of electrons in situations where  irregular orbits are possible.  ***",
