 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406073  Fitz       The Bayesian filter family of algorithms is a recently  developed family of deconvolution (both known and unknown channel)  algorithms for digital communications.  The Bayesian filters are  approximations to the K-lag optimum symbol-by-symbol estimator with  the unique characteristic that its resulting exponential complexity  is decoupled from both the filter lag and the channel length.  This  project 1) will produce significant refinements to the Bayesian  filter algorithms, 2) will produce an analytical characterization  of these algorithms to provide greater insight into the  performance, 3) will examine some applications of the algorithms in  digital communications, and 4) will implement the algorithms in a  fixed point DSP architecture.  The Bayesian filters can be refined   to include significantly more general decision feedback structures,  to be applicable with more general channel models, to more  accurately model time-varying fading, and to implement optimal  combining algorithms.  The general decision feedback structures are  both similar to and a significant generalization of reduced state  sequence estimation.  This structure will provide an excellent  tradeoff between achieving a long decoding lag and maintaining a  reasonable level of complexity.  The channel models considered in  this project will be the autoregressive moving average model and  partially observed Markov chain model.  Deriving deconvolution  algorithms for these channels enables a wider range of problems to  be addressed by Bayesian techniques.  The final generalization is  in the modeling of time-varying channels.  If high performance  deconvolution can be accomplished in a rapidly fading frequency  selective channel, then significant improvements are available in   the capacity of digital communication systems (especially ones  using TDMA).  Finally, methods for optimally combining more than  one observation per symbol will be considered in a Bayesian  framework.  Typical applications of this  type include antenna  diversity systems and fractional spaced equalization.  The Bayesian  filter has a great many potential applications areas and these  applications will be explored in detail.  The areas targeted are:  reduced complexity demodulation of nonlinear modulations with  memory; reduced complexity decoding of error control codes; high  speed high frequency (HF) digital communications; magnetic  recording; and land mobile radio.  ***",
