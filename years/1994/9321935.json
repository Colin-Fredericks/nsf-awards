The funds will be partially used for invited plenary speakers as well as for subsidizing the attendance of researchers in the field by lowering the registration fees.    Reaction Engineering is the discipline that quantifies the interactions of transport phenomena and kinetics in relating reactor performance to operating conditions and feed variables.  This quantification requires a thorough understanding of the micro-scale (molecular level), meso-scale (transport kinetic events on a catalyst particle level) and macro-scale (reactor design in the content of process and plant design).  It results in methodology that is useful in approaching a variety of systems including chemical, biological, biochemical, and electrochemical, where the cause and effect relations imparted by reactions and observed in small laboratory vessels need to be \"scaled-up\" to commercial production.  ISCRE conferences are unique in that they bring together internationally prominent researchers in reaction engineering in a small setting where there is an open atmosphere for the exchange of ideas.  This particular meeting has, as its underlying theme, the environment, including clean or environmentally benign  processing and emission control.",
