 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452409  Oliver  Exciting and important advances in optical and electronic materials  should play a much more significant role in the undergraduate  science and engineering curricula. With this need in mind the  curriculum at the University of Arkansas has been designed to  provide a series of four courses in modern optics for science and  engineering students: Optics, Laser Physics, Applied Nonlinear  Optics, and Optical Properties of Materials. Students in Optics and  Laser Physics learn the fundamentals of both physical and wave  optics and they develop specific skills in the design,  construction, and analysis of state-of-the-art laser systems. These  skills are further developed in Applied Non-Linear Optics where  students investigate concepts and techniques finding widespread  applications in science and technology. All three of these courses  at Arkansas combine both classroom and strong \"hands-on\" laboratory  experiences to enhance student interest and maximize the learning  experience. The Optical Properties of Materials course develops a  foundation in the structural, electronic, and optical properties of  materials, all of which are integrally related and vitally  important for the continued development of novel optical and  electronic materials and devices. Unfortunately, a complementary  \"hands-on\" laboratory experience for Optical Properties of  materials is not presently available for the students. This project  proposes to reinforce the enthusiasm shown by science and  engineering students in this course with an opportunity to develop  their talents and interests into specific skills.  The proposed  Growth and Characterization of Optical Materials laboratory  explores several key aspects of materials research to develop  skills in (i) Crystal Growth, (ii) Physical Characterization; (iii)  Electrical Characterization; and (iv) Optical Characterization of  Materials. In each area, the equipment requested will give the  students experience with actual techniques used throughout the   optics and materials research community.",
