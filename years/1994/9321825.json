 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321825  Steponaitis    Under the direction of Dr. Vincas Steponaitis, Mr. Thomas Maher  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue  his archaeological research in the \"American Bottom\", a section  of the Mississippi River floodplain located East of St. Louis  Missouri. With a focus on the Middle Woodland period which dates  from ca 200 BC to AD 300 he will work to provide a more robust  ceramic chronology and to anchor it firmly in time. To accomplish  this, detailed analysis will be conducted on ceramics from the  few well known sites across this region. A series of radiocarbon  dates will then be obtained from relevant deposits. On this basis  limited and very carefully directed excavation will be conducted  to provide further ceramic material and to allow reconstruction  of social organization.    The large mound site of Cahokia, located on the outskirts of St.  Louis attests to the impressive scale of social complexity and  prehistoric development in the northern Midwest. Archaeologists  have termed this the \"Hopewell phenomenon\" and wish to understand  how such a stratified society emerged. The question is an  important one since this same basic process appears to have  occurred in many parts of the New and Old Worlds. Because of it's  extensive archaeological remains, the American Bottom provides  and excellent region to address this issue. While much is known  about both the earlier and later periods, the Middle Woodland in  the region is still not well understood and it was during this  period that the earliest phases of regional integration likely  took place. What hampers research most is lack of a good  chronology. It is necessary to place sites into chronological  relationship to one another as a first analytic step and this  still can not be done with authority. Mr. Maher's work will help  to remedy this situation.    This research is important for several reasons. It will Provide a  chronological framework of use to many archaeologists. It will  increase our  understanding of how social complexity develops and  will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
