The bulk of the  course will build on this foundation and will consist of student  projects with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and the atomic-scale  characterization of conducting and non-conducting material surfaces  in air, but the students will also experimentally investigate  (Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and relative  emissivity) black body radiation, the birth mother of quantum  physics, and Brownian motion (checking, as did Perrin, Einstein's  derivations from his 1905 paper that did so much to silence the  critics of the atomic viewpoint, Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald),  all with more historical context provided in lectures, readings,  and critical writing assignments than is usual in a lab course. One  thread running through the whole course will be an on-going  discussion of what is meant by \"seeing\" atoms, and the nature of  experimental \"proof.\"  This course will provide needed on-campus  upper-level laboratory experience with apparatus of historical and  pedagogical importance as well as equipment invented even more  recently than the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which was  developed in 1982 and led to the 1986 Nobel prize. In addition,  Physics major Senior Synthesis projects will make extensive use of  the AFM.",
