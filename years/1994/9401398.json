The work will be  carried out in three directions.  In the first, work will be done  on applications of the methods of complex analysis to the dynamics  of polynomial mappings for two complex variables.  The mappings are  assumed to be univalent.  Central to this study will be the use of  pluri-potential theory analogous to the impressive use of potential  theory in the study of one-dimensional dynamics.  In the second  direction, work will continue on the classification of domains with  noncompact automorphism groups.  Since it is trivial to construct  nonsmooth domains with such automorphism groups, attention will be  restricted to domains with smooth boundaries.  The first two  domains addressed will be those which are convex and those with  real analytic boundaries.  In the third direction, the use of Levi  flat surfaces will be studied in connection with the corona theorem  for bounded analytic functions.  A central goal of the work is the  generalization of Wolff's d-bar approach to the corona problem on  simply connected domains to multiply connected domains and Riemann  surfaces.  Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the  century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one  complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory  differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of  the fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on understanding these  basic mathematical forms.  ***",
