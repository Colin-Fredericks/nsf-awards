A variety of design configurations  using the ICL is developed and compared in order to suppress  bending and torsional vibrations and optimize damping  performance. The dynamics and stability of ICL are investigated  in the context of helicopter rotor blades, and a precision boring  process as an illustrative example of a manufacturing task. The  results of this research yield practical, innovative and fail-  safe damping treatments which enhance system reliability and  damping adjustability. In addition, they establish fundamental  theories such as controllability and stability of damped  distributed systems under active vibration control, and advance  damping design methodology in structural dynamics and  manufacturing.  ***",
