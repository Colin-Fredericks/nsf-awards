As a part of this cooperative activity, Dr. Raeburn  will make a reciprocal visit to Dartmouth College in late 1994  or early 1995 supported by the Australian Department of Industry,  Technology and Regional Development. The topic of the research  is the definition of the Brauer group for dynamical systems.    Dynamical systems are mathematical realizations of physical  situations involving time evolution or symmetries. Recent  theoretical work has led the collaborators to the realization  that there is an important underlying structure in which various  non-commutative systems associated to a fixed commutative system  form a group - the equivariant Brauer group.  Using this new  approach will allow the initiation of a program which applies  sophisticated algebraic techniques to dynamical systems.",
