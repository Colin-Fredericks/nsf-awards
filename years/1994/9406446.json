 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this research program is to  elucidate the mechanisms of cell interactions that control  cell fates during early embryogenesis.  Signaling between  embryonic cells is a fundamental mechanism of cell fate  specification in all multicellular animals.  An  understanding of cell-cell interactions in the early embryo  will require not only an analysis of the molecular basis of  the signaling, but also an understanding of the cellular  context of such interactions within the embryo.  With these  goals in mind, the proposed research program involves an  integration of cellular and molecular methodologies.  The  P.I. will apply these experimental strategies to the  developing sea urchin embryo, a manipulable, optically  transparent experimental system.  He plans to focus on a key  regulatory interaction that occurs between the two principal  populations of mesodermal cells in the embryo, primary and  secondary mesenchyme cells (PMCs and SMCs).  PMCs transmit a  signal during gastrulation that suppresses the skeletogenic  potential of SMCs and directs these cells into an  alternative developmental program.  This interaction plays  an important role in the specification of SMC fates and the  process of skeletogenesis, and serves as a model system to  study embryonic regulation and cell signalling in the early  embryo.  Three key aspects of the PMC-SMC interaction are to  be addressed:  (1) the development of new methods for  studying the dynamics of cell fate-switching in living  embryos; (2) the properties and molecular basis of PMC  signaling; and (3) the properties of the responding SMCs.  The proposed research will significantly advance our  understanding of a central issue in developmental biology.  In addition, this research program will continue to support  the training and development of young developmental  biologists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral  levels.",
