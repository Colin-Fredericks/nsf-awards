RIA:  Cooperation Support Systems for Group Problem  Solving      This is the third year funding of a three-year  continuing award. Many problems that are encountered in  an organizational setting are large and complex enough  that they require a team/group effort for efficient and  effective resolution.  These problems are usually  decomposed into subproblems which allows team members,  each of whom is responsible for a distinct subproblem  depending on their area of expertise, to work on  subproblems and resolve the overall problem through  coordination with each other.  In some cases, the  problems are well-structured so that a decomposition of  the overall problem will result in relatively  independent subproblems, which may facilitate  concurrent resolution of subproblems.  This is followed  by information exchange and cooperation between team  members to resolve the overall problem.  In some cases,  problems may be ill-structured, ill-defined, and/or  subproblems may be highly interdependent so that team  members may have to collectively deliberate on the  various aspects of the problem to resolve it.  Most  other problems are usually in between these extreme  cases.  Examples of such problems range from  engineering and software design, project planning to  project selection, product design and marketing, make  or buy decisions, audit going concern decisions, and  many other organizational decisions that involve an  interface of different organizational functions.  This  project addresses the issue of designing information  sharing and cooperation mechanisms to support the  overall problem resolution process using AI techniques  and Argumentation Theory.",
