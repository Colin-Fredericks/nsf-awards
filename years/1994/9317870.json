 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to purchase an electrospray HPLC mass  spectrometer (single  quadrupole) to carry out four diverse  structure-function studies, to provide training in  an  emerging analytical method for graduate students and post  doctoral fellows, and  to provide other researchers within  the Chemistry Department and UCSB campus  access to a  contemporary molecular mass determination method, a  technique  presently unavailable on the campus.    The first major project focuses on both bacterial and  mammalian DNA methyltransferases. The target bacterial  enzyme is the EcoRI DNA  methyltransferase. Ongoing work on  this NSF supported project has used various  LC-MS methods,  and the proposed work extends this effort. Characterization  of  critical histidines within the enzyme is proposed; a  novel electrospray LC-MS  method is under development and  application to the methyltransferase should  identify the  essential histidine(s). The proposed LC-MS method is a  significant  improvement over presently used  spectrophotometric methods and may be  generally applicable.  An LC-MS based strategy is proposed to determine which  elements of the mammalian cytosine DNA methyltransferase are  in contact with its  substrate. A related strategy is  proposed to identify portions of the DNA substrate  contacted by the enzyme. The extent and site of post-  translational modification of the mammalian enzyme are also  proposed to be investigated by LC-MS methods.  The  characterization of the mammalian enzyme is important for  understanding what  role this protein plays in gene  regulation, cancer, and genetic imprinting.    The second major project focuses on the acetylcholine  transporter of synaptic   vesicles. Identification of the  acetylcholine binding site within the protein is proposed  using radiolabeled photoaffinity analogs and LC-MS methods.  Characterization of various site directed mutants of the  transporter is proposed, including the extent to which these  mutants are modified in their post-trans lational  modification. A related proposed set of experiments is  designed to assess how  different growth conditions impact  on the post-translational processing of the  transporter.  The proposed structure-function analysis of the transporter  should help elucidate how the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  functions.    The third project proposes to use LC-MS methods to elucidate  metal ion binding selectivities of siderophores produced by  open ocean marine bacteria. The metal  binding affinity and  selectivity of the recently identified siderophore  Alterobactin A,  the first structurally characterized  siderophore from an open ocean organism, will be  determined. Thus the speciation of the siderophore in  seawater can be determined. A novel LC-MS method is proposed  to screen a large number of potential metals; application to  other marine siderophores is proposed.    The fourth project focuses on the use of high field N.M.R.  to investigate protein-  nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions. LC-MS is  proposed as an additional  means of characterizing the  target biomolecules.    The purchase of the proposed LC-MS instrument would enable  the training of numerous graduate students and research  fellows involved in these projects, as well  as  undergraduates and other individuals associated with  intended minor users. This  proposed training targets the  increasing need in the biotechnology industry for protein  chemists trained in contemporary analytical methods.",
