 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, the brain must lay down an incredibly  complex system of connections between nerve cells that  number in the billions.  Central issues for this development  include how nerve cells are directed to form proper  connections, and to what extent nerve cell activity is  necessary for connections to form normally.  The visual  system of mammals has been extensively studied to approach  these issues, and the basic wiring patterns are well known.  This project uses an important area, called the lateral  geniculate nucleus, where the fibers of the optic nerve in  the eye terminate on cells that project to the visual  cortex.  Electrophysiological recordings, optical recordings  using special dyes, and pharmacological manipulations will  be used to explore how cellular activity, and in particular  activity correlated among particular cells, is important  during prenatal development before full vision is  established.  Results will be important for understanding  how functioning of nerve cells is important to establishing  connections, and forming a bridge between a systems-level  description of mammalian visual development and the  formulation of cellular mechanisms to account for the  process of activity-dependent development.  The results may  have important applicability in understanding the changes  that occur in learning and memory, as well as being  important for developmental biology and sensory  neuroscience.",
