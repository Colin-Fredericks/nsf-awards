 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416017  Kieber         The proposal involves an analysis of ethylene signal  transduction in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with a  focus on one particular element of this pathway, the CTR1  kinase.  CTR1 was previously identified as a member of the  Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases that acts as  a negative regulator of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis.  The goals of the studies proposed here are to characterize  the CTR1 biochemically, to define the function of the amino  terminal domain of CTR1, to understand how the CTR1 protein  and gene are regulated, and to identify additional elements  involved in ethylene signal transduction.  Specifically, it is hoped to demonstrate that CTR1 encodes a  functional protein kinase and to characterize the activity  in vitro by purifying this protein after expression in a  heterologous system.  The properties of the enzyme will be  compared to other protein kinases, with particular attention  given to other members of the Raf family.  It will be  determine whether the activity of the CTR1 kinase is  regulated by differential phosphorylation using in vivo  radiolabeling  with P32 orthophosphate followed by  immunoprecipitation with anti-CTR1 antibodies.  Different  domains of the CTR1 will be over-expressed in planta in an  attempt to determine the function of the amino terminal  domain and to examine the effect that inappropriate levels  and spatial expression of CTR1 has on plant development.  There is preliminary evidence that CTR1 translation is  enhanced by ethylene, and this will be confirmed and  investigated further.  Finally, novel elements involved in  ethylene signal transduction will be searched for using  additional; genetic screens and the yeast two-hybrid system.  The studies should lead to an increased understanding of  ethylene signal transduction, and may provide insights into  other environmental signal transduction pathways.    Plant development is a complex interplay of various  hormonal, environmental and endogeno us developmental  signals.  The elucidation of the molecular mechanism  underlying the perception and transduction of these signals,  and how these pathways are integrated with each other is  crucial for an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate  plant growth and development.  One such signal is the  gaseous plant hormone ethylene, which has been known to have  significant effects on plants since the turn of the century.  Ethylene affects seed germination, fruit ripening, and  abscission and senescence of leaves and flowers.  Ethylene  is also involved in the response of plants to various  environmental stresses such as wounding, pathogen attack,  drought and flooding..  This proposal involves the analysis of the ethylene signal  transduction pathway in the model plant Arabidopsis  thaliana, with a focus of a particulate element of this  pathway, the CTR1 kinase.  The goals of the studies proposed  here are to characterize the CTR1 kinase biochemically, to  define the function of the various parts of the CRT protein,  to understand how the CTR1 protein and gene are regulated,  and to identify additional elements involved in ethylene  signal transduction  The results of these studies will shed light on mechanisms  by which plants sense and respond to various environmental  stimuli.  They will also lay the basis for future  biotechnological applications to interfere with flower  senescence and fruit ripening.",
