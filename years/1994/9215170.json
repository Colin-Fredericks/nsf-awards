 "awd_abstract_narration": "9215170  Pearson  Techniques will be developed that facilitate the least squares  parameter identification for systems modeled by a class of  nonlinear input-output differential and functional differential  equations.  Examples for this class will be found in diverse  areas such as pharmacokinetics, robotics, lasers, and  viscoelastic materials, as well as modeling for control systems  engineering.  Techniques will also be developed for the  nonparametric multivariable linear system (frequency transfer  function matrix) identification problem, as well as the  parametric and (possibly) the nonparametric identification of  time-varying linear differential system models.  Unique to these  formulations will be a discrete-frequency format brought about by  the introduction of a set of complex-valued Fourier based  modulating functions for the classical Shinbrot method of moment  functional.  A basic motivation for using Shinbrot's method is  that it circumvents dealing with unknown initial and boundary  conditions for time-limited input-output data, i.e., no state  estimation is involved.  In addition to the discrete-frequency  format, a basic motivation for developing the Fourier modulating  functions is that the underlying computations will use the  DFT/FFT algorithm, thus providing a \"fast algorithm\" for setting  up the least squares problem.  Structure determination procedures  may be developed for particular classes of system, like those  modeled by polynomial input-output differential equations.  ***",
