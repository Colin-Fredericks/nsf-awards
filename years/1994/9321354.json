Title: Predictability and Variability of the Present Climate    This research encompasses a number of closely related projects  which are aimed at understanding the low frequency (monthly to  decadal) variations of the coupled climate system consisting of the  atmosphere, hydrosphere, land biosystems, oceans and ice, primarily  in the present climatic regime.  Goals include both the ability to  simulate these low frequency variations with complex numerical  models of the individual and coupled systems, and to estimate the  degree to which these variations are predictable.  The methods to  be used will involve extensive experimentation with existing  numerical models and schemes to couple them, and extensive  diagnosis and analysis of observational data from both existing  records and from the retrospective assimilation of atmospheric data  planned by the major operational centers of the world for the near  future.  In addition to the intrinsic importance of understanding  and predicting the low frequency variability of the climate system,   this work will help to define the accuracy and coverage  requirements for current and future climate observing systems in  order to adequately monitor the current behavior of the climate  system.         1. Predictability of the coupled ocean-land-atmosphere system.   The predictability of this system on both the seasonal and  interannual time scales will be systematically explored, the former  by a large number of seasonal atmospheric simulations, and the  latter from integrations of the fully coupled system.         2. Land-surface-climate interactions.  The importance of  vegetation change, albedo feedback and the global boundary  conditions in the Sahel drought will be explored.  The potential  impacts of man's activity on climate through the (hypothetical)  doubling of the world's deserts, global deforestati on and the  desiccation of the Aral Sea region will be addressed.         3. Climate diagnostics.  Diagnostics of the planned  reassimilation of atmospheric data includes a detailed examination  of the hydrological cycle, and global energy cycle and the critical  tropical-extratropical interactions.  These efforts will be aided  by the availability of consistent estimates of the subtle  quantities of divergence, specific humidity and diabetic heating.         4. Simulation of the present climate.  To test the ability of  numerical models to simulate the observed low frequency anomalies,  the PIs plan an integration of the atmospheric model for about 100  years using observed boundary conditions.  Similarly, they will  integrate the coupled climate system model for several hundred  years in order to test the realism of its overall statistical  behavior.         5. Climate observing system simulation.  The PIs will estimate  the sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation to many types of  changes in the boundary conditions.  They will \"observe\"  numerically modelled climate system using methods similar to the  current (and future) observing systems for the real climate to  explore their sampling and accuracy characteristics systematically.    This research is important because it seeks to enhance knowledge  about climate processes and improvements in predicting climate  variation and change.    Part of this research is funded under the USGCRP CMAP project.",
