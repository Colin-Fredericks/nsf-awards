 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452121  Cook  This proposal will enhance four (4) courses in the  Electrical/Electronic Engineering Technology program at Ferris  State University. The courses (EEET 311, EEET 412, EEET 422, EEET  428) form the core analog and digital courses along with the  capstone project course in the EEET program. It is proposed to  enhance these courses by updating the electronic design automation  tools to allow circuits to be designed, simulated and fabricated  which contain mixed types of devices. These types would include  analog, microprocessor and programmable logic devices.  The  specified hardware and software will allow a circuit to be designed  and simulated to observe operation. The printed circuit board or  multi chip module will then be layed out. Thermal profiles of the  resulting board will be observed and the final artwork for the  board will be generated along with appropriate documentation for  the design. The board will then be assembled and final testing will  be performed.  The proposal requires purchase of ten (1O)  workstation computers and associated peripherals. Mentor Graphics  design automation software is specified because of its complete  suite of tools which can accomplish the proposed tasks.",
