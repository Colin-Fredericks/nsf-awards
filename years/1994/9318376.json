The budding yeast,  saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides an excellent opportunity to  study the molecular mechanism of action of negative growth factors.   The yeast mating factors(a-factor and a-factor) are peptides  secreted by each of the mating types, a and a.  They cause cells of  opposite mating type to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle  and to differentiate by inducing expression of a variety contains  a seven-membrane-spanning receptor and several protein kinases,  which include MAP kinases.  Cell-cycle arrest ensues because  activity of the regulatory kinase,p34 CDC28, is inhibited.  A gene,  FAR1, has been recently identified whose protein plays a key role  in arresting the cell cycle in G1 in response to the negative  growth factors.  Genetic studies led to the hypothesis that FAR1  protein inhibits one of the G1 cyclins, CLN2.  Recent biochemical  studies show that FAR1 protein associates with the CDC28 and CLN2  proteins and that the ability to form this complex requires that  FAR1 be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase, FUS3 protein.  These  studies demonstrate that FAR1 is the link between the signal  transduction pathway and the machinery that is involved in  regulating the cell-cycle.  This research is employing a  combination of molecular genetic and biochemical techniques to  address the following aims: (a) Determine how phosphorylation of  FAR1 by FUS3 (and by p34CDC28-CLN2 ) controls activity of FAR1.   Phosphorylation sites shall be identified by biochemical methods;  mutant sites shall be constructed or otherwise identified to test  the role of these sites in vivo and in  vitro.  (b) Determine how  FAR1 inhibits activity of the p34CDC28-CLN2 complex.  Immune  complexes containing CLN2 and CDC28 shall be isolated and assayed  for function in the presence of FAR1 protein;  mutant FAR1 proteins  (inactive or constitutively active) shall be identified and  analyzed to dertemine their ability to inhibit CLN2/CDC28 kinase  activity in vitro and in vivo.  (c) Explore the role of FAR1 in the  mating process of yeast.  Mutants of FAR1 defective in a second  function of FAR1 shall be isolated and their mating defect  characterized.  (d) Search for homologues of FAR1 in other  organisms.  Homologues will be identified by functional rescue of  yeast far1 mutants and by nucleic acid hybridization.  %%%  These studies are relevant to understanding how cell growth is  regulated by the external environment, a fundamental problem in  cell and developmental biology with relevance to cancer.  ***",
