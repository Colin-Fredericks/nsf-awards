Legal secretaries at the ECJ are  lawyers, judicial administrators, and legal academics, and they  perform many professional roles within the administrative  structure of the high court.  The bureaucratization of appellate  courts is an important aspect of their political power because it  increases staff, and therefore judicial, capacity and permits  judicial specialization.  This research is the first effort to  build an extensive data base on the workings of the ECJ, thereby  providing the basis for comparison with other high courts.    The Principal Investigator will interview a number of judges and  legal secretaries at the ECJ, observe the working interactions  between legal secretaries and judges, observe oral argument and  gather descriptive materials on other internal aspects of  judicial procedure.  ***",
