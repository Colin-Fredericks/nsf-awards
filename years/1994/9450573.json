The WINSM Consortium, for the first time, brings together five  EPSCoR states which have much in common, including low population  density, similar geographic and climatic conditions and natural  resource-based economies which are currently in transition.  The  Consortium enables the five states to collectively pursue  opportunities in science, technology, and economic development  which might otherwise be beyond their individual capabilities or  available resources, with the overall goal of improving the  quality and effectiveness of the five state's science and  technology infrastructure.    During the funding period of this one-year proposal to NSF  EPSCoR, WINSM plans to establish the foundation necessary for the  five states to more effectively build on common strengths,  address common problems, and explore common opportunities in  science, technology, and industrial interaction. To this end,  this proposal will provide the start-up funding needed to: (1)   provide technical assistance to both faculty research teams and  small businesses throughout the region to develop and pursue  funding for research and technology transfer programs; and (2)   initiate working relationships with the Idaho National  Engineering Laboratory (INEL), other government facilities, and  with industry to help the Consortium meet its goals.    It is envisioned that at the end of this one-year funding period,  two to three major research initiatives will be developed by the  WINSM Consortium, including one which will develop regionally  appropriate environmental technologies involving the Idaho  National Engineering Laboratory, and another which will address  rural manufacturing development.  A number of smaller inter-and  intra-state research programs ar e also anticipated as a result of  this start-up activity.  In addition, the administrative  framework needed to sustain long-term collaboration between the  five states will be in place.",
