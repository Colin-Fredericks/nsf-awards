 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411564  Martinez    There is great interest by neuroscientists, and a tremendous  practical benefit, to understanding how the brain stores  information.  Previous research has suggested that memory  formation involves protein synthesis and new patterns of  neural gene expression.  In this research a model of  learning, long-term potentiation, will be examined in order  to probe the genes which may be switched on, or switched  off, when new memories are laid down in the brain.   Dr.  Martinez and his colleagues will identify changes in gene  expression induced in a region of the brain called the  hippocampus, using the technique of cDNA subtractive  hybridization.  These genes will then be cloned so that they  can be analyzed in detail through gene sequencing.    The identification of these memory-related genes should  increase our understanding of the cellular and genetic  factors which influence information storage in the nervous  system.  These studies should have important implications  for problems of learning, and of dealing with aging-related  changes in the brain.  ***",
