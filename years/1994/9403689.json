The proposed experiments will be  performed on stamen hair cells of the spider plant  ,Tradescantia virginiana because they exhibit a rate of  progression from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase  onset that is remarkably predictable and useful as a  temporal assay for mitotic progression.  The proposed  experiments are based on a body of published work from the  PI's laboratory that shows the regulatory cascade to consist  of two or three successive waves of protein kinase activity,  punctuated by an interval in mid-metaphase when protein  phosphatase activity is elevated.  Protein phosphatase  activation is a necessary requirement for synchronous entry  into anaphase.  In this proposal a series of microinjections  in living cells with a series of peptides that serve as  activators, inhibitors and substrates of specific protein  kinases will provide an assessment of the timing of  involvement of p34cdc2 protein kinase, calcium calmodulin  dependent protein kinase II, and calcium dependent but  calmodulin-independent protein kinase (cdpk) in the  regulation of progression through metaphase.  All three of  these protein kinases are present in plant cells, and the  experiments include the utilization of the best available  oligopeptide probes for the detection, inhibition or  activation.  The microinjection protocol developed by the PI  permits the introduction of a known quantity of charged or  uncharged molecule (MW < 6,000, though probably much larger)  into the cytosolic compartment of a living stamen hair cell  at a known time point during prometaphase or metaphase.  The  injection protocol, by itself, has no significant event on  the metaphase transit time of these cells.  These  experiments will contribute to our understanding of the  regulatory mechanisms that mediate progr ession through  metaphase and trigger entry into anaphase.  %%%  Mitosis is the process that facilitates the  equal partitioning of the replicated  chromosomes to the incipient daughter cells  that will separate from each other as one  cell becomes two.  In this proposal  experiments are presented to test for the  involvement of a set of protein  phosphorylating enzymes in the regulation of  progression through a specific cell division  stage that is called mitosis, with a  particular focus on sister chromatid  separation, the morphological marker for  entry into the anaphase stage of mitosis.  The model system utilized in these  experiments is the stamen hair cell from the  spiderworth plant, Tradescantia virginiana.  These plant cells progress through mitosis  at a highly predictable rate, and they have  been proven to be uniquely suited for  studies of the timing of regulatory events  involved in mitotic progression.  In the  current experiments living cells will be  injected with known quantities of  synthesized peptides that will affect the  activities of specific protein kinases in  known ways.  Some of these peptides are  kinase activators, while others are  inhibitors or substrates for these enzymes.  Because the cell can be injected at known  time points during metaphase, their effect  on the protein kinases at different times  can provide clues about the environment of  these enzymes in the regulatory cascade that  controls the progression through metaphase  and entry into anaphase.  Results from this  project will contribute to our overall  understanding of the regulatory mechanisms  thatcontrol mitotic progression in intact  cells.  ***",
