 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355481  Duerst    \"Hands-on, Minds-on, Hearts-on\" is the theme of three years of  3-week Science Institutes for primary (K-3) teachers, with  extensive academic year follow-up.  Three groups of thirty-six  lead teachers from 15-19 schools in rural school districts in  east-central Minnesota and west-central Wisconsin will each be  involved for a two-year period.  Initially, each group will  participate in a Summer Institute led collaboratively by two  instructors from the University of Wisconsin River Fall  (UW-RF)with extensive outreach experience, one from the College  of Education and one from the College of Arts and Sciences.  The  teachers will receive instruction in presenting hands-on  activities and, even more importantly, they will experience  science learning and teaching from an inquiry and conceptual  change perspective as they explore, field-test, critique and  compare nationally recognized instructional materials.  During  the following academic year, these lead teachers will field test  selected modules in their own classrooms, with support from the  PIs.  A Science Curriculum Lending Library will be established  for use by participating districts.  The second summer the same  group will meet again for a week on the UW-RF campus to share  experiences and plan inservice workshops which they will conduct  for the rest of the K-3 teachers in their own schools during the  second academic year.  Since most of the targeted districts are  in the transition state from traditional science teaching to  hands-on instruction, the teacher-participants will be prepared  to play an important role in the shaping of science education in  this region.    The cost sharing for the project will be 23% of the NSF award.  ***",
