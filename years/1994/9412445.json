 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through laboratory studies these researchers will conduct a  systematic search for new important heterogeneous reactions in the  upper troposphere and lower stratosphere; that is, heterogeneous  reactions other than those recognized to occur in the Antarctic  spring.  They will measure the surface coverages and compositions  of selected trace species on the surfaces of water ice (ICE),  nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), and supercooled sulfuric acid/water  (SA/W) solutions.  These surfaces will be exposed to trace  atmospheric species one at a time, two at a time and in some cases  three at a time in order to investigate reaction-enhanced surface  adsorption as well as single-species surface coverages.  The plan  is to study these surface compositions under experimental  conditions similar to those present in the upper troposphere and  lower stratosphere.  These experiments will employ the surface  science techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for  the determination of the elemental composition of the surface and  the oxidation states, (and therefore the bonding) of the surface  chemical species, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for the  determination of the elemental composition of the surface, and  quadrapole mass spectroscopy (QMS) for identification and  monitoring of the gas phase chemical species.  In conjunction with  these experiments, through use of chemical thermodynamics combined  with the composition and temperature data provided by the Livermore  two-dimensional atmospheric model, these researchers will determine  the locations and times that various chemical reactions are the  thermodynamically capable of undergoing heterogeneous catalysis at  noon and midnight, during June and September, at altitudes of 5 to  35 km, and from pole to pole.  By combining these two novel lines  of study they seek to identify candidates for new heterogeneous  atmospheric reactions and suitable catalysts for such reactions.   Reactants of interest include atmospheric trace species such  as  sulfur dioxide (S02), hydrogen peroxide (H202), Chlorine (Cly)  molecules, and NOy molecules.  One specific research task will  emphasize the +3 oxidation state of nitrogen N(III), which is  significant in urban smog, but is apparently not important in  stratospheric models and measurements.  N(III) species may be a  significant reservoir for active NOx, a sink for stratospheric NOy,  a catalyst for activating HC1, and a source of atmospheric OH  radical.  Through such laboratory studies, they hope to locate  where in the atmosphere N(III) chemistry is important and  investigate previously unidentified heterogeneous reactions that  occur under the conditions present in the upper troposphere and  lower stratosphere.",
