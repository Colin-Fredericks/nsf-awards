The University of Chicago's  Consortium for Advance Radiation Sources (CARS) is committed  to providing the remaining funds needed to complete the X-  ray detector system. GeoCARS is an organizational sub-unit  of CARS, dedicated to the construction and operation of a  multi-user facility at APS designed to meet the needs of the  earth science research community in using synchrotron  radiation. The APS, to be commissioned at Argonne in 1995,  will provide hard X-rays with 1000 times higher brilliance  than the brightest existing synchrotron source in the U.S.,  and the earth science research community will gain access to  this powerful tool for characterizing the structure and  composition of earth materials by making use of the GeoCARS  sector's experimental stations at APS. The extremely high X-  ray brilliance available will permit unprecedented levels of  spatial and energy resolution in X-ray diffraction and  scattering, X-ray absoption spectroscopy, and X-ray  microprobe and microtomography studies applied to earth  science research in ultra-high pressure, environmental  geochemistry, soils science and agronomy, and waste  disposal. The goal of this project is to instrument the  GeoCARS sector at APS with X-ray detectors that will take  full advantage of the spatial, energy, and time resolution  characteristics of this remarkable and powerful new X-ray  source.  ***",
