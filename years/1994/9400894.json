 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400894  Hrushovski       The investigator would like to study the model theory of the  Frobenius automorphism.  This work has already started, on two  fronts.  On the one hand, he formulated a conjecture analogous to  the Lang-Weil estimates, but more general, that would determine  the first order theory of the Frobenius.  On the other hand,  together with several coworkers, he is in the process of carrying  out the fundamental model theoretic analysis of the theory of  difference fields in question, along the lines of Shelah and  Zilber.  Put together, these should throw considerable light on  the issue; there will be applications to finite simple groups and  perhaps to finite groups in general.       The work described in the above paragraph forms part of a  general trend in the area of mathematical logic known as model  theory.  For several decades, this subject developed  autonomously.  The lack of external pressure allowed it to refine  distinct points of view on algebraic structures, and to reach a  degree of technical maturity.  However, this was done as it were  in laboratory conditions, under assumptions (\"stability\") that  are too restrictive in practical applications.  The time seems  ripe to test the ideas developed in this period against more  complex structures, in particular, number theoretic and geometric  ones.  This requires identifying structures appropriate for model  theoretic analysis and performing an algebro-geometric analysis  needed to prepare for the model theoretic tools.  It also  requires generalizing the model theoretic ideas beyond the  \"stable\" context in which they were conceived.  Some success has  been had with these methods, including the investigation of  finite structures with a high degree of symmetry, and the proof  of certain conjectures in number theory.  One hopes that this is  only the beginning of the road.  ***",
