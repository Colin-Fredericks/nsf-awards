One method of minimizing the environmental effects of  chemicals such as surfactants that are used for their  \"performance\" is to increase their efficiency and effectiveness.   For a given level of performance, less chemical raw material is  then required and less chemical effluent must be treated.    A new type of surfactant that contains two hydrophilic groups of  two hydrophobic groups in the molecule (called \"gemini\" type)  has recently been shown to have surface activity form one to  more than two orders of magnitude greater than comparable  conventional surfactant, depending upon surfactant structure.   It has also been shown, in initial studies, to interact more  strongly with other surfactants than comparable conventional  surfactants.  Since increased interaction strength increases the  probability of synergy in mixtures of surfactants, this  indicated that geminis are more likely to exhibit synergism in  interfacial properties when mixed with other surfactants.    This proposal is for a systematic study of chemical  structure/fundamental interfacial property relationships,  including interactions in mixed monolayers and mixed micelles,  of well-defined, well-purified geminis, to be synthesized for  the most part in our institute.  The necessary data can be  obtained from equilibrium and dynamic surface tension  measurements, supplemented by NMR studies on micellar solutions  and reflectance-absorbance FTIR studies on monolayers.  In  addition to increasing our knowledge of structure/interfacial  property relationships and of molecular interactions in mixed  micelles and monolayers, the results of this study should  provide guidelines for the design and use of surfactant systems  with maximized desired interfacial properties and minimized  environmental impact for industrial use.  ***",
