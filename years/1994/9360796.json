 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360796  Wang  Monolithic integration of silicon  avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays with  their associated  electronics is  proposed. The photodiode elements are  based on the state-of-the-art process   developed by Radiation Monitoring  Devices, Inc., which achieves uniform  bulk breakdown by using neutron  transmutation doped silicon and a  \"beveled junction\" to suppress surface   breakdown. ARACOR intends to  combine these photodiode arrays with  their readout electronics  by using a  special bonded wafer approach to  achieve three-dimensional integration.  In the  proposed approach, the already  processed photodiode wafer will be  bonded to a prime wafer. The  readout  electronics will be processed in this  prime wafer after it has been thinned.  The readabout electronics and  photodiodes will be fully dielectrica11y  isolated with electrical connections  made by means of vias opened through  the silicon film and buried dielectric.  The Phase I feasibility study  will  include fabrication of a two element  APD array, integration of this array into  a bonded wafer  substrate, and  processing of the interconnects.  ARACOR will design readout electronics  and fabricate a prototype of the  inregrated detector array in Phase II. In  Phase II, ARACOR intends to   incorporate these integrated detector  arrays into its own systems and provide  OEM components to  others in  cooperation with RMD.",
