The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Christopher M. Miller of Lehigh University to  work with Professor Robert G. Gilbert at the University of  Sydney.    Their project will apply complementary knowledge and  experimental techniques of the Sydney University and Lehigh  University groups to understand the fundamental science of  processes governing polymer formation, and properties of the  resulting polymer in miniemulsion systems.    The project will build into already existing models for  miniemulsion kinetics the new discoveries that have been  reported by the Sydney group. An outcome of these will be  computer codes whose predictions should be consistent with  the extensive data for archetypical miniemulsion  polymerizations compiled by Miller during his doctoral  research.  The project will make use of the Y radiolysis  relaxation facilities available to the Sydney group to carry  out several experiments.  The increased understanding  derived from these experiments should pave the way for  innovative design of these processes in the future.  ***",
