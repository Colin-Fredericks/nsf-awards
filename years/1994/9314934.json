 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314934  Yen    Swarming of zooplankton at various temporal and spatial  scales have been observed:  where fist-sized ephemeral  clouds of Acartia form in eddies behind coral heads or are  found milling around  shafts of light, to extensive layers  existing at depth or migrating as deep-scattering layers.  While aggregative behavior has been well-studied in larger  aquatic organisms (fish, krill) and terrestrial animals  (birds, insects), little is known of how copepods form  aggregates nor how they maintain the patch against the  tendency of spreading by random motion and the dispersive  energy of mixing in the ocean.  Furthermore, there is little  quantitative knowledge of the cues  that cause aggregations  in zooplankton nor of the purpose of these aggregations.  A  detailed study of swarming behavior in copepods is needed  yet this has not been done before because of limitations in  making actual observations of swarming behavior or in  monitoring situations where one can quantitatively evaluate  their  aggregative dynamics.    This research project will observe and record zooplankton in  a laboratory setting using laser-illuminated video imaging,  and it will examine the kinematics of the formation and  maintenance of zooplankton swarms to an attractive marker  with a quantification of the 3-dimensional animal-animal  interactions as well as the 3D animal-fluid motion.  The  project will determine the sensitivity  of copepods to cues  of different modalities (light-, odor-, motion- reception)  which attract swarm members and to quantify the forces that  maintain a swarm against dispersion by motion.  The effects  of attractant intensity and the species of the swarm member  (stage, sex, size ) on swarm size, density and distribution  (separation distance) as well as on swimming behavior  (posture, orientation, turning and collision frequency,  velocity and acceleration) will be investigated.  To verify  laboratory findings, the behavior of swarms and the dynamics  of swarm formation in respo nse to a designated attractant  will be examined in situ in nature.    ***",
