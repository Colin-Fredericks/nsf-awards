 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408166  Hangarter  Plant development is influenced by many environmental stimuli,  including light, temperature and gravity.  Of these stimuli, light  is of particular importance because it regulates nearly all stages  of development in addition to supplying energy for photosynthesis.   Examples of light-regulated development include germination, stem  growth, leaf and root development, tropic responses, chloroplast  development, branching, and flower induction.  Plants respond to  different qualities of light through the action of multiple  photosensory systems.  The long-term objective of this proposal is  to determine at the cellular and molecular level how blue light in  particular is perceived by plants and converted into modified  growth responses.  The research will focus on the Arabidopsis blue  light photomorphogenic mutants blu1, blu2 and blu3 which have been  shown to be deficient in several important blue light responses.   The major objective of the proposed research is to identify the  nature and mechanism of action of the gene products required for  blue light-dependent signal transduction.  A second objective is to  continue conducting physiological and genetic experiments using  various double mutants between the three blu mutants and other  photomorphogenic mutants, including phytochrome-deficient mutants,  in order to identify functional interactions between different  photosensory systems.  This work will provide significant new  knowledge about the complex network of regulatory events that  control photomorphogenesis and will help elucidate the mechanisms  by which light, and possibly other environmental stimuli, control  plant development.  ***",
