 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311071  West       This project concerns statistical issues arising in data  processing, analysis and inference based on geological records of  environmental change.  The current proposal results from  discussion between the two investigators about the statistical  issues and problems for models and methods of analysis,  especially time series analysis, geared to the realistic  assessment of patterns of time variation in sedimentary records  relevant to climate change.  This project will initiate a  collaborative research and reciprocal training program to address  these issues.  The focus will be on the processes of uncertainty  propagation and formal statistical inference about climatic  changes based on raw records from deep lake sediments.  Similar  issues exist and deserve attention in the assessment of data from  deep sea sediments, ice cores, and tree rings.  Technically, the  project concerns statistical calibration of raw data records, and  time series analysis to assess patterns of variation in the  geological records over time.         The initial objective will be to develop an appreciation of  the statistical issues as they permeate the various stages of the  experimental processes in analyzing isotope and other proxy  climatic variables from deep-lake sediment cores.  Cross-  disciplinary training for each investigator will  e a central and  continuing feature of the collaboration.  This will be directed  at bridging the gulf between, on one hand, current standards of  practice in statistical  analysis of paleoclimate data (e.g.  Pisias and Moore 1981; Hagelberg, Pisias and Elgar 1991)  and, on  the other hand accessible and appropriate modern statistical   methods and models.  A reciprocal training and  development  schedule will provide the opportunity for each of the two  investigators to become sufficiently proficient in the  fundamentals of  the other's field of expertise so as to initiate  and enable a research program focussed on rigorous statistical  analysis of paleoclima te data generated from deep lake sediment  cores.  Statistician Mike West will become familiar with the  methods used to select sediments core sites for paleoclimatic  analysis, the various methods of geochemical analysis of sediment  cores (and notably the limitations of age assignment to sediments  as a result of various natural processes such as erosion and  redeposition, bioturbation, diagenesis and laboratory  contamination), calibration of carbon dating assessments, and  current methods of time series analysis used in paleoclimatology.   Geologist Tom Johnson will become familiar with the capabilities  and pitfalls of statistical methods, especially methods of time  series analysis that are currently used in this area, and gain  appreciation of the consequences for  uncertainty assessment in  geochronology.  The investigators anticipate eventual development  of Bayesian methods in statistical calibration at the various  stages of the experimental process, and resulting time series  analysis in assessing cyclical variability in calibrated records.   Both investigators will also become familiar with the statistical  issues and methods of calibration of 14C dates (together with  associated uncertainty assessments) to calendar dates, and with  the recent development of advanced statistical methods in the   field.       This project will eventually lead to focussed research  efforts in developing Bayesian statistical models and methods  appropriate for all stages of the experimental process in  sediment based paleoclimatology, and that will ultimately apply  in other geological and archaeological arenas.  Most  optimistically, it is hoped that this collaboration will seed the  development of an internationally recognised centre for the  statistical analysis of paleoclimate proxy records at Duke  University.  ***",
