 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in computational mathematics have revolutionized the  variety and the nature of problems that can be addressed by  environmental scientists and engineers.  To fully exploit these  advances, we must develop students who have computational as well  as environmental domain expertise.  We propose  a training  program  emphasizing graduate study of advanced computational  techniques applied to complex problems in environmental science  and engineering.  The focal point of this program is  computational environmental science and engineering will be a  radically different approach to the solution of complex  engineering problems:  multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).   MDO is founded on advances in numerical optimization, parallel  computation, and information technology for collaborate work.   MDO will allow environmental scientists and engineers to  collaborate within the context of one or more objectives that  apply to the project as a whole, but that may be unattainable or  unclear within the context of each subtask.  This capability is  critical to the resolution of environmental problems which are  typically multidisciplinary and multiobjective.    The training program will draw on faculty in the departments of  Environmental Science and Engineering.  Computational and Applied  Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics.  These departments  have a substantial history of cooperation and the faculty  involved in the program are internationally recognized as leaders  in their respective areas.",
