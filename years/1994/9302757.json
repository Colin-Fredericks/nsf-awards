 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302757  Starmer       This project will investigate the genetic basis of female  egg laying behavior in conjunction with the performance of her  offspring in a well studied species of Drosophila (D. buzzatii).   Females of this species are known to display different  preferences for laying their eggs on different microorganisms  (yeasts) in the laboratory and in the field.  These preferences  are at least partly under genetic influence.  Understanding the  benefits of the mother's preferences to the offspring could  explain several important aspects of evolutionary ecology such as  1) the maintenance of genetic diversity, 2) the evolution of  host-specialization and 3) the origin of species.%%%       Experiments will compare female egg laying behavior to the  performance of her larvae with attention to both environmental  and genetic aspects.  Four distinct strains of D. buzzatii  representing independent genetically determined egg laying  responses to yeast species that grow in the natural habitat will  be used.  The experiments are designed to approximate the  biological  situation as we know it from extensive field studies.   Interpretations  about genetically based behavior should be  useful to basic biology, evolutionary ecology, applied aspects of  conservation biology and biological control of insect pests.  ***",
