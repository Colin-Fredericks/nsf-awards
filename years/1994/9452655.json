 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental scientists must be able to synthesize diverse  information about the biological, chemical, and physical attributes  of perturbed ecosystems.  We propose to train students broadly in  the environmental sciences to produce professionals with the  breadth of knowledge needed to address serious and complex  environmental problems.  A single-discipline approach is inadequate  to identify, solve, and avoid environmental degradation.  Yet,  graduate programs have been slow to move beyond the traditional  boundaries of colleges and departments to develop rigorous and  comprehensive degree programs that integrate disciplines.  Our  proposed training program in environmental science will foster  integration of students, faculty, curricula, facilities, and  knowledge from two major disciplines:  Ecology and Environmental  Engineering.  Our training program will encourage the development  of integrated research efforts needed to address real-world  situations of environmental perturbation and mitigations.  We will  accomplish this with a combination of:  (1) traditional coursework  in three primary research areas (Environmental Chemistry,  Organismal Biology, and Aquatic Ecology), (2)  innovative field  training modules covering six critical subdisciplines in  environmental science, (3) in-depth instructional training for the  students, and (4) active recruitment of minority students for the  program.  We view a training grant from NSF as a major step in  coordinating the active graduate programs in environmental science  and engineering at the University of Notre Dame.",
