The meeting is called the International Conference on Cleaning, Contamination Control and the Environment for Industry, University and Government and is known colloquially as the \"Mr. Clean\" Conference.  This will be the 18th such conference which draws participants from domestic industry, government, NGO's, and universities.  The purpose of the presentation is to publicize the work that has been done at MIT under NSF sponsorship.  Potential benefits include (1) attracting industrial co-sponsorship of the research thereby leveraging the initial investment by NSF, (2) technology transfer, and (3) enhancing NSF's stature in the environmental industries.",
