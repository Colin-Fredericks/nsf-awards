 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355620  Stewart    This 3-year project provides intensive training and academic year  support for a cadre of 40 leader elementary and middle school  teachers from four districts in northwestern Washington State.   With training in Operation Physics materials, leadership training  and continuing project and district support these teachers will  provide comprehensive training and collegial support for  essentially every other K-6 teacher in these districts.  The leader  or Level-2 teachers will receive 50 days of training each year in  summer workshops, academic year workshops and scientific research  experiences.  Workshops for their peers, Level-3 teachers, will be  for two weeks in the summers.  Unusual features of the Washington  State-Op are:  university faculty from the sciences, mathematics  English and Technology will provide summer instruction and academic  year consultation to the leader teachers, there is substantial  support for the leader teachers in the form of teacher release time  for the leader teachers, the extent to which an outside evaluator  will track the project, and the extent to which the entire project  design has been driven by teachers.  Level-2 teachers will earn 36  graduate credits applicable to a Masters degree in Natural Science.   Level-3 teachers may earn 3-graduate credits for each summer with  AY follow-up.",
