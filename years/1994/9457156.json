 "awd_abstract_narration": "9457156  Mantell       The goal of this research is to develop and implement a  noncontact, nondestructive method for evaluating interlaminar  bonding during in-situ consolidation of composites.  An airborne  acousto-ultrasonic technique will be implemented in closed loop  control of tape laying.  In the early phases of this research, the  focus will be on developing a better understanding of airborne  ultrasonic waves for detecting defects in composites.  A  theoretical model relating airborne acousto-ultrasonic operating  parameters to the resulting stress wave will be developed and  experimentally validated.  The second phase of the research will  entail sensing and evaluating bond quality off line using the  proposed air contact NDE method.  Specimens of varying thickness  with an poorly bonded top most layer will be manufactured and  tested.  Nondestructive evaluation of bond strength will be  compared with mechanical tests of the bond strength.  In the final  phase, the proposed air contact NDE method will be integrated into  an existing tape laying apparatus.  Following statistical design of  experiment techniques, an empirical process model will be developed  and a closed loop control algorithm implemented.       This research is significant on several fronts.  In processing  of advanced materials via in-situ consolidation, adequate  interlaminar bonding is critical to part structural integrity.   Because cost of these materials is high, it is desirable to monitor  part quality during processing.  Defects identified during  processing can be reworked immediately as part of the process  control scheme; thereby improving yields and reducing scrap and  costs.  A noncontact method also offers portability to remote sites  and on line (during manufacture) sensing capabilities.  Moreover,  similar methodologies could be applied to other in-situ  consolidation and bonding processes.",
