 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405254  PICKLES       This research will investigate the production of new  political geographies in contemporary Bulgaria as that nation  undergoes its transition from state socialism. Key to these new  political geographies are the changing relations between  political institutions, actors, and interests operating at  different geographic scales (national/regional/local). This  includes the distribution of political powers between national,  regional, and local levels of governance. Also important for the  new Bulgarian political geographies are the different mechanisms  which are being developed at different spatial scales for  apportioning, legitimizing, and utilizing political power.  Utilizing ethnographic research techniques this research program  will develop a detailed case study of local government change in  Burgas obstina (county), Bulgaria. In-depth interviews, focus  groups, survey research, and archival sources will be used in the  research.       This research will contribute new insights into the  democratization process in Eastern Europe and will add to the  literature in both geography and political science approaches to  democratization. As a doctoral dissertation research improvement  award, this project will also provide support to enable a  promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.  ***",
