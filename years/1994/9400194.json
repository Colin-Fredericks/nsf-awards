Ten undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in  \"Applied Demographic Research on Migration\" for two months in the  Summer, 1994.  These students, supervised by a project team of  professional demographers, will focus their research efforts on  the study of migration profiles and analytical models.  A variety  of data files, including the Public Use Microdata Sample, the  1990 STF's and the Cumulative General Social Survey, will serve  as primary data sources for the students.  The program will  include an ethics component featuring a two-day workhop with  outstanding ethicists focussing on ethical issues in demography  and in student research projects.      This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
