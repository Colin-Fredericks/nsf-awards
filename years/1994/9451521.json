 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451521  Tenney  The project will use computers to support and enhance the  laboratory component of general chemistry to make the subject more  relevant and current. The equipment needed for this proposal  consists of eight data acquisition and processing workstations. The  data acquisition and processing workstations will be used in  experiments involving real time measurements of thermochemistry,  phase transitions, electrochemistry, pH and potentiometric  titrations, chemical kinetics, and oscillating reactions. Using  graphical analyses of those data, the student can infer functional  relationships among the measured quantities without the tedium of  repetitive measurements. Focus will be placed on interpreting and  analyzing results. Students will be expected as the course  progresses to write their own programs to acquire and analyze their  data. The proposed hardware and software has been used in the  physical chemistry and the instrumental laboratories for three  years. Fully using computer technology in the general chemistry  should not only increase the number of students who succeed but  also produce students with improved critical reasoning, graphical  analysis, and problem solving skills.",
