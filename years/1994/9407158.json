 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407158  Roeder    This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research in \"Development of Guidelines for Heat  Straightening\" is between Dr. Charles Roeder of the University of Washington and Dr.  Henryk Zobel Warsaw Polytechnic University.  Plastic deformations occur when metals are  subjected to a stress or a thermal gradient at elevated temperatures.  This deformation is  commonly used in the heat straightening or heat curving method to repair damage or reduce  initial curvature in the member.  Though such deformations are of considerable importance,  they are poorly understood.  This lack of understanding results in limited use (and, in some  cases, misuse) of the heat straightening method.  With a rational understanding of the  method, engineers will be able to predict (1) the members suitable for straightening; (2) the  deformation resulting from heating; (3) the required location and quantity of heating; and (4)  the number and sequence of heat applications.  Such estimates now are made by experienced  metalworkers, whose estimates are highly variable and often grossly inaccurate.  This  proposal seeks to extend the existing understanding of heat straightening.  The Polish P.I.  will draw on recent practical experience in using heat straightening to repair bridges in  Poland, and theoretical experience in developing an empirical model for predicting the  behavior of the model.  The American P.I. has had extensive research experience with  thermal effects and the heat straightening method.  He has performed many experiments and  a wide range of temperature-dependent inelastic analyses.  Ultimately, the researchers hope  to develop practical guidelines to use and control heat straightening and verification of  guidelines through monitoring several actual straightening projects.      This proposed research in civil engineering fulfills the program objectives of advancing  science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas  of strong mutual interest and competence.  ##",
