Pultruded products are noted for high fiber volume contents relative to products are noted for high fiber volume contents relative to products made by alternative composite processes making them materials of choice in many structural applications.  The well established thermoset technology, which represents nearly the entire current commercial market, is limited to product geometries of constant cross section relative to the linear machine direction with not opportunity for subsequent reforming.  Thermoplastic pultrusion technology, while in its infancy, does allow for limited geometry reforming after primary molding, however, the cost of raw material and processing steps is severely cost prohibitive for most applications.  Such reforming capability is desirable in order to introduce flangers, offsets, and bosses for example which can provide secondary structure for load transfer and improved joint efficiency.  This research project investigates the feasibility of a thermoset pultrusin process modification which allows for continuous production of variable cross section profiles.  The feasibility of this process will be established through process modeling employing Finite Element Analysis techniques and verified through process simulation.          Commercial opportunities are numerous for both new products as well as cost reduced structures currently employing traditional fabrication and fastening methods, such as troughs, wireways, conduits, tension, members, oil well sucker rods and structural profile s.",
