 "awd_abstract_narration": "The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center  (MRSEC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolgy supports  interactive   research  in  five  interdisciplinary   groups  spanning a wide area of materials research..    The   group   investigating  microphotonic   materials   and  structures aims to explore the fundamental nature, synthesis  and properties of photonic bandgap materials, and to exploit  these  properties  for the design and fabrication  of  novel  structures  and  devices  for the creation  and  control  of  electromagnetic radiation.  The molecular and supermolecular  engineering group is developing  the chemistry and molecular  level  processing  needed  to  control  and  manipulate  the  organization of macromolecular systems with novel electronic  and  optical  properties.  The  group  investigating  phase  behavior  in the presence of quenched randomness is carrying  out experimental and theoretical studies of phase changes in  disordered  systems.  Such changes may underlie  fundamental  mechanisms in the life sciences, and may have application in  the information sciences.  The group studying the structure,  chemistry and  transport  properties  of  intercrystalline  interfaces  seeks a unified and comprehensive  understanding  of  the role of atomic-level structure, chemistry, and local  electronic  structure in determining the physical properties  of   interfaces  between  crystals.   The  fifth  group is  investigating the properties of transition metal  oxides  in  order  to  guide the development of a theory  of  correlated  systems  and  ultimately  explain  the  mechanism  of   high  temperature superconductivity.    The   MRSEC   supports   the  development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for  materials  research.  It  provides  seed  funding  for exploratory  research, and fosters research participation by  undergraduates.    The   center  is   associated  with an  educational outreach program with emphasis on attracting  and  retaining women and underrepresented minorities in materials  science.  It  also supports a science and engineering day  camp  which  is  directed toward seventh  and  eighth  grade  students  from  underrepresented  minorities.  The  center  administers an  industrial  outreach  program    The  center  currently  supports 37 senior investigators, 13 postdoctoral  research associates, 10 technicians, 39 graduate students,  and 13  undergraduates  who perform research as  summer  interns. The MRSEC is directed by Professor Marc A. Kastner.",
