 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317381  Szymkowiak    This is a collaborative project with Dr. Ian Sussex  (9317262).  Plant cells differentiate in a position-  dependent and not a lineage-dependent manner.  They must,  therefore, receive signals that inform them of their  position within the multicellular organism and differentiate  accordingly.  The nature of the signals, their origins and  how they are transmitted is largely unknown.  This  collaborative research project will address these questions  by examining how cells in the three layers of the shoot  apical meristem maintain functional coordination over the  course of meristem ontogeny.  The generation and analysis of  periclinal chimeras has demonstrated that interactions occur  among the cell layers of the meristem.  In general, the  outer two meristem layers, L1 and L2, develop in a  nonautonomous manner.  That is, cells occupying these two  layers do not develop according to their own genotype but  according to a pattern of development determined by cells in  the internal meristem layer, L3.  Cells comprising the  chimeras interact effectively both in the meristem and in  the tissues and organs generated by the meristem.  An  interesting exception occurs during floral meristem  development in certain chimeras between tomato and Solanum  nigrum.  The shoot meristems of these chimeras all function  normally during vegetative development.  Each chimera also  makes the transition from vegetative meristem to  inflorescence meristem.  However, development is arrested in  the floral meristems of four of the five cell layer  combinations generated between tomato and S. nigrum.  The  tomato-S. nigrum chimeras provide an excellent opportunity  to examine a developmental process in which cell-cell  coordination has failed, in order to learn more about the  signaling that is necessary for coordinated development.  The main objective of this collaborative project is to use  these periclinal chimeras to investigate possible mechanisms  for coordinating cell layer function in t he meristem.  To  achieve this, Drs. Szymkowiak and Sussex propose to:  (1)  determine if the arrested development of chimeric floral  meristems results from a breakdown in the coordination of  the patterns of development in each cell layer by using gene  probes specific for different stages of meristem ontogeny;  (2) investigate the role of plasmodesmata in cell layer  coordination by examining changes in plasmodesmata structure  and size exclusion limits by using dye-injection studies in  the aborting floral meristems before and during arrested  development; and (3) generate additional chimeras using  mutations that affect function in shoot meristems in order  to characterize further processes requiring cellular  interactions.  Achievement of these goals will contribute to  improved understanding of meristem organization and  function.  ***",
