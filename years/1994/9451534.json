 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451534  Chen  To offer undergraduate students hands-on laboratory experience and  to improve laboratory instrumentation for better undergraduate  education in the field of Environmental Science, we will  incorporate Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy  (ICP-AES) into curricula and offer research opportunities to  undergraduate students. ICP-AES is the ideal choice for elemental  analysis for the majority of inorganic pollutants regulated by EPA  and OSHA.  The ICP-AES workstation will greatly enhance the  undergraduate laboratory experience for students learning  instrumental methods, environmental chemistry, toxicology of heavy  metals and fate of pollutants in the environment. Specific  experiments will be conducted to maximize the use of these  workstations and to increase instruction efficiency using new  teaching methods like cooperative learning groups and rotating  workstations. Analysis of pollutants in the atmosphere, soils,  waters and sediments will be covered, so ICP-AES may be used as an  investigative tool in research and result in scholarly works with  undergraduate coauthors. Since chemistry, biology and environmental  science students will take laboratory courses using these  workstations, the project will impact a significant number of  students.",
