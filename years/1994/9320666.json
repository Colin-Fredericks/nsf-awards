 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320666  MERSHON   This collaborative project investigates how coalitions are formed  on the U.S. Supreme Court.  A particular focus is the process by  which opinions are written, often including many drafts and  various shifts in position as the doctrines that could decide a  case are debated among the members of the Court.  The proposed  research has scientific significance for two reasons. First, by  emphasizing the policies and doctrine enunciated by the Court  through its opinions, rather than simply counting votes on  winning and losing sides, the project refocuses the scientific  study of the American legal system.  Second, the project expands  the field of coalition analysis by examining an institution  composed of non-elected officials instead of legislatures and  political parties.    To test the model of opinion coalition, the project calls for the  collection of data from two sources: the official records of the  Supreme Court of the United States and the collected papers of  five justices, spanning from Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite to  Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall.  Specific information culled  from these sources includes: the policies at issue, the tentative  and final votes of the justices, the size and composition of  opinion coalitions, the number of opinion drafts, and the length  of time between votes on the merits and final opinions.  ***",
