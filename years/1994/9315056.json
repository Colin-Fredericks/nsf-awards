 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315056  Gaffey       Cementation in modern shallow-water marine carbonate sediments  is believed to be confined to the intertidal zone, restricted  environments with high salinity, and reefs and sand shoals at  platform margins.  Boring by microbial endoliths, resulting in  micritization or destruction of grains, is thought to be the  dominant diagenetic process in other shallow marine environments.   However, published studies by various workers, and preliminary work  by the investigator, indicate that significant volumes of cement  are precipitating in low to moderate energy, normal marine phreatic  environments, a fact with important implications for cycling and  storage of carbonate within protected settings.        It is also widely believed that marine cementation is largely  a physicochemical process, and that the role of microorganisms in  carbonate cementation is restricted to inducing precipitation of  carbonate by changing pH and Eh of pore waters.  However, sample  collection and preparation methods commonly used by  sedimentologists degrade or destroy organic structures, so that  their role in cementation often goes unrecognized.  The proposed  work will assess the role of chasmolithic bacteria, cyanobacteria,  and microalgae in cementation by using techniques designed to  preserve the microbial component of samples intact, and will  develop new criteria for recognition of calcified chasmoliths in  ancient sediments.       In contrast with high energy, platform margin settings,  calcification of chasmoliths rather than physicochemical  precipitation of carbonate appears to be the dominant cement-  forming process in sands from low energy marine phreatic  environments.  There also appear to be variations in cement types  and abundance between different subenvironments within low energy  settings.  the proposed work will characterize the types and  amounts of cements, and their distribution with bioclastic sands in  a low, an intermediate, and a high energy lagoon on San Salvador  Is land.  Bahamas, and relate types and distributions of cements in  these three settings to environmental factors such as sea grass  cover, wave and current energy, and degree of bioturbation.   Characterization of cement types and of their distributions in  relation to environmental factors will provide useful criteria for  interpreting early diagenetic environments of ancient shallow  marine carbonate sediments.",
