 "awd_abstract_narration": "During  development, gonadal steroids (androgens  and  estrogens)  confer  permanent  sex-specific differences  (sexual  dimorphism)  onto  the  organization and function of the  brain.  This  sexual  dimorphism in the brain, in turn, leads to production of behavior  that  is different in male and female animals. The estrogens  and  androgens act during a very specific and limited period in  early  development to induce these permanent sex-specific differences in  brain structure and in behavior. The best studied brain structure  which  is both sexually dimorphic and is known to be critical  in  mediating sex-specific behavior is the hypothalamus. We know that  much  of  the information transfer in neurons in the hypothalamus  depends  upon  the  presence of a class of proteins  called  GABA  (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. The goal of this work is  to  determine  if  androgens and estrogens act during  this  critical  period  in early development to alter the types of GABA receptors  that  are  expressed  in the hypothalamus  and  to  determine  if  steroid-dependent  changes in GABA receptor  expression  lead  to  changes  in sex-specific behaviors in adult animals. The  results  from this study may help us to understand how development in  the  brain is regulated to produce sex-specific behaviors.",
