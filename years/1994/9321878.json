Four primary  areas will be consider in this project.  The first concerns  polyharmonic interpolations continuous functions on C-1 curves in  the boundary of the unit ball.  The second area focuses on a  unique continuation property and weak Hopf lemma for holomorphic  mappings from the plane to higher dimensional spaces.  Also, work  will be done on an extremal problems about hulls and spheres in  complex two-dimensional space.  Finally, an investigation of  the disc-hull and other properties of hulls which arise by a  linking process will be taken up.  Special emphasis will be  placed on studying the ball of the Lagrangian disc of  Duval.Several complex variables arose at the beginning of  the century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of  one complex variable.  It became clear early on that the  theory differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying  geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory  had far more affinity with partial differential operators of  first order.  It thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep  characteristics of differential geometry and differential  equations.  Many of the fundamental structures were defined in  the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on  understanding these basic mathematical forms.  ***",
