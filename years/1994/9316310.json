 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316310  Faure  This award supports acquisition of exposure ages of rocks in the  Dry Valleys regions in order to determine when the Transantarctic  Mountains were last overridden by the East Antarctic Ice Sheet  and to help resolve competing hypotheses about the Pliocene  history of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This project will date  the exposure of quartz on the summits of the highest peaks in the  Transantarctic Mountains of southern Victoria Land by measuring  10Be and 26Al which form by cosmic ray bombardment of quartz.  The geological  interpretation of these dates is based on the assumption that the  highest peaks in southern Victoria Land were covered during the  last full transgression of the ice sheet and then, as the ice  receded, the mountains were exposed and parts have been exposed  ever since.  Consequently, by measuring exposure ages on the  sides of several mountains, this project will construct an  exposure history that will be interpreted as a record of ice  sheet recession.  The dates produced by this project will help to  resolve the controversy about the Sirius Formation and will  address some questions about the stability of the East Antarctic  ice sheet.  ***",
