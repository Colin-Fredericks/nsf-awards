 "awd_abstract_narration": "Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) is a 3,487 ha.  tallgrass prairie preserve 15km south of the Kansas State  University campus that is owned by The Nature Conservancy  and managed by the Division of Biology.  Over 80 projects,  involving 14 Departments and 5 colleges on campus and dozens  of researchers from off campus, are being conducted on the  site, with current extramural funding of almost $6,000,000.  Current facilities include a large stone ranch house and  barn, a small laboratory, 30 km of fencing, 17 km of  maintained gravel roads, a 16.4 km bison enclosures and  bison handling facility, and fire management equipment for  the experimental burn treatments imposed on the site (which  requires 61 km of maintained fire guards).  Over 90% of the  research on the site resolves around the bison or fire  experimental manipulations, or the 5,000 ft2 behavioral  research facility in the loft of the barn.  Research on  KPRNA has grown significantly in the last decade and the  site has reached its carrying capacity with the current  facilities.  Therefore, KPRNA has embarked on a three phase  development plan that includes I) producing a long range  Master Plan, II) stabilizing and renovating the existing  facilities and equipment, and III) constructing a new  laboratory and living quarters for visiting scientists.    This proposal is to complete Phase II - specifically, to  construct new bison handling facilities, upgrade our fire  management capabilities, and to renovate an existing  behavioral research space.  The new facilities will allow  effective and safe handling of the bison, and the fire  management equipment will enhance our ability to conduct  prescribed burns and fight unwanted fires.  The behavioral  research facility will be renovated with new support columns  for the loft and new flooring.  Concurrently, matching funds  will be used to upgrade the other equipment and facilities  on the site, especially the stone house, which is used by  scientists for offices, sleeping qu arters, and meeting  areas.  The completion of Phase II is critical to increasing  research capacity, and allowing a move to the next level of  development and productivity.",
