 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9318419  Heyman    A widely shared, basic idea in economics and related  disciplines is that choice is best described as rational  decision-making in which gains are maximized and losses  minimized (an optimizing strategy). However, the results of  the actual decisions made by organisms often differ from the  calculations of rational decision theory.  In many  experiments, these deviations appear to be the result of the  operation of some other set of rules than those of rational  decision theory.  One competing theory, based on  experimental studies, is a special case of a general  psychological principle known as \"matching.\" Experimental  results supporting matching seem to contradict both rational  choice theory and common sense. However, the empirical and  theoretical relationships between matching and rational  choice theory have yet to be clearly described, and recent  data suggest a possible synthesis.  The purpose of this  research will be to explore this synthesis.    A number of studies indicate that how individuals  \"calculate\" the costs and benefits of their choices is an  important factor in determining matching vs. optimizing.  When subjects calculate costs and benefits in terms of the  current status of each alternative taken separately, they  match. When they calculate costs and benefits in terms of  the joint contribution of each alternative, treating each  source of reward as a component of a larger unit, they  optimize. Thus, the question of whether individuals match or  optimize can be restated as which \"bookkeeping\" rule is in  effect. Experiments will be carried out during which  matching and maximizing predict different patterns of  behavior, producing data that will reveal the conditions  under which subjects learn to maximize or learn to match.  Implicit in this approach is the idea that it should be  possible to discover a yet more general behavioral rule, one  that predicts which choice strategy is in effect. A  practical implication of this research is that it sho uld  show how to frame choice situations so that individuals will  choose optimally. This question is especially relevant to  issues involving self-control, for example, overeating and  addiction.",
