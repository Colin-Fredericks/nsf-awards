 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400587  Cohen       F.R. Cohen intends to consider problems in classical  homotopy theory and offshoots to other subjects involving  cohomology of discrete groups, certain moduli spaces, and a  further study of the Whitehead square.  One of the main projects  is to extend his recent partial solution of M.G. Barratt's finite  exponent conjecture to the general case.  He intends to continue  an analysis of the groups appearing in this work together with  their connections with other parts of mathematics involving  classical homotopy theory and their connections to certain moduli  spaces.  He will continue his study of the Whitehead square  involving an interplay between Cayley-Dickson algebras and spaces  of rational functions.  F.R. Cohen and S. Gitler will continue  joint work in a study of characteristic classes for spaces of  embeddings which are implicit in their earlier work and which are  related to invariants of knots defined by Vassiliev.       This project is a study of how large dimensional spheres  can be wrapped around smaller dimensional objects at least up  to continuous deformations.  This type of geometric problem  occurs ubiquitously in mathematics and other related areas such  as physics.  Some of the basic structure is given by the  geometric and algebraic consequences of particles which move on a  surface and which are parametrized by a time coordinate.  At  various times, the particles may return to their original  position.  The algebraic analogue of this geometric property is  known as torsion.  Bounds on the growth of torsion for various  naturally occurring spaces which are analogues of surfaces is one  of the main subjects of this project.  One goal of this work is  an attack on an outstanding problem in the subject known as  Barratt's finite exponent conjecture.  A second and unexpected  offshoot is that this work overlaps with work of some others who  are interested in physics.   ***",
