This equipment and the mobility of  such computers are providing students in various courses such as  calculus, pre-calculus, college algebra, geometry, and mathematics  for elementary teachers the hands on experience of using computers  in the area of mathematics. Students have an opportunity to  experience the vastness of mathematical knowledge and have an  in-depth look at mathematics at its best. Students see the changes  of graphs at their fingertips, are able to explore problems more  easily without the complications of numerical manipulation, and  experience the use of the computer in mathematics teaching which is  important for students going into the education field.",
