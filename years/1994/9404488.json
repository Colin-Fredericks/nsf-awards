 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404488  Meade    The proposer will develop accurate and efficient numerical  solution procedures for problems arising from the scattering of  electromagnetic waves by an inhomogeneous body. The natural  domain for these problems is unbounded --- the exterior of the  scatterer.  This work will identify approximate reformulations of  the problem on a bounded domain which can be solved by Galerkin  methods, in particular the finite element method.  The general  idea is to truncate the unbounded domain through the selection of  an appropriate artificial boundary and a corresponding boundary  condition.  An exact boundary condition can be used, but its  non-local temporal and/or spatial dependence is an obstacle to  efficient numerical computations.  The primary objective of this  project is to find approximate boundary conditions which are  defined locally, can be implemented numerically, and yield  accurate approximations to the exact solution of the scattering  problem.  A major challenge will be to develop the mathematical  tools which can be used to balance the competing constraints of  computational complexity and the different approximation errors.    When an electromagnetic signal hits an obstacle, one portion of  the wave continues into the object while another part of the wave  is reflected back into the surrounding medium.  The goal of this  project is to devise accurate and efficient numerical algorithms  for determining the different components of the electromagnetic  wave.  The mathematical statement of this problem involves the  solution of partial differential equations on an unbounded  domain.  The fact that the domain is infinite complicates the  search for an efficient numerical solution of this problem.  The  purpose of this research is to identify approximate  reformulations of the problem which can be solved numerically  without significantly degrading the quality of the computed  solution.  Initial studies will be directed towards the  two-dimensional scalar problem.  The ulti mate objective is to be  able to solve the vector-valued problem in three-dimensional  space.  The numerical solution will call for the solution of a  system of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of equations.  For this reason, the proposer will be developing codes which can  be used on high-performance parallel computers.  The results from  this project can also be applied in a variety of other  applications, including interface problems in elasticity and the  scattering of acoustic, seismic, and water waves.",
