Changes in energy use in rapidly growing cities of  Asia may have especially strong impacts on future emissions of  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  This doctoral dissertation  research project will assess the ways that human activities alter  chemical and energy flows to and from the landscape and  atmosphere in Cebu City, a rapidly growing industrial center in  the southern Philippines.  A household energy-use study will be  conducted in about 600 households, with particular attention  focusing on transitions from use of biomass to fossil fuels.  The  data from these surveys will be analyzed in concert with data on  commercial fossil fuel use in order to better assess the socio-  economic factors that influence fuels used for different kinds of  activities.  These analyses will contribute toward development of  integrated energy and trace-gas emissions models for Asian-  Pacific cities.       This project will provide valuable new information about a  representative industrial city in the Philippines, focusing  special attention on changing patterns of energy use that impact  on biological and atmospheric systems.  In addition to providing  a useful case study dealing with an important topic, the  add  dissertation end statement.  ***",
