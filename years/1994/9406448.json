The purpose of this project is to examine the  mechanisms involved in the production and transmission of  opportunities for such migration in one of the world's largest  exporters of labor, the Philippines. Opportunities for labor  migration are produced through institutional actions in the form  of emigration policies at the national level and then transmitted  to communities and individuals through recruiting agencies, mass  media sources, and social networks. The research will be based  largely on structured interviews, undertaken in the Philippines,  of key individuals in government, umbrella organizations, and  private recruitment agencies. This information will be  supplemented with secondary information collected in the  Philippines which will be used to further explain the production  and transmission of overseas opportunities.       This research will make significant contributions to our  understanding of the international migration of contract labor,  an important source of contact between developing and developed  countries and an important source of capital for developing  countries. As a doctoral dissertation research improvement award,  this award will also provide support to enable a promising  srudent to establish a strong independent research career.  ***",
