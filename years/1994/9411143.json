 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411143  Veas  Coastal Carolina University  The photochromism of 1,3,5-triphenylformazan (TPF) (or a-Phenylazo-a-phenylhydrazonotoluene) and its derivatives will be studied in solution and the feasibility of the use of this compound to determine structural characteristics of polymers will be explored. UV/Visible and infrared spectra of TPF will be complemented with calculations to understand the photochromism process. Synthetic methods to incorporate photochromic TPF derivatives into polymers will be explored as well.     This grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Nina Veas at Coastal Carolina University in the form of a Research Planning Grant. A molecules that changes color upon irradiation with ultraviolet light will be studied to determine the mechanism of this process, which is called photochromism. Computational methods will be employed as an aid in the determination of the mechanism of photochromism. This molecule and its derivatives will also be used to determine the structure of polymers by means of photochromism.",
