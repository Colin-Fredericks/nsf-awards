We have a  dual goal in mind.  First, we seek to provide experimentalists with  a conceptual framework and effective strategies to be exploited in  the experimental dissection of site-specific effects.  Second, we  seek to bring the analysis of cooperative effects in biology to a  whole new level by unraveling the thermodynamic foundations of the  behavior of subsystems open to interactions with other subsystems.   This is a basic problem in statistical thermodynamics which remains  in largest measure unformulated and unexplored, due to its  mathematical complexity.  Without a thermodynamic treatment of  local effects, our understanding of the most exciting and  challenging problems in biology, such as cooperativity, molecular  recognition and protein folding, will remain necessarily  incomplete.   %%%  Our project entails the development of a theory for interacting  systems in biology.  The goal is to understand the detailed basis  for protein-ligand and protein-protein recognition in terms of a  novel conceptual framework.  Protein-mediated molecular recognition  is a crucial step in nearly every aspect of biology, as well as in  the onset, propagation and control of diseases at the molecular  level.  The developments under the proposed research project will  provide us with a much deeper understanding of how proteins work.   This will eventually foster the developments of new strategies for  the control of diseases at the pharmacological level.    ***",
