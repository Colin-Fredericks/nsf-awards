 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312149  Tickamyer    This project supports dissertation research of Ms. Siti  Kusujiarti under the direction of Dr. Ann R. Tickamyer,  Department of Sociology, University of Kentucky, and subsequent  collaborative research on hidden power in gender relations among  Indonesians, for a period of 24 months.  Gender relations and  power negotiations in daily relations in 48 couples in two  villages in Java, Indonesia, will be investigated by intensive  interviewing and observation.  This study will focus on 5  household activities: household chores, reproduction, production,  financial matters, and social activities analyzing who has power,  how it is negotiated, and the \"hidden transcripts\" which hide  latent conflict.    This research has both theoretical and practical social  significance.  Theoretically, it provides a comparative view of  how power is conceptualized and manifested in gender relations  among the Javanese people.  Gender ideology plays a central role  as the foundation of women's government programs and in defining  the characteristics of women's involvement in these programs.   Thus, this research has great practical significance for the  course of Indonesian development and for understanding how the  development process benefits women.  The PI is a highly respected  researcher in the field of this proposal.  She is fortunate in  having as a graduate student and, later, as a postdoctoral  collaborator an Indonesian woman with a thorough knowledge of the  culture and acceptability, as an insider, to those whose  relations will be studied.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the East Asia and Pacific Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and  engineers and their counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region  through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  ***",
