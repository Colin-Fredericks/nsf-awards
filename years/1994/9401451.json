Robinson and their students will continue  their investigation of rigid subanalytic and semianalytic sets  (i.e. subanalytic and semianalytic sets over an algebraically  closed field which is complete with respect to a non-Archimedean  absolute value).  This investigation will entail further work on  the algebra and geometry of the rings of separated power series.   Among other topics, they will investigate unique factorization,  uniformization, Stein factorization, the singular locus theorem,  and sheaf theory over these rings.  Methods to be used will be  nonstandard models and quantifier elimination from mathematical  logic, together with techniques from commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry.       The sets of points in real space defined by systems of  equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called  analytic sets.  The projection (i.e. the shadow) of such a set on  a lower dimensional subspace is called subanalytic.  Real  subanalytic sets arise in several branches of mathematics, such  as differential equations and geometry.  Similar classes of sets  arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields  different from the real numbers, where the notion of distance has  rather different properties.  These sets, however, share many of  the nice properties of their real cousins.  Lipshitz, Robinson  and their students will continue their investigation of the  properties of these sets, using methods from mathematical logic,  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  ***",
