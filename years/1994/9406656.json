 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406656  Bullesbach  Structurally related proteo-hormones of the insulin family consist  of the parent hormone insulin, the hormone of pregnancy relaxin,  and invertebrate developmental factors (i.e, bombyxin, isolated  from the brains of the silk worm) and growth factors (i,e.,  molluscan insulin-related peptide, isolated from the pond snail).   The wide variety of biological functions inherent in essentially  the same three-dimensional structure implies that the biological  function of this family of proteins depends primarily on the side  chain distribution.  It is the ultimate aim of this proposal to  find the surface features that are crucial for the diverse  biological functions of the insulin family of hormones.  The  initial step of this investigation involves the chemical synthesis  of these factors and of defined analogs.  The syntheses are based  upon a novel approach, the site directed disulfide-bond formation,  which has been highly successful in the synthesis of insulin-like  structures.  Investigation of the physical chemical and biological  properties of the analogs by comparison with natural factors will  give insight into the structure-function relationships within this  important family of hormones.  The long-term goal of these studies is a better understanding of  the mode of action of hormones and the subsequent design and  synthesis of mimetics.  Such mimetics of hormones involved in  invertebrate maturation may improve our ability to control insects  by environmentally acceptable means, i.e., by suppressing or  arresting the development of a specific pest.  ***",
