 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419696  Bielak  This action is to support a workshop to address the use of  advanced computer architectures for the solution of large-scale  problems in geotechnical earthquake engineering and strong ground  motion seismology, including the application of visualization and  animation techniques.  The workshop is to be held in the Fall of  1994.    The workshop will convene selected researchers and practitioners  from academia, industry and government to exchange information  and ideas,  and to provide broad guidelines for the use of this  technology.    With the advent of supercomputers, earthquake engineers and  seismologists have begun to address, mainly with the help of  vector multiprocessors, problems of great practical interest,  such as the three-dimensional analysis of the seismic response of  earthdams and alluvial basins.  Anticipated increases in raw  computing power over the next five years will not be sufficient  for the successful understanding and prediction of the earthquake  response of large systems, unless simultaneous advances are made  in physical modeling, numerical approximations, parallel  algorithms, and software tools for the new generation of high  performance parallel systems.    Another important aspect of the computational process, which is  shared by engineering activities such as field and laboratory  experiments, is the need to process and understand vast amounts  of numerical data.  In recent years advanced visualization and  animation techniques have been developed to assist in analyzing  and interpreting these large numerical data sets.  Thus this  workshop will discuss these evolving trends associated with the  use of advanced computer architectures and visualization  techniques as applied to earthquake hazard mitigation.  ***",
