It will trace multiple  paths of children's construction of addition, subtraction, place  value, and problem solving understanding within primary school  classrooms that contain social, material, linguistic, and cultural  supports for such construction.  Teaching studies will be carried  out in cooperation with teachers of English-speaking and Spanish-  speaking classrooms to discover culturally relevant conceptual and  social supports that facilitate children's mathematical thinking in  the specified areas.  The project will also focus on ways to invole  low-literacy parents of poor urban Latino children in supporting  their children's mathematical thinking at home and in school.  The  results will involve developing theories in four areas:  tenstructured methods of single-digit addition and subtraction like  those used so effectively by Asian children, multidigit and place-  value thinking, word problem solving, and classroom conceptual  supports for children's mathematical thinking.  The resulting  improved theories, as well as the descriptions and analyses of  individual children's learning, will provide a basis for large-  scale teacher development and school change activities in urban  schools.  The results will also contribute to our understanding of  all children's thinking in these mathematical areas.  ***",
