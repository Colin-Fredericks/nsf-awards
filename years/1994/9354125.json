 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354125  SubbaRao    Lincoln University will develop strategies to increase the number  of minority students who enter science, engineering and  mathematics (SEM) fields. The proposed approach will develop  strategies to assist minority students at critical stages in  their academic life. For example, a variety of intervention  activities at the pre-college, community college, 4-year college  and graduate school levels would be utilized to prepare, motivate  and encourage several hundred urban minority students to pursue  advanced degrees in SEM. Special attention will be paid to  developing strategies that enhance recruitment, retention and  graduation rates.    A key component of the proposed effort will establish  partnerships and articulation agreements with regional community  colleges, secondary schools, and with majority universities  involving faculty exchange and collaboration, student support,  student enrichment activities, and facilitation of transfer to  and from Lincoln University. Lincoln University plans to improve  its SEM curriculum to make it more challenging, exciting,  relevant, and to explore the possibility of introducing new  programs, while at the same time, designing activities to enhance  the teaching skills and methods of SEM faculty; improving  faculty/student research capabilities; renovating and expanding  laboratory space and equipment for teaching and research, as well  as establishing multimedia capability. Finally, the project  develops strategies to involve government agencies, private  foundations, and corporations in strengthening SEM programs and  the infrastructure at Lincoln University.",
