 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides funds to establish a National Science Foundation \"Research  Experiences for Undergraduate\" site in southeast Wisconsin.  Eight highly qualified  undergraduates will be recruited to conduct research, at the Biomedical Research  Institute laboratories on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.  Based upon extensive experiences with undergraduate research together with active  research programs, faculty representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory Biology  will serve as potential project supervisors.  This program is designed to develop each  participant's intellectual confidence, technical competence and research independence via    1.   Guidance and daily nurturing by active researchers in the areas of Molecular and       Regulatory Biology whose primary emphasis is working with undergraduates.  2.   A program of specific goals for each student's research progress via a meeting and       seminar schedule plus instruction in literature search and seminar presentation       techniques complementary to each project including faculty-led discussions of       relevant, current literature.  3.   Leveraging of the NSF effort through a commitment to support additional       students each summer and/or to carry over meritorious students for a second       summer of research using internal funding.  4.   Aggressive regional and in some cases national recruitment of superior candidates       with special efforts to attract underrepresented groups plus housing arrangements       proximate to the UWP laboratories, and,   5.   Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU experience.",
