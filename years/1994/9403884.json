The structures  of interest are induced by  individual characteristics like (chronological or class) age,  size, location etc.  A particular goal is to identify those  structures the introduction of which into a previously  unstructured model changes the dynamical behavior of the model  solutions.  Specifically, he examines the influence of class age  and chronological age on models of endemic diseases, the impact  of body size structure on populations of zoo-plankton, and  evolutionary aspects in structured metapopulation models.   Mathematically, the introduction of population structure  typically converts small systems of ordinary differential  equations into large systems of ODEs or into integral,  integro-differential, functional differential or partial  differential equations.  These equations are studied as evolution  equations (dynamical systems) in an appropriate Banach space,  which typically is infinite dimensional or has a large finite  dimension.  The study uses methods of linear and nonlinear  functional analysis and dynamical systems theory.  While  establishing existence and uniqueness is a necessary and often  not trivial step, the focus is on studying the qualitative  behavior of solutions addressing stability, damped and undamped  oscillations, persistence, and permanence.         In order to interpret, forecast, manage and control the  dynamics of microbial, plant, animal and human populations it is  necessary to understand the interaction between inherent  population structures (as given by age, body size, location etc.)  and population development.  The investigator develops  mathematical concepts and tools to formulate and analyze  appropriate models for this interdependence.  Particular points  of interests are how population structure affects stability,  resilience, persistence and extinction of populations; fu rther,  how to interpret population data in terms of individual  well-being.  The latter is relevant, e.g., for the use of  micro-organisms in testing detergents.  Important examples of  structured populations are structured metapopulations.  Many  populations live in a patchy environment, leading to the  formation of local populations that often go extinct and are  recolonized by individuals immigrating from other local  populations.  The number of populations forming metapopulations  of the above kind increases because the formerly continuous  habitats of many species are fragmented.  Metapopulation dynamics  are important issues in conservation biology and re-establishment  of naturally extinct species.",
