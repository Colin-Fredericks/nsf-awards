 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354528  Potter  There is widespread and growing agreement that very serious  problems exist in the introductory courses in all science  disciplines. Many of the factors at the root of the problems in  these courses have only recently been identified by researchers in  cognitive psychology and science education. We believe that most of  the problems with introductory science courses and the  \"non-calculus\" introductory physics course in particular, stem  directly from the way in which instructors conceptualize the  teaching and learning process.  The goal of this proposal is to  construct and fully implement a new introductory physics course  which will replace the standard \"non-calculus\" course at UC Davis.  The model we are proposing is grounded in the direct implications  for instruction that are emerging which support a constructivist  theory of how learning and conceptual understanding actually  develops in an individual student. The course will by necessity  have to be taught within the constraints normally found at large  universities and so will serve as a viable model for other  institutions.  The objectives of this proposal are to transform the  traditional non-calculus introductory physics course into a  constructivist based course, to produce instructor and TA training  materials in constructivist methodologies, to produce a student  textbook along course lines, and to give support and guidance to  other institutions desiring to make these changes. The expected  outcomes include an increase in student conceptual understanding  and appreciation of physics, an increase in math and critical  thinking skills in students, and a pedagogically appropriate model  of a science course for pre-service teachers.",
