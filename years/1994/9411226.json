 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two major cell types that form the nervous system are  neurons and glial cells.  Genesis of glial and neuronal  cells, their differentiation and maturation in developing  nervous system are thought to be controlled by proteins  (growth factors) expressed at individual developmental  stages.  Controlled expression of growth factors may also  underlie the plasticity that occurs in the adult nervous  system during learning or regeneration of nervous tissue  (stimulation of cells).  Aberrant expression of growth  factors has been implicated in the transformation of normal  glial cells to tumorigenic glioma cells.  Hence, to  understand development, adult plasticity of the nervous  tissue, and tumorigenic transformation it is essential to  elucidate mechanisms that control expression of genes  encoding growth factor proteins.  One such protein is basic  fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).  Elucidation of the  mechanisms controlling expression of the gene that encodes  the bFGF protein is of the highest priority.  Very little is  known about regulation of this protein which is critical for  neural and glial development and plasticity.   The PI's have  revealed that expression of the BFGF gene is transiently  increased during reversible transition of quiescent  (nondividing) glial cells to reactive (actively dividing)  glia.  Such reversible activation of glia is thought to play  a role in neural development and in the  support of adult neural plasticity. The PI has also shown  that expression of the bFGF gene is permanently increased in  irreversibly transformed tumorigenic glioma cells.  In both  cases increased expression of bFGF gene was responsible for  the changes in the biology of glia (transient and permanent  induction of cell proliferation).  The overall aim of this  project is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying  the above-mentioned changes in bFGF gene expression.  The  analysis of the bFGF gene has indicated that there are  fundamental differences in the mechanisms by which t his gene  is regulated as compared to other genes, and that novel  mechanisms are involved in the regulation of bFGF gene.  Identification of those mechanisms will lead to a better  understanding of the molecular events controlling the  biology of glial cells in the developing and adult nervous  system.",
