The objectives of the A-ASTRA project are:  to  enhance the teaching of astronomy in elementary and secondary  schools, to provide astronomy workshops to elementary and  secondary teachers using hands-on astronomy activities, to  encourage the professionalism of the participants, and to  increase interactions among professional astronomers, science  educators, and elementary/secondary school teachers.    For each of three summers, twenty-five participants at each of  three geographical diverse sites will interact with the primary  instructional staff of professional astronomers, astronomy  educators, and master teachers.  The institute will use  instructional materials (many of which were developed with NSF  funds) to model the teaching of hands-on astronomy concepts, will  offer instruction in workshop presentations skills, and provide  astronomical research or educational experiences unique to each  site.  These activities may include presentation of current  research topics by area astronomers, field trips, and various  observing/research experiences.  The sites (and site directors)  are:  Loyola University of Chicago (David Slavsky), Northern  Arizona University (Kathleen DeGioia-Eastwood), and the  University of Maryland (John Trasco).  Each site will have a  leadership team consisting of the site director and two teachers  from previous NSF astronomy programs.  These teacher consultants  will share their experiences in presenting workshops and  classroom applications of the materials.  Concerns about  identifying topics suitable for different ages and presenting  workshops to teachers of various grade levels will be addressed.   Thematic instructional materials that relate concepts from  several science fields (integrated science) to astronomy provide  the core of the su mmer institute.    An advisory board consists of the nine members of the AAS  Education Advisory Board and two elementary/secondary teachers.   Publicity about the program, selection of candidates, general  program organization, and evaluation will be coordinated at the  national level through the AAS Education Office.  The PI will be  involved not only in program organization, but also in the  instruction phase at each site, especially in the methodology of  workshops.    Following their participation, the teachers will become associate  members of the AAS and attend an AAS meeting in the following  summer.  At the meeting, they will report on their own  experiences, both in the classroom and in the peer-led workshops  they presented.  They will attend sessions especially designed       for them to learn about the latest research in astronomy and will  have the opportunity to exchange ideas with many astronomers at  the meeting.    An outside evaluation team will assess the program through  examination of instructional materials, interviews with   participants, sampling of those attending peer-led workshops, and  written evaluation instruments.  Members of the instructional  team will attend a sample of the peer-led workshops in order to  access their content and pedagogical integrity.    The participating teachers will each present at least four  workshops which are expected to attract 6,000 teachers of 180,000  children per year.  ***",
