 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year Small Grant for Exploratory Research in the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Mark   Meyerhoff at the University of Michigan, and is focused on the   development of porphyrin-based stationary phases for the separation of   members of the fullerene family of compounds. The separation   characteristics of the porphyrin phases will be altered by changing the   identity of the metal ion located within the porphyrin ring, and by   electrochemically controlling the oxidation state of the metal center.    Other potential applications include polyaromatic hydrocarbon analyses   and peptide separations.    In recent years, a new type of chemistry has been developed based on the   discovery of the fullerenes.  These are compounds with a framework based   only on carbon atoms and which have symmetrical structures, for example,   the soccer ball-shaped C60.  These compounds show a great deal of promise   as new materials with unique properties, e.g., lubricants.  This   research, supported by the Chemistry Division, will allow these new   materials to be characterized in much more detail.  These studies will   potentially allow for the isolation of large quantities of these unique   species, which is critical for the development of new materials based on   these compounds.",
