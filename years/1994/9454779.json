 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454779  Bunderson    This is a research project to delineate a set of new roles in a  flexibly reproducible, differentiated staffing pattern for  elementary schools.  Role delineation (or job analysis) is an  essential specification step in producing designs, plans and  materials for technology transfer.  The subject matter to be  transferred is the masterful use of technology in teaching,  individual study and project-centered education.  Technologies of  interest include digital multimedia and networking technologies,  for use in both teacher-centered group environments and  learner-centered labs.  Expertise in the set-up, masterful use,  maintenance and trouble-shooting of computers and  telecommunications software and links does not exist in schools as  presently organized.  It is probably not possible for busy,  multiply-tasked school personnel in current roles to add new  technical tasks, even with limitless training.  Instead, people  with different specialized technical, teaching, and administrative  roles must be trained and recruited along with magnifying the  capabilities of current teachers in order to gain the remarkable  benefits possible through the effective use of technology.    The fundamental research problem is that conventional job-analysis  methodologies apply to established jobs not to new jobs/roles that may  exist by analogy in science, engineering and business settings, but not  in schools.  Thus a revised methodology emphasizing synthesis for  communication and specification, not just analysis, which in any case  must assume jobs that are constant enough to be analyzed, is introduced  in this study.    Objectives and Their Significance:    1. To delineate through an experimental methodology for job  analysis/synthesis the inter-related roles of teachers. administrators.  supporting professional specialists, and technical support personnel as  they may be established in technology-intensive leaning environments.    2. To develop publications, presentations, and instruc tional systems  using multiple forms of media, especially visual media, as a means of  communicating these new roles and functions in relation to several  prototypical technology configurations.  These visual materials and  supporting detail will serve in technology transfer plans. They will also  include research-based design specifications for future project teams who  wish to develop integrated, networked learning and assessment systems for  preservice and in service training of technology-using teachers.    3. To develop one such integrated system of instruction and assessment  and implement it in a preservice course on technology for elementary  school teaching candidates.  This course will both teach and model  prototypical technology configurations and their use within a  differentiated staffing model to deliver innovative science, mathematics,  and other learning content.    4. To publish descriptions of the new role delineation methodology used  in this project that iterates between analysis and synthesis of models of  the work in each role.  These publications can use as examples the data  and visual materials produced in this project.    The products of this research can influence the building of the human  infrastructure of educators needed to use new technologies in a  productive way.  It will define the technology configurations that  structure the roles -- configurations that can evolve over time and need  not be installed all at once.  It will suggest a coherent and thoughtful  set of roles for differentiated staffing and will contrast these roles to  extant job analysis of conventional teacher roles.  It will contribute to  methodology for role delineation of rapidly changing,  technology-intensive jobs.",
