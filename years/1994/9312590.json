 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312590  Solbrig  This project will study the effects of fire on vegetation biodiversity and heterogeneity in the cerrado, a savanna region in south-central Brazil. The aim of ecology is not just to describe pattern in nature, but to explain the mechanisms that contribute to that pattern. To assess the effects of fire on biodiversity and heterogeneity, this study will incorporate analyses of population and community ecology. Community level data will be collected in transects sampled across replicated experimental plots which are either burned frequently or left unburned. Population level data will focus on the effects of fire on the reproduction, growth and survivorship of nine common species, three species of grass and six tree species.  %%%  The cerrado region of Brazil has an unusually high diversity of plant species compared to other savanna regions. Fire has been an important force in the development of cerrado vegetation, but the precise effects of fire on species diversity in the cerrado is unknown. Although fire is commonly used as a management tool by ranchers, the long-term effects of this practice are relevant to species conservation. In addition, the importance of fire as a management tool in ecological reserves and national parks is still poorly understood. This study will provide experimental data on the effects of fire on community diversity and species survival in this species-rich region of Brazil.  ***",
