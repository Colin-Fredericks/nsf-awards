Roux of the University  of Texas at Austin and Dr. Gregory Clark, a postdoctoral  associate, to collaborate in developmental botany research with  Professor Richard E. Kendrick of the Department of Plant  Physiology, Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands.   The objective of their research is to gain a better understanding  of the cause of the light-induced increase in the nuclear number  among pea cells, a phenomenon which was recently discovered by  Professor Roux and Dr. Clark.  Together with Professor Kendrick  and others at his institution, they are taking a  multidisciplinary approach to studying the biochemical basis  for the postulated role of the pigment phytochrome in the  stimulation of mitosis.  In particular, they are exploring  whether this role is mediated through GTP-binding proteins. Their  research depends on the complementary expertise of the two  groups.  Dr. Kendrick is a world leader in the physiological and  photobiological aspects of phytochrome research and a pioneer on  studies of G-protein mediation of phytochrome responses.  Others  in his institution will contribute expertise in the cytological  and morphological aspects of plant development.  Dr. Roux has  worked extensively on biochemical aspects of phytochrome, and is  an expert on enzymes regulated by phytochrome.    This research tests the important question of whether phytochrome  can regulate mitosis and whether this regulation requires the  mediation of GTP-binding proteins.  Verification of this  influence will help explain the dramatic effects of phytochrome  on pea plumule development and will represent a critically  important addition to the impressive list of events controlled by  phytochrome during photomorphogenesis.  Verification of a role  for GTP-binding proteins as mediators would be an equally  important finding, not only for plant sciences but for cell  biology in general, for almost nothing is known about the  regulation of GTP -binding proteins in nuclei.  ***",
