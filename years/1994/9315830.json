 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315830  Hammer  This award supports continued research on Triassic and Jurassic age  vertebrate material collected in the Beardmore Glacier region of  the Transantarctic Mountains.  The fossils include Triassic  synapsids and the first Jurassic dinosaurs from Antarctica.  This  continued funding is required because of the large amount of  material that was collected during the previous field work and  because of the time consuming nature of fossil preparation work.   The collection to date has produced at least five taxa of Jurassic  age, including a new large crested carnivorous dinosaur.  Other  dinosaur material includes portions of a prosauropod and teeth of  a scavenging carnivore.  In addition to the dinosaur material,  other Jurassic animals identified include a pterosaur and a  tritylodont synapsid.  Early Jurassic fauna under study is one of  only a few high latitude faunas known and so has considerable  paleoclimatic significance.  In addition, because Early Jurassic  terrestrial vertebrate faunas are relatively rare, these fossils  could provide significant information about the evolution of  lineages between the Late Triassic and the Middle to Late Jurassic.   Preparation of the Triassic material will follow the completion of  the Jurassic material.   ***",
