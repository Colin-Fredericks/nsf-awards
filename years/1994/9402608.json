 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402608  Krishnamurty  In this research project, a unified scheme is developed for the  design of generic mechanisms using an exact gradient approach.  The utilization of this approach enhances the efficiency of  the mechanism design process, and the accuracy of the final  solution. It includes a comprehensive design procedure for  determining and eliminating branch-defects and circuit defects  during mechanism synthesis process leading to optimal solutions  for complex mechanisms. The unified approach uses matrix methods  to model and analyze mechanisms to ensure generality, and has the  capabilities of systematically determining suitable mechanism  types and their optimal dimensions without branch and circuit  defects. The results of this research are extremely useful in the  mechanism identification and enumeration process, formulation of  appropriate selection and rejection criteria for mechanism  evaluation, and designing and implementing schemes for automatic  mechanism sketching  without crossing links, and representing  different class of mechanism such as contracted graphs and  kinematic chains.  ***",
