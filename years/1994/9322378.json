Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of Michigan State University.  The  program will provide undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in an  integrative program in ecological field research, which is considered an essential part  of the education of scientists with the skills to address complex environmental  problems.  Students will be exposed to concepts and techniques from a variety of  subdisciplines, levels of ecological organization (genes to landscapes), scales, and  habitats through weekly seminars led by resident and visiting researchers.  Weekly  group meetings will provide a forum to discuss research ideas and approaches,  conceptual aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology, and project proposals.  Each  student will develop and conduct an independent project under the guidance of a  faculty mentor, which will include all stages of scientific inquiry:  identification and  refinement of questions, experimental and sampling design, field work, and data  analysis and presentation.  Results will be presented to the KBS community at an REU  symposium at the end of the summer, and written up in the form of a manuscript for  publication in a scientific journal.  ***",
