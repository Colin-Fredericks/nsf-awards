 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317198  Nelson  Femtosecond  through  millisecond time-resolved  spectroscopy  of  condensed matter will be conducted to understand the dynamics  of  structural  change  in  solids  and  liquids.  Structural   phase  transitions  between crystalline phases and structural  evolution  in  glass-forming  liquids and polymers  will  be  examined.  The  results  will  be  analyzed  in terms of  theoretical  models  of  structural  change, which describe the behavior of whole  classes  of  materials and which therefore transcend individual materials,  and  in  terms of molecular models which attempt to  explain  the  behavior  of  specihc  materials by taking  their  distinguishing  characteristics into account. Measurements of the mechanical  and  thermal  conductivity  properties of  thin  films  will  also  be  performed. The goals will be to understand the relations  between  the  linear  mechanical response of the interface, the  nonlinear  response  (e.g. peeling) measured by destructive tests,  and  the  interface  chemistry and bonding. The work on thin film  polymers  will  have  an  immediate practical impact. The  proposed  method  permits  noncontact, nondestructive, rapid in situ  determination  of  mechanical and thermal properties (elastic and  loss  moduli,  thermal diffusivities) of supported or unsupported polymer  films  used   in   microelectronics,  protective  coatings,  and   other  applications.  If  noncontact adhesion quality assessment  proves  possible,  this will present a truly revolutionary  tool  to  the  applied community.  ***",
