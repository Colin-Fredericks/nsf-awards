The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.        This award will support a seven-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Timothy E. O'Brien of Washington State  University to work with  Professor Dr. Friedrich Pukelsheim  at the Institut fur Mathematik der Universitat Augsburg on  optimal design for nonlinear regression models.    This research will focus on several specific problems.  First, development of a theoretical framework will help  researchers select among design procedures available for  nonlinear models.  Second, extension of  existing second-  order and Bayesian design procedures to accommodate the  multi-response and/or compartmental  nonlinear models that  face many researchers.  Third, elevation of  compound design  procedures for nonlinear models so that researchers can  obtain optimal designs even when they are unsure which model  they should use. In addition to enhancing the theoretical  understanding of statistics, the results of this work will  furnish scientists in other fields with efficient tools to  accomplish their research. ***",
