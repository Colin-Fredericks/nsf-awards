 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404554  Shelley    Large-scale computation and computational mathematics are now  primary tools for studying those physical processes characterized  by randomness and strong nonlinearity.  These processes include  complex pattern formation and growth problems in diffusion  dominated systems, and wave interactions on the ocean's free  surface.  Closely related are problems with singular or nearly  singular behavior, such as flows undergoing changes in  topological type, or water wave breaking.  The main objective of  this proposal is to investigate such problems in fluids and  materials by developing and applying state-of-the-art numerical  methods to large-scale computation, and understanding important  constituent processes through analysis and modelling.  All these  problems, while arising in quite disparate physical settings, are  strongly mediated by the presence of surface tension or energy,  and often share mathematical structure.    In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical  analysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to  study certain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and  materials science. One such problem is understanding pattern  formation in diffusion dominated systems. This has important  implications in the production of metallic alloys.  The complex  patterns that are observed to form within the alloys during their  production, strongly affect the bulk properties of the resulting  alloys, such as their strength and toughness.  Other problems  involve the motions of free surfaces in fluid flows.  Two  important instances are the interactions of waves on the ocean's  surface, and the dynamics of flows undergoing changes in  topological type, say as characterized by the production of  bubbles through the mixing of two fluids.  All of the above  problems are similar in the sense that the relevant phenomena is  heavily influenced by surface tension at the interface (called  \"surface energy\" in the materials science context).  As such,  they c an be studied by some common analytical and computational  tools.",
