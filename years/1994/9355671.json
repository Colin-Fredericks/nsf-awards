The teachers will participate, as district teams, in two four-week  summer institutes with the purpose of creating scenarios that will initiate vertically-integrated  geometry curricular change in their districts.    The project will generate guidelines for  teacher enhancement projects to create and sustain inquiry based teaching of mathematics,  grades 6-12, with an impetus from geometry related topics.     In the first summer, participants will expand their knowledge of geometry,  instructional  skills using manipulatives and technology, and construction of inquiry-based scenarios.   During the year, they will establish networks and observe mentors and colleagues for  learning and reflection.  In the second summer, they will expand their knowledge, learn to  provide staff development, and begin vertically-integrated curricula.   During the second  academic year, participants will teach and revise their lessons/scenarios and provide staff  development to their colleagues in the district.  The project will culminate with a national  conference on the teaching of geometry with participant-team scenarios highlighted as  examples of a vertically-integrated inquiry curricula using technology and manipulatives.    The project will focus on building teacher skills and confidence in the teaching of geometry  and related topics with technology and manipulatives in an inquiry mode.  From this first  level, the participants will move to establishing scenarios and units for use by their  colleagues in their district.  The participants will gain skills in staff development and school  change to enhance district implementation of their efforts.  Districts will contribute through  co llaborative planning opportunities, within and across buildings, and opportunities to work  with colleagues on curriculum and classroom change.",
