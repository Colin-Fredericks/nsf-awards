 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319933  Berridge    In this project Dr. Kent Berridge will study how a specific  circuit within the brain integrates behavior into  coordinated sequences of movement.  This part of the brain,  the striatum, is a \"high-level modulator\"  of action in a  wide range of mammals.  In humans, it may control the  sequencing of overt movements, words and thoughts.   Dr.  Berridge will study the striatum in rodents, where it  appears to coordinate the sequencing of instinctive grooming  movements.    Previous indirect evidence suggested that the striatum  allocates control among various lower-level action  generating systems.  Presumably, some of these action  systems express programmed movements, while others may use  sensory input to guide the form of movements.   In the work  proposed here,  Dr. Berridge's group will first map the  specific areas of the striatum controlling particular  functions.  Then they will use deactivation techniques and  tests of sensorimotor thresholds to determine if  the  contribution of the striatum to the sequencing of movement  does indeed depend upon modulation of sensory processing.  These results will provide a better understanding of how the  brain produces complex behavioral sequences.  It may also  provide insights into the nature of the processes that are  disturbed in human striatal syndromes characterized by  abnormal sequences of movement or thought.  ***",
