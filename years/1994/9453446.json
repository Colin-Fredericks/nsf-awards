 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453446  Lewis    Principal Investigator would pursue new areas of research and  instrumentation which are emerging in materials science and  engineering. In particular, the proposed research and educational  plan would focus on developing a fundamental understanding of  cross-disciplinary interactions in polymer-stabilized nanosized  ceramic systems.  Novel materials with unusual properties are  expected at the size and scale of nanosized particles, which are  greatly different or improved over conventional bulk ceramics.   Efforts will be directed to design organic processing aids their  effects on microstructural development.  The specific research  objectives are to study the role of \"free\" and adsorbed polymeric  species on interparticle forces, suspension stability and rheology,  and the influence of such properties on the resulting  microstructures of ceramic forms and coatings derived from these  systems.  The educational component of the proposed plan would  focus mainly on two activities:  new course and text development.   The Principal Investigator plan to develop a new graduate level  course entitled \"Sol-Gel and Nanosized Particulate Ceramic  Processing Science\" to be taught in the Spring, 1995.  These course  notes and those developed for a senior level course \"Ceramics  Processing and Microstructural Development\" which the Principal  Investigator currently teach will serve as a basis for preparing a  much needed text book -- Colloidal Processing of Advanced Ceramics.    %%%    The specific research objectives are to study the role of 'free'  and adsorbed polymeric species on interparticle forces, suspension  stability and rheology and the influence of such properties on the  resulting microstructure of ceramic forms and coating derived from  these systems.  The Principal Investigator also plan to develop a  new graduate level course and may prepare a text book in the field  in the near future.  ***",
