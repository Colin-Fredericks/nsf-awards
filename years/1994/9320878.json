The debt crisis, because it called for a  large private-to-public transfer of resources in order to fund  increased debt service, directly or indirectly spurred fiscal  changes.  Yet, not all countries reformed taxes substantially in  this context, and those that reformed did not do so in the same  way or with the same results.  This study will explore hypotheses  relating the degree and nature of tax reform to international  capital mobility, to a country's experience of economic crisis,  to international influences, and to the electoral cycle.    The investigator will retrieve relevant data in library research  at William College, Yale University, the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), and the Library of Congress.  This will be  supplemented by interviews with tax experts at the IMF and  elsewhere.  The data will include measures of tax revenue as a  proportion of Gross Domestic Product; the stock of overseas  capital held by residents, as a proportion of gross fixed capital  formation; level of investment; inflation; GDP growth; and  information about formal communications with international  financial institutions.  The research involves two pooled time-  series designs, one with thirteen countries and the other with  seven, both over the fifteen year period, 1977-1991.    This research is especially relevant today, as Latin American  governments face a potentially sharp conflict between dealing  with worsening social problems and winning the confidence of  international investors.  Tax reform may be one way to moderate  this conflict.  This investigation will deepen our understanding  of this aspect of state competence in Latin America.  ***",
