 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel class of developmental mutants in Arabidopsis  thaliana where lateral organs of the shoot fuse upon growing  into contact have been identified by the PI.  Studies of the  original mutant, fdh1, indicate that organ fusion is  mediated by epidermal cell interactions.  Experimental  evidence suggests that morphogenetic factors are produced  that may induce fusion between epidermal cells and  preliminary results indicate that this activity can be  extracted by surface washes of fdh leaves.  At least three  genes that regulate organ fusion in Arabidopsis have been  determined by the PI.  Pollen from Arabidopsis and closely  related species will germinate and grow on the fdh1 shoot  surface.  Wildtype pollen from tomato, tobacco and  snapdragon plants, however, will not grow pollen tubes when  applied to fdh shoot surfaces.  These results suggest that  fdh1 plants express factors that mediate pollen recognition,  germination and growth.  The PI does not yet know whether  all organ fusion mutants support promiscuous pollen growth.  Both the organ fusion and pollen growth phenotypes  cosegregate with the original fdh1 gene mutation.  Since  only carpel epidermal cells fuse and interact selectively  with pollen in wildtype plants, the PI hypothesizes that  mutation of the FDH gene causes the constitutive expression  of a carpel-specific program in all epidermal cells of the  shoot.  Although fdh organs and epidermal cells are  morphologically normal, carpel-specific biological activity  is expressed over the entire shoot surface.  The  availability of such mutants makes possible the  identification of molecules involved in these biological  processes.  The objective of this research project is to  understand how epidermal cells mediate organ fusion and  identify ectopically expressed factors that may be important  in stigma-pollen interactions.  This will be accomplished  using biochemical, molecular and genetic approaches.  The PI  proposes to characterize factors mediating organ fusion and  pol len growth.  In particular we will analyze the fdh mutant  cell wall and cell wall constituents.  Cytochemical  techniques to determine the staining profile of fresh and  cryopreserved fdh tissues and the porosity of fdh cell walls  will also be conducted.  In a collaborative effort, an  analysis of the sugar and lipid monomer composition of fdh  cell walls will be done.  The expression of S-locus  glycoprotein genes and the presence of JIM antibody binding  species will also be tested for.  Initial attempts at  characterizing the morphogenetic factors will be made and  tests for functional conservation between C. roseus and fdh  factors will be conducted.  In addition efforts toward  isolating the FDH genes using one of three strategies will  be initiated.",
