 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317842  Stone  This is an award to provide support for a project the objective  of which is to develop conceptual and quantitative bases for  models that can be used in engineering design of adsorption  processes for removing aromatic ligand pollutants from aqueous  solution and in determining the fate of these pollutants when  moving through soil and groundwater aquifers. The investigator  plans on studying the physical and chemical factors that  influence the relationship between the substance being adsorbed  and the adsorbing medium.  The research involves analyzing  results of well-selected experiments designed to provide a good  understanding of the underlying physical and chemical phenomena  involved in the adsorption process and relating this  understanding to models that will potentially displace the  empirical, site-specific procedures that now characterize the  design and characterization of adsorption processes.    Results of this project are expected to provide a better basis  than now exists for predicting the fate of water pollutants that  move through soil and aquifers that are subject to adsorption on  surfaces of the media through which the water flows.  The results  may also provide improvements in the ability of engineers to  design soil remediation systems as well as water and wastewater  treatment processes that are either fundamentally based on  adsorption as the physical process for removal of the pollutants  or in which adsorption occurs as a secondary benefit.",
