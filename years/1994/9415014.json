 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myers:  The award to the Temple University School of Medicine will renovate and significantly  improve the animal care facility for pathogen-free mice needed in Developmental Biology  research activities.  The 30-year old, 5,000 square foot conventional animal facility will be  reconfigured and upgraded into a state-of-the-art barrier facility and will support a gene transfer  and targeting center for research and research training to support embryonic stem cell work and  transgenic mice.  Currently, inadequate configuration which defeats the clean/dirty corridor  system, obsolete instrumentation which affects environmental monitoring, and corrosion of  metallic surfaces impede good animal care, good science, and the validation of research results.   The modernized facility will provide research service, research training, and an  AAALAC-accredited animal resource for transgenic, breeding colonies of mice with  compromised immune systems and for specialized research equipment to conduct studies.  The  graduate research training program, which has grown dramatically over the past several years,  will be centered in this facility, and in excess of ten faculty researchers will benefit from this  renovation effort.",
