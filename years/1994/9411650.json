 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411650  Morse         The decline of many populations of Neotropical  migratory songbirds has triggered much research over the  last decade into the biology of these species on their  temperate breeding grounds and their tropical wintering  areas. The interim migration period has received much less  attention, despite the extreme energetic demands and the  very divergent behavior of migrants during this transient  period. During migration, many songbirds diversify their  breeding-season behaviors to select different habitats, use  more foraging behaviors, and feed on more varied diet types  than at other times of the year.  The ecological factors  behind the evolution of such behavioral plasticity and the  ecological and conservation implications these divergent  behaviors remain speculative.  The proposed research will  investigate these questions in one aspect of behavioral  diversification in autumn migrating songbirds - the shift in  diet from eating insects to one of eating fruit.       Preliminary research on Block Island, Rhode Island  suggests that unpredictability in resource abundance at  migratory stopover sites and increased energy intake on  expanded diets during the demanding migration period have  led to behavioral plasticity in songbirds. This research  will be furthered with continued monitoring of insect and  fruit abundance at stopover sites to monitor different  degrees of predictability of the two resources during  Autumn, 1994 and 1995. Furthermore, migrants will be fed  experimental  diets with varying degrees of fruit to  determine the extent they can fatten on expanded diets, thus  testing the hypothesis that diversification of ingested food  types has resulted from selection to maximize energy intake  during migration. Finally, experiments will allow evaluation  (through doubly-labeled  water techniques) of the amount of  energy saved by migrant birds in feeding on diverse diets.  These techniques allow estimation of the energy expenditure  of birds which can be follow ed under situations where birds  have monotypic and diverse diets available to them. These  studies will provide insight into the evolutionary pressures  for behavioral plasticity as well as important information  about the biology of migrating songbirds.  This in turn will  allow better conservation decisions to be made regarding  these declining populations.  ***",
