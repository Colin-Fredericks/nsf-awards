 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400091   Finzer    This project aims to develop a computer learning environment and  curriculum materials for use in teaching data analysis and  statistics at the high school level.  The proposed curriculum  materials will be usable in a semester-long course, as  substantial units within other mathematics and science courses,  and as skill-focused components of other courses.   This project  will bring learning experiences to secondary school classrooms  that intimately involve students with concepts and technologies  they need to become informed and productive participants in the  information age.  The software, provisionally named  StochasticsLab, is a conceptually unified platform for data  gathering and exploration, simulation, and statistical analysis.   The innovative design supports the latest understanding about how  children learn stochastic ideas, including the importance of  user-constructed measures, the problems and potentials associated  with categorical variables, and the need to feed simulation data  into data analysis tools.  It is based from the ground up on net-  worked collaboration, access to large datasets, and visual  explanation of how things work. While the software is expected to  enhance existing courses, the curriculum materials will require  the presence of computers and software.  In this project, the  software is the major innovation.  ***",
