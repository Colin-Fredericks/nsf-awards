 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding for the REU site within the Physics Department at  Lehigh University will be continued.  The Department has a  strong internationally recognized research program which is  fully integrated with a strong commitment to undergraduate  education; hence the department is exceptionally well suited  to the demands of a successful undergraduate research  program.  Such a program has in fact existed in the  Department for the past 13 summers.  The Physics Department  was designated an REU site by the National Science  Foundation in 1989 and from 1991-93.  Since 1989, we have  provided highly interactive research experiences for 100  physics majors representing 57 undergraduate institutions.  Generally, these are students who would not otherwise have  had the opportunity as undergraduates to participate in real  research.  This program includes research, weekly seminars  and lab tours, an end-of-the-summer symposium, and various  faculty/graduate student/undergraduate student social  functions.  An effective group housing arrangement,  subsidized heavily by the University, has greatly enhanced  both the academic and social experiences of the  participants.",
