 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of approximation algorithms for combinatorial  optimization problems dates back to the 1960's, and in spite  of significant  attention paid to this area, there has not  been much progress until the past  few years.  Recently,  there have been a number of important breakthroughs that  have introduced new techniques, both in the design and  analysis of  approximation algorithms, and more  significantly, in techniques for providing  evidence that  problems do not have efficient algorithms that guarantee  near-optimal solutions for particular performance  guarantees.  The  problems studied include: (a) the vertex cover  problem; (b) the maximum acyclic  subgraph problem; (c) the minimum-cost satisfiability problem;   (d) the Steiner tree problem; (e) the traveling salesman problem;   (f) the bin-packing problem; (g) the graph partitioning problem;   and (h) several scheduling problems.  In the search  for improved approximation  algorithms for these problems, the primary focus  is on  methods that rely on the use of linear programming as a tool  both  in the design and the analysis of the algorithm.  Also these new techniques for  proving nonapproximability results are applied in a variety of settings; in  particular:  (1) proving lower bounds on the absolute error of approximation  algorithms (as opposed to the relative error); and (2) strengthening  lower bounds (where traditional methods were able    to prove lower bounds that did not match  the performance of the best known approximation algorithms).",
