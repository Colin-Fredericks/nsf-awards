 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year program of research organized around the  theme of heavy tailed modeling. Heavy tailed modeling assumes  regular variation is present in either the right tail (frequently  implying infinite variances) or the left tail of basic component  distributions of the system and thus departs from Gaussian  methods. Broad  themes include parameter estimation and  prediction in heavy tailed models (Hill estimator, linear  programming estimator), model selection and confirmation and long  range dependence. Specific classes of models to be studied are  extreme value models, infinitely divisible processes and time  series with positive innovations. Application areas include  modeling financial and commodities markets and teletraffic  systems.  This is a three year program of research organized around two  topics. The first involves modeling random phenomena whose  behavior is controlled by exceedingly large values. For example,  in communications, network performance can be dramatically  affected by anomalous long calls such as computer logins by  modem. Accurate modeling of these phenomena can lead to  improvements in the system. The second topic deals with random  phenomena in which dependencies in a system last a long time.  Once again accurate modeling is important in improving system  performance. Other applications of this research include modeling  financial and commodities markets and modeling of water flows and  heights.",
