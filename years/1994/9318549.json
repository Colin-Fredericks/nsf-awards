The nature and extent of the interactions among these  factors is poorly understood. It is the goal of this research to  help understand how these factors interact in one particular  function: the ability to conserve water by producing concentrated  urine.       The PI will study the urine concentrating ability (UCA) of  the white-footed mice. These mice are an important prey species  in the biological community. and naturally occur in a wide  variety of habitats from  very moist to very dry. They thus  provide a sort of \"natural experiment\" that allows us to examine  the effects of different environments on kidney function. To  distinguish between differences  due to long-term genetic changes  between populations of mice on the one hand, and short-term  developmental responses on the other, the PI will also study mice  raised in the laboratory under different condition of water  availability. Because UCA depends not only on the kidney itself,  but also on the control of kidney function by hormones, the PI  will perform a variety of analyses on tissues from the mice. The  PI will measure the levels of the hormone vasopressin in the  blood and in the gland that produces it, as well as the kidney's  responsiveness to vasopressin. The PI will use light and electron  microscopy to study the internal structure of the kidney.       The importance of this study lies in its contributions to  understanding environmental influence on the development of  basic physiological processes, and to understanding the extent to  which this key species in the biological community can respond to  changing climatic conditions.  ***",
