 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells employ calcium ions to convert electrical  signals to biochemical changes within the cell.  Electrical  activity increases intracellular calcium.  Once inside the  cell, calcium acts as a messenger carrying information to  various parts of the cell interior.  Only during electrical  stimulation, or during certain pathologies, is the calcium  concentration in the cell elevated.  Under normal conditions  the intracellular calcium concentration is kept very low by  a complex series of pathways which pump calcium out of the  cell.  The goal of this project is to characterize the  processes which remove calcium from neurons.  The principal  objective is to determine how calcium pumps are modulated by  drugs and environmental factors.  Toward this objective 4  specific aims are proposed.  1)  The effects of altered  energy metabolism on calcium buffering by mitochondria will  be determined.  2)  The possibility that various members of  the calcium pump family selectively regulate specific cell  functions will be explored.  3)  The effects of hormones and  neurotransmitters on calcium pump activity will be  determined.  4)  The hypothesis that a specialized calcium  extrusion protein is localized to nerve endings will be  tested.  To achieve these goals neurons will be grown in  culture (in a dish), and studied individually employing  optical and electrophysiological instrumentation developed  by the investigator.  This work will increase our  understanding of how neurons process information at the  molecular and cellular level, and may reveal new targets for  drugs.",
