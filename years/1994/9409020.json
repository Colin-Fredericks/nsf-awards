 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program, high level ab initio theory, using good   orbital basis sets and correlated wavefunctions, are applied to a broad   range of problems in transition metal chemistry spanning the range of   simple transition metal complexes with as few as six atoms to studies of   full catalytic cycles.   A systematic comparison will be carried out of   H-H and C-H bond activation by transition metal complexes.  Improvements   to existing ab initio methodology include the further development of   computational techniques using effective core potentials.    Modern methods in molecular electronic structure theory are applied to   transition metal chemistry.   Detailed calculations will be carried out   for small molecular systems which exhibit fundamental bonding principles.    Much  larger scale computations of realistic models will also be carried   out.  This  research is distinguished by the application of highly   rigorous theory to such large molecular systems.  These computations   using supercomputers are expected to yield a reliable and more detailed   picture of the molecular events which occur during typical chemical   reactions catalyzed by transition metal complexes.  Such catalytic   processes are widely employed in the chemical industry.  The hope and   expectation is that this research will eventually benefit these   industries.",
