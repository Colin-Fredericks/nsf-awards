Although administered through the University of California at  Berkeley, this is a Program without walls, a group unified by a common  goal. PMMB enables the collaboration of experimental biologists with  mathematicians, professions often viewed as disparate. PMMB members  apply state-of the-art mathematics and computational techniques to the  design and analysis of biology experiments. PMMB provides a forum for  mathematicians and biologists with interesting problems and a  commitment to the application of mathematics to molecular biology.       The Program uses three major mechanisms to achieve this  interdisciplinary collaboration. (1 ) An active fellowship program and  well-attended annual scientific meetings draw particularly the younger  scientists into the area of study and provide support for  interdisciplinary training. (2) The Program actively promotes the  education of the general mathematical and biological audiences on the  potentialities of the field through presentations and tutorials at  national meetingst focused small meetings, individual seminars,  courses, and didactic articles. (3) The Program provides modest direct  support for interdisciplinary studies by the members, their students  and postdoctoral associates, fostering a network of interactions among  the members for productive collaborations.",
