 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the design and implementation of autonomous  agents, that is, of computer programs that have sustained  interactions with a dynamic, incompletely predictable environment,  examples being mobile robots, factory control programs, and  programs for database consistency management.  To facilitate the   design and construction of very sophisticated autonomous agents, it  is important to develop appropriate program specification  techniques, planning algorithms, and learning methods, and these  tasks have formed the focus of the researcher's previous work.   Areas to be emphasized in the continuing research are the  integration of learning methods with pre-programmed strategies and  the integration of low-level, reactive methods with higher-level  planning approaches.  In addition, some technical problems of  reinforcement learning will be studied.  One of these will be the  effect of preprogrammed knowledge and structure on the learning  process.  Another will be efficient learning where relevant aspects  of the environment are inaccessible to the agent's sensory systems.   Planning in stochastic domains will also be explored.",
