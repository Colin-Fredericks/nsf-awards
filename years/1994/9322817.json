 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the main goals of the Human Genome Project is to produce  physical maps of the human chromosomes.  Such maps are important  steps on the path to the complete sequencing of chromosomes, and  have other important applications, such as assisting in the  localizing of disease genes.  A common method for constructing  physical maps is based on fingerprinting random clones. The  proposed research uses information theory notions to quantify  information needed for the completion of a physical map, and  information obtained from random clone data.  Maximizing the  mutual information between a configuration variable and data is  also proposed as a design criterion to select the hybridization  probability parameter.  Numerical and analytic approximations to  the criterion will be considered in the simple pairwise  comparison case, on which most current physical mapping  strategies are based.  Optimal values of the parameter can then  be obtained using these approximations.  Finally, it will be  addressed how to utilize mapping information to localize  positions of genes of interest on the chromosomes.    The proposed research is on applying information theory to  physical mapping problems arising from the Human Genome Project.   An information-theoretic approach is proposed to address certain  problems arising from physical mapping in the Human Genome  Project.  The goals of a physical map will be clarified and we  will answer questions regarding the amount of information we need  for and the amount we learn about the map.  A 3-clone approach is  expected to extract more information out of mapping data than  from 2-clone data, and the possibility of using mapping data to  locate genes of biological interest will be better understood.",
