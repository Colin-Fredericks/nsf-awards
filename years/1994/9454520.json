 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image Processing for Teaching (IPT) brings a powerful technology to  schools and two-year colleges, where students use this  state-of-the-art tool for exploration and analysis, learning  problem-solving skills, computer and imaging technologies, and  specific image processing skills, which are becoming increasingly  important in the modern work place. IPT's past success at exciting  students about science and mathematics, bringing inquiry and  discovery-based learning to students of all ability levels, has  created considerable demand for implementation in  vocational/technological education settings.The IPT project  produces curriculum materials targeting technological education  programs. We design and conduct workshops to provide the teaching  staff development necessary for successful implementation. IPT  further supports implementation with follow-up services, including  toll-free telephone and e-mail communication, an annual conference,  and periodic video conferences. Our team of expert teachers play a  primary role in all planning, development, and instructional  activities. The stream of interdisciplinary activities, keyed to  occupational clusters, will keep instructors and their students on  the cutting edge of technology, while using a demonstrated powerful  tool for learning.",
