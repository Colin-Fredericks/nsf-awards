Hoffman, Chemistry Department, Northwestern University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for a collaborative project with Dr. Anthony G. M. Barrett, Chemistry Department, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, for the synthesis and study of star porphyrazines, solitaire phthalocyanines and related multimetallic macrocycles. A series of porphyrazines bearing a variety of ligating ring subsituents  will be synthesized. These will be converted into multimetallic arrays, with metals bound to the peripheral heteroatoms as well as to the core of the central macrocycle. The resultant complexes may exhibit unusual spectroscopic, magnetic, or electrical properties properties due to electron delocalization and metal-metal interactions via the macrocycle pi-system.    Compounds in which contain several metals often have unique magnetic and electronic properties. In this project a series of such materials will be prepared. The specific design involves a central metal which is surrounded by a rigid structure of other atoms (a macrocyclic ligand) to which additional metal are attached. This results in star shaped or linear arrays of metal atoms which are expected to have a diversity of applications in such areas as materials research, catalysis, and diagnostic and therapeutic medicine.",
