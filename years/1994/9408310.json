 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408310  Tab Rasmussen/Ellen Miller    During  the lower Miocene, the African-Arabian and Turkish  tectonic plates collide, resulting in a land bridge between  Africa and Eurasia.  For the first time in the entire  Cenozoic, animal could move between those two continents.  Before then in Africa, the isolated animal species were  mostly primates, elephants, hyraxes, and cerodonts.  In this  new period, new primates, carnivores, and hooved animals  appeared for the first time, and much of the present day  fauna can be traced to that period,  including the origin  and early evolution of the Old World monkeys.  Many of these  important early Miocene animals are preserved as fossils in  the rocks at Wadi Moghara, although most of the African  sites of this period are in the East African Rift Valley  system. The taxonomic diversity of the fossils at Moghara,  coupled with the site's great distance from most other early  Miocene localities, makes the further study and excavation  at Moghara important.    This project, by a graduate student, will result in the  collection of more fossil mammals from this important site,  an examination of all Moghara museum specimens and important  comparative collections, a revision of the systematics of  the Moghara mammals, and an investigation of the  relationships between these mammals and other early Miocene  faunas.    It will make important paleontological contributions as well  as aiding in the training of a new scientist.",
