In  particular, he would like to understand the analog of the Chern  character formed by using the map from E(n) to the inverse limit  of the Lin inverse system smashed with E(n)  which gives  a v(n-1)-periodic homotopy theory .  He will also continue  his efforts to understand the result of taking the inverse limit  of the Lin inverse system smashed with the Bousfield localization  of a space with respect to the homology theory E(n).  This latter  inverse system seems to relate vn-periodic and  v(n-1)-periodic homotopy classes via an analog of the Hopf  invariant.       Topology is the study of \"spaces\" where two spaces  are considered the same if one is deformable to the other.   (For present purposes, a space can be thought of as a subset of  some  n-dimensional Euclidean space; i.e. a subset of the plane, or a  subset of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, a subset of  4-dimensional  Euclidean space, etc.  Although the spaces requiring more than 3  dimensions to describe are not familiar from our ordinary  experience, they arise frequently in most branches of  mathematics,  in physics, and in engineering applications.)  Homotopy theory  uses  algebraic techniques to study the number and kind of \"holes\"  in these spaces (contrast, for example, the sort of hole in a  circle with the sort of hole in a hollow sphere).  Although this  latter information is rather coarse (it fails to distinguish  between some spaces that are topologically distinct), it still  describes much of the geometry of a space, and suffices for many  applications.  Furthermore, it turns out that the algebraic  information provided by homotopy  theory can be divided up into  what are called \"n-periodic\" types, for each non-negative integer  n.  Examining one n-periodic type of homotopy at a time leads to  some simplifications, and is more tractable than examining all  the homotopy theoretic information about a space at once.  This  project is concerned with understanding the interaction between  different n-periodic homotopy information and (n+1)-periodic  homotopy information.  These appear somewhat unrelated, but the  n-periodic information for a space restricts the possibilities  for the (n+1)-periodic information for the same space.  This is  ultimately a very useful relationship to understand, for the  0-periodic information is quite accessible, and the 1-periodic  information is also quite well understood, so one might hope to  use this relationship to describe much of the n-periodic homotopy  in terms of the k-periodic homotopy for k < n.  ***",
