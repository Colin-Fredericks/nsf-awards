 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parkin  This award supports the renovation of 3424 square feet of  research and research training space  at the University of Iowa.  The Water Plant Laboratories of the Environmental Engineering  program at this institution will become modernized as a result of this project.  These laboratories  are currently used for one undergraduate and four graduate teaching laboratories, a water quality  monitoring project, and one research project.  There are also, five faculty with research  programs utilizing these laboratories.   Renovation of the Water Plant Laboratories will allow  the Environmental Engineering program to develop its current strength in bioremediation by  providing space to accommodate large bench scale and small pilot scale reactors, as well as by  adding additional high quality laboratory space.  The ability to build and study larger reactors  is critical in developing technologies that can be eventually field-tested.  Providing a relatively  dust-free environment will make placement of analytical instrumentation in the Water Plant  laboratories more attractive, and thus make the space more appropriate for the research currently  in progress in the department.  This renovation is important for the study of the environment and  the attraction of students into the field of environmental engineering.",
