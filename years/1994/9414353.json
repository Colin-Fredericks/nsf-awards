 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414353  Hallam       The investigator and his colleagues conduct a training course  and research conference on mathematical ecology.  The  multidisciplinary course addresses ecological problems using  mathematical, statistical, and computational methods.  Specific  topics include   - population demography,   - population, community, and ecosystem dynamics,   - conservation biology,   - resource and agricultural management,   - environmental assessment and quality,   - global change,   - epidemiology and infectious diseases.       Ecology studies the relationships between living things and  their surroundings.  As with other complex phenomena, the  mathematical sciences help model, analyze, and understand these  relationships.   This project introduces researchers at all levels  to mathematical and computational tools, mathematical formulations  of ecological questions, and the ecological implications of the  mathematical results.  It also fosters research collaborations  between mathematical and ecological scientists on problems  important for the sciences and for the environment.  A significant feature of the course is the involvement of  students, postdoctoral researchers, and scientists from developing  countries as well as from developed countries.  This grant  supports U.S. participants.",
