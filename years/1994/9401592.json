 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401592  McClanahan       The investigator has previously shown that Pimsner's most  general exact sequence of K-groups is valid in the case of  twisted crossed products relative to a circle 2-valued cocycle.  One component of the proposed project involves extending this  result to the case of unitary multiplier-valued cocycles. A  possible application of this result would be the computation of  the K-groups of certain group C*-algebras in terms of the K-  groups of the group C*-algebras of a normal subgroup and of an  action of the corresponding quotient group. The investigator  plans to investigate extending Pimsner's exact sequence for  groups acting on trees to the partial crossed product setting.  This will enable the computation of the K-groups of many  other amalgamated products of C*-algebras.       This project involves computation of invariants of  operator algebras. An operator is an infinite dimensional  generalization of matrices. Given the natural algebraic structure  a collection of operators can frequently be considered as an  algebra. A C*-algebra is an algebra of operators with additional  topological structure that is closed under the adjoint operation.  A basic problem is to classify operator algebras up to  isomorphism. This is frequently handled by determining simple  invariants associated with operator algebras. One such invariant  is the K-group of a C*-algebra. This project will provide  explicit computations of K-groups of product C*-algebras.  ***",
