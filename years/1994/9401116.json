It is a study of the impact of  German reunification on East German women, based on in-depth  interviews conducted with eastern German couples who have  children.  Topics covered by the interviews will include: 1)  employment in the new, capitalist labor market, 2) child care  arrangements before and after unification, and 3) financial and  emotional dependency of partners.  Current German government  policies have the effect of encouraging women to leave the labor  force to have families, while former East German policy did the  opposite.  Thus, this research will examine an area where  governmental change may have a substantial impact, thus  permitting the testing of sociological theories of national  transition.  %%%       The research supported in this award will contribute to  social-scientific understanding of transnational aspects of  global change and democratization.  Across the world, massive  shifts in government policies can be expected to affect  decisively the context in which individuals and families make  career decisions, and through these decisions, the social and  economic status of women.  In addition to the scientific gains to  be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a  highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next  generation of social scientists.    ***",
