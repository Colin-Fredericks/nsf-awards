These studies will determine the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity of mammals inhabiting old-growth forests of the Olympic Peninsula.  We will use spatial analysis techniques to investigate how the structure of old-growth forest communities reflects differences amount species, forest fragments and surrounding landscapes.  Subsequently, we will use  these patterns to assess the importance of corridors and the habitat matrix, on the biodiversity of old-growth forest mammals, and landscape features which favor immigrations of forest mammals.    %%%  We will adopt a multiscale, or hierarchical approach in our attempt to assess the effects of fragmentation of old-growth forests.  Field studies will employ a combination of livetrapping, sign (tracks, scats, etc.), habitat and camera surveys conducted in nine continuous forest sites, 30 fragments of old-growth forest, and 10 locations along corridors and within clearcuts.  Resultant data will be subjected to Monte Carlo, regression and correlation analyses to test predictions regarding fragmentation and biodiversity.  %%%  The information we will provide on distribution patterns in the fragmented landscape of Olympic National Forest will facilitate efforts to manage these forests for mammals and dependent species such as spotted owls.  This research also will provide general insights regarding forest fragmentation by serving as a rigorous case study that documents the effects of fragmentation and assesses the influence of key processes influencing biodiversity.",
