The purpose of this workshop will be to provide a forum to the  interested faculty to explore options in teaching of Electric  Drives.  Following is a list of possible topics for this  workshop:         What should be the prerequisites in terms of Electric       Machine Theory, Power Electronics and Control Theory?       Can the students be given the required information in       this course without having to rely on prerequisites?         Are there any good sources of lecture notes?         What should be the role of simulations, if any? What       are to the good simulation packages for this purpose?         It is generally agreed that a hardware laboratory is a must       How much of that should be in terms of classroom       demonstrations and how much as lab experiments for the       students to carryout? Should it be integrated with the       lecture course or as a separate lab course?              It is challenging and expensive to develop an Electric       Drives Laboratory.  Should it be developed based on off-the        shelf drives available commercially or should it be       developed in-house using power electronic components, DSPs,        and so on controlled by a PC?              What is the best way to teach field-oriented, vector control       of induction motor drives, especially in an undergraduate       course?    To allow ample time for a free-flowing discussion on each topic,  the attendance will be limited to 40 full-time university faculty  on a first-come basis.    Detailed notes will be prepared and distributed on the topic of  Field-Oriented, Vector-Controlled Induction Motor Drives.  A  paper copy of the overhead transparencies used during the  workshop will also be distributed to each participant.  A copy of  all this material alo ng with the Summary of the Workshop Results  will be sent to NSF.   ***",
