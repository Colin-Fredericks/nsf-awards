 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354728  Fuller    Students in each course in a collaborative laboratory project  (CLP) apply the special skills, etc. they are learning in that  course to a research project. Thus, introductory biology  students use basic techniques to provide some data for a  project while more advanced students use their special  expertise to quantify a different element of the research. For  example, a CLP on the effects of nutrients and zooplankton on  phytoplankton communities is designed as a collaborative  project for the introductory biology, the phycology and the  ecology courses. The introductory students take samples and  quantify zooplankton; ecology students analyze the water  chemistry and quantify zooplankton; and the phycology students  quantify the phytoplankton. Each student brings an expertise to  the project and all make a significant contribution to the  scientific endeavor. This approach requires interaction among  students and faculty and fosters a cooperative learning  environment that pairs students with students, faculty with  students and faculty with faculty. This \"community of learners\"  extends beyond a single course to encompass all levels of the  curriculum. Furthermore, students appreciate the relevance of  their results, recognize the relatedness of different  sub-disciplines within biology and are introduced to the types  of skills/techniques that they will participate in if they  continue in biology. These CLPs make the science that students  do more substantive, interesting and meaningful, and more  sophisticated at all levels. This approach to teaching science  more accurately reflects how science is done, and can serve as  a model for how science is taught in all disciplines.",
