 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411008  JANKOWSKI       Locational conflicts arise when different people or groups  give different weights to various factors when deciding where to  locate facilities or resources.  The development of spatial  decision-support systems (SDSSs) for use within geographic  information systems (GISs) has offered new approaches for solving  spatial problems and making locational decisions.  Knowledge of  the benefits and limitations of such systems is limited by a  paucity of conceptual and empirical critiques of their use,  however.  This collaborative research project will provide  insights into the use of a SDSS for groups in order to understand  how and why such a group system affects decision-making processes  and outcomes.  Special attention will be given to analysis of  that ways that several thematic map types and multi-criteria  decision models influence the dynamics of, and are influenced by,  small-group interactions for site-location decisions.  In  laboratory experiments of small groups with five participants  within each group, graduate students from environmentally related  programs will select sites for habitat restoration and  development in the wake of toxic-waste cleanup projects.  Participants will function in a group-based software environment  created from a combination of commercial and public-domain  software.  Interaction-coding techniques will be used to compile  data from transcripts of the interaction process in order to  ascertain how SDSS approaches affect group decision making.       This project will contribute valuable new insights into the  dynamics of collaborative decision making and the use of  information technology by adding substantive knowledge about  multi-phase group decision-making processes.  It will apply and  refine an interaction-coding scheme to develop a knowledge base  that other technology-based studies of collaborative spatial  decision making can use, and it will develop a more complete  understanding of the integration needs for information tech nology  that involves GISs, multi-criteria decision models, and SDSSs for  groups.  Because of the pervasive character of locational issues  requiring collective decision making, the potential applications  for advances along these lines is enormous.",
