 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9317621  LaBelle  This project involves the operation of sensitive radio receivers  operating in a frequency-swept mode from 0.1 MHz to 5.0 MHz.  The  resulting spectra will be used to study the physical mechanisms in  the magnetosphere and ionosphere which are responsible for the  radio waves, for example, the mechanisms which accelerate the  electrons which cause aurora.    This award will continue support for the receivers already  operating at South Pole and in the U.S. Antarctic Program Automatic  Geophysical Observatories in Antarctica and will also support the  construction and operation of two more receivers which will be  installed in British Antarctic Survey Automatic Geophysical  Observatories in Antarctica.    Also, the project complements the data being produced by a similar  instrument which is located in the northern auroral zone at Two  Rivers, AK.  The Alaska project is supported by the Atmospheric  Sciences Division of NSF.    Additional support for this project is provided by a separate  Presidential Young Investigator grant to the Principle  Investigator.  Funding for the PYI grant is split between the  Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  ***",
