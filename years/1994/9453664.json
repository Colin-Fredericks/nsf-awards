EPUSI will unite the three school districts, El  Paso Independent, Ysleta and Socorro, that serve over 85% of  all of the children in the El Paso region, in the  development and implementation of a standards-based, K-12  science, mathematics and technology curriculum appropriate  to meet the needs of El Paso's culturally-diverse, bilingual  student population.  The curriculum will be developed by  teams of curriculum supervisors, teachers and science and  mathematics professionals.  Through joint effort, the  districts will provide teacher enhancement, implement  technology to support the new curriculum, align policies and  redirect their resources to support EPUSI.  The Initiative  will be managed by El Paso Collaborative for Academic  Excellence in concert with the three school districts.  Science and mathematics professionals from the University of  Texas El Paso (UTEP) will help design the curriculum and  provide school level coaching, mentoring and other support.  Programs developed by the Comprehensive Regional Center for  Minorities UTEP, will be incorporated within the EPUSI.",
