Gundersen,  University of Southern California, Jean-Pierre Boeuf at the  University of Toulouse and V. Puech of the University of Paris,  Orsay.  The objective of the research is to study the applied  physics and applications of pseudosparks and back-lighted  thyratons devices.      The pseudospark is a promising, inexpensive high voltage switch  with possible environmental and semiconductor applications.  It  can be used for a range of scientific activities, including the  studies of the effects of beams on materials growth and as a  plasma lens for focusing high energy beams.  The U.S.  investigator is the innovator of the optically triggered  pseudospark and brings to this collaboration considerable  experimental expertise in pulsed power research.  This is  complemented by the French group's computational expertise and  their recent work in modeling of low temperature plasmas.  The  U.S. group will stress experiment and applications; whereas the  French groups will develop models of the underlying physics,  calculations of the basic properties, and conduct experiments  primarily related to switching applications.  ***",
