 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306436  Black       Leafhoppers are insects that extract nutrients from plants  through piercing and sucking mouthparts.  Leafhoppers occur on a  wide variety of trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants and grasses and  can transmit a number of important plant diseases.  It is  believed that leafhopper species arose through changes in host  plant specialization.  A species that feeds on several closely  related plant species may have come to specialize on one or a  leafhopper that fed on one plant species may have broadened its  range.  Shifts in host plant specialization are believed to have  occurred among leafhoppers in the tribe Deltocephalini.  Some  genera in this tribe have a worldwide distribution and occur on  trees and shrubs or alternate between woody and herbaceous  plants.  Other genera are largely associated with herbaceous  plants.  One group inhabits primarily grasses in North, Central  and South America.  From these arose a group that are almost  entirely limited to grasses in North America and Mexico.  This  suggests a progression from widely distributed species that occur  on many families of woody and herbaceous plants towards North  American and Mexican species that occur exclusively on grasses.   The importance of host plant transfer in the origin of leafhopper  species is poorly understood because leafhoppers have only a few  morphological characters that can be used to separate species and  determine the genetic relationships among them.  The research of  this project will use DNA sequences to estimate genetic  relationships among leafhopper species.  The goal is to develop  an objective phylogeny for leafhoppers that will test the  hypothesis that new species arise through host transfer and  specialization.  %%%       The leafhoppers are a group of insects that have economic  importance because several members transmit plant diseases to  crops, trees, shrubs, etc..  Developing a better understanding of  relationships among these insects will serve to explain changes  in host pl ant associations which may have potential implications  for disease control.  The results of this project will also serve  as a general model for other insect groups where host plant  transfer and specialization is suspected.  ***",
