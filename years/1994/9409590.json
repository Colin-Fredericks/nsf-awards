Work on  superfluid helium three A-B phase nucleation will probe how surface  roughness increases the nucleation rate, possibly paving the way  for the use of this system in quantum tunneling studies.  Study of  the magnetic order in thr second layer helium three films adsorbed  on graphite will be continued.  The emphasis of this work is to  search for a possible finite temperature phase transition in low  magnetic fields for this two dimensional Heisenberg system.  Third  sound studies will be carried out to search for a second  superconducting state of sub-monolayer helium three films adsorbed  on superfluid helium four.  Finally, new studies of the spatial  dependence of noise correlations in spin glasses will be carried  out.    Non-technical abstract:  Helium three will be used as a model  system for studying various aspects of the nature of phase  transitions and complex order in important classes of physical  systems.  Studies of the phase transitions between two liquid  helium three phases which are neutral analogs to electrical  superconductors may help produce a highly effective particle  detector, as well shed knowledge on a broad class of phase  transitions in general.  Thin helium three films which exhibit  effective magnetic interactions between the atomic nuclei will  allow test theoretical predictions that thin liquid helium three  films on appropriate substrates may exhibit still more novel forms  of order, possibly related to those seen in the oxide  superconductors.  ***",
