This proposal  focuses specifically on the regulation of the synthesis and  assembly of components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in  response to an increase in the secretory load of the cell  and on the role of the ER stress proteins in this pathway.  An experimental system has been established which can be  used to explore \"signaling\" from the ER and which can be the  basis for more refined systems in which to study the  molecular mechanism of the generation and transduction of  this \"signal\".  In addition, a new ER stress protein has  been identified and th ecis-acting elements that control its  expression have been analyzed.  This work has led to the  development of reporter constructs which represent the  ultimate targets of  regulatory signals generated in teh ER.  These data provide an excellent basis for the investigation  of two aspects of the regulation of the ER stress response:  1) the cis-acting regulatory elements and the trans-acting  factors that are the ultimate targets for the stress signal;  and 2) the molecular interactions responsible for the  transduction of the signal from the ER to the nucleus.   In  this project, experiments will be designed to identify and  characterize the trans-acting regulatory elements of the  ERp72 gene, a target for the signal generated in the ER, and  to determine the mechanisms of both signal generation in the  ER and signal transduction across the ER membrane.  The 5'  upstream sequences responsible for both basal and stress  signal stimulated transcription have already been defined in  earlier work.  A combination of DNase I footprinting an  mobility shift DNA binding studies will be used to extend  these results and to identify trans-acting factors  recognizing these elements.  The identification of these  el ements will allow us to accomplish their purification and  cloning and, in turn, should provide us with valuable new  insights into the regulatory pathway used to transduce the  ER signal.  A second focus of these studies will be  pharmacological studies involving the use of inhibitors of  intracellular signalling to probe the ER stress protein  regulatory pathway and the functional analysis of purified  and cloned trans-acting factors.   Each of the specific aims  is designed to produce significant, new information  independently.  It is our hope that each aim will augment  the other a produce a deteailed definition of the  intracellular signal pathway used by the ER stress response.  %%%  In order for an organism to survive, its cells must be able  to adapt to accomodate changes in its circumstances or its  external environment.  This entails sensing the changes  (signals) and then responding to them in an appropriate  manner.  This project focuses on the ability of a cell to  recognize an increase in the amount of secretory proteins it  is producing and to respond to this by increasing the  amounts of the cellular machinery required to deal with  secretory proteins appropriately (cellular stress response  to increased secretory load).  The eukaryotic cell is efficiently partitioned into  functional compartments, many of which are delineated by  intracellular membranes.  One of these membrane-enclosed  compartments, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is the place  where newly-synthesized proteins are initially placed if  they are destined for secretion.  The new secretory proteins  undergo some post-translational processing within the ER,  and are then shuttled to additional intracellular  compartments before their ultimate secretion from the cell.  When the amount of secretory protein coming into the ER is  increased beyond the system's ability to handle the load, a  \"signal\" is transmitted to the nucleus to up-regulate  production of certain ER resident proteins which are  involved in the prope r \"handling\" of transitory secretory  proteins.  This project focuses on the question of how  synthesis of those resident proteins become up-regulated as  a result of secretory load.  The project has two-fold  significance.  First, a better understanding of how cells  handle newly-synthesized secretory proteins is critical to  efficient exploitation of eukaryotic cells as bioreactors  for the large-scale production of specific proteins of  interest, and therefore this project has direct relevance to  biotechnology.  Second, a better understanding of how  different functional compartments communicate with each  other as well as with the external environment is essential  to a general understanding of how organisms adapt to  changing circumstances.  ***",
