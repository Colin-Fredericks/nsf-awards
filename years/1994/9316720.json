 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315831  Fitzgerald  This award supports a study of the thermal evolution of the  Shackleton Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains using  fission track and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology.  The goal is to use the  thermal history of the rocks (temperature-time data that dates the  time of cooling) to infer the timing and rate of uplift and  denudation of the region.  This information will, in turn, allow  constraints on mechanistic models for uplift of the range on the  southwestern edge of the Ross Embayment.  The first year of the  award will be used to analyze rocks from existing collections and  to prepare for field work in the second year.  The Shackleton  Glacier region is the focus of new field work because it represents  a substantial crustal block that is between two segments of the  Transantarctic Mountains which have already been extensively  studied.  The sampling strategy is to collect vertical profiles  from basement rocks at regular intervals across, and along the  length of, the Transantarctic Mountains.  This strategy minimizes  the potential for complications and ambiguities which can result  from unmapped faults in the region and maximizes the potential for  a good estimate of the cooling history.  This new field work will  test the hypothesis that the Transantarctic Mountains is segmented,  with each segment having a distinct uplift history.  The data on  the time of cooling at each of several vertical profiles is basic  information on the geologic development of the region.  These data  will be used to infer the uplift and denudation history for each  locality.  The geographic patterns that emerge will help to  constrain the tectonic evolution of the central Transantarctic  Mountains and they will place constraints on a diversity of  geologic problems from Gondwana breakup and development of the Ross  Embayment to development of the Cenozoic ice sheets of Antarctica.  ***",
