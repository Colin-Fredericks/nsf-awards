 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408326  Alexander    This Research Planning Grant permits Dr. Rani Alexander to  conduct preliminary fieldwork and establish the basis for a  larger more long-term project. In this first stage she will  conduct an intensive archaeological survey of the site of Isla  Cilvituk, located in Campeche, Mexico. The site dates to the Late  Postclassic period (AD 1250-1521). During this interval, it was  economically peripheral relative to the boundaries of the large  Aztec empire to the west, to major waterborne trade routes and to  the powerful Mayan polities to the North. Dr. Alexander wishes to  examine how the expansion and contraction of these late  Postclassic economic entities impacted the subsistence strategies  and economic organization of a single community, Isla Cilvituk,  whose political and economic position is presumed marginal  relative to contemporary developments in Mesoamerica. In this  first stage of the investigation, she will conduct an intensive  survey in which the remains of house lots, features and dwelling  units, as well as non-residential structures will be fully  recorded. A random sample of auger tests will also be employed to  establish the chronological depth and distribution of artifactual  material across the site.    Dr. Alexander is interested in the nature and development of  family units and recent analyses of economic organization of  large-scale core-periphery systems suggests that episodes of  economic expansion and contraction of urban centers have wide  ranging effects on household subsistence strategies, not only in  the core's immediate sustaining area, but also in peripheral  regions. The work will therefore examine how, over long periods,  of time the basic human economic unit - the household - responds  to economic and political change.     This research is important because it will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of the factors which affect households and will  assist in the career development of a pr omising young scientist.",
