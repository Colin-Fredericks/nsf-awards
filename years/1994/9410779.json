 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410779  Friesen    Many  animal  movements result from precise coordination  between  body  parts. The two wings of a flying bird, the four limbs of  a  trotting mammal, and the undulations of a swimming fish  are  all  common   examples   of  the  elegance  of  organized   rhythmical  movements.  Coordination of limb movements and  body  musculature  results  from  internal  coordination between  sets  of  neuronal  oscillators  that  control  individual  appendages  or  segments.  Neuronal  oscillators are sets of nerve cells that interact  with  each other to generate rhythmic changes in the electrical signals  of  these  nerve cells. Neurobiologists have learned a lot  about  how  these individual neuronal oscillators work, but know  little  about  how  the  oscillators work together  to  produce  rhythmic  movements.  This  proposal is to study how  the  interconnections  between  neuronal oscillators in the leech produce intersegmental  coordination during swimming. Mathematical and computer models of  intersegmental  coordination  of  this  well-characterized   swim  neural  network  will be developed. Because  of  the  fundamental  similarity of rhythmic movements in all animals, insights  gained  from this study on a complex, yet tractable, nervous system of  a  lower  animal should be applicable to the more complex  and  less  tractable  nervous  systems that produce  rhythmic  movements  in  higher animals.",
