 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406090  Belmonte      This award is under the International Junior Investigator  and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months  of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint  research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Andrew L. Belmonte  to work with Dr. Jorge R.  Tredicce at the Institut NonLineaire de Nice.    Dr. Belmonte proposes to study the motion of  spiral wave  defects, developing methods to attract and hold them by  suppression of chemical reactivity in controlled regions,  and measuring the strength of this \"pinning.\"  He also  proposes to explore the creation and disruption of these  defects, and their perturbation by complex boundary  conditions and anisotropic or inhomogeneous media.  The  unpinning or disruption of such spiral defects would have  important implications for the dynamics of ventricular  fibrillation in the heart (leading to sudden death), which  is thought to be caused by pinned spiral waves of electrical  excitation in the muscle. ***",
