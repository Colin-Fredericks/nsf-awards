 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401755  Hsiang       This project involves research in topological manifolds and  differential geometry.  The principal investigator, Wu-Chung  Hsiang, has some interesting new ideas relating to the Novikov  conjecture.  Together with Cynthia Curtis, Hsiang is also  interested in work on four-manifolds related to the Poincare'  conjecture.  Curtis and Hsiang recall a theorem of Wall stating  that two h-cobordant four-manifolds may be \"stabilized\" by adding  copies of S^2 x S^2 in such a way that the stabilized manifolds  are diffeomorphic.  They study obstructions to \"destabilization\";  that is, they attempt to determine whether the original manifolds  were themselves diffeomorphic.  Curtis also studies  generalizations of Casson's invariant for three-manifolds and  related invariants.   Meanwhile, Zhuang-dan Guan studies  geometric structures on manifolds.  He is interested in examples  of compact holomorphic symplectic manifolds which are not  Kaehlerian, quasi-Einstein metrics, singularities on rational  curves, and homogeneous spaces.       The investigators will study the properties of objects which  are 3-, 4-, or higher-dimensional.  Specifically, they will  develop means of determining when two objects of the same  dimension are equivalent in some sense.  Curtis and Hsiang are  working together on a certain class of four-dimensional objects.   Their work relates to a conjecture of Poincare' dating from the  turn of the century.  Guan works to determine if two  same-dimensional objects are equivalent in a stricter sense,  taking more geometry into account.  The work of all three  researchers relates in a general sense to new and exciting  developments in physics.  ***",
