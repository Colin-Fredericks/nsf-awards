 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the critical necessity of introduction of  Concurrent and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) into the  manufacturing engineering technology curriculum. A need for  engineering workstations arose to teach these topics. The computer  equipment presently on hand is limited to IBM Compatible and Apple  microcomputers.  The following will be accomplished as a result of  the proposed project: i) Teach Finite Element Analysis (FE A),  which is a fundamental CAE concept that is vitally important to  accomplish rigorous and thorough engineering analysis and design.   ii) Run Mechanical Design Automation (MDA) software which is  essential to implement Concurrent Engineering in a Computer  Integrated enterprise. MDA software, on account of their size and  processing requirements, are run on UNIX based engineering  workstation platforms. iii) Model true 3D solids and complex  surfaces which is required for mass property evaluation, generation  of sculpted surfaces for tool and mold design, rapid prototype  generation, and simulation of cutter paths in NC. iv) Issue  projects in plant simulation that are so essential to achieving  productivity enhancements in a dynamic manufacturing environment.",
