 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322073  Becker       The existing REU Site in the Physics Department of San Jose  State University will be expanded to include the other active  research areas in the SJSU Physics Department.  A proposed new  and innovative component of this REU Site will include support  for students in industry-university collaborations.  Four teams  will be formed, each consisting of a Physics faculty member, a  physicist from an industrial or government laboratory located  close to the campus, and an NSF-REU student participant.  Although eleven of these projects are still in the area of  optics, the remaining two are in condensed matter and  computational physics.  All these projects complement the Physics  Department's officially recognized \"Concentration in Lasers and  Optics\", \"Concentration in Condensed Matter\", and the  \"Concentration in Computational Physics\".  These three areas  represent the major scientific focus in the high-tech \"Silicon  Valley\" surrounding our University.  These on-going research  projects will provide both experimental and theoretical research  experience for undergraduates in Physics.       Undergraduate students will be placed in thirteen projects  which range from experimental diode laser spectroscopy of stable  isotopes in carbon dioxide to theoretical studies of electrical  and optical properties of quantum well semiconductors, to rare-  earth spectroscopy, to temperature-induced refractive index  changes in oxide insulators, to neutron activation analysis of  optical materials.       The proposed program's major goal is to involve  undergraduate students, especially minorities, in research who  might not otherwise have the opportunity.  ***",
