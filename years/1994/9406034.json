 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406034  Clark    Under the direction of Dr. Geoffrey Clark, Mr. Michael Neeley  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will examine  archaeological collections at several U.S. universities and  analyze the collected data. His focus is on the Epipaleolithic  period (from ca. 18,000 to 5,000 years ago) in the Near East and  he will study stone tools from a number of sites in this region.  He will conduct a number of technological analyses, note  differences among sites and attempt to relate these to a series  of variables such as the availability of raw material, the nature  of the local environment and prehistoric peoples' use of the  environment.    Because they are so common and well preserved, stone tools  provide an important source of archaeological data. For over a  century prehistorians have examined such materials to gain  insight into the culture of the makers. Traditionally, variation  in assemblages between sites has been ascribed to factors such as  \"ethnicity\" or function. In recent years archaeologists have  recognized that other factors such as mobility strategy can  affect assemblage variation. This realization is resulting in the  development of analytic approaches which may provide new insight  into prehistoric life. Mr. Neeley's work follows in, and expands  on this tradition.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will assist in the  development of new analytic techniques of potentially wide  applicability and will assist in the training of a promising  young scientist.  ***",
