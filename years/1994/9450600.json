 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450600  Johnson  The Chicago Public School System and its educational  partners propose to implement broad based reform in each of  the system's 551 schools.  The USI is led by a strong,  innovative General Superintendent.  It will build upon  School Reform Legislation which resulted in individual  schools being governed by eleven member Local School  Councils (LSC) consisting of parents, teachers, community  members and the principal.  The very successful Chicago  Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities (CRCM) provides  the USI with a rich array groups as well as an effective  data base which is being redesigned for local school use.  It has also led to the development of a Resource Menu which  will include listings of all appropriate and quality  community resources available to schools.  A critical  benchmark of the Initiative is the expectation that all  children will complete algebra by the end of the eighth  grade.  Citywide and local school-based design teams and the  implementation of a highly coordinated staff development  program will serve as the mechanism for ensuring quality  mathematics and science education for all students in  Chicago Public Schools.",
