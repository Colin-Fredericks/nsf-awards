A basic assumption  guiding the research is that people are better at detecting  deception than previous research suggests, and an accommodation  motive is proposed to explain the less than optimal rates of  detection. Specifically, it is hypothesized that people (women  especially) read other people in the ways they think those people  want to be read.  The research includes laboratory and field  studies that investigate whether accommodation really is the  relevant motive; whether in reading others as they want to be  read, people might be pleasing themselves as well as others, and  whether people might be actively avoiding information that could  help them determine when others are lying.  These studies include  manipulations of interpersonal contexts which may moderate  accommodation, including the threat of being exploited,  subordinate power positions, and the possibility of negative  evaluations of self.  The nature of the perceivers' personal  relationships with others is also examined as a predictor of  sensitivity to deceit.  It is also hypothesized that people's  success at detecting deception can be improved by feedback about  the accuracy of their deceptiveness judgments and by  manipulations that are motivationally rich but informationally  vacuous. The research is important because it offers (a) a new  answer to the question of why people are sometimes so inept at  detecting deception, and (b) new promise for improving lie  detection skill.  The traditional answer to the question of why  people are unskilled lie detectors is that they do not know which  cues to look for.  This may in fact be part of the answer.  But  another important part may be that people are sometimes motivated  to overlook deception rather than detect it.  This research will  determine  whether detection accuracy improves when people are  appropriately motivated to detect deception.  It will also  determine whether people have implicit knowledge about deception  that they ordinarily do not even realize they have.  The studies  investigating procedures for helping people to make use of their  implicit knowledge hold promise for developing cost-efficient and  time-efficient methods of improving people's lie-detection  skills.  ***",
