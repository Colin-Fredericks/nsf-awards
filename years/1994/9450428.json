 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450428  U of Texas Pan American  Edinburg, TX  Kiritsis, Nick    \"Summer Science Camp For Minority Students\"    The University of Texas Pan American (UTPA) and the Edinburg  Consolidated Independent School District (ECISD) are collaborating  in the organization of a commuter Summer Science Camp (SSC) for 50  entering ninth graders.  The ECISD is located in the Lower Rio  Grande Valley of Texas (18 miles from US-Mexico border) and has a  student population of about 17,000 of which 94.56% are Hispanic,  5.28% are Whites and 0.16% others.  The SSC is held at UTPA and its  primary objectives are: a) to expose student participants to  practical every day math and science, b) to encourage its  participants towards Math, Science and Engineering related careers,  c) to provide its participants with valuable career information, d)  to expose them to successful role models from their own community  and e) to provide them with a realistic idea about the world they  live in.  The SSC at UTPA concentrates in the Physical Sciences  (Chemistry and Physics), Mathematics and their applications in  Engineering.  Lesson activities incorporate the use of teamwork for  an intensive \"hands-on\" experience.  The camp runs for 27 days  including 4 Saturdays.  A typical day starts at 7:30 am with the  students' arrival at UTPA and ends at 4:45 pm with the students'  departure.  The instructional activities of the camp are held in  the morning and the research methodology activities along with  several student project activities and tutoring are held in the  afternoon.    The instructional activities concentrate on the relationship  between mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering and the  surroundings.  They cover the following four subjects: a)  mathematics, b) chemistry, c) physics and d) computer literacy.   The afternoon projects involve: a) the construction and testing of  model robots, b) a Mini-science Network and c) model bridge  building.  The research methodology part of the daily schedule  includes co llege level experiments which are performed for the  students by UTPA engineering faculty.  The students take data,  manipulate them and write a summative report.  Three experiments  are performed: a) investigation of a Laminar Boundary Layer, b)  Flow Through a Clear Venturi Section and c) Computer Aided Design  and Computer Aided Manufacturing on Small Lathes and Milling  Machines.  The career exploration activities of the SSC explore and  measure the career awareness level of the participants, educate  them about mathematics, science and engineering related careers and  show them that they have the potential to pursue one.  Under these  activities, the student participants take the Strong Interest  Inventory test twice, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude  Battery test and the National Engineering Aptitude Search test.   The students also have the opportunity to interact with scientists  and engineering in the work place when they follow them through a  typical morning.  During the two field trips, the students visit  sites such as: the Central power and Light power plant in Corpus  Christi, Tx, the USDA Laboratories in Weslaco, Tx, the Magnetic  Resonance Imaging Center in McAllen, TX and others.  Two days are  also allocated to presentations by local scientists and engineers  which are followed by discussions.  Upon completion of the SSC, the  students organize \"Science Clubs\" in their own high schools and  compete in several science competitions.  The \"Science Clubs\"  organize regular visits of the SSC participants to elementary and  junior high schools to familiarize the younger students with the  SSC activities.  Students visits to local industrial sites and  presentations by local scientists and engineers continue throughout  the regular academic year.  The SSC staff is comprised of three  UTPA engineering faculty, three high school teachers, one high  school professional counselor and 10 student workers (5  undergraduate UTPA students and 5 high school students).",
