During his year-long tenure, Dr. Haugan  will work with Dr. Shoji Tanaka, Director of  the Superconductivity Research Laboratory. on a  research project entitled \"Growth and Synthesis  of High Tc Superconductors for Bulk  Applications.\"    The research project focuses on phase  transformations occurring along different  reaction pathways.  To study the complicated,  sometimes kinetically fast reactions that can  occur in the liquid-solid \"melts\" during bulk  synthesis, several methods will be used.  Solid  phase reactions will be analyzed using real-  time high temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD).   To study complicated liquid phase coalescence  and reaction phenomena, bulk superconductors  will be quenched from different times in a  reaction sequence and alayzed by several  methods, including film surface XRD, powder  XRD, surface scanning electron microscopy  (SEM), polished cross-sectional SEM, energy  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and SQUID.   Quantitative percentages of crystalline,  amorphous and quenched liquid-like phases  present in the reacted and quenched  superconductors will be determined by SEM image  analysis and XRD methods.  These methods are  particularly suited for studying melt or  liquid-assisted bulk processing.  ***",
