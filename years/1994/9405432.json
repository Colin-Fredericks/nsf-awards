 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405432  Helz  Much current research is directed toward understanding the behavior  of trace metals in anoxic aquatic environments.  These studies  create a need for accurate data on the stoichiometry and stability  of metal complexes containing reduced sulfur ligands.  Many  existing stability constants are uncertain at the order of  magnitude level and thus far less accurate than the field data to  which they are applied.  In some cases, especially for polysulfide  or thiol ligands, no data exist.  When data are available, it is  often uncertain whether the species described are mononuclear or  polynuclear.  This proposal request support to continue research on  the stabilities of metal sulfide and polysulfide complexes.  Our  approach combines traditional solution chemistry and EXAFS  spectroscopy.  In the coming three years, emphasis will be placed  on (a) resolving the controversy concerning the nature of arsenic  and antimony sulfide complexes (while at the same time exploring  the possible importance of thioarsenic and thioantimony as  complexing ligands for metals like Cu) (b) developing a continuous  flow reactor method and applying it to extend previous work on Zn  and Cd sulfide complexes and (c) continuing current work on the  role of thiomolybdates as geochemically important ligands and  determining the form of Mo in black shales.  In the experiments on  Cd and Zn sulfides, the possibility of measuring surface energies  will be explored.",
