 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408869  Kreitman       This research will examine DNA sequence features associated  with naturally occurring chromosomal rearrangements in natural  populations of the fruitfly, Drosophila.  Rearrangement of the  genetic material, such as that caused by chromosomal translocations  and inversions, are common; however, they are also causally  associated with a number of genetic diseases in humans and other  species.  In addition, the aberrant segregation of many kinds of  rearrangements with non-rearranged chromosomes in also strongly  deleterious.  Despite this expectation that gross rearrangement of  chromosomal material will have strongly negative fitness  consequences, and therefore should be rare in nature, their  presence as polymorphisms in natural populations of many species  and as fixed differences between species, suggests that many  inversions must, in some cases, be selectively neutral or  favorable.  It is the goal of this research to examine the history  of several inversions and to test hypotheses about the maintenance  of genetic variation as well as to investigate the influence of  chromosomal rearrangement on the  expression and function of genes  near the breakpoints.  This work will also produce insights into  the molecular mechanism(s) leading to chromosomal breakage.  The  findings will have direct applicability to the understanding of  human variation and disease.",
