The project will  examine how residents of Granada, Spain understand their legal  and cultural (ethnic) identities in light of recent social and  political changes.  The student will interview Spaniards who  migrated to northern Europe a generation ago and returned, and  compare them to Spaniards of Moroccan ancestry who migrated to  Spain more recently.  Both groups were considered culturally  \"inferior\" in the place they migrated to, and now are part of the  expanded European Economic Community.  The project will describe  how these people understand the \"rebordering\" of the  mediterranean through an examination of oral histories,  participant observation, archival research.       This research is important because it will illuminate the  changes in ethnic relations in a country that was previously  thought to be more foreign but is now more tightly integrated  into the European community.  Understanding how people change  their sense of being \"at home\" in different places will help  planners develop programs to better integrate foreigners into  host societies.",
