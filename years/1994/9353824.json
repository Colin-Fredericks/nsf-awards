 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353824  Wankat  This project will develop and institutionalize a model program for  deaf and hard of hearing students in engineering at Purdue  University.  The program will focus on providing academic support  and social integration for deaf and hard of hearing students who  want to study engineering in a mainstreamed environment.  Emphasis  will be placed on promoting retention of these students because  data indicate that attrition rates for deaf and hard of hearing  students are one-third higher than for hearing students.  Program  staff will also work with the University's Engineering Co-op Office  and with companies to make jobs available to the students who are  hard of hearing or deaf.    The program will also contain a recruitment component aimed at pre-  college students who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The recruitment  activities will concentrate on both encouraging qualified high  school seniors to attend Purdue and on encouraging students in  grade school through high school to stay in mathematics and science  courses so that they will be eligible for engineering, mathematics,  and science in college.  Efforts will be made to convince  counselors, parents and teachers that engineering is an excellent  career opportunity for hard of hearing and deaf students.    In addition, a national computer electronic network for deaf and  hard of hearing students interested in studying engineering will be  designed and developed.  This network will serve as a linkage  between high school students, their parents and teachers; current  college students in engineering or interested in transferring into  engineering; engineering professors; and practicing engineers.  The  network should help in the retention efforts and should provide a  basis for recruiting more deaf and hard of hearing students into  engineering.     Information on the program's methodology and results and the  electronic network will be disseminated throughout the United  States to engineering colleges and to organizations inte rested in  the education of deaf and hard of hearing students to promote  development of similar programs.",
