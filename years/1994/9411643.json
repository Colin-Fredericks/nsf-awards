 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411643  Miller  This project continues and extends the investigator's earlier  survey of research in three former republics of the Soviet Union.   The stated goal of many post-Soviet leaders is the  democratization of their countries.  Thus, the process of  democratization as well as the development of effective state  structures is the theoretical focus of this investigation.  In  addressing this task, the investigators look first to structural  and then to instrumental theories of democratization in an effort  to understand the likelihood that post-Communist systems will be  successful in dealing with the myriad challenges to  democratization they currently face.  The structural theorists,  with their concentration on such prerequisites for democracy as  socio-economic development and supportive mass values are helpful  in pointing up the importance of societal factors in contributing  to or constraining the development of democracy, but these  theories tend to be lacking in the provision of an adequate  evidentiary base.  The instrumentalist studies, while  highlighting the importance of struggles between competing elites  in determining the ultimate structure of politics, are for the  most part based upon case studies and therefore lacking  generalizable outcomes.    The current project integrates the structural and instrumentalist  approaches by offering a new theoretical and analytical focus and  by providing new empirical evidence drawn from their earlier  cross-national and longitudinal studies of societies currently in  the process of transition.  The investigators will augment the  two approaches by incorporating an analysis of factors necessary  for the establishment of strong governmental institutions - -  recognizing that a successful transition to democracy requires  the concurrent establishment of democratic procedures together  with effective government.  Two factors in particular have  limited effective state development - - the salience of competing  national identities within  these societies and the relative lack  of legitimacy enjoyed by the institutions of authority.  Tapping  into citizen orientations becomes especially critical when  citizens come to base their political participation in their  ethnic identity, and when ethnic groups are separated by feelings  of distrust, suspicion, and resentment.  The researchers will  study whether the devolution of political power to ethno-regional  territories and the promotion of preferential treatment programs  serves to decrease ethnic-based conflict and enhance the  possibilities for stable democracy.  In addition, the researchers  argue that the degree of citizen support for political leaders,  institutions, and both political and economic reform is critical  during times of transition.    By interviewing citizens the study will provide an assessment  from the perspective of the citizen as to how effectively the  government is meeting the needs of the people.  The study will  allow for a direct linkage between the orientations of the  decision-makers and the constituencies they are meant to serve.",
