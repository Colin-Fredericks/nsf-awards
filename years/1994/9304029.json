This  enzyme catalyzed reaction is one step in cholesterol biosyntheses.   Inhibition could lead to reduction of cholesterol synthesis.  It is  proposed that the transition state for the decarboxylation has a  carbo-cationic character.  To test this, the appropriate demethy-  mevalonate pyrophosphate analogue will be prepared and subjected to  enzyme action.  If a carbo-cation transition state is involved the  reaction should proceed slowly.  In the event a methylphosphate  addition occurs, analogues will be devised to block enzyme action.   Hopefully, a more complete understanding of the mechanism will lead  to effective inhibitors of the enzyme and control of cholesterol  synthesis. (2) In all living organisms 5-S-methyl adenosine is  converted to methionine.  Four novel compounds, which are  intermediates in the pathway, have been characterized, as well as  four new enzymes.  It is the goal of this research to identify all  intermediates and all enzymes of the pathway.  In this system a  deadenylylated C5 intermediate, 1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylthio-1-  pentene-3-one, is formed and spontaneously converts to a secondary  intermediate on the way to methionine.  It is likely that this  reaction is enzyme catalyzed.  After the complete pathway is  identified, an inhibitor will be developed.  This inhibitor will be  used to evaluate the importance of the pathway in various  microorganisms and in plant cells, where it may be essential for  ethylene production.  %%%  Each living cell carries out hundreds of chemical interconversions.   They are called metabolic pathways.  The proper function of each  pathway is essential for the survival of the cell.  Blockage of a  pathway can be fatal.  This research program consists of two parts.   (1) An enzyme of the metabolic pathway for the formation of  choles terol will be studied.  We hope that a complete understanding  of the mechanism of action of the enzyme (mevalonate-pyrophosphate  decarboxylase) will allow for the development of a compound to  inhibit the enzyme and thereby control cholesterol formation in  plant and animal cells.  (2) All living organisms convert 5-S-  methyl adenosine (MTA) to methionine, an essential amino acid.    The intermediates of the pathway will be characterized, as well as  the enzymes.  With this information, it will be possible to develop  an inhibitor to block the pathway and thereby determine its role in  different microorganisms and in plants.  In plants, it may operate  to produce ethylene, a plant hormone, that controls ripening of  fruit.  Inhibition of the MTA in plants could be used to stop  ethylene production, and serve agriculture as a useful means to  control fruit maturation.
