 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cognitive capacities of infants are evident in the way they use   reaching to manipulate and explore their environment.  Infants demonstrate   considerable capacity to adjust their reaches to different tasks, and to   use particular strategies to solve particular tasks.  At present it is not   clear why infants use particular ways of reaching in different situations,   or why the kinematics of reaching changes so dramatically during   development.  The present proposal suggests that infant reaching kinematics   are mainly determined by the internal constraints imposed by the infant's   lower-level motor systems and by the external constraints imposed by the   task.  The current proposal suggests that infant motor planning can be   modelled as the development of a plan to control a stochastic dynamical   system representing the lower-level motor systems.  This formulation of the   planning problem, together with a small number of testable assumptions,   predicts motor behaviors, and spotlights the aspects of the reach that are   most important in controlling the arm, and guides experimental design.  The   proposed research examines the kinematics of infant reaches in several   tasks and compares the infant's movements with movement plans predicted by   a mathematical model.  The research tests whether adults will adopt   infant-like strategies when forced to execute movements with a model of the   infants lower-level motor systems.",
