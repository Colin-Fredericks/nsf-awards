 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators (Z.D. Bai and Jack W. Silverstein)  plan to study several remaining questions concerning the  eigenvalues of a class of random matrices of sample covariance  type, where the numbers of variables and observations are  proportionally large.  Theoretical problems include the  convergence and convergence rates of the empirical spectral  distributions to some nonrandom limits, limits of extreme  eigenvalues, separation between eigenvalues when the population  ones are separated, and analogues when the underlying samples are  dependent, such as stationary ergodic. The principal  investigators also plan to apply the theory of spectral analysis  of large dimensional random matrices to the detection problem in  array signal processing when the numbers of (unknown) sources and  the sensors are both large. Recent work has shown that, when  applying known results, the number of measurements needed to  estimate the proportion of the number of sources to the number of  sensors can be much smaller than what is required when using  classical multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal an interesting phenomenon: the exact number of sources can  be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  Intensive investigation of these problems is of great interest in  both probability theory and signal processing. Some other  application problems are also proposed.  The principal investigators (Z.D. Bai and Jack W. Silverstein)  plan to study certain properties of random matrices of high  dimension used in modeling multivariate random phenomena. The  motivation stems from the detection problem in array signal  processing.  For example, when determining the number of sources  impinging on a bank of sensors in the presence of noise when the  number of sources is sizable, known results on large dimensional  random matrices can be used to reliably estimate the proportion  of the number of sources to the number of sensors with a number  of measurements much smaller than  what is needed according to  standard multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal that, with high probability, the exact number of sources  can be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  The principal investigators intend to mathematically analyze the  observed phenomena which allows for exact detection, and its  dependence on the number of sensors and the sample size. Several  other remaining questions on large dimensional random matrices  important to applications will also be studied.",
