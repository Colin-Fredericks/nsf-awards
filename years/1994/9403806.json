The research will answer questions concerning the  structure, defects and doping mechanisms in metal chalcogenides  glasses where both the metal and chalcogenide atoms can be  tetrahedrally coordinated.  Important questions concern the  microscopic origins of optically-induced paramagnetidm, of  photodarkening, and potential doping mechanisms.  The specific  objectives are (1) to understand the details of the local  structural order in metal-containing chalcogenide glasses, (2) to  study the intrinsic defects in metal chalcogenide glasses as the  structure is changed from low to high average coordination number,  (3) to understand the p-type doping mechanism in the Cu-As-Se(S)  systems, and (4) to further the understanding of the photodarkening  process and the defects that contribute to photodarkening,  especially those defects that involve optical anisotropies.    Non-technical abstract:  In order for semiconductors to be useful  as electronic devices on must be able to change their electrical  properties dramatically by a process called \"doping\".  In most  semiconductors where the atoms are not well ordered (amorphous  semiconductors) it has generally been assumed that doping is not  possible.  We have demonstrated the feasibility of inefficient  doping in a class of amorphous semiconductors containing sulfur.   Selenium or tellurium and are investigating ways of improving the  doping and expanding our understanding of the process.  Amorphous  semiconductors also have the property that they are metastable and  that their electronic and optical characteristics can change.   These metastabilities are sometimes deleterious to device  performance, as in the degradation of thin-film transistors with  time, but so metimes they are useful, as in the use for optically-  induced index changes in inorganic photoresists.  These  metastabilities will be studied to understand the basic microscopic  mechanism essential for the design of useful devices.  ***",
