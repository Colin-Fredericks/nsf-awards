 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406436  McDonnell    The knowledge of the hydrologic flowpaths is critical to  understanding runoff of generation and the transport of pollutants   on to modeling the linkages between hydrologic flux and geochemical  flux.  However, models and field studies are not well linked in  hydrological investigations.  Furthermore, attempts to introduce  such field observations into models have faced the inevitable  compromise between the value of additional data and the  identifiability of parameters required to take account of the data.   New research on runoff flowpaths has shown that spatially-  distributed models are required to capture the key hydrological and  geochemical processes.  This work will develop   a new  synergistically linked hydrologic/geochemical model of how: (1)  waters evolve chemically and isotopically along the different  flowpaths and (2) specific flowpaths produce distinctive  \"signatures\" related to the topographic position and hydrologic  history of the water. Uncertainty analysis will be used to assess  uncertainty in the model parameters.    Our objectives are: (i) to develop a hydrogeochemical model within  which the dynamics of stream chemistry and flowpaths can be related  to fieldwork, (ii) to assess model structure/parameter  uncertainties and identify fieldwork strategies to reduce such  uncertainties, (iii) to make spatially-distributed measurements in  the field to validate spatially-distributed estimates of soil  moisture, water table elevations, isotope and solute  concentrations, (iv) to examine the controls on  geochemical/isotopic evolution along flowpaths by using physical  characteristics and responses of the catchment, and (v) to use the  new model as a tool for testing specific hypotheses on flowpaths  and mixing overall this study represents an innovative attempt  (i)  to link a evolutionary reaction-path model constrained by both  solute isotope and geochemical data within a topographically-driven  hydrologic model at the hillslope scale  and (ii) to de velop a new  type of hydrogeochemical model in a form constrained by the  interaction of the field campaign and the assessment of model  uncertainty.  The work would make it easier to apply fully  distributed models in other study areas.",
