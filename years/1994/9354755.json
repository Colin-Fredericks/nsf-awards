 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354755  Wrigley  This project will restructure the general microbiology course  to  an investigative format in which students use hypotheses as a  springboard for further, more specialized study. To accomplish this  task the course will be constructed around topic modules that  incorporate investigative laboratory activities. Also, students  will be taught to design and perform simple experiments to support  or disprove a given hypothesis and to form hypotheses from their  own observations.  Over the course of the project, faculty will  expand piloted materials  and further restructure the existing  course, using small group techniques, investigative experiments,  hypothesis generation and testing, interactive tutorials, and daily  laboratory sessions. It is expected that this project will be a  more effective learning experience for all general microbiology  students; a more relevant focus for undergraduates in programs such  as nursing, environmental biology, and microbiology; and a  significant pedagogical model for science education majors.  ***y",
