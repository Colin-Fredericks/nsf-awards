 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402300  Dube  Geometric algorithms arise in many application areas.  The non-  robustness of such algorithms is of major concern.  As geometric  algorithms are characterized by the presence of both numerical  and combinatorial elements, non-robustness problems here appear  more intractable than in purely numerical computation.  Evidence  suggests that current implementation approaches, based on machine  floating-point arithmetic, are fundamentally inadequate in  dealing with non-robustness.    This project proposes to use exact computation for implementing  such algorithms.  This is a fundamentally  new computing paradigm  that includes a rich set of computational tactics.  Initial  analysis indicates that exact computation can be quite effective  for an important class of problems (the rational bounded-depth  problems).  The two goals of the research are          To establish the practical viability of this approach.          To investigate the theoretical bases for exact  computation.    The practical goal involves the design of key software packages,  and to apply this to a significant application area.  A new topic  here is the area of precision-sensitive algorithms, which  promises to stimulate new algorithmic research on problems which  seems intractable using traditional complexity parameters.  ***",
