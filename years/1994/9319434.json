 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319434  Krawinkler  This project is concerned with the development of basic  concepts and fundamental information needed to formalize a  deformation based methodology for the evaluation and  strengthening of existing structures.  This methodology is  intended to (1) permit an assessment of the expected seismic  performance of existing structures and the identification of  basic strengthening needs, (2) facilitate the development of  an effective strengthening scheme and provide target values  for the required strength and deformation capacities of the  components of the strengthening scheme, (3) permit a  verification of the seismic performance of the strengthened  structure and provide information for fine-tuning of the  elements of the strengthening scheme, and (4) provide  information on the deformation demands that will govern  requirements for detailing of the elements of the  strengthening scheme.    There have been knowledge gaps in deformation base  evaluation/strengthening which reflects the physical  phenomena that control seismic performance and this research  is intended to fill most of these gaps.  Research is  conducted on the following three topics:  (1) Quantification  of seismic strength and displacement demands for Single-  Degree-of-Freedom and Multiple-Degree-Of-Freedom systems,  (2) development of procedures and criteria for the execution  and evaluation of a \"push-over\" analysis that is to be  employed as part of the evaluation/verification process, and  (3) formalization of the concepts of the deformation method  to the extent that it can become a feasible and attractive  tool for the engineering profession.    A successful completion of  this research will make it  possible to implement an approach to repairing and  strengthening of seismically vulnerable structures.  It  represents a unique opportunity to advance the state of the  practice and introduce deformation control as an accepted  part of the design process.    This is an award under NSF-Initiative \"Repair and   Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of  Structures.\"  ***",
