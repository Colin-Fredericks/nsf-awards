 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407364  Allmon   The combined collections of invertebrate fossils and Recent mollusks of the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) and Cornell University (CU) contain almost two million specimens, including the fifth largest collection of invertebrate fossil type and figured specimens in the United States, and constitute a major potential resource for research and education in paleontology and systematics.  These collections, however, have been almost completely inaccessible to potential users.  In September 1992, PRI embarked on a program of renovation of staff and facilities that included reorganization and preliminary inventory of its collections.  As result, these collections are now usable by staff and visitors.  Yet they are still inadequately housed and curated.  The CU collection of Recent mollusks is fairly well curated and inventoried, but inadequately housed in an out-of -the-way location.  The CU collection of invertebrate fossils is poorly curated, largely univentoried, and housed in inadequate facilities without any curatorial staff in an out-of-the-way location.  Funds will be used to support the first phase of a complete reorganization of the PRI and CU collections of invertebrate fossils and Recent mollusks, involving moving the CU facilities, together with approximately half of the existing PRI collections.  This will allow these important collections to be curated properly and cared for in a way that will make them fully available to the research and educational communities, and that will prepare them for eventual computerization.",
