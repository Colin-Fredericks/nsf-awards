 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400534  Littler   The central goal of the research is to inventory and produce a scholarly, but user-friendly, treatment of the macroscopic marine plants of the Caribbean and adjacent seas, thereby providing a baseline of botanical biodiversity that will serve as a model for subsequent studies.  Collectively, marine plants comprise a taxonomically broad assemblage of very different evolutionary groups that have evolved an astounding variety of life histories, external morphologies, internal anatomical features, biochemical constituents, and metabolic activities.  The taxonomic breadth of the treatment will be synoptic, dealing with six unrelated phyla, including Chlorophyta (the ancestors of land plants), Rhodophyta (the most species-rich of marine plant groups), Phaeophyta (brown rockweeds), Magnoliophytae (flowering Plants), Cyanophyta (the longest evolving group of organisms), and Chrysophyta (diatoms).  Every species will be illustrated with one to two in situ color photographs accompanied by detailed line illustrations of anatomical characters so that species con be \"picture keyed\".  The critical technical descriptions also will be adjacent for confirmation of identifications.  Easily followed keys to orders, families, genera, and species will be produced as an initial means of arriving at accurate identifications.  The project will focus on large macrophytes (many are commercially valuable), which are not easily dispersed (particularly the rhizophytic forms attached in sedimentary substrata), and, hence, questions regarding isolation and speciation also can be addressed.  By increasing the known sample size and micro habitat information on a large scale, the study will reveal patterns of natural selection and speciation of value in addressing larger theoretical questions on biogeography and dispersal.",
