The image is precise enough to examine grain  boundaries, quantify surface roughness, measure microstructural  defects, provide surface profile, and even visualize the atomic  configuration of the specimen surface. SPM is now a routine  microscopy tool used for metrology and extremely high-resolution  profilometry. Since scanning probe microscopes are commercially  available with mature inexpensive technology, this proposal  requests matching support from NSF for the equipment to introduce  students in Mechanical and Microelectronic Engineering programs to  scanning probe microscopy in a significant way.  Students will use  the equipment in a number of required courses, and in senior  design/seminar/research projects involving open-ended problems.  With the equipment, students will be able to visualize atomic  configuration at material surfaces, understand fundamental  relationships between bulk material properties and size-scale, see  sub-microscopic structures in detail, and quantitatively  characterize effects microelectronic processes have on material  surfaces during integrated circuit fabrication. Microelectronic  engineers and mechanical engineers working together to design and  build prototypes of micro-electromechanical systems will also be  able to characterize their prototypes with the SPM equipment.",
