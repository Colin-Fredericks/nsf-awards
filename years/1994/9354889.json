 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks $537,500 over five years to support Ph.D.  graduate students in the Department of Civil Engineering and  Geological Sciences (CE/GEOS) at the University of Notre Dame.   Research performed by these students will concentrate on the  critical area of mitigation of natural and human-made  environmental hazards.  The CE/GEOS unit is uniquely positioned  to address environmental hazards from a multidisciplinary  viewpoint because its faculty is an integrated mix of individuals  with both science and engineering degrees.  Among the critical  problems that can be creatively attacked within this  multidisciplinary framework are technology for the seismic design  of landfills and the associated uncertainty modeling and risk  assessment, mathematical modeling of toxic chemicals in surface  water and groundwater systems, and biological degradation of  hazardous materials.  The support obtained will expand  opportunities for highly qualified students to perform state-of-  the-art research that complements and expands activities in the  Department aimed at assuring excellence in Ph.D. education.   Particular emphasis will be placed on identification,  recruitment, and retention of students from groups  underrepresented in academia, with two of the five requested  scholarships being designated to support such students.  To  increase this applicant pool, alliances have been made with three  institutions (Prairie View A&M University, Texas Southern  University, and St. Mary's College) which graduate a significant  number of underrepresented students.  The program will be  structured to achieve the goal of preparing students for  leadership positions as teachers and researchers in the diverse  aspects of environmental hazard mitigation.",
