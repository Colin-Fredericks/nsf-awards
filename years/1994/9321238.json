 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321238  LEATHERS       Physical geographers, climatologists, and other scientists  recently have come to understand the critical and highly variable  role that snow cover plays in the global climate system.  Recent  research has gathered data over the last century from satellite  images and ground station records.  This research also has  advanced analyses of relationships between the extent of snow  cover and surface air temperatures.  This collaborative research  project will continue this line of inquiry by expanding the study  of snow kinematics to include data on snow depths and by  extending analyses to consider associations among snow cover and  depth and other near-surface atmospheric conditions.  Data will  continue to be acquired from satellite and surface-based sources  in order to better explore spatial and temporal patterns of the  extent and depth of terrestrial snow cover throughout the  Northern Hemisphere.  The analyses also will identify and  diagnose sensitivities of near-surface atmospheric variables to  variations in snow cover across a range of spatial and temporal  scales.  The investigators also will test the capabilities of  different general-circulation climate models to simulate observed  patterns of snow cover and its relationships with other  variables.       This research will extend a productive line of inquiry on an  important topic.  The data-collection activities will expand a  database of Northern Hemisphere snow cover over the last century,  further improving a resource that already has been used by other  researchers.  These activities are complemented by analyses of  relationships between snow cover and a range of atmospheric  variables.  More complete understandings of these relationships  should advance general knowledge and help refine meteorological  forecasting techniques.  The evaluation of general-circulation  models should also prove useful in assessing the possible  consequences of continued increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide  and other forms  of global environmental change.  ***",
