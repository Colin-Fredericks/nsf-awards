Instead, responding often begins slowly, increases to a peak  and then decreases throughout the rest of the session.  Dr.  McSweeney will try to determine why these changes occur.  In  particular, her experiments are designed to separate the  contribution of factors related to reinforcement, such as  arousal followed by satiation, from the contribution of  central factors, such as the focusing and waning of  attention.    These experiments are important for both theory and method  for two reasons.  (1) Many experiments in operant psychology  are not designed so that their data can be interpreted if  such within-session changes in responding occur.  (2) Rate  of responding averaged over the session is one of the  primary dependent variables in operant psychology.  Finding  systematic changes in responding within sessions suggests  that this measure ignores important changes in behavior at a  more detailed level.    Improving theory and methods in operant psychology has  important practical benefits.  Operant techniques are used  as methods for determining the effects of physiological  variables (for example, in the pharmaceutical industry) and  as the basis for some forms of therapy for human behavioral  problems.",
