 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James B. Hendrickson is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue in the   development of his computer program SYNGEN, and to adapt it for the   determination of environmentally benign synthetic routes to target   molecules.  The program SYNGEN assesses the target molecule in terms of   its basic skeleton to determine all of the best ways to assemble the   skeleton from available starting skeletons, and then it generates,   systematically and rapidly the chemistry for all viable routes from a   catalog of real available starting materials.  The program will be   adapted to generate only the most economical syntheses first, thus   eliminating costly routes, and then the resulting solutions will be   ordered to bring to the fore those utilizing a minimum of toxic or   hazardous chemicals en route.  This will be accomplished by establishing   a quantitative standard for environmentally acceptable chemicals from the   data available in  databases and linking these directly into the route   generation process.    For the most part, industrial syntheses have been based on economic   considerations with an emphasis on developing synthetic routes which   employ inexpensive starting materials and efficient high-yield synthetic   reactions.  Until recently, the production of toxic or hazardous   by-products has been a hidden cost in the synthetic industry.  Now, since   toxic or hazardous waste must be disposed of in an environmentally   responsible manner, and since the cost of such waste disposal is high,   this cost is no longer hidden and must be considered a parameter in the   overall cost of production.  Hendrickson has been working on a computer   program, SYNGEN, for several years with the primary objective of   developing economic synthetic routes for targeted organic compounds.    With minor modifications, he will be able to incorporate toxicity   information into his synthetic materials databases in such a manner as to   give higher we ight to feasible synthetic routes which are environmentally   benign.",
