 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452068  Qazi  The Research Foundation of the State University of New York, for  and on behalf of the SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome,  requests $51,496 from the National Science Foundation to develop  a cost effective, real-time multimedia communication facility. We  propose to link the Institute's image processing and fiber optic  communication laboratories by an optical network to improve  undergraduate instruction. The SUNY Institute of Technology has  committed $25,748 in matching funds for this project.    The proposed project is intended to serve the needs of  undergraduates enrolled in the five electrical engineering  technology (ETC) courses that will be enhanced through this  project. Undergraduate students majoring in electrical  engineering technology, computer technology, photonics, and  telecommunications will also benefit from the improved curricula.  The enhanced laboratory environment will permit students to  acquire hands-on experience using a real-time system for the  transmission of voice, video, and data; to study the design of  this facility; and to evaluate its merits. Students will also  learn how to capture, store, playback, and process multimedia  data on a personal computer using a fiber optic local area  network. Students will gain knowledge in the areas of fiber  optics, image processing, data compression, and networking, all  of which have become vitally important to business and industry  today with the emergence and rapid growth of multimedia  technology. Real-time lab experiments with software and hardware  will be used to achieve a stimulating hands-on education.    The duration of the project will be 30 months.",
