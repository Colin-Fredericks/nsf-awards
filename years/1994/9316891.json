 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316891  Dalbey    The proposed research is focused on how N-terminal tails  of bacterial membrane proteins are transferred across the  membrane bilayer.  It is not known whether membrane  insertion of these tails will require SecA or SecY, central  components of the sec- machinery, or whether insertion can  occur spontaneously into the lipid bilayer.  Most proteins  with N-terminal periplasmic tails conform to the \"positive  inside\" rule with mroe positively charged residues on  cytosolic loops compared to periplasmic loops.  However,  subunit H of the photosynthetic reaction center of  Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which contains an N-terminal  periplasmic tail, violates this rule and has a highly  negatively charged region at the membrane/cytoplasm border.  The aims of this proposal are: 1), to determine whether  short N-terminal tails are inserted through the lipid or  through a proteinaceous complex within the membrane; 2), to  define the features (length, charge, or an amphiphilic  helix) within N-terminal tails that are needed to  translocate the tails across the membrane; 3), to examine  whether there is a certain length of the N-terminal tails  where the membrane proteins utilize the sec- machinery; and  4), to identify the determinants of the protein topology of  subunit H, a protein that has an orientation that disobeys  the \"positive inside\" rule.  A variety of approaches will be  used, including site-directed mutagenesis, gene fusions,  topological mapping, and biochemical studies with protein-  free liposomes.  %%%  This project focuses on the question of how bacterial  membrane proteins are inserted into membranes.  The delicate  architecture of biological membranes, and the fine-  resolution accuracy of placement of membrane proteins in  biological membranes, are absolutely critical to the proper  functioning of biological systems.   An understanding of the  \"rules\" that Nature uses to achieve this defined  architecture is in turn critical to the successful  exploitation of modern gen etic engineering and bioprocessing  technologies.   This research projects will result in better  understanding those rules of Nature concerning  how membrane  proteins achieve their final topology and location.  ***",
