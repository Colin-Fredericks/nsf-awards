 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318124  Cooper    Biological systems are, in general, very resourceful in  responding to external signals.  We have identified such a  response in BC3H-1 myocytes, a mouse muscle cell line.  These cells are used in research because they respond to  insulin to increase glucose uptake.  In this case, the  myocytes rapidly switch the types of proteins they  synthesize so that they can enhance glucose uptake in  response to insulin.  The protein being investigated is  protein kinase C beta.  This enzyme phosphorylates or  regulates other enzymes to enhance or inhibit their  function.  It is a component of the glucose transport system  in myocytes and its activation is required for the  stimulation of glucose uptake.  Protein kinase C beta is  interesting because two forms of the enzyme can be expressed  by cells due to alternative splicing of its precursor RNA.  Alternative splicing of protein kinase C beta leads to  differences in the C-terminal end of the protein that is  synthesized.  This difference means that two different  proteins can be expressed from one primary transcript of  RNA.  The cell can respond to hormones such as insulin which  control the alternative splicing very quickly.  In this  case, protein kinase C beta II is more effective than  protein kinase beta I in enhancing insulin effects on  glucose transport.  The actual factors controlling  alternative splicing of PKC beta are unknown.  We want to  identify these factors and determine how insulin can  regulate alternative splicing so that cells can alter their  physiological responses to hormones such as insulin.  ***",
