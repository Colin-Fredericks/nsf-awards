 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320825  Krishna  This research will develop theoretical models of trade in an  effort to understand the different effects of trade policy,  especially when markets are imperfectly competitive. Most  often the effects of policy depend on paying particular  attention to the details of the implementation procedure.  This study focuses on three main areas where the details of  implementation are clearly important. The first is an  investigation of export quotas, in an effort to ascertain  whether transferability of licenses is welfare enhancing.  The conventional wisdom is that transferable quotas are  preferable to nontransferable ones. A simple model is  developed to show that contrary to conventional wisdom,  license prices could increase or decrease depending on the  quota level and the extent of free quota. The second part of  the study deals with issues of market access. There has  recently been increasing pressure to create rules to ensure  market access. The effort here is to find out if attempts to  assure a minimum market share for U.S. products help or hurt  its competitiveness in the long-run. Finally, the study  conducts an analysis of the rules of origin used in Free  Trade Agreements. These rules of origin are used to  determine whether a good is produced in a Free Trade Area  and hence eligible for preferential treatment of the Free  Trade Area or not.  This project is of significant interest because it allows a  better understanding of the implications of different  implementation procedures. The findings from the study are  also important in more general settings as well. For  example, the issue of the effects of permitting  transferability is relevant for all types of permits from  pollution permits to permits to run a taxicab.  ***",
