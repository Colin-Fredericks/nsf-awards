In this current  effort, the investigators and working group will develop and  critique several initial papers:  one will explore the concept of  the public interest, and one will provide a bibliographic essay  examining the relevant literatures and available data that future  research could use to answer questions about the current status and  directions of cooperative relationships between industry and  university with respect to biomedical research, impacts of these  relationships on the public interest and conflicts of interest,  implications of exclusive licensing, tax and trade policy for  commercial benefit and for university industry relationships, and  the impacts of all of these developments on university culture and  the public interest.  Results will be presented at meetings and in  other forums, published, and used to prepare future research  proposals on these topics.   ***",
