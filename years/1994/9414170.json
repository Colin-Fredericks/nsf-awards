 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414170  Cartwright     Programming is founded on two complementary models of computation: as algebraic model rooted in mathematical logic and a physical model grounded in electrical engineering.  Introductory computing courses typically teach only one of these two models and an associated language.  Courses devoted to the algebraic model teach Scheme and courses devoted to the physical model usually teach C, C++, or Pascal.  There are strong arguments for both approaches.  The algebraic model is better for teaching a taxonomy of programming concepts and problem solving methods because it is simpler and more general.  On the other hand, the physical model provides better preparation for the software marketplace and it exposes the structure of the underlying machine, which is important in some applications.  The competition between these two models has split the programming curriculum -- diminishing course standardization and undermining the interfaces between courses.     To exploit the strengths of both models and unify the programming curriculum, the Computer Science faculty at Rice University proposes to develop the curricular materials and software tools required to support the synergistic combination of the two models throughout the programming curriculum.  These curricular materials and software tools will support:    1) a new introductory computing course that teaches both models of computation, their interrelationship, and languages that support them (Scheme and C); and    2) the integration of the algebraic model into upper level software systems courses that have traditionally focused on the physical model.  ***",
