 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320126  MILLER       The proposed research address two major issues: (1) the  relationships between spatial search and locational factors  such as accessibility and (2) the effect of these  relationships on market area structure. Both of these issues  are fundamental to location theory. The project will develop  probabilistic simulation models run on a supercomputer. The  use of simulation models for this research provides the  potential to include more realistic assumptions into  location theory. In the first phase of the research the  analysis will focus on the interactions between spatial  search and spatial competition for the controlled case of  the single searcher confronted with competing retail  facilities. In the second phase retail stores will compete  for a spatially dispersed, multiple customer base. Of  particular interest is the effect of spatial search on the  structure of market areas. Existing results in the  literature suggest that search behavior can have complex,  and unexpected, influences on facility patronage patterns.       This research will have a significant impact on  location theory through its novel approach to integrating  models of search and competition. Although the immediate  impact of this research is on location theory, it should  also provide guidance for the types of questions and the  techniques used for the empirical analysis of spatial search  behavior.",
