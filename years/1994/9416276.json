 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416276  Uang  This project addresses seismic performance of instrumented  steel moment-resisting frames.  The 1994 Northridge  earthquake caused widespread damage of beam-to-column moment  connections in more than fifty buildings.  This earthquake  shook not only steel framed buildings but also confidence  that the seismic design profession has long held for this  type of premier system. Although design, detailing, and  welding issues of steel moment connections remain to be  investigated experimentally, to improve seismic design of  this type of framing system it is also important to re  examine current seismic provisions.  The main objective of  this research project is to investigate factors that  contribute to damage of this type of frames at the  structural system level.    Many steel moment-resisting frames in the Los Angeles area  have been instrumented by the California Division of Mines  and Geology (CDMG).  Because of the high level of ground  shaking, the recorded response from this earthquake  represents the most valuable data of actual building  performance up to date.  Three instrumented buildings (two  office and one hospital buildings, ranging from 5 to 19  stories high) are selected for intensive study.  Time  history correlation and nonlinear dynamic analysis re  conducted to evaluate actual deformation demand (story  drifts, member and panel zone rotational demands).  The  relationship between the response modification factor and  the structural redundancy, which has not been addressed in  current seismic codes, is also addressed.    The results of this research project will provide  information on realistic deformation demand on moment  connections.  This information is essential for providing  guidelines for future testing of steel moment connections.  The research results on structural redundancy will further  provide a basis for developing a next-generation seismic  code.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
