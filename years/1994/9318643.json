 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318643  GOLLEDGE       It is well known that there are significant differences  in performance levels for spatial tasks between men and  women.  Many scientists have argued that this difference in  performance is an important factor deterring women from  participating more fully in many of the sciences and  engineering.  However, it is unclear whether this difference  in performance is the result of innate sex-related  differences in spatial \"competence\" (i.e. physiological  differences) or in gender-related influences, such as  experience, training, attitude, and culture.  The goal of  this project is to seek a better understanding of the  relative importance of gender-related and sex-related  differences in spatial competence.  This project is being  undertaken by an interdisciplinary team that provides the  breadth necessary to undertake this ambitious research.  A  carefully chosen sample of 80 persons will be thoroughly  studied using a complementary variety of approaches  including personal histories, attitude surveys, behavior  surveys, psychological tests, and laboratory and field tests  of spatial competence and behavior.       This combination of research on social/anthropological  and human geographic factors, along with standard  psychometric test measurements and performance measures on  specific tasks, will provide an indication of the roles that  socially rooted values, expectations, and pressures play in  determining the existence (or lack) of sex-related  explanations of variations in spatial abilities and  performance.  Results of the analysis will contribute  significantly to better understanding the factors behind sex  and gender differences in spatial ability and to enhancement  of theories related to spatial knowledge in general.  As  such, the findings will have major implications for a broad  range of theoretical and practical issues related to gender  and sex differences in spatial performance.",
