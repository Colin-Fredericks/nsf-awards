 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Ydstie - 9316572    In systems engineering, computer science and mathematical physics, there is interest in the study of complexity, global system structures and macroscopic analysis.  This is a consequence of advances made in the stury of nonlinear dynamic systems.  The interest can also be motivated by industrial and societal needs - large systems must be modelled and controlled in the face of a changing environment and significant uncertainty.  Interconnections between systems become increasingly complicated and the decision making processes are integrated.    The aim of this research is to develop a macroscopic theory for process control.  The first law of thermodynamics will be used to develop a reduced complexity description of the process.  The second law will provide a mechanism for dissipation, and Lyapunov analysis will be applied to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of stabilizing controls.   This theory is valid far from equilibrium and it can be applied to a wide range of unsteady state control problems.  A constructive method for control system design will be derived.   The method can be used to decide which variables should be measured and manipulated, how nonlinear combinations of measurements can be used and how equipment and equilibrium constraints limit the control system performance.    The theory will be applied to two systems.  First, the idea of microscopic reversiblity will be used to develop a complete theory for the control of single stage, well mixed processes.   Second, this will be generalized to processes with several well mixed stages.    u    } cs, there is int erest in the study                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             !         !         !         !
