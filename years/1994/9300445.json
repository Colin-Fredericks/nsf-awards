The program  brings students from colleges with limited research opportunities  to the university for their junior years.  Each student works  closely with a faculty mentor from the Regional Research Institute  and experiences the entire research process from defining a topic  to presenting results.  Women and underrepresented minorities have  priority.  The program was developed and refined during a  successful three-year pilot project.     In the Fall semester, the students become familiar with their  substantive areas, learn research skills, begin to understand the  nature of inquiry and scholarly research, and prepare a research  proposal.  In the Spring semester, they work actively on their  research projects and prepare a draft report.  The Summer stage  varies; some students opt to work fulltime on ambitious extensions  of their research, while otheres revise their draft reports.  The  overall goal is to prepare a manuscript suitable for conference  presentation and journal publication.  A group seminar and numerous  other activities prepare the students to conduct research, provide  the opportunity for scholarly interaction, and encourage the  students to attend graduate school.  As Undergraduate Research  Fellows, they are part of the University Honors Program, live in  the Honors dormitory, and participate in Honors classes and  activities.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to  attract talented students into careers in science through active  undergraduate research experiences.  ***",
