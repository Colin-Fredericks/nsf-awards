Early transition metal bent-metallocenes in which a group 13 moiety is a substituent on or a bridging group between cyclopentadienyl rings will be prepared. These Lewis acid  sites are expected to enhance the reactivity of the transition metal complex toward polar substrates and increase the ability of the complexes to serve as olefin polymerization catalysts. Consequently, their reactivity with a variety of small molecules will be investigated.  A number of important industrial chemical processes which are catalyzed by transition metal compounds also employ a main-group,   often aluminum, compound as a co-catalyst. In this project compounds which contain both the transition- and main-group metal  portions will be prepared. They will then be investigated to determine their ability to mediate the reactions of small molecules and to serve as polymerization catalysts.",
