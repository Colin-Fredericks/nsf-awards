 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322475  Goodman       The investigator and Richard Pollack (Courant Institute of  the Mathematical Sciences, NYU) will continue their study of the  interplay between the geometry and the topology of Euclidean  spaces by extending their recent results (1) on a generalization  to Grassmann manifolds of the standard convexity structure of  Euclidean spaces, (2) on the classification of ordered  configurations and their generalizations, and (3) on related  geometric and combinatorial problems.  Building on their past  work on allowable sequences and order types of configurations, as  well as on ideas coming out of their solution of the Vincensini  problem for hyperplane transversals to families of convex bodies  and their recent extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds,  Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on  configurations, arrangements of flats, and geometric transversal  theory.       One of the most elegant things that Goodman and Pollack have  done recently is to extend convexity, as noted above, from sets  of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of higher dimensional  flats, for example lines in ordinary three-space.  One obtains in  this way \"convex\" sets of lines such as all the lines through a  particular point, or all the lines in a particular plane, and  there is nothing especially exciting about these.  However, one  also obtains such sets as all the lines which are surrounded by a  particular hyperboloid of one sheet together with one set of  rulings lying on the surface of the hyperboloid.  Since the  suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes available in  this new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new  geometric conjectures, proofs, and theorems.  ***",
