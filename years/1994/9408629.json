 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408629  Smith    Under the direction of Dr. Michael Smith, Ms. Lisa Cascio will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological research in the Yautepec Valley of Morelos Mexico  and focus on sites from the Classic period when the nearby  Teotihuacan expire reached its maximum extent. She, her advisor  Dr Smith, and crew will conduct a pedestrian survey of the entire  valley floor and foothills. All sites will be identified and  mapped. Surface collections of ceramic and other cultural  materials will be made and test pits will be placed in a  representative series of sites. Artifact analyses will be  conducted and ceramics identified by type. X-ray florescence will  be used to analyze chemical composition and determine sherds of  non-local origin. Based on these data, Ms. Cascio will examine  the relationship between the Yautepec region and the Teotihuacan  empire of which it formed a part.    In prehistoric times, empires which incorporated large  geographical areas and diverse peoples under their control  developed in many parts of both Old and New Worlds. While  archaeologists have documented this phenomenon, relatively little  is understood about how central control was established and  maintained. Prior research has indicated that the Yautepec Valley  lies at the edge of Teotihuacan control and therefore it provides  an excellent context to examine this issue. Based on the  archaeological literature, Ms. Cacsio has formulated several  models and the data she collects will allow her to evaluate  these.    This research is important for several reasons. Very little  archaeological work has been done in this region and the results  will be of interest to many archaeologists. The work will shed  new light on how complex societies develop and are maintained and  will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
