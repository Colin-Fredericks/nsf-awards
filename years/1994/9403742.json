 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403742  Meyn         This proposal concerns development and application of new  methodologies for analysis of complex systems, most of which can  be seen as special cases of general multiclass network systems  with feedback.  Perhaps the most important examples is the design  of semiconductor manufacturing systems, where one impact of the  analysis would include the construction of stable and efficient  routing and scheduling policies; but the applications of  understanding the general systems is far more widespread.       Specifically we propose to carry out research into three  aspects of system analysis:    (i)       Methods of evaluating system stability and instability,            which will include not only discrete and continuous            time representations of systems, but also fluid and            diffusion approximations for such systems;    (ii)      Performance measures on stable systems, and            specifically comparison of rates at which such systems            achieve a stable regime;    (iii)     Robustness of system design against perturbations            in assumptions.         The specific types of applications envisaged include  manufacturing systems, and more general queuing systems with  feedback, for which the stability and performance results to be  developed are well suited.  We will also consider in detail  scheduling algorithms for such systems, and develop simulation  methods for modeling and performance validation.       Overall this project can be expected to deliver new  methodologies which will unify the current work in all of (i)-  (iii); and to provide a number of significant applications to  manufacturing and engineering systems which, of themselves, will  be a major importance in improving design guidelines.    ***",
