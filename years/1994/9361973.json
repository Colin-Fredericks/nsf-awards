 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361973 Kemp          Most electropolishing treatments for stainless steels employ multiple open mildly acidic vessels.  Concerns regarding fumes and carryover of more aggressive acids make commercial treatments for titanium unavailable.  An automated enclosed single tank electropolishing machine provides and environmentally friendly method for titanium.  Workpieces are placed in a dry vacuum tight chamber and necessary fluids are sucked in.  Electrolytes and rinse fluid storage canisters are sealed and rinse fluids are continuously deactivated.  All servicing is through removal and replacement of sealed tanks.          The work includes construction of a working model and the verification of procedures which include pulse current and ultrasonic capabilities.  Phase I will also include metallurgical characterization of electropolished titanium and zirconium samples.  Phase II includes prototype construction with complete automation and the characterizing of metallurgical effects on representative ferrous, nickel, and reactive alloys.  Immediate beneficiary will be the medical industry where titanium is now finished by manual polishing.  Longer term the new system can move many electroplate/polish operations into the clean computer controlled environment of the modern production facility.",
