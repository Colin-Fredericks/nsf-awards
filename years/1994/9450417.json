Certificated Science/Math teachers will provide  instruction emphasizing the hands-on approach involving student  activities and projects.  Learning activities will center on the  theme of WATER, its multitude of uses and how it impacts our daily  lives.  Students will be housed in the Outdoor Education Center  which is located in the Sierra foothills.  This is an area rich in  geological examples, fossils, environmental issues, power  generating facilities and scientific stimuli.    Professional scientists, mathematicians, engineers and individuals  from related fields will participate in the instructional program  and serve as mentors.  They will focus upon the importance of  remaining in school, the selection of science and math courses and  the choice of careers available if the students pursue the path of  learning.    Selected students will matched with a control group on the basis of  ethnicity, gender, age, and community type (urban, small community,  and rural).  Comparisons will be made over a five-year span on  frequency of dropouts, selection of science and math courses in  high school, grades in these courses, attendance, and frequency of  attendance in higher education institutions.  The results of this  study will be disseminated to cooperating school districts,  supporting organizations, the National Science Foundation and  minority organizations such as the NAACP, the Hispanic Leadership  Council, The Asian Coalition, etc.  ***",
