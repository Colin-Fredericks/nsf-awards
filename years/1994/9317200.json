 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317200  Hansell  The growing season for phytoplankton in polar oceans is short,  but intense.  There is an increasing body of evidence that in  many Antarctic habitats, the most active period may be very early  in the season, a period that has not been emphasized in previous  investigations.  This project is part of an interdisciplinary  program that focuses on the dynamics of the spring phytoplankton  bloom in a highly productive subsystem of the Antarctic, the Ross  Sea.  The overall program will test hypotheses related to the  initiation of the phytoplankton bloom shortly after the onset of  ice melt, the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth and  productivity in spring, the implications and short-term fate of  high productivity in spring, and the transition from spring to  midsummer conditions.  The overall goal of this proposal is to  determine the importance and role of dissolved organic carbon  (DOC) as an intermediate in the carbon cycle of the Southern  Ocean.  It is estimated that almost 1000 gigatons of reduced  carbon reside in this pool globally and that it has a turnover  time 6000 years.  The average net oceanic carbon dioxide2 uptake  of 2.1 gigatons (Quay et al., 1992) is only a fraction of a  percent of the DOC pool so a perturbation in the DOC production  or sink terms could strongly impact the balance between oceanic  and atmospheric carbon.  Yet the dynamics of this large pool  remain an enigma, particularly in high latitude environments  where concentrations of DOC can be very high.  The specific  objectives of this work are 1) to determine the concentrations of  both the total and biologically labile pools of dissolved organic  carbon in the coastal polynya of the Ross Sea during Phaeocystis-  and diatom-dominated spring blooms, 2) to measure the rates of  mineralization and production of DOC during these blooms in the  surface mixed layer, and 3) to infer the export of DOC from the  surface waters via deep mixing.  This project will contribute to  an improved under standing of DOC cycling in the Southern Ocean.",
