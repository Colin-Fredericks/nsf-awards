 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403596  Forest/Overman       The primary project relates to the equations of nonlinear  Schrodinger type which govern pulse transmission in fiber optics.  Scalar NLS is the model equation for monomode fibers, while  coupled systems of NLS equations describe birefringent fibers,  switching devices, fiber-fiber links, etc. While the integrable  theory and near-integrable perturbation methods are  well-developed for scalar NLS, these fundamental results are  still open for coupled NLS equations. We propose to develop  several interconnected projects in this proposal: the spectral  transform construction of pulse train solutions for coupled NLS;  explicit characterization of integrable instabilites; numerical  codes to implement the spectral transform in conjunction with  full pde codes for the precise optical perturbations of coupled  NLS pdes; nearly integrable perturbation methods to understand  the observed simulations. Ultimately, our goal is to predict and  understand the robust, optimal transmission and switching limits  of present fiber optic technology, in cooperation with and driven  by industry collaborators.  Fiber optics technology is  fundamental to modern communications and the electronic  superhighway. Advantages in this technology can clearly be  achieved by accurate models and simulation of the transmission  along these various fibers. While long-distance communication  lines are now on sound mathematical and engineering grounds,  various new fibers and applications lead to more complicated  model equations and quite different issues need to be understood.  The fundamental governing equations for fiber optics consist of a  single nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, while the newer  applications are governed by coupled NLS equations. The theory  and nonlinear diagnostic tools for the solitons of NLS are NOT  yet known for the coupled NLS pdes--these valuable methods are  precisely the goals of our proposal. We intend to develop these  methods on the equations of practical interes t, with the  collaboration of optics experts in academics and industry, and  focused on the problems of technological concern.",
