 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408841  Boyer    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in  physical modeling of ocean currents between Don L. Boyer, Arizona  State University and Peter A. Davies of the University of Dundee.  The objective of their research is to develop physical models of  the interaction of tidal currents and other unsteady background  flows with bathymetry in the vicinity of continental shelf  breaks.  They will investigate phenomenon such as fronts and  their instabilities, mean along and cross-isobath volume  transports, hydraulic jumps and internal waves.     The collaboration with the University of Dundee allows the  investigators to apply this modeling approach to specific oceanic  regions.  The U.K. investigator's research is part of a large  European Community Marine Science and Technology (MAST) program  that includes similar studies along the Iberian and North West  European continental shelves.  This collaboration takes advantage  of extensive field measurements and modeling efforts of MAST.  Their research will provide integrated data sets on specific  sites, including the Portuguese section of the Iberian shelf and  the Hebridean shelf edge, and should accelerate the modeling  efforts of both groups. The results will further our  understanding of physical aspects of ocean currents.  ***",
