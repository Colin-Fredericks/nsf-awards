McDonald, P.I.)%%%       There is an ever growing body of evidence that retroviruses  and retroviral-like transposable elements are a major source of  mutation in higher eukaryotes including humans.  The  ramifications of this fact extend to a broad range of biological  disciplines ranging from medicine to evolutionary genetics.   Although we now know a great deal on the mechanisms of how  retroviral-like elements  alter the expression of chromosomal  genes, little or nothing is  known concerning how retroviral  elements are maintained and spread within and between species.   In addition, it remains a mystery as to how retroviral elements  insertion mutations which are usually non-adaptive can  nevertheless increase in frequency and eventually become \"fixed\"  (i.e., attain a frequency of 1.00) in some species over time.   One possibility is that host chromosomal genes capable of  suppressing the mutant phenotype associated with retroviral  insertion variants are present in natural populations and serve  to harbor insertion variants by shielding them from natural  selection.  Dr. McDonald hypothesizes that insertion variants may  periodically increase in frequency due to \"founder events\" or  other such forced inbreeding effects.%%%       Over the next three years Dr. McDonald will study the  mechanisms by which the copia retroviral-like element is  maintained and spread through natural populations of Drosophila.   Drosophila is an ideal system for these studies because  retroviral elements are well understood in this organism and  element frequency and mutational effects can be easily monitored.    Dr. McDonald will be concentrating on identifying host genes  capable of trans-regulating retroviral elements and studying  their frequency and mode of action in a number of Drosophila  species.  The DNA sequence of copia elements isolated from a  number of Drosophila populations and species will be analyzed t o  determine if structural differences which might affect element  activity are variable in natural populations.  Dr. McDonald will  search for transregulatory effects by introducing the same copia  LTR-reporter gene construct into several strains and species and  monitoring the effect of LTR mediated expression.  Results will  shed light on the factors determining the maintenance and spread  of retroviral elements in natural populations and species of all  higher eukaryotes.  ***",
