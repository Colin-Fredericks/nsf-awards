 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362028  Miccotto         There is a definite trend in early childhood education  away from rote learning methods toward more child directed,  activity based learning. As children act upon and change the  external environment, they internally construct knowledge.   Constructivism stresses hands-on interactive learning  through problem solving activities that provoke thought and  reflection.              Many early childhood educators have endorsed and  integrated games as a primary means of Mathematics and Logic  education. Some games can provide an excellent opportunity  for children to compare, seriate, equate, count, and  establish a concept of number and logic. Unfortunately, they  games weren't designed for this specific purpose, and often  don't provide the level of interaction desired. Furthermore,  todays sophisticated children often tire of simple games.              We propose to empirically test the hypothesis that  interactive games can more efficiently promote constructive  abstraction of the concept of number, concept of inclusion,  concept of conservation, and other basic mathematical and  logical thought functions. Cognition of these concepts at an  early age would lay the foundation for development of higher  rational powers and independent thought. Furthermore, it  would directly improve mathematics performance, confidence,  and enthusiasm in later education.  ***",
