The meeting will be include a Yeast Genome Workshop to update the community on the international effort to sequence the yeast genome and to discuss the implications of this work for yeast research.  In light of the recent progress made to elucidate the motor components of the yeast kinetochore, the Committee has decided to include a special session on Molecular Motors.  Other sessions will cover such topics as nuclear architecture, DNA replication, cell cycle control, telomeres and position effects, mutations that cause missegregation, meiotic chromosome segregation and the components of the mitotic spindle.  %%%  A conference on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replications and Segregation will be held by the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) July 23-28, 1994 at the University of California at Santa Cruz.  The main objective of this conference is to bring together a small group of leading scientists in the field to discuss their recent work and exchange ideas.  The participation of minority researchers and younger scientists as well as postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will be encouraged. There is abundant evidence that what is discovered from studying yeast is relevant to our understanding of mammalian chromosomes.  Many of the components that participate in the organization and function of chromosomes are highly conserved among all eucaryotes, from yeast to man.  Already, some of the molecular and genetic studies on yeast chromosomes have led to discoveries of similar gene products in higher organisms. Understanding the basic mechanisms of chromosome segregation is essential for the prevention of chromosome transmission problems in humans.  Aneuploidy, genome rearrangements and other chromosomal abnormalities are k nown to play important roles in cancer, spontaneous abortion and birth defects.  ***",
