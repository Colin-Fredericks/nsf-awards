 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317691  Wilkins  This proposal requests support to permit replacement of an  obsolete PDP-11 computer system controlling two mass  spectrometers located in the Southern California Regional  Mass Spectrometry Facility. That computer controls both a  VG-7070 and a VG-ZAB mass spectrometer which provide  services to Southern California academic scientists doing  research primarily in the fields of biology, biochemistry,  and chemistry. It is intended to replace the current slow  single computer with two modern independent stand-alone  systems, along with the requisite interface hardware and  software. This computer upgrade will substantially reduce  mass spectral sample turn-around times and eliminate the  possibility that both mass spectrometers become inoperable  as a result of a single computer malfunction. As described  in the \"project description section\" mass spectrometric  analysis is a vital part of any synthetic research involving  preparation and characterization of chemicals with  biological functions. Thus, the proposed equipment upgrade  is expected to have a major impact upon the rate of research  progress for all facility users.",
