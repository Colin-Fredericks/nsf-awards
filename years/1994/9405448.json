 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405448  Baldwin    On timescales from a week through interannual there is considerable  variability of tropospheric flow patterns.  This study will focus  on understanding how much of the low-frequency variability of the  stratosphere can be accounted for by stationary wave patterns in  the troposphere.  The general approach will be to identify patterns  in the mid-troposphere that are linked with stratosphere flow.   Particular attention will be paid to the possible influences of El  Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the stratosphere that may be   communicated through modulation of the extratropical tropospheric  flow.    The PI will use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and  singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of the tropospheric  height field together with correlations, composites and spectral  analysis to identify modes which, on interannual and interseasonal  timescales, seem to have a significant stratospheric influence.   The complementary nonlinear technique of cluster analysis will also  be used.    A series of experiments using a GCM with simplified physics will be  used to study the response of the middle atmosphere to tropospheric  circulation anomalies.  The experiments will be designed to  determine the model's stratospheric response to tropospheric  anomaly patterns.  Comparing the response of the model's winter  stratosphere with the resultq of the data analysis should provide  a valuable method of identifying the contribution to winter  stratospheric interannual variability from tropospheric anomalies.    As part of this study the PI will use gridded ECMWF data analyses  in conjunction with rawinsonde data, to determine tropical  tropospheric horizontal wave structure to better elucidate the  different types of synoptic-scale disturbances that exist in the  tropical troposphere and their vertical coupling, if any, to the  stratosphere.  The focus is specifically on organized, westward-  traveling, synoptic-scale waves in the tropical lower atmosphere  that  may be involved in the excitation of Rossby-gravity waves.   Disturbances in both lower and upper troposphere will ne  investigated, as will any vertical coupling between the two layers.    This research is important because it should enhance our  understanding of important climate processes related to  stratospheric-tropospheric dynamics.",
