In particular  they will try to extend their theory of local real algebraic  geometry from dimension two to dimension 3. They will also study  consequences of their recent proof of the existence of a  completely normal spectral space which is not the real spectrum  of any commutative ring.       This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of  the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed  to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
