 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conspicuous traits, such as vocalization in frogs or insects  and showy plumage or bright coloration in birds, are  perplexing because often they reduce the survivorship of the  individual because they are costly to produce or display.  In this project possible year-round benefits to conspicuous  coloration in male Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis  cardinalis), a species which has bright plumage throughout  the year will be studied.  One experiment will determine  whether coloration influences territory quality and/or a  male's ability to pair with an earlier breeding female.  The  coloration of males just prior to the breeding season will  be manipulated in one of three ways - increase red, control  (no color change), and decrease red.  If coloration during  the breeding season influences territory quality and/or  timing of breeding, then significant differences among the  treatment groups will be expected.  If a male's coloration  during the non-breeding season affects his ability to obtain  a high quality territory and/or an earlier breeding mate,  then the natural coloration prior to the manipulation to be  correlated with these benefits will be expected.  The second  experiment will test whether red coloration influences a  male's access to food and quality roosting sites.  The same  three treatments will be used and will determine foraging  efficiency and choice of roost site for males in an aviary.  These results should be of interest not only to behavioral  biologists and ornithologists interested in sexual selection  but also to evolutionary and theoretical biologists  interested in the evolution of costly traits.",
