Typical of the area, Kilgore has a high percentage  of low-income families and a high minority population.  Total  enrollment for the campus is approximately 8,670 students with  4,570 in credit degree courses.  After a careful needs assessment,  the area of immediate need is the expansion of lab facilities to  include multimedia technologies for Computer Science majors.  This  grant  allows introductory computer science classes to enhance the  students education through multimedia in cooperative learning  groups.  Curriculum has been developed to include hands-on  activities using telecommunication, audio and video digitizing,  video disc, CD-ROM products and hypermedia.  Hypermedia  applications allow students to manipulate information in the form  of text, graphics, video, voice, and animation, and to access large  amounts of this information quickly and efficiently through the  creation of logical linkage.  The goal for the student lab  assignment is to allow each programming structure to be covered in  a visual and exciting way using multimedia technology so that this  enthusiasm and understanding can be carried to the students' other  programming courses.  Our society has changed dramatically over the  past decade, and our colleges must be restructured to accommodate  the increase in information and the technology used in harnessing  that information.  The hardware purchase allows students to expand  their knowledge of computer science through multimedia programming.",
