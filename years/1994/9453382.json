 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453382  STOLE  This award provides support to Dr. Lars Stole under the National  Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) Program.   The PFF Program was established at the request of the President  of the United States to recognize and support the scholarly  activities of some of the Nation's most outstanding science and  engineering faculty members early in their careers.  Awards are  intended to allow Fellows to undertake self-designed, innovative  research and teaching projects, to establish research and  teaching programs, and to pursue other academic related  activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research  agenda of understanding incentives within and between economic  organizations.  Two separate fields of inquiry, the economic  theory of contracts and the economics of industrial  organizations, contribute to our present understanding of  internal and external organization (and the nexus of interactions  between them).  Dr. Stole will bring both of these literatures  together to bear upon the problem of economic organization.  In  particular, he will construct new theories to understand the  incentive and welfare implications of (1) competitive  externalities across bilateral agency relationships; and (2) the  internal multilateral organization of the firm.  In the first,  the goal is to extend the design paradigm of contract theory to  multiple principal settings, and then use the methodology to  understand competitive environments.  In the second, the goal is  to determine incentive effects of organizational design and  intrafirm input markets.    This research addresses important issues relating to contractual  interactions within organizations and between as well as  insider/outsider theories of unemployment.  As an economist in  the School of Business, Dr. Stole has been very successful in  imparting the insights of microeconomics to MBA students, making  economics accessible and useful for practicing professionals, as  well as in training  doctoral students in economics.  This five  year award will enable him to continue his important research as  well as to train students in his interdisciplinary work spanning  economics, business, law, and political science.",
