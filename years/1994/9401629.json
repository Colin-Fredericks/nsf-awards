 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GEM program's second major observational and analysis campaign  will be on the physics of the magnetotail and substorms.  A  critical question for magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is to  determine from where in the magnetosphere do magnetic field lines  map to connect to the nighttime auroral ionosphere.  This question  becomes even more important for understanding substorm dynamics  when significant changes to the magnetospheric configuration occur  during this episodic release of energy.  A recent study by Burke et  al.  1993a  has identified the high latitude boundary of the  nighttime auroral region as magnetically connecting to the distant  x-line in the geomagnetic tail.  This identifies the open/closed  boundary for magnetotail magnetic field lines.  We propose a  correlative analysis effort using DMSP satellite data and ground-  based data from Svalbard and Sondrestrom to determine the  characteristics of this boundary as seen jointly in both data sets,  to confirm the magnetospheric interpretation of the boundary where  possible using GEOTAIL data, and to resolve the spatial and  temporal variations of this boundary.  Optical data from a network  or auroral TV and meridian scanning photometers in Svalbard and  Greenland will be combined with radar data from Sondrestrom to  compare with DMSP satellite data.  Three DMSP satellites measuring  ion  drift, plasma characteristics and energetic particle  precipitation currently monitor the high latitude ionosphere  continuously.  Directly overhead passes will establish critical  signatures.  The spatial and temporal dynamics of this boundary can  then be determined with spatially separated data sets.  Application  of these results will place constraints on the geotail  configuration during substorms and will aid in the development of  a model of the substorm process.  We plan two observation periods:   January 1994 and December 1994 through January 1995.  The first  coincides with the planned GEM World Day period and when GEOTAIL is  at  an apogee of 100 R near midnight.  The second corresponds to  special observation periods for additional ground-based data.  We  proposed to collaborate with other GEM investigators to jointly  define and analyze special campaign events for elucidation of  substorm and geotail physics.",
