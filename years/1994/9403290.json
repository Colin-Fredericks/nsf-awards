 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403290  Thomson     Factors contributing to the distribution of subalpine meadows  and forests in western Colorado will be studied in an attempt to  establish firm intellectual connections between population  processes and landscape patterns in the ecological sciences.  Disturbance and herbivory by the pocket gopher, Thomomys talpoides,  serve as the foci of the investigation.  Manipulations of pocket  gopher densities will be compared using sonic deterrence and  trapping on plots set out in a factorial design.  Seismic sensing  will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that forest - meadow  ecotones are driven by subsurface rock profiles that limit gopher  activity.  Spatial autocorrelation methods will be employed to  relate shallow seismic profiles to indices of vegetation and gopher  activity.  Specialists in landscape ecology, geographic information  systems (GIS), and spatial statistics will be consulted.  %%%  Results will serve as a basis for designing long - term studies of  gopher exclusion at ecotones (an ecotone is a transition area that  bounds two adjacent ecological community types, such as forest and  grassland).  The work has implications for land use policy, given  that current use in the region consists of a mosaic of residential  development, wilderness, tourism, grazing, and timbering, all of  which are affected by large scale factors of logging, fire,  avalanches and snow - creep, and grazing (by both native ungulates  and livestock).  The surmise that as plant predators, pocket  gophers have potent effects on ecological succession is thus far  relatively untested.  ***",
