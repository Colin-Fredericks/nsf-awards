 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414719  Alesina         The last decade has witnessed an unprecedented process of  democratization, not only in Eastern Europe but also in large  parts of the developing world.  At the same time, and partly as a  result of this institutional change, the borders of nations have  been redrawn to an extent which is quite exceptional for modern  peacetime history.  Fiscal issues are crucial determinants of  decisions concerning borders of political jurisdictions.  In  fact, the definition of borders and the political mechanisms  which lead to fiscal decisions greatly influence the final  distribution of costs and benefits of taxation and spending.  For  example, much of the difficulty in ratifying the Maastricht  agreement lies in the fear that richer and/or more fiscally  \"responsible\" countries and regions will bear some of the fiscal  burden of poorer and/or less responsible regions.  This research  project studies the interaction between fiscal policy decisions  and the definition of boundaries of political jurisdictions.  In  particular, it examines how democratization leads to changes in  social choice decisions concerning both political boundaries and  fiscal (de)centralization.         Models with social planners have suggested various arguments  in favor of centralized fiscal decisions in relatively large  political jurisdictions, particularly when the redistributive  aspects of fiscal policy are important.  This implication appears  inconsistent with the recent tendency toward secessionism and the  renewed difficulties of moving toward a political union in the  European community.  We emphasize how diversity and heterogeneity  among individuals and regions influence, through the voting  process, the decision about (de)centralization and the definition  of boundaries.  Heterogeneity with voting gives rise to a much  richer and more realistic set of results, relative to social  planner models.  The project considers several aspects of this  general problem by focusing on different types o f fiscal policy,  i.e., public good provision, insurance, redistribution, on  different types of institutions, i.e., dictatorial regimes versus  democratic ones, different voting rules, and other institutional  differences.",
