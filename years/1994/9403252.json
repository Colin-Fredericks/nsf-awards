 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403252  Ackerly     Other functional and comparative studies have dealt with intra-  and interspecific variation of various plant characters, but use of  phylogeny reconstruction to investigate evolution and coadaptation  among aspects of canopy design is novel.  Four components comprise  this project: a) using material from living collections (botanical  gardens), a DNA - based phylogeny will be generated for 30 to 40  North American and Asian species of maple (Acer, of which there are  more than a hundred species altogether), b) a broad survey of  interspecific variation in canopy architecture will be conducted,  c) intraspecific variation in populations of six eastern North  American species are to be studied, and d) methods of phylogenetic  comparative analysis will be applied to test for correlated  evolutionary change among suites of leaf and canopy architectural  traits.  %%%  The adaptive significance of tree canopy architecture is a long -  standing problem in plant ecology.  Adoption of a systematics  methodology to the question is innovative, unique, and one that  certainly holds significant promise for environmental biology.  The  incorporation of a molecular evolution aspect in the work also  bolsters it.  In addition to benefits to fundamental scientific  knowledge, potential spin - offs would include the possibility that  plant architecture attributes could be genetically altered in the  future, for horticultural / ornamental or other purposes.  ***",
