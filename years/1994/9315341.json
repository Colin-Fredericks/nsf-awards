 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315341  Heiney    Discotic liquid crystals are generally composed of organic molecules with a rigid disk-shaped core  and 6-8 alkyl tails. Depending on the temperature and molecular geometry, these molecules can form  either nematic phases or columnar structures with long-range intercolumnar order and only short-  range intracolumnar order. Such columnar structures represent a new ordering of dimensionalities  for a condenssd state of matter: they are ordered in two dimensions and disordered in one.  Further, discotic donor-acceptor complexes formed by doping with an electron acceptor such as  iodine may combine the electrical properties of semiconductors or conductors with the anisotropic  mechanical, optical, and structural properties of liquid crystals. Discogenic molecules can  aggregate at the air-water interface to form Langmuir films, and thence be transferred to solid  substrates to form Langmuir-Blodgett films. The columnar structure of these materials is reflected  in transport anisotropy. Such thin films are of interest as model low-dimensional systems and for  display applications and the development of pressure  sensors.    In this research, studies on discotic liquid crystals are conducted to correlate the structure of  bulk phases, the structure of thin films, and the conductivity of both three-dimensional and two-  dimensional materials. The primary tools employed will be x-ray diffraction, atomic force  microscopy, and voltammetry, in conjunction with standard characterization by optical microscopy and  calorimetry. The materials studied will include triphenylene and truxene derivatives, hexacyclens,  and phthalocyanine derivatives; the latter are synthetic analogs of porphyrins that are of interest  because of their electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. Additionally, the properties of  newly conceived heptameric \"supradisks\" and tubular compounds will be characterized and explored.    ***",
