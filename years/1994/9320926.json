 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320926  Pint  This research proposes to estimate water demand and price  elasticities using residential billing data from Alameda  County Water District in California over the period 1982 to  1992. The empirical part of the research will use data for  599 single-family households, as well as information on  house size, lot size, household income, weather variables,  and other socioeconomic variables from the 1980 and 1990  censuses. The demand equation also controls for variables  that capture drought management policies used by the water  agencies, such as publicity, distribution of water-saving  devices, and use restrictions.  Data on household water rate  schedules, water use and other price measures are obtained  from California water agencies that used price increases as  a drought management policy.  The project is important because it promises to produce  reliable estimates of price elasticities of water demand  that would assist water agency managers in all parts of the  United states in assessing the effectiveness of price as a  conservation device, the effects of relatively large price  increases on household water use and water agency revenues,  and the potential consumer surplus losses due to droughts.  Moreover, the findings from this study would become  increasingly valuable if global climate change caused larger  or more frequent water shortages to occur in the United  States.  ***",
