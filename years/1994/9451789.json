 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451789  Zielinski  Three modern laser experiments with complementing computational  chemistry components are being incorporated into the physical  chemistry laboratory courses.  A nitrogen pumped dye laser and  boxcar gate setup is being used to study the atomic spectroscopy of  Ne or Ar.  The same laser system is being used to study the  photochemistry of Ru(II) diimine complexes where short time-scale  (10 - 100 ns) measurements of luminescent lifetimes are being used  to analyze the collision induced energy transfer between excited  metal complexes and organic quenchers.  The nitrogen laser is being  used with gated integration to implement an introductory Raman  spectroscopy study of CCI4, C2H50H, or C6H6.  These experiments use  a versatile computer interface and a departmental PC to control  scanning, acquisition and manipulation of data, and subsequent  plotting of results.  This is exposing our majors to modern optics  and computer based data acquisition techniques in a non-black box  learning situation.  An IBM RS6000 computer workstation is being  used to implement the theoretical complement to each experiment.   Spartan v3.0 software is providing a convenient and easy interface  for students to compute and visualize molecular orbitals and  molecular structures.  The theoretical studies are intimately  integrated into the spectroscopy experiments using the lasers and  the departmental FTIR and UV-VIS instruments.  The full integration  of the three components, spectroscopy experiments, theoretical  chemistry, and molecular modeling, is essential for the  modernization of physical chemistry laboratory.  Methods for  implementation of these integrated experiments would be of major  interest to other undergraduate institutions seeking to sustain  student interest in physical chemistry.",
