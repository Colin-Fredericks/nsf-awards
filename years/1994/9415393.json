The U.S. team will be headed by  David Smith, professor of medicinal chemistry at Purdue  University.  The Pakistani organizer is Zafar Zaidi of the HEJ  Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry at the University of Karachi.   Past symposia have achieved high levels of success.  They have    attracted leading international protein chemists including Nobel   Laureates and have been effective in developing contacts that  often lead to collaborations among scientists from over a dozen  countries.  Proceedings from all the symposia have been    published.  The six day symposium will be followed by a one week  workshop on protein structure elucidation and will provide  substantial training for research fellows, members of the  teaching faculty, and students from Pakistan and neighboring  countries.     Scope:  This is a significant meeting on an important topic in  basic science that has many direct applications in health and  agriculture.  These gatherings do much to catalyze the   development of biochemistry in Pakistan and South Asia, and they   provide a unique training opportunity for budding young  scientists in the region.  The host institute has excellent  facilities for research in this area of analytical biochemistry.   The Karachi area is well suited due to the concentration there of  the pharmaceutical and natural medicines industries.      NSF funds will be used to support the U.S. participants and   partial support for a few young scientists from neighboring  countries in South Asia.       ***",
