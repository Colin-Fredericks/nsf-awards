To achieve this goal, the program helps the students to experience, first-hand, several of the most rewarding activities that characterize most graduate programs and research careers. Specifically, the program gives eight student participants during each of three summers the opportunity to:    1. Conduct Research: Each of the eight students are paired with a faculty mentor who guides the student in carrying out a research project.    2. Disseminate Information: The program sponsors a seminar series in which the students regularly explain the progress of their research to the entire group. Each student also prepare a final written report summarizing the results of the research. As part of the recruiting process, each student provides a letter of support from a faculty member who agrees to arrange for the student to present the results of his/her research at the student's home institution during the following academic year.     3. Participate in a Community of Scholars: By providing a set of common experiences for the students, the program encourages these young researchers to build an informal community of scholars among themselves. The common experiences include participation in critiques of student talks, periodic group lunches, and attendance at presentations given by faculty members and guest speakers on various topics (e.g., discussion of a research interest, description of a particular career option, and discussion of the process of applying  to graduate school.)    u     software design, and     (4) The production of undergraduate research papers which can be published and presented at regional or national conferences.     u    projects from neural network based learning in robotics to machine vision to VLSI design and implementation. This diversity makes it possible to stimulate students with a broad spectrum of professional interests9322371  Berque  This program is intended to encourage talented undergraduates to pursue graduate study and research careers in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             U   W                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !           !           !           !           !
