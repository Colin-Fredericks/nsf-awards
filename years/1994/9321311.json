 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321311  Newton  The Maize Genetics group has met on an annual basis for the past 35  years to discuss recent research advances.  A broad range of topics  are covered from cytogenetics to molecular genetics and includes  chromosome mechanics, cytoplasmic inheritance, mapping,  transposable element behavior, gene identification and expression,  development, tissue culture and transformation.  Although most  participants are from academic institutions in the U.S., a number  of European scientists and increasing numbers of industry-  affiliated scientists attend.  It is also usually the first meeting  that U.S., graduate students in maize genetics laboratories attend.   The emphasis is on reporting recent, unpublished data and  presentations by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are  strongly encouraged.  The meeting is an essential gathering for  scientists working with maize, but is open to other plant  scientists who wish to learn from the strong heritage of maize  genetics.  Indeed, there is a long tradition of cooperation and the  open sharing of information and stocks in the maize genetics  community.  To perpetuate the spirit of free exchange and  cooperation is one of the most important objectives of the meeting.   The format has evolved with time and with the increased attendance,  but the strong sense of community has been retained.  ****  The Maize Genetics Meeting will be held March 24-27, 1994 at the  Pheasant Run Conference Center, near Chicago, Illinois.  The  localized site will enhance the interactions between the  established investigators and younger scientists, all of whom use  corn as an experimental organism regardless of their expertise and  interests.  Thus, many of these productive interactions would not  occur except for this meeting.  %%%%",
