Far too few minorities attend graduate school in most fields, but  especially in SEM fields.  National data shows that approximately 20% of SEM students attend  graduate school immediately following the reception of their Bachelor Degree each year, but because  minority enrollments in graduate school are so low we would like to at least double that percentage.    The proposed five-year funding will support 70 RCMS students, 60 will be supported in the SEM  disciplines and 10 in the NSF supported SBS disciplines.  Participants in the RCMS program at  TAMU are selected from undergraduate under-represented minority students at Texas A&M  University who have a GPA of 3.0 or greater.  Half of the students in the program over the past five  years have been minority women.      Junior and Senior students are actively involved in research projects with faculty mentors.  They also  service as role models through their involvement in RCMS outreach activities to public schools with  high minority enrollments.  Freshmen and sophomore participants attend a  variety of seminars  designed to introduce them to the research opportunities available nationally and at TAMU.  These  seminars are hosted by faculty research mentors, senior minority scholars, representatives from other  research institutions, and professional from private sectors.    Other core activities of the RCMS program include participation in faculty mentorship, presentations  at the RCMS/AMP Research Symposium. special Research Problem Courses, AS URT ( A Seminar in  University Research and Teaching), RCMS Meetings (GRE Preparations, Summer Internships,  Fellowships), RCMS/AMP Student Teaming in Research, and Ph.D. Pipeline Bridging.    TEES will be matching funds with PI, Co-PI, Graduate Student and program Coordinator salaries and  fringe benefits.  TEES will also match 45% of the modified total direct cost.    We propose to get more undergraduate who are under-represented minorities to graduate with a B.S.  and enter graduate school in one of the SEM/SBS disciplines.  This RCMS program will be a  continuation of a five year program that was implemented in 1989.  130 students  participated in that  program and  52% have graduated with a  B.S. with 44% of them currently enrolled in a graduate  program and 13% are currently working on a Ph.D.    Participants will present their research project findings at a conference/symposium to faculty,  administrators, industry supports and program directors.  The program coordinator and PI's will also  present the RCMS program at conferences such as ASEE, NAMEPA.",
