The  approach will be to use date from the recently solved x-ray crystal  structures of both nitrogenase components coupled with site-  directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization of altered  proteins to define the functions of specific amino acids in the  mechanism of this reaction.  A series of amino acids within the  iron protein (FeP) components of nitrogenase have been targeted as  a result of their conservation among iron proteins from 22  different organisms, their inclusion in nucleotide binding motifs  and by their location in the x-ray structure of the FeP.  The  specific objectives for this project period will be to elucidate  the function of amino acids within the FeP involved in:  1)  nucleotide phosphate binding and hydrolysis, 2) adenine  recognition, 3) component docking and electron transfer and 4) the  MgATP induced conformational change.  A system has been developed  that allows the rapid generation of altered FePs by site-directed  mutagenesis with expression in Azotobacter vinelandii.  The altered  proteins will be purified and subjected to detailed biochemical and  biophysical characterizations to determine the function of the  original amino acid.  These characterization studies will include  steady state and pre-steady state kinetic studies, analysis of  conformational states, and structure determination by x-ray  crystallography.  Preliminary results have begun to define residues  in the FeP that are essential to MgATP binding and hydrolysis and  to the conformational switch that is part of the energy  transduction mechanism.  It is expected that the results from this  project will provide a more detailed biochemical understanding of  the MgATP coupled electron transfer mechanism in nitrogenase and  will have broader applications to our knowledge of  other nucleotide  coupled energy transduction systems.  Finally, the results from  this study should provide a foundation of knowledge required to  initiate rational protein engineering of nitrogenase to develop new  properties such as altered nucleotide affinities.  %%%  The long range objective of this project is to define the mechanism  by which MgATP hydrolysis is coupled to electron transfer and  substrate reduction in the metalloenzyme complex, nitrogenase.   Reduced forms of nitrogen are essential to all living organisms.   The need for reduced nitrogen is especially limiting in modern  agriculture where it must be supplied in the form of fertilizers.   The nitrogen in fertilizers is prepared by a chemical reaction that  requires large amounts of energy in the form of high temperatures  and pressures.  In contrast to this chemical process, many soil  bacteria can convert atmospheric N2, a gas that constitutes 80% of  the air that we breath, into ammonia, an agriculturally useful  nitrogen source, without the requirements for high temperature or  pressure.  This bacterial process, called nitrogen fixation, is  catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase.  Nitrogenase catalyzed ammonia  production accounts for the largest total input of fixed nitrogen  into environment and represents a very attractive alternative to  industrially prepared fertilizers for agriculture.  We are  investigating the mechanism of this biological process at the  molecular level, especially the requirement for the cellular energy  source MgATP.  Our approach will be to combine modern genetic  cloning techniques with biochemical and biophysical techniques to  define the mechanism of energy utilization by nitrogenase.  We  anticipate that the results of our investigations will provide a  detailed understanding of the mechanism of nitrogenase and will  provide the foundation knowledge that will be required to initiate  protein engineering of nitrogenase.  Such studies could prove  valuable to the future utilization of nitrogen ase in agriculture.   ***",
