These  include introductory chemistry, organic chemistry, an  instrumentation course for non-chemistry majors, and advanced level  laboratory.  In addition, the instrument will be used in  undergraduate research projects. The student body is about 75%  women who will be served by these improvements.  There are also  plans to do outreach to help upgrade teaching at local schools.    This project will fit well into the Chemistry Department objectives  which include: 1. To continually update lecture material in all  courses to reflect advances in the field of chemistry; 2. To  strengthen all laboratory courses by providing hands-on experience  with modern instrumentation of the quality and type comparable to  that used in research and industry; 3. To enrich the Department of  Chemistry programs by providing increased opportunities for  students to engage in independent projects using research quality  instrumentation; 4. To acquaint the students with modern techniques  in computational analysis and computer data acquisition methods; 5.  To replace and upgrade existing equipment for purposes of increased  efficiency and versatility in all laboratory courses.",
