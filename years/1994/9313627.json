 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313627  Spielmann    Under the direction of Dr. Katherine Spielmann, Mr. Peter  Whitridge will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He has  begun and will continue archaeological excavations at the site of  PaJs-2 which is located in the Central Canadian arctic and was  inhabited by Thule Eskimo peoples between ca. 1100 - 1450 A.D.  Preliminary data indicate that the site was occupied recurrently  for six to eight months a year by a group of 100 to 200 people  whose economy centered in intensive harvesting of bowhead whales.  Over the course of excavation, Mr. Whitridge will expose seven  domestic dwellings, a ceremonial house and surrounding activity  areas and middens. Because of permafrost conditions, artifactual  material is well preserved and provide detailed insight into the  lives of these prehistoric peoples. Mr. Whitridge will focus on  status differentiation and will examine materials to gain insight  into the degree of differential access to economic resources.  Thus valued foods - as reflected in animal bone - and exotic and  scarce commodities will provide a focus for attention.     Archaeologists are interested in the origin and causes of social  inequality and Thule Eskimo from this perspective are of  particular interest. It is widely believed that hunter gatherer  societies are basically egalitarian in nature  and because of the  rigors of this way of life, status distinctions between sexes and  between families rarely if ever occur. However because groups  such as the Thule specialized in whale hunting, food was often  abundant and based on ethnographic analogy successful hunters  often were accorded great respect. Mr. Whitridge wishes to  examine whether such factors in fact resulted in inequalities.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of the processes which led to the emergence of  complex society and assist in the training of a promising young  scientist.  ***",
