 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406485   Lamphere       This project involves the dissertation research of a student  of cultural anthropology from the University of New Mexico.  The  student will conduct an ethnographic study of Salvadoran  immigrants to the US, living in Los Angeles.  The question is to  understand how migrants use new concepts of ethnicity -- as  Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country, and as Salvadorans -- when  their political identity is local in their home country -- to  construct their political identities and mobilize support, often  transnational, to sustain productive and meaningful lives.  The  techniques used consist of ethnographic participant observation,  and formal interviews of immigrants to understand these  transplanted individuals relations to and understandings of the  national state.       This research is important because transnationalism is a  dominant fact of our world.  Increased understanding of how  people change their identities, and construct new political  identities to establish lives in new places and maintain  connections with their home places can help us design programs to  ameliorate problems and facilitate positive adjustment.   The basic question is important -- understanding how Salvadorans  living in the US adopt Salvadoran nationalism (missing to a large  extent at home) and Latino ethnicity as coping mechanisms to help  develop successful lives in the US will be valuable.",
