 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational   chemistry program.  Reaction field models will be developed for the   prediction of solvent effects on structure, reactivity and spectroscopic   properties of large molecular systems.  Initial tests of the theory will   employ semi-empirical molecular electronic structure methods.  Subsequent   tests will be carried out using ab initio calculations for small   molecular systems.  Specific aspects of the reaction field model to be   studied include the shape of the solute cavity and the  nature of the   electronic distribution that generates the reaction field.  The   theoretical model will be applied to the calculation of: (a)   solvatochromic effects in dyestuffs, (b) solvation effects on reaction   rates and equilibria, and (c) absolute solvation energies for various   solutes ranging from nonpolar to zwitterionic to ionic.    Remarkable success has been achieved in recent years in understanding and   predicting the properties of gas phase molecules from first principles   (by approximately solving the electronic Schroedinger equation), but far   less success had been achieved for molecules dissolved in liquid   solution.   It is well known that dissolving a molecule (the solute)  in   a solvent can dramatically change its color, its other spectroscopic   properties, and its chemical reactivity.  Reaction field models attempt   to describe the solute-solvent forces  responsible these observed   effects.   A number of such reaction field models have been proposed, but   considerable testing is still required to determine the validity of the   many mathematical approximations which must be introduced if the model is   to be of practical use for large molecules such as dyes or various   light-sensitive pharmacological agents.",
