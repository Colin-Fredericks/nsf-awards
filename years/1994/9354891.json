 "awd_abstract_narration": "The filamentous fungi are organisms of unusual importance.  They  are the major cause of plant diseases.  As producers of  mycotoxins in infected plant products, they cause significant  losses of agricultural products and are a grave health concern  for man and animals.  Fungi are the primary organisms responsible  for the decomposition of woody plant tissues and hold the  potential for bioconversion of plant waste into valuable  products.  Fungi form associations with plants that enhance plant  productivity and fungi are important producers of both foods and  medicines.  Thus, increase fungal research efforts are warranted,  both to decrease the damage that fungi cause to plants and to  increase their potential to enhance the value of plant products.   Recently, Texas A&M University has made a concerted effort to  attract scientists with common interests in fungal biology.  We  recognize the potential for future scientific breakthroughs in  the manipulation of fungi for the benefit of society.  Our goal  is for Texas A&M to become a leader in fungal biology research as  it relates to plant biology.  To this end, we have established  interactions between research groups investigating diverse  problems in fungal biology.  Scientists graduating from this  program will have an immediate impact in areas of critical  importance for agricultural, industrial, environmental, and  governmental needs.",
