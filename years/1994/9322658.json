 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322658  Chelst          To excel in the first decades of the 21st century,   manufacturers must have a strategic and operational vision of   design, marketing, and distribution that encompasses the world.  To  implement this vision, a manufacturer must also effectively utilize  service systems in areas such as finance, human resource   management, information systems, and telecommunications to support   its global enterprise.  Operations research and management science   (OR/MS) are some of the tools modern managers use to address   complex strategic, tactical and operational concerns.  This project  is designed to increase the visibility and role of OR/MS techniques  in improving the global competitiveness of United States   manufacturers and their suppliers.       The theme of the Fall 1994 ORSA/TIMS conference is Global   Manufacturing in the 21st Century.  To insure the relevance of the   conference to practical problems, a major effort is planned to   increase the participation in the conference of OR/MS practitioners  and managers of manufacturing and related enterprises.  This will   include: 1) an expanded marketing effort, 2) a special program for   manufacturing managers with little or no OR/MS  background and 3)   complimentary registrations for a limited number of manufacturing   manager speakers who are not members of ORSA or TIMS.  All of these  efforts should enhance the practical value of the conference to the  manufacturing and related service support sectors of the United   States economy.",
