 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weikard  9401816       This award supports mathematical research on problems in the  theory of differential equations, especially relating to the  spectral theory of second order equations.  The subject has a  long, distinguished, history in which significant emphasis was  placed on the study of the spectrum of Schrodinger operators  during much of the current century.  Fundamental advances were  made following discoveries in the 1960's of the relationship of  finite gap potentials, Weierstrass elliptic functions and inverse  problems.  The renewed interest in finite gap potentials  was intensified when it was shown how potentials can have a  finite number of bands if and only if they satisfy some equation  in the Korteweg-deVriess hierarchy.  Until very recently, all  work focused on real-valued potentials.  The isospectral problem  and Korteweg-deVriess flow arising from complex-valued initial  data was studied in the 1980's, marking the starting point for  this research.  A new approach has been opened based on a  classical theorem of Picard concerning differential equations  with elliptic coefficients all of whose solutions are  meromorphic.  This approach promises to be a powerful tool for  tackling some of the open problems in the field, such as  practical computation of band edges (by reduction to a linear  algebraic eigenvalue problem) and the classification of  isospectral manifolds of elliptic finite- gap potentials.   Moreover it sheds light on an unexpected relationship between  spectral properties in the algebraic as well as in the functional  analytic sense of differential operators and global analytic  properties of solutions of the associated differential equations.       Differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness  and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
