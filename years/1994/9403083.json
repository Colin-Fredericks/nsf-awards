 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403083    Dr. Jeffrey A. Jankowski has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Jankowski received his  doctoral degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill under the supervision of Professor Mark Wightman.  Dr.  Jankowski will continue research at the University of Illinois  under the sponsorship of Professor Jonathan Sweedler. Dr.  Jankowski's postdoctoral research will focus on the analytical  chemistry of neuroscience. He will develop skills in capillary  electrophoresis with laser-induced fluoresence and  radiochemical detection to study the release of neuropeptides  from individual nerve cells. Longer term, he plans to develop  the use of electrochemistry and capillary electrophoresis to  characterize steroid secretion and quantify steroid synthesis  at individual adrenal cortical cells. This work will provide  great insight into steroid biochemistry and the physiology of  the adrenal cortex with implications in the fields of medicine  and pharmacology.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is  viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to  broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research  and teaching.  ***",
