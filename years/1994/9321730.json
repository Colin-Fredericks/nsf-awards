 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321730  Welker  This project will evaluate the ecological consequences of climate  change in moist and dry arctic tundra with field manipulations of  winter precipitation and summer temperature.  Project scientists  will investigate effects on species performance, community  structure, and ecosystem C and N dynamics. They will erect snow  fences to increase snowpack and use small greenhouses to warm air  and soil temperatures. Growth rings and annual stem increments of  woody species and physiological plant performance will be  compared with historical temperature and precipitation records.   Experimental findings will also be compared to natural vegetation  patterns along snow gradients and areas where long-term  anthropogenic increases in snow cover have occurred. Simulation  modeling will be used to extend their findings with a focus on  net ecosystem carbon budgets.  The main effort will be to  quantify and understand the magnitude and direction of the  transient response of arctic tundra to a series of climate change  scenarios.  The experimental infrastructure will permit more  detailed investigations by other investigators in future years if  the response is, as we anticipate, of sufficient magnitude to be  of importance for evaluating effects of climate change to arctic  ecosystems.  The project is a U.S. contribution to the  International Tundra Experiment (ITEX).  ***",
