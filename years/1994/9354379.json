Two groups are being studied and  compared---an experimental group consisting of students who  experience the proposed approach for several semesters, and a  comparison group containing students who proceed through the  curriculum as normally taught. The objective of the research is to  demonstrate that the systematic and repeated use of the specified  methods can have a significant beneficial effect on academic  performance, retention, problem-solving ability and creativity, and  attitude toward chemical engineering as a curriculum and career  choice. The products of the research will include a body of data on  over 300 entering engineering sophomores relating to their  backgrounds, reasons for choosing engineering, academic strengths  and weaknesses, levels of confidence and anxiety, academic  performance, retention in engineering, and responsiveness to  different instructional methods.  ***y",
