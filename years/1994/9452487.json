 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452487  Coulson  The equipment described in this proposal will be used in lab work  for both engineering physics and principles of engineering  technology classes. Its purpose is to increase student involvement  in the learning process and to build student excitement through a  multi-dimensional learning lab. It will provide students with  multiple methods of investigation on topics and concepts covered in  class lectures that could not previously be experimented with in a  conventional lab. This will not only improve student understanding,  but will enhance their problem solving skills and promote proper  methods of scientific investigation. The equipment requested  includes six complete 486DX computer systems, each with a lab  interface, physics simulation software and assorted probes; two  printers; and two interactive videodisc systems. This equipment  will bring the latest technology into our labs, giving students the  ability to make investigations and acquire data through both  traditional and innovative techniques.  ***",
