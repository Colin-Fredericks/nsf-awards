Leinweber of the University of  Maryland College Park and Drs. Wojciech Broniowski and Marek Kutschera of the Institute  of Nuclear Physics in Cracow.  The research will focus on a variety of topics in low-energy  strong-interaction physics, such as the structure of individual baryons and of nuclear matter.   They plan to approach the problem using such techniques as:  chiral perturbation theory,  lattice gauge theory, large Nc analysis, heavy fermion dynamics, and phenomenological  models.  They will stress the connection between various theoretical approaches.  They will  use the insights of this work to make new phenomenological predictions.        This proposed research in theoretical physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing  science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ###",
