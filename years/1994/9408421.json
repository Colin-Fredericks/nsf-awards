Key areas to be discussed will be 1) environmental biotechnology and bioremediation; 2) phenotypic expression in novel environments (including genetically engineered organisms); 3) novel products and processes; and 4) biodiversity and conservation.  During the workshop, carefully designed sets of questions will be tackled during facilitated break-out sessions.  Responses will be captured in a workshop report, which will be disseminated to a variety of audiences including evolutionary biologists, industry representatives, policy makers, and funding agencies.  The two investigators have prior experience in running  workshops for scientists to discuss applied aspects of their research.  Facilities are well appointed and well organized. Current national attention to environmental problems and challenges promises a ready audience for the deliberations of this large group of evolutionary biologists.",
