 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Suib - 9413394      This research involves the use of microwave heating in the presence and absence of catalysts for conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons via oligomerization reactions.  In addition, microwave-induced heating of precursors of manganese oxide sols and gels will be used to prepare highly dispersed microporous manganese oxides that will be used as oligomerization catalysts.  Optimization of reactor types, modes of operation (contact times, pulse versus continuous), and addition of dielectrics will be done to optimize conversion and selectivity.  In situ characterization methods will be developed to monitor the mechanisms of reaction.    The goals of the project are to prepare microporous manganese dioxide (MnO2) Microwave-Induced Oligomerization (MIO) catalysts, to study MIO of methane to higher hydrocarbons, to elucidate mechanistic details of MIO reactions, and to study fundamental aspects of reactor configurations, additives (chain propagators, dielectrics), temperature measurements, magnetic field effects, and reaction conditions.  All reactions will be done in a flow system.  Characterization studies will involve product analyses by gas chromatography mas spectrometry methods, microwave-induced acoustic studies of heat and energy transfer in such systems, and Fourier transform infrared studies of hydrocarbon intermediates and products.  The long-term goal is to understand factors which control product selectivity and long-term stability of microwave-induced reactions.",
