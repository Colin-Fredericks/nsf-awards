These networks will be expected to carry a mix of  traffic with differing service requirements. This research project  addresses important operational problems arising in such an  environment.  Specifically, the research project will investigate  efficient operating policies for multi-media conferencing across  existing networks; access control and bandwidth allocation in  B-ISDN with ATM switching; and routing in high-speed data networks.   The project will establish properties of optimal control policies,  develop efficient numerical methods to compute optimal control  policies, and use these results to synthesize simple, implementable  and efficient operating policies that exhibit near-optimal  performance.       Stochastic fluid-flow models of high-speed communication  systems are useful tools in achieving the above goals.  An  understanding of how to control a fluid-flow system operating in a  random environment in order to optimize a given system performance  measure (such as delay, loss, throughput, etc.) is critically  important for proper design and operation of these systems.        The proposed research will develop and analyze appropriate  fluid-flow control models motivated by the above problems.  A new  methodology, based upon reduction to deterministic control  problems, will be developed to compute the optimal operating  policies.   ***",
