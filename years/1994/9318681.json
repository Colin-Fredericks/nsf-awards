 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318681  Ryan    All vertebrates use their forelimbs for locomotion whether  it be for walking, swimming or flying.  Yet there is a  great deal of diversity in forelimbs:  The wings of a bird  are anatomically different from the wings of bats, the  flippers of a seal, and the legs of a mouse.  Despite these  structural and functional differences,  the neurons from  the brain and spinal cord responsible for controlling  movement are thought to be \"wired\" in basically the same  manner in all vertebrates.  This has come to be known as  the motor control conservatism hypothesis.  In this  research, Dr. James Ryan will test the conservatism  hypothesis by locating and comparing the populations of  neurons controlling forelimb movements in vertebrates that  use a primitive type of locomotion (lizards) with those  that use more advanced  types of locomotion (bats and birds).  For example the split  second maneuvers of a flying bat as it homes in upon a moth  illustrate the precise sensorimotor control of the forelimbs  that is possible.  Bats are the only mammals capable of  powered flight, and they evolved flight independently from  birds.  These three organisms represent  ideal models for  the the comparative study of locomotion control by the  nervous system.  Ultimately, this research will lead to the  formation of a general model of the neural control of  vertebrate locomotion.  ***",
