 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds will be  used to acquire a helium liquifier system, a bulk liquid  nitrogen storage con-tainer and bulk high pressure gaseous  helium containers. These acquisitions will form the basis  for a highly efficient, helium recycling, cryogenic facility  serving a multidisciplinary scientific and engineering  community at SUNYBuffalo. The facility will provide services  to faculty and graduate students in 8 academic departments  in addition to 2 research centers, namely the Center for  Electronic and Electrooptic Materials and the New York State  Institute for Superconductivity. The facility should provide  cryogenic liquids in a more convenient and economical manner  to the users of cryogenic liquids. The principal users from  the Department of Physics are involved in research on: the  superconductivity of quasi-1D-metals;  two-dimensional  3Helium on the surface of 4Helium films; D- ions and many  electron effects on hydrogenic donors in gallium arsenide  quantum wells at high magnetic fields; the study of II-VI  magnetic semiconductor based structures and quantum wells;  transport and magnetic properties of high critical  temperature superconductors; high pressure studies in  epitaxial and bulk semiconductors.    A helium liquifier system with efficient helium recycling  will be developed for the users of liquid helium that will  increase the convenience of liquid helium use in addition to  reducing the cost of liquid helium. The facility will be  used by faculty and students from eight departments and two  Centers. The facility will support research in the the areas  of superconductivity and semiconductor heterostructures and  quantum wells.",
