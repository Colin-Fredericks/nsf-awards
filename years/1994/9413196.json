 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial support is provided to the University of California-  Los Angeles for the development of a novel, compact pulsed  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument for research in  condensed matter science. The new instrument will operate  over a broad range of steady magnetic fields that extends up  to the highest available. The main parts of the system  consist of: (1) A compact, portable, medium-power pulsed NMR  spectrometer with frequency coverage up to 2 GHz, (2) a low-  helium consumption 9-T superconducting solenoid for  experiments at UCLA, and (3) a wide variety of probes to  accommodate different magnets and experimental conditions of  temperature, NMR frequency, and sample alignment.  Experiments below 9 T will be conducted at UCLA. For the  higher fields (up to 45 T), the spectrometer will be  transported to the laboratories at other institutions that  house the high-field magnets. Since many of these magnets do  not have the field stability and homogeneity necessary for  NMR measurements, correction coils will be added to the  probes to overcome these difficulties. The NMR research  topics to be investigated with the system include the static  and dynamic properties of spin density waves, vortex pinning  and dynamics in superconductors, and nanocrystal compounds.  A secondary use by UCLA investigators of the 9 T magnet that  involves very little liquid helium consumption will be  thermal, magnetic and frequency dependent electrical  transport investigations of correlated electron systems. In  these applications, the field at the sample will be swept by  maintaining the magnet in the persistent mode and physically  lowering it to move its fringing field past the sample.  Aside from studies at UCLA, collaborations will be  established with other investigators to use the NMR  spectrometer at various high field laboratories.",
