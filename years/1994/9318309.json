 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318309  Grodzicker    Funding is requested for a Cold Spring Harbor summer course  in Arabidopsis molecular genetics.  The use of Arabidopsis  as a model plant for the course reflects the current  research interests of many US and international  laboratories.  The course is designed to fulfill a growing  need within the plant science community for training in this  area.  The intention is  (1) to teach state of the art  molecular techniques to scientists who are already involved  in research with plants so that they can apply these  technologies to their own future research and (2) to teach  scientists who are familiar with microbial, animal or plant  systems about current research in plant biology using  Arabidopsis as the model plant system.  The course consists  of a rigorous lecture series, a hands-on laboratory and  informal discussions.  Speakers will provide both an in-  depth discussion of their work and an overview of their  specialty.  The laboratory sessions provide intensive  training in modern techniques in plant biology.  It also  introduces approaches used in yeast that have the potential  to be utilized for the advancement of Arabidopsis molecular  genetics.  ***",
