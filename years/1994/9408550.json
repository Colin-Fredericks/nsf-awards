 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine adaptive synchronization protocols that  monitor the execution of the parallel simulator, and automatically  adapt the simulator's execution to optimize performance.  Adaptive  mechanisms allow the underlying simulation system to achieve  maximum performance, particularly for dynamically changing  workloads that often arise in practice.  These mechanisms can also  simplify the development of parallel simulation software to the  extent that some degree of performance \"tuning\" is automatically  performed by the simulation system, rather than by the application  programmer, who may not be an expert in parallel simulator  performance.    A protocol that uses memory allocation to control execution is  proposed.  A second problem that will be addressed concerns  analyzing and defining suitable incremental state saving methods  that are designed to execute efficiently with rollback-based  parallel and distributed simulators.  Both problems will be  attacked using experimentation on implementations running on  multiprocessor hardware, and analytic modeling techniques.",
