 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314335     Rose       This project addresses fundamental problems in vector coding  for digital communication of audio and visual signals.  The overall  signal compression problem is reformulated as a generalized vector  quantizer design problem, which incorporates signal decomposition,  quantization, and reconstruction.  The main line of attack, using  this new paradigm, is to embed the optimization problem within the  probabilistic framework of deterministic annealing, which is  derived based on the principle of maximum entropy and its  generalization, the principle of cross-entropy.  This yields two  main benefits: ability to avoid some of the local optima that trap  greedy methods, and extendibility to joint optimization of various  objectives by incorporating additional constraints.  The first  phase of the project will include optimization of isolated problems  of particular importance to data communications: source-channel  vector coding, entropy constrained vector quantization,  structurally constrained vector quantization, generalized vector  quantization, and unbalanced tree vector quantizer growing.  The  first phase is expected to yield substantial improvements over  methods currently in use, and at the same time provide the basis  for the second phase which consists of synthesizing the different  optimization problems.  The second phase of the project will  include joint and simultaneous optimization of subsets of the  problems addressed in the first phase, thus removing the  suboptimality due to independent piecewise optimization.  A  particularly important special case to be addressed is the combined  optimization problem of a vector quantizer design for a given  source and noisy channel, subject to encoding complexity and bit  rate constraints.  A method addressing these issues simultaneously  in a nonheuristic manner is expected to provide a theoretically  exciting yet practically useful solution to reliable and efficient  communications in the demanding context of critically b andlimited  channels, such as the future generation of cellular networks.  In  order to validate the new optimization methods developed in this  project, specific speech and image compression targets utilizing  these methods will be tested and simulate.  Benchmarks of  performance improvement will be determined with the intent of  convincing future designers of practical signal compression systems  of the practical  utility of the new techniques.  In particular,  two widely studied problems, the quantization of LPC parameters for  spectral modeling in speech coding and low-rate transform coding of  images with serve as targets for benchmarking performance.  In one  or both cases, a model of channel errors will be included to assess  overall source-channel coding performance.  ***",
