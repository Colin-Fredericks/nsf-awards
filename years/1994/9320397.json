This extensive world-class research collection, part of which was formerly known as the Allan Hancock Foundation Crustacea Collection, contains the largest collection of eastern Pacific decapod crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, lobsters) in the world.  This proposal requests funds primarily for (1) temporary personnel to help physically transfer this incomparable collection of Decapoda from its current repository on the campus of the University of Southern California to the LACM.  Additional funds are requested for (2) purchasing archival quality jars, lids, and labels to rebottle the collection, much of which is currently housed in rapidly deterioration bail-top or metal-topped jars, (3) two locking, light-proof, environmentally stable metal cabinets for housing all type-specimens separately from the other crustacean holdings, (4) one medium quality stereomicroscope for rough sorting of mixed collections (those containing several taxa), and (5) material for shelf and carriage labeling, including one printer.",
