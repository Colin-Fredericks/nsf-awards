The Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology,  an independent campus-wide unit, created to promote genetic engineering  research and education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will  sponsor the program.  Academically successful students and students from  disadvantaged backgrounds who exhibit high scholastic promise and who  would benefit from an independent study experience will be chosen from a  national applicant pool to participate in research projects conducted by UNC  faculty.  A total of 10 students will be supported by the National Science  Foundation REU program and five additional students are expected to be  supported with University funds.  Emphasis will be placed on recruiting  students from schools with limited research opportunities and students  historically underrepresented in the sciences.  The primary focus of the  training program will be encouraging pursuit of, and providing preparation for,  advanced degrees in the biological sciences.  To meet these goals students will  (1) work for 10 weeks on faculty-developed laboratory research projects, (2)  meet with preceptors for informal seminars about science and personal  accounts of how and why faculty became research scientists, (3) attend field  trips to major research pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes  of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, NC, and to  coastal marine labs operated by UNC and Duke University, (4) attend a  Graduate-Professional Student Roundtable to learn in detail about life in  graduate school, and (5) present the results of their research in talks before  the community.  ***",
