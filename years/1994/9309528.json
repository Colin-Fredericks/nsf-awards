These reactions have two  effects on the ability of cement-based systems to immobilize  hazardous wastes.  First, the capacities of the secondary  compounds to bind hazardous materials are likely to be different  from those of the primary compounds. Second, formation of  secondary compounds often result in cracking and disruption of  monolithic forms.  Cracking results in an increase in the  surface area of a monolith and may heighten the susceptibility  to leaching.    Three chemical processes are of particular importance in this  regard.  These are carbonation, the alkali-silica reaction and  sulfate attack.  Carbonation results from interaction of the  hydration products of cement with atmospheric CO2 or bicarbonate  in water.  This results in the depression of pH.  If the  sequestration of a heavy metal or an oxyanion is pH-dependent,  increased solubility may occur.  However, the occurrence of the  phenomena depends on the exposure of the mass to carbonate and  the effects carbonation seem to have been ignored because, it is  regarded as a surface phenomenon.  The alkali-silica reaction in  concrete is conventionally associated with the reaction between  siliceous aggregate and the alkalis in cement.  However, the  reaction resulting in the conversion of the calcium silicate  hydrate binder phase to a calcium-alkali silicate gel is  thermodynamically favorable regardless of the presence of  aggregate.  Sulfate attack occurs when hydrated calcium silicate  hydrate binder phase to a calcium-alkali silicate gel is  thermodynamically favorable regardless of the presence of  aggregate.  Sulfate attack occurs when hydrated calcium  aluminates react with sulfate to form a compound similar to the  natural mineral ettringite.  Both alkali-silica reaction and  sulfate attack form expansive products which eventually dest roy  the structural integrity of a monolith.  As a result of the  cracks formed, a significant increase in the effective surface  area available for carbonation occurs.  Thus, the synergy  between various chemical reactions can result in the premature  liberation of incorporated hazardous species.    Although the alkali-silica reaction is recognized as a major  cause of deterioration in structures, the conditions under which  this deleterious reaction occurs are not well defined.  Based on  the generally accepted view of the sequence of reactions which  lead to strength development in cement, sulfate attack should  not occur  in the absence of sulfate from an external source.   However, internal sulfate attack is now being observed as well.   The mechanism causing this does not seem to be understood.  It  is not generally recognized that onset of internal sulfate  attack is linked synergistically with the alkali-silica  reaction.  Both reactions are able to occur in the absence of  exposure to external sources of ions.    This research program will establish the stability ranges of the  compounds slowly formed in portland cement-based systems which  are likely to compromise the integrity of waste forms.  These  include the alkali-silica reaction, sulfate attack, and  carbonation.  Because these are chemical processes, the  progression  of these reactions exhibit compositional  dependencies.  The products of these reactions are ettringite,  calcium substituted potassium silicate hydrate and various  carbonates.  The conditions favoring the formation of these  compounds will be established as functions of composition and  temperature.  This is a necessary step in the eventual  determination of the effects of hazardous materials on the long-  term stabilities of cements.  Establishment of the stability  ranges for these compounds in turn provide the link between  conditions required for their formation and the bulk  compositions of cement.  Therefore, limiting these deleterious  reactions, can, pot entially, be accomplished by controlling the  compositions of the cement used when specifying a waste form.   Pragmatically, this will make it possible to develop a rational,  prescriptive basis to facilitate the long-term performance of  cement-based systems used in waste disposal.  ***",
