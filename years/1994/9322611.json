However, designing and carrying out field  sampling strategies can be a complicated process involving  interactions between a host of variables. No standard textbooks  are able to provide the insight necessary to conduct complex data  gathering in geomorphology. This project provides modest support  to enable 12 doctoral students to participate in a workshop  devoted to better understanding the process of high quality data  collection. The students will be joined by a number of experts in  field sampling who will present papers, lead discussions, and  consult in small groups.       This project will have a major impact on the development of  young scientists in geomorphology by providing them with advanced  training in the use of field sampling techniques. The workshop  will provide direct assistance to the conduct of their  dissertation research and will have a long-lasting impact on the  quality of their future research  ***",
