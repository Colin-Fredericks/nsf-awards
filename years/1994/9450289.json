 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450289  Cal State U Hayward Fnd  Hayward, CA  Harper, Charlie    \"Summer Physics Enrichment Camps (SPECS)\"    Summer Physics Enrichment Camps (SPECS) is an SEM enrichment  program designed to serve 40 minority seventh graders and four  junior high school science teachers per year.  Twenty students and  two teachers from each of two school districts (Oakland and New  Haven) will participate in the 4-week residential summer camp and  academic-year follow-up activities.  The goals of SPECS are to  provide a foundation for a lifelong interest in SEM for  participants and to encourage the consideration of SEM as a  possible career.  Some specific objectives of SPECS are to (a)  strengthen students' commitment to remain in school and complete  their university entrance course requirements, (b) illustrate the  importance of SEM skills in our daily lives, and (c) offer students  information and guidance in the career exploration process.    SPECS seeks to reverse the pattern of minority students being  under-motivated and unprepared to consider science-based careers or  to enter higher education.  SPECS will provide students with (a)  residential experience on a university campus, (b) an opportunity  to explore science by use of hands-on and visual activities, (c)  mentors and role models who will encourage the students to pursue  higher education, (d) enhanced parental support for students'  pursuit of higher education, and (e) academic year activities and  guidance.  The success of the program will be evaluated by tracking  participants' scholastic achievements in high school and beyond and  by comparing this cohort to a non-participant group.  ***",
