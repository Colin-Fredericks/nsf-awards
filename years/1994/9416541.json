 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research requests funds to investigate methods for improving the performance of thermoelectric refrigeration elements by reducing the thermal conductivity of bismuth telluride based alloys.  The research proposes to significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of bismuth-telluride elements through enhanced powder processing techniques.  The proposal was  submitted as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of conservations between the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program Director.  The qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform fundamental work in this area are excellent.  The relevance of the proposal, the fact that subject area is one of increasing importance, and the uncertainty of the outcome make this particular proposal an excellent candidate for the SGER program.",
