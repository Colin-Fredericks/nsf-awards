Although an outline of the pathway of protein import is  known, the mechanism underlying each step is not well-  understood.  The long term goal of this project is to  elucidate at the molecular level the components involved in  individual steps of the pathway and how they function.  The  project focuses on the proteolytic processing enzyme that is  responsible for precursor maturation.  Processing enzymes  play a critical role in organelle biogenesis; they are  responsible for the proteolytic removal of the N-terminal  transit peptide from the precursor, releasing the mature  protein.  In peas, two proteins of 145 and 143 kD co-purify  with an activity that cleaves the precursor for the major  light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (LHCP).  The processing  enzyme appears to be responsible for the maturation of other  proteins as well, including the small subunit of Rubisco and  the acyl carrier protein.  Using antibodies raised against  the 145/143 kD proteins, genes will be isolated by  immunoscreening a cDNA expression library in order to  determine the primary sturcture of the chloroplast  processing enzyme (CPE), both in peas and in the model plant  Arabidopsis.  CPE will be synthesized in E. coli, and  isolated under conditions to recover an active enzyme, or  synthesized in vitro.  The mechanism of precursor  recognition and cleavage will be investigated by in vitro  binding assays and mutational analyses.  Peptides  corresponding to regions of the transit peptide will be  employed in in vitro competition experiments to determine if  they inhibit processing.  The pattern of expression of CPE  during development and in response to light will be explored  at the transcript, protein, and enzymatic activity levels in  Arabidopsis.  This analysis will reveal the importance of  CPE in different organs , and provide information on how its  synthesis is regulated.  CPE activity will be downregulated  in Arabidopsis using antisense genes to assess if CPE is  indeed a general processing enzyme utilized for the  maturation of a diversity of proteins, and thus a key  component of the import machinery.  It will be established  how far organelle biogenesis proceeds in the absence of  normal levels of CPE and protein complexes that depend on  this enzyme for their assembly.  Biochemical and  morphological studies will be performed to monitor changes  in plant phenotype.  %%%  The chloroplast is the plant organelle which is responsible  for photosynthesis, the process whereby sunlight is  converted to biologically usable chemical energy.  The  activity of the chloroplast is thus the key biological  function underpinning life as we know it on earth.  Understanding how the chloroplast works is of major  importance to agricultural biotechnology, since such  understanding is absolutely  prerequisite to any efforts to  enhance food production by plants through chloroplast  manipulation by bioengineering methodologies.  This project  addresses how the proteins of the chloroplast, most of which  are synthesized in the cytoplasm, get into the chloroplast.  It is already well established that the chloroplast protein  import process involves a transit peptide extension on the  incoming proteins which are required for import, and that  the newly-imported proteins lose their transit peptides  through the action of a processing protease inside the  chloroplast.  However, although the general pattern of how  proteins get into the chloroplast is understood, very little  is yet known about the actual biochemical machinery of the  process.  The specific focus of this project is the  processing protease.  A candidate protease has been  identified in chloroplasts of pea.  This enzyme will be  studied using biochemical, cell biological, and genetic  approaches, to learn how it functions in terms of its role  in protein im port, and also to learn its significance for  the biology of whole plants.  The biochemical and cell  biological approaches will be carried out using pea  chloroplasts, and the genetic and whole plant developmental  studies will be carried out in the model flowering plant,  Arabidopsis.  The results of these studies will lead to a  greater understanding of both the machinery of chloroplast  protein import and the role of that machinery in the  development and physiological function of whole plants, and  thus will be of great significance to agricultural  biotechnology.  ***",
