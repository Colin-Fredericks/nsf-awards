 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mtingwa    North Carolina A&T State University has a long and distinguished  record in graduating talented minority students in science and  engineering, both at the baccalaureate and masters levels.  In  its quest to achieve academic excellence in science and  engineering, the institution recently established a doctoral  program in the fields of electrical and mechanical engineering.  This program will significantly enhance the university's progress  in its relation to scientific research excellence and the  productivity of scholars trained in science and engineering.  To  help support the doctoral programs and expand its research  programs, the university will create the Interdisciplinary  Research Center (IRC),  a single facility that will allow for the  merger of several multidisciplinary laboratories in six major  thrust areas: Materials, Manufacturing, Systems Engineering,  Computing Systems, Agriculture Sciences and Social Sciences.  The  Center will support interdisciplinary research activities by  faculty and students from the Schools of Engineering and  Technology and the College of Arts and Science.    This award will provide funding for the renovation of research  and research training space for the IRC.  Space will be  reconfigured to house well-defined interdisciplinary research  that is currently ongoing in cramped conditions.  Supporting  utilities will be routed vertically through common chases and  distributed horizontally to the various laboratories, and new  fixed equipment will be installed.  The improved facility will  expand the capabilities of researchers and students engaged in  research activities, stimulating technological innovations and  training in nationally strategic academic disciplines for the  21st century.  Since North Carolina A&T State University is an  Historically Black College and University, the renovated facility  will have a substantial impact on increasing the number of  underrepresented minorities and women entering the pipeline  leading to advanced  degrees in engineering and science.",
