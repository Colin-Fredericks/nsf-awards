 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenotype of immature neurons is influenced by cues from the  local environment in which they develop.  One well-characterized  environment cue is a glycoprotein produced by various types of  cultured cells, known as cholinergic neuronal differentiation  factor (CDF), or leukemia inhibitory factor.  CDF, a member of a  group of growth/differentiation factors called cytokines, acts on  a wide range of cell types and exerts a variety of effects.  This  is in contrast to the nerve growth factor family that mainly acts  on neurons and supports their survival.  Despite our knowledge of  a number of effects in vitro, the physiological role of CDF in the  developing nervous system is unknown, and it is the goal of this  research to understand this role.  To elucidate the physiological  role of CDF, it is critical to know which neural cells respond to  CDF and which produce CDF in vivo.  At present, the full spectrum  of CDF-responsive neural cells is unknown, and little is known  about CDF-producing cells in the nervous system.  Using pure native  CDF and its function-blocking antibodies, two approaches are  proposed for systematic investigation of potential CDF-responsive  and CDF-producing cells in the developing nervous system:  1)  examination of CDF receptor distribution by radioautography using  iodinated native CDF as a probe; 2)  determination of the tissue  content of CDF protein by two-site immunoassay.  These studies will  provide essential information necessary for formulating specific  hypotheses for the role of CDF in the developing nervous system.",
