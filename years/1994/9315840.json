 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315840  Phillips  Dr. Phillips proposes to develop a strategy for the complete  refinement of macromolecular structure and dynamics in crystals  by utilizing all of the available X-ray scattering data, namely,  the low and high resolution Bragg reflections, but more  importantly the diffuse scattering between Bragg peaks.  In  addition to the average structure then, the result of this  expanded refinement will be a picture of the conformational  states available to a macromolecule, knowledge indispensable for  correlating molecular structure and dynamics with biochemical  function.  Although generally applicable to any macromolecular  crystal, the methods will initially be applied to the oxygen  binding protein myoglobin, the nucleic acid transfer RNA, as well  as the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase where disorder in the  molecule's ligand binding domain can be controlled in crystallum.   X-ray diffraction data will be collected on imaging plates, which  afford the dynamic range necessary for collecting the weak  diffuse scattering signal, and for placing this signal on the  same absolute scale as the much more intense Bragg data.   Molecular dynamics calculations will play in integral role in the  extended refinement of the Bragg and diffuse intensities; thus  high performance computing technologies will prove a useful tool.  %%%  The microscope has always played a role in science, particularly  biology.  The more detail visible, the deeper our understanding  of the mechanics of life.  Even the most powerful glass lenses  cannot image atoms however.  To see what life looks like down at  the level of atoms and molecules, X-ray crystallography is used.   In this technique, high intensity X-rays are scattered off a  sample; then sophisticated computer algorithms are employed to  analyze the results, acting as 'mathematical lenses' to form  pictures of the arrangement of atoms in the biological structure.   X-ray crystallography has had an enormous impact on our  understanding of the atomic stru cture of the biological world,  from the earliest structure of the genetic code DNA to the  structure of enzymes involved in the replication of the AIDS  virus.  Nevertheless, until now X-ray crystallographic  researchers have only analyzed part of the signal from their  scattering experiments, namely, the data corresponding to the  average, static picture of a biological molecule.  Our atomic  views of life are consequently motionless at present.  Watching a  butterfly or a ballerina, however, we all know that what makes  living organisms special are their movements.  Thus, we propose  developing methods to analyze all of the X-ray data, the  traditional part due to the average atomic structure as well as  the part due to atomic movements.  This will lead to dynamic  pictures of living processes down at the atomic level.  The  proposed study, though primarily motivated by questions in  biology, will require new understanding in the physics of X-ray  scattering as well as substantial high performance computing  technologies.  The result promise an increased understanding of  life at its most fundamental level.   ***",
