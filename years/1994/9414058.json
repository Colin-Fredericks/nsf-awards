Dr. Skog is an established paleobotanist whose application of  modern technologies to the study of fossil fern material in this  country has helped to elucideate relationships of these ancient  land plants and revealed information about their distributions  and the paleoclimate conditions under which they evolved.  She  seeks to broaden that knowledge of extinct fern relationships to  extant taxa by investigating material from fossil beds in China.   Her Chinese collaborator has excellent complementary training in  Geology, so stratigraphic details or potential problems will be  well covered in this collaboration from which both  scientists/countries serve to benefit.    It is especially important that such collaborations be encouraged  because of the long term political situation which, until very  recently, precluded any intellectual exchange and would not  permit the loan of specimens for scientific study.  Every such  collaboration that serves to foster good working relationships  and trust is of great value to the Chinese scientists who will  learn western methodologies/technologies and to U.S. scientists  who will have access to material which allows systematic analyses  that previously could not incorporate material from China.",
