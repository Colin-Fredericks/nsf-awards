 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gender issues relate very directly to the participation of women  in science and to issues concerning the nature of modern science  and technology.  Prominent scholars have individually investigated  and analyzed both phenomena in recent years, but there have been no  opportunities for those historians, philosophers, sociologists, and  anthropologists currently pursuing the social and humanistic  studies of women and science, engineering, and mathematics to meet  and discuss their theories and results.  Dr. Sally Gregory  Kohlstedt, a historian, and Dr. Helen Longino, a philosopher, are  holding a workshop to bring together such researchers with the goal  of improving the conversation, finding areas of agreement and  contention, and publishing a result of their deliberations.  The  subsequent conference will allow other scholars an opportunity to  present papers on related topics and a much larger audience to  consider the issues and discuss the implications of research on  \"The Women and Science Question.\"  The workshop and conference are  being held May 10-13, 1995 at the University of Minnesota.",
