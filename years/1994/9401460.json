In Sheafhom the  basic items are finite-dimensional vector spaces, cochain  complexes, regular cell complexes, sheaves, and morphisms among  these objects.   There are functions like kernel, image,  cohomology, and tensor and wedge products.  The system works with  important complexes of sheaves, such as the intersection  cohomology sheaves and other perverse sheaves.  Second, the  project involves bringing Sheafhom to bear on convex polytopes  and the intersection homology of toric varieties.  McMullen's  conjecture characterized the f-vectors of simplicial convex  polytopes.  Stanley's proof of (one direction of) McMullen's  conjecture used the cohomology of the toric variety associated to  a simplicial polytope.  Key facts were that the cohomology,  modulo the Lefschetz class, is a graded ring generated in degree  two.  For an arbitrary rational convex polytope, one can ask  whether the intersection cohomology of its toric variety,  modulo the Lefschetz class, is a ring, and whether it is  generated in degree two.  The project will build on preliminary  results on these questions, and Sheafhom will play a part in  approaching them.       A computer algebra system is a program for algebraic  calculation.  Any program can add numbers, but a computer algebra  system combines whole formulas: the input (2x + 7) + (4x - 3)  automatically becomes 6x + 4.  This capacity is more abstract,  hence more flexible.  Excellent general-purpose systems, like  Maple or Mathematica, are available, but of course they don't  have every function that every mathematician needs.  In recent  years several disciplines have acquired their own special-purpose  systems--Cayley/Magma for algebraists, Pari for number theorists,  and a dozen others.  The investigator intends to develop  Sheafhom, a computer algebra system for algebra ic topology.   Second, he intends to apply Sheafhom to study convex polytopes.   Convex polyhedra are familiar solid bodies like cubes, pyramids,  or hundred-faced diamonds.  A convex polytope is the same kind of  body in the fourth dimension or higher.  Since 1980, algebraic  geometry has become a major tool for studying polytopes.  This is  surprising, since algebraic geometry includes some of the most  abstract mathematics known, while polytopes, like crystals, are  very concrete objects.  Sheafhom will make possible some  difficult computations in algebraic topology and geometry that  will advance our understanding of convex polytopes.  ***",
