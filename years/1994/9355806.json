These  tools will include computational tools which will allow  participants to model scientific processes as well as communication  tools which will allow participants at multiple locations to work  together, to share information, and to retrieve information from  remote sources.  Implementation of the 'virtual high school'  project will help us determine how peer and mentor support,  additional technical advice and technical resources, and a source  of problem-solving activities related to science and mathematics  can help teachers adapt to new technology and methods, and help to  equalize the learning opportunity for all levels of students at  diverse schools.    preparing students to \"do\" science in the real world of the future  means guiding them in \"doing\" science now.  This project entails  bringing to the classroom the same team problem solving, technology  rich approaches currently used in research and business.   Computational science has become a powerful paradigm to complement  other approaches.  Computational tools, ranging from spreadsheets  on microprocessors to advanced molecular modeling tools on  supercomputers, are allowing scientists to model processes too  costly or impossible to investigate in other ways.    This project will support the creation of the 'virtual high school'  in two ways.  Interdisciplinary problems requiring many levels of  expertise and solvable with computational techniques across a  communication network will be developed by a team of teachers who  are interested in using these problems in their classroom.   Workshop training will enable these teachers to lead their students  and other teachers through the team building and content learning  necessary to create computational models.  Secondly, the  computational, communication, and teaming tool s will be evaluated  in a testbed environment involving selected school sites and  industry.  Use of these tools and the global Internet will enable  schools to leverage the use of 'low end' microcomputers currently  available in schools to achieve access to databases and more  powerful high performance computers.    As the project matures, the schools in Maryland will be linked  together solving 'realworld' problems.  Students from different age  groups, with varying mathematical and scientific backgrounds, with  all levels to computer expertise, and from schools geographically  distant from one another will collaborate on problems of common  interest.  Students will no longer wonder why they are learning  disjointed facts nor will they wait impatiently to see the uses of  their high school education.  Instead, they will be motivated to  learn because they are solving 'real' problems now.  ***",
