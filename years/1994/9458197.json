 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9458197  Bacterial cytokinesis will be analyzed with genetic, biochemical  and molecular approaches. It has been shown that the control of the  placement of the division septum in Escherichia coli is regulated  by a 3 gene operon and one of the genes products provides  topological specificity. It has also been shown that an essential  septation protein, FtsZ is important to cytokinesis. It forms a  membrane-associated ring structure at the site of septum formation.  This ring shrinks as it remains associated with the leading edge of  the ingrowing septum until cytokinesis is complete. In vitro, the  protein self-associates into filamentous structures upon binding of  GTP. We will develop a quantitative assay for FtsZ polymerization  and study the role of nucleotide hydrolysis in Fts-multimerization.  Genetic studies have suggested that FtsZ interacts with a number of  other division related proteins. Several of these will be tested in  purified systems by a variety of methods. In addition, peptide-  tagged derivatives of FtsZ will be used in an unbiased search for  proteins that interact directly with FtsZ.  %%%   Although much is known about the genetics and physiology of the  bacterium, Escherichia coli, much less is known about mechanisms  involved with converting one cell into two cells. This work should  deepen our understanding of the genetic regulation of and the  physiological mechanisms involved in cell division.  ***",
