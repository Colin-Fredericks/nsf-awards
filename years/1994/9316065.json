 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goldenberg  9316065  The goal of this project is to determine what factors influence  the folding and disulfide-bond formation of a small peptide toxin  found in the venom of a marine snail, Conus magus.  The venoms  are composed of small peptides, typically 12 to 30 residues long,  most of which contain two or three disulfide bonds. Although  these molecules are much smaller than typical globular proteins,  they fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures. The  small size of the peptides and the high degree of sequence  variability suggests that information in addition to that found  in the mature toxin may be necessary to direct correct folding.  This information may be provided by recently identified  pro-peptide sequences. Folding may also be influenced by the  enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) or other cellular  components.  In order to determine the role of the pro-peptide  sequence, the in vitro folding and disulfide formation of the  mature toxin will be compared with that of the pro-toxin form  produced in E. coli. Comparing the rates of folding and the  distribution of intermediates with and without the pro-peptide  will indicate whether the pro-peptide can increase the rates of  productive folding. The folding kinetics of the mature and  pro-toxin forms will be examined in the presence of PDI. An in  vitro translation-translocation system will also be used to study  the folding of the toxin precursor. Comparison with results  obtained in vivo will indicate how well the in vitro reactions  mimic folding in vivo and may reveal the presence of other  components of the endoplasmic reticulum that are important for  folding.  %%%  Proteins are long linear molecules made up of amino acids linked  together by chemical bonds. In this regard, proteins resemble  synthetic polymers such as nylon.  Proteins differ from most  other polymers, however, because the chains are able to fold into  unique three-dimensional structures. The shape of the folded  protein and the distribution of  chemical groups allow  proteins  to interact with other molecules with high specificity.  Most  proteins known to fold into a unique structure contain a minimum  of about 50 amino acids. A very interesting exception to this  generalization has been discovered in peptides found in the  venoms of snails in the genus Conus. This genus is made up of  about 500 species of cone-shaped marine snails. These snails are  predators and are able to paralyze their prey by injecting highly  potent venoms containing mixtures of small peptides. These  peptides are typically only 12 to 30 amino acids long, but have  been shown to be folded into well-defined three-dimensional  structures. The different peptides interact strongly and  specifically with components of the nervous system. The high  specificities of these interactions have made the Conus toxins  powerful tools for studying the molecular components of the  nervous system. The goal of this project is to determine what  molecular and cellular factors enable the Conus peptides to fold  into their specific conformations, in spite of their small size.   In addition to helping to elucidate the details of this unusual  biological system, the results of these studies may be useful in  the design and production of artificial peptides  with novel biological activities.  ***",
