The study will combine and use  appropriate social science concepts in a political constructionist  approach.  This approach focuses on political and policy processes,  examining the roles of key actors in governmental processes that  require networking and strategies.  A major issue in this effort is  the negotiation of boundaries between science and policy -- and  scientists and politicians.  Recognition of this form of  negotiation is the contribution of social constructionism.  The  USGCRP is one of the largest and most extensive research efforts in  the federal government.  Begun in 1987, it has grown to have a $1.5  billion budget, spread through at least nine agencies.  The first  official \"Presidential Initiative,\" it later became the first  designated multi-agency endeavor intended both to build good  science and usefully serve policymakers.  While criticized for  weakness in policy relevance, it nevertheless is also being  expanded and used by the Clinton Administration as a model for  other major national research initiatives that cut across agencies.   Understanding the forces that have shaped USGCRP, particularly the  mechanism that governed the program -- the interagency Committee on  Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) -- will provide some  lessons for national research policy for other endeavors.  Results  from this project will include presentations, articles and a book.  ***",
