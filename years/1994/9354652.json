 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354652  Johnson         Funds are requested to create a unique Mathematics Across the  Curriculum program that will be disseminated nationally as a  paradigm for enhancing mathematics education. It will affect every  undergraduate student on campus by integrating the use of  mathematics into all core curriculum (general education) classes.  Long-term goals of the project are to improve students' proficiency  in mathematics by routine use throughout their general education;  reduce \"math anxiety\" and generate more positive attitudes toward  mathematics and science, especially among future K-12 teachers; and  help break down barriers to technical career choices.  A prominent feature of the program is a Mathematics Center with a  full time Director which will provide support for the program by  serving as a resource for non-mathematics faculty in developing a  new mathematics-intensive curriculum; training student \"Math  Mentors\" to assist faculty and students in the application of  mathematics in non-mathematics courses; developing methods to  assess mathematical skills in all core classes; sponsoring Visiting  Distinguished Scholars to promote faculty dialogue across  disciplines; providing computers, video players, and tutors to  support students; and producing aids for student learning,  including video tapes.  A very successful Writing Across the Curriculum program served by  a Writing Center has been underway for four years at the University  of Nevada, Reno, and will serve as a model for Mathematics Across  the Curriculum. Dissemination of the entire program nationally is  a major goal of this proposal and will be aggressively undertaken.  ***y",
