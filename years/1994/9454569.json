The project will  also create a model of collaboration between secondary schools,  two-year and four-year colleges, educational and work force  agencies, professional organizations, and private industry.  This project proposes an informal consortium between Houston's  Spring Branch Independent School District, the Northwest College of  the Houston Community College System, the College of Technology of  the University of Houston, and selected private industry partners.  The project will encompass 1) a needs assessment of industrial  educational and training requirements, 2) curriculum development at  the secondary, community college, and four-year college levels, and  3) faculty/student development through educational and industry  mentor/apprenticeship opportunities, and 4) and evaluation of the  projects performance.NSF Form 1295(9/93)",
