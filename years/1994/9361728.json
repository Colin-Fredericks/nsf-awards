 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361728  Genders  This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation  Research Solicitation.  In a previous effort, a process based on  the electrochemical hydrodimerization of formaldehyde at a graphite  cathode was developed.  A drop in oil prices, and a resultant drop  in ethylene prices, the feedstock for the major present process for  ethylene glycol, made the new process economically unattractive.   This effort is an extension of the earlier work designed to reduce  the capital and operating costs required.  Modifications include  operating in an undivided, narrow-gap cell with noncatalytic  electrodes thus eliminating the need for costly membranes and  catalysts; using solvent extraction for product isolation and  employing gas-diffusion electrodes.    Ethylene glycol is an important commodity chemical.  It is a  precurser to polyester, is the principal antifreeze compound in  use, and has other applications in chemical processing.",
