 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408035  Belanger  Fungal endophytes of the genus Acremonium infect many wild and  cultivated grass species and these associations have major  ecological and agricultural impacts.  In many instances the  endophyte-grass association is strictly mutualistic.  The fungi  synthesize alkaloids which protect the plants from herbivory by  insects and other herbivores, while the plants supply the fungi  with necessary nutrients.  The presence of toxic alkaloids in  endophyte-infected forage grasses, however, can result in poisoning  syndromes in grazing livestock.  Because of the importance of  livestock toxicosis to agriculture, considerable research has been  done on this aspect of endophyte infection of grasses.      Dr. Belanger is interested in the physiology of the interaction of  the fungal endophytes and their host grasses.  In contrast to the  information on alkaloids and animal toxicosis, the physiological  aspects of endophyte-grass interactions have not been well  characterized in any system.      The long range objective of this research is to understand the  factors which are important in establishing effective symbiotic  associations between the Acremonium fungi and their host grasses.   Dr. Belanger has detected a novel fungal protease which is  expressed in the endophytic infection of the grass species Poa  ampla by the fungus Acremonium typhinum.  The focus of this  proposal is to further characterize this protease and determine its  role in the endophyte-grass association.  In addition to its  potential biological significance, this protease has unusual  features which make it a particularly interesting enzyme in its own  right.      The specific objectives of this research are:  1) Further characterization of the enzymatic and physical              properties of the A. typhinum protease  2) Characterization of cDNA and genomic clones for the A. typhinum      protease  3) Determination of the effect of protease gene disruption on the      ability of the fungus to infect its host  grass",
