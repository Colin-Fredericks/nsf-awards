 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attachment theory proposes that the child's early attachment  relationships are fundamental influences on social and emotional  development.  The continuing challenge of this relatively young  research area is to elaborate and refine the concept of attachment  by developing measures and research designs that allow for greater  accuracy and specificity.  This research will contribute to this  effort by assessing individual differences in attachment security  beyond the infancy period in the home environment, and by examining  links between security and theoretically relevant child behaviors  and perceptions.    Patterns of attachment with mother will be investigated in relation  to internal representations of the mother-child attachment  relationship, of the self, and of peers, both in the home and in  the daycare/preschool.  The study will employ a short-term  longitudinal design, with data collected on 80 children over two  years.  This project will dovetail with a larger longitudinal study  concerned with socialization of emotion and social competence with  peers.  The meshing of these two studies will provide a powerful  empirical data set with which to examine multiple interactive  factors in early social and emotional development.    Interactive activities include:  (1) teaching a graduate level  developmental psychopathology course not currently available at  George Mason; (2) organizing a series of seminars, presented by  women faculty in the science and engineering departments and guests  speakers, on the topic of \"Becoming a Scientist; and (3)  coordinating a \"Women in Science\" research festival with poster  presentations by women graduate students, faculty members and  researchers from the National Institute of Health.  Other  activities include team-teaching developmental psychology seminar,  mentoring undergraduate students who are preparing senior theses,  and training and supervising graduate students in research  methodology.",
