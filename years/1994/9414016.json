 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414016  Ruvolo    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Maryellen Ruvolo  will purchase an automated DNA sequencer system consisting of: 1.  an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer with the necessary  software for editing and analyzing newly-generated sequence files  and for DNA microsatellite typing; and 2. a DNA data storage  system consisting of: an external hard disk drive for ready  retrieval and manipulation of DNA sequence files and a magneto-  optical drive for long-term, high stability storage of DNA  sequence files. The research of Dr. Ruvolo and her colleagues  uses DNA sequence data and the purchase of this instrumentation  will exponentially increase the laboratory's productivity.    Research on primate systematics and evolution constitutes the  focus of the laboratory's work and the team is currently involved  in a number of projects. These include a broad scale approach to  the molecular systematics of primates and a complementary effort  on the molecular evolution of the Strepsirhines. The group has  begun work to determine the genetic diversity present within  extant chimpanzees and is examining mitochondrial DNA sequence  and nuclear microsatellite marker variability in East African  chimpanzee populations. These chimpanzees are important because  of their endangered status as well as the extensive behavioral  information available on selected groups. The new instrumentation  will also allow the team to expand its examination of hominoid  nuclear gene variation and genomic structure.    Dr. Ruvolo's laboratory trains undergraduate and graduate  students as well as post-doctoral fellows;  automated sequencer  equipment will assist in this, as well as the research, function.",
