Two carefully structured workshops jointly  sponsored by the Foundation and ABET would provide the forum  for the needed discussions and constitute a significant step  toward resolving the central issues.  Attendance would be  limited and would include leaders of the key stakeholder groups  for engineering accreditation.  ***",
