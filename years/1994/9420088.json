 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420088  Buck       The investigator and his colleague undertake an extensive  computational and analytical study of the energy surfaces given  by the energy functions on finite-dimensional conformation spaces  of knots.  The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal  knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given  by finite Fourier series parametrizations.  Recent theorems  relate the invariants given by these energy functions to  classical invariants such as crossing number.  So this project  should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with  relatively low degrees of freedom.       Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday  objects called knots.  Once thought the purview of theoretical  mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide range of  applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and  cosmology.  For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and  in the replication process must somehow become untangled.  In  this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing  techniques to the study of knots.  In particular, they continue  the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory.   The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot  types are distinguished by computations involving these  properties.  For example, knot conformations can be assigned an  energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering  minimum energy conformations.  The conceptual basis of the  approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and  physics as well as mathematics.  The project produces both  theoretical results and software.",
