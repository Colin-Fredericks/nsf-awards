 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409559  Baron    This research program has four parts. The first part of the  study involves a more complete exploration of information  hierarchies. Information hierarchies include public  hierarchies, such as, Congress, bureau, state agency, etc.  and private hierarchies, such as, manager, foreman,  headquarters, etc. The model that is developed addresses  current debates about the delegation of authority. It looks  at the problem of contracting and subcontracting when  information is incomplete and unobservable to at least one  of the parties involved.   The second part of the study  involves the development of collective choice theory from a  sequential choice perspective. It focuses on the provision  of collective goods rather than particularistic goods. It  attempts to include the electorate in the model and  addresses questions concerning the amount of information the  electorate has about collective goods programs. The third  part of the study deals with interest groups and their  influence at the electoral and legislative stages of the  policy process. The fourth part of the study involves  empirical tests of the sequential choice models of  collective goods provision using data on entitlement  expenditures.       This project is of significant interest because it  attempts to develop further a relatively novel approach to  modeling political institutions, to integrate legislative  and electoral determinants of policies, and to provide  insights into the nature and evolution of entitlement  programs.",
