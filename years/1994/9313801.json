The solar wind induces electric fields in the  ionosphere, accelerating the ions, which then accelerate the  neutral gas through collisions.   The reverse is also true.  If the  neutral species are accelerated by a pressure gradient or other  force, the ions are also accelerated.  One example is the diurnal  tide, which propagates up through the thermosphere.  The periodic  neutral winds act as a dynamo, generating global electrical  currents.    One important quantity for each of those interactions is the  collision frequency.  When the collision frequency is large for a  certain scattering process, those two gases are dynamically  coupled.  Unfortunately, the relevant collision cross sections are extremely  difficult to measure.  Laboratory measurements have been done only  at energies substantially greater than those found in the  thermosphere (Stebbings, 1964).  It is necessary to use quantum  mechanical calculation to extend theoretically the measurements to  the low energies of the thermosphere.    The transport coefficients are calculated as part of the proposed  research.  The theoretical values of these transport coefficients  will be compared to published coefficients and with empirically  derived coefficients.  The discrepancy between published empirical  and theoretical collision frequencies is on the order of a factor  of three.  An estimate of the error in the other transport  coefficients will be made based on this discrepancy and the  empirical coefficients.  Data from the Dynamics Explorer 2  satellite will be used to give empirical values of the collision  frequency and thermal diffusion coefficient.  Simplified momentum  and energy equations will be used in that analysis.  ***",
