He will collaborate with  professors R. Kumar and K.S. Gandhi on research  dealing with the engineering aspects of the  development of fine particles of current  technological importance.  These include  ceramics, pharmaceuticals, paints and others.   The work involves two features.  The first  deals with precipitation in single drops (or  reverse micelles), while the second is  concerned with the precipitation in  microemulsions.    Scope:  The P.I. has an invitation from the  President of the JNCASR in Bangalore to spend  his sabbatical there and to collaborate with  its staff.  The collaboration is likely to  enhance the progress of the U.S. scientist in  his research, and to produce significant  scientific results.  This fits well with the  aims of the Division of International Programs.  ***",
