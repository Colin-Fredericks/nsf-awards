 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general trend in the world economy to substitute markets and                competition for economic regulation, and the heightened                         international consciousness for energy efficient resource                       utilization motivate this study of the technical and economic                   feasibility of deregulating electric power transmission networks.               The project focuses on the development of computer coordinated                  market mechanisms for the generation and transmission of                        electrical energy and for the building and exchange of capacity                 rights in the power network.  Previous related work by the                      investigators has attracted the attention of various government                 agencies in New Zealand, England, France, Poland, Norway, Hungary               and the United States.  A useful byproduct of this grant is                     computer software for hands-on laboratory demonstration                         experiment to better inform non-technical decision makers of the                potential advantages of institutional reform.                                                                                                                   The approach taken to defining the structure and property rights                in the deregulated form of this industry is based on two                        fundamental concepts that are at the core of a deregulation                     scenario.  The first is central economic dispatch (regional or                  national) of energy in pipeline or transmission networks.  An                   economic dispatch center uses optimization algorithms that                      compute prices and allocations so as to maximize system surplus                 as revealed in the dispersed location-specific bids of all                      agents.  The idea is to combine the coordination advantages of                  centralization with the informational advantages of decentralized               ownership.  Decentralization cannot alone serve well the needs of               competition in markets that have the complex interdependencies                  that characterize power networks.  The second concept at the core               of a restructure is cotenancy or joint ownership of capacity                    rights to \"natural monopoly\" elements of the network, and the                   opportunity to exchange these rights as agents' circumstances                   change.  The research methodology is that of the controlled                     laboratory experiment.  The laboratory is used as a test bed to                 examine the performance and equilibrium properties of price-                    allocation mechanisms far too difficult to model formally as                    noncooperative games.",
