 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322112  Cotter       Ten women will be involved in field and laboratory research to  determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west-  central Minnesota.  This includes the continuation of three closely  related projects which have in common the utilization of till  provenance analysis to determine the origin and glacial history of  three problematic deposits.  These deposits are, 1) the Alexandria  Moraine Complex, 2) Tunnel Valley Eskers, and 3) the striated and  faceted Boulder Pavement of the Minnesota River Valley.   Additionally, paleoenvironmental studies of lacustrine deposits  will be expanded and will include micropaleontological,  palynological and geochemical investigations.       U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent  facilities and close faculty contact.  R.E.U. women will have the  opportunity to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates  doing geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and  role models to underrepresented high school students participating  in college level research.  The research experience and the unique  opportunity to interact with a scientific community when  underrepresented individuals are in the majority will both break  down a number of traditional barriers and aid in the maturation of  these students as scientists.  The culmination to the program, the  \"Friends of UMM REU\" conference, will provide these women with the  opportunity to present results and discuss ideas with experts in  the field.  Additionally a field trip to the Canadian Rockies will  show participants active glacial processes and glacial  environments.  The REU program will contribute to the personal  growth of these women and the research to be accomplished will  contribute to the understanding of the glacial history of  Minnesota.",
