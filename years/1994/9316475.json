To characterize the expression characteristics of each  tomato gene during growth and development and to define the type of  inducer(s) responsible for their induction. To characterize the  expression characteristics of the Arabidopsis ACS4 and ACS5 genes  in the presence of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and Li+, respectively.   To define the cisacting elements for IAA inducibility of the  Arabidopsis ACS4 and Li+ responsive elements of the ACS5 gene.  The  elements will be defined by ExoIII deletion analysis of the  promoter regions.  Promoter constructs with the CAT reporter gene  will be transiently assayed in Arabidopsis protoplasts.  The  functionally of the elements will be verified by stable  transformation experiments.  To inhibit growth of rice under  hypoxia using antisense OS-ACs1 RNA and to define the cell types  that express two rice genes OS-ACS1 and 3 under low O2 tension.  To  define the critical residues required for enzymatic activity of ACC  synthase by in vitro mutagenesis and expression experiments in E.  coli.  To perform intermolecular complementation experiments in E.  coli for determining whether ACC synthase is a dimer with two  active sites.  To inhibit ethylene dependent developmental  processes by overexpression of dominant negative mutations of  specific isoenzymes.   To biochemically characterize the  Arabidopsis ACC synthase isoenzymesfor defining their biochemical  diversity.  %%%  Ethylene is an unique plant signaling molecule.  The hydrocarbon  gas, known as the fruit ripening hormone, controls many aspects of  plant growth and development, and its synthesis is highly  regulated. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the key  enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-  carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase is encoded by a highly divergent  multigene family in various mono-and dicotyledonous plant s.  The  members of each family are differentially regulated by various  inducers and developmental stages.  Studies on the structure and  regulation of the ACC synthase genes in tomato (Lycopersicon  esculentum), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana are  proposed here to gain insight into the details of the biochemical  mechanisms that regulate their expression by various hormones and  stress conditions as well as their role in regulating plant growth.   Furthermore, in vitro mutagenesis studies are proposed to obtain  fundamental knowledge about the structure and function of the ACC  synthase protein.    ***",
