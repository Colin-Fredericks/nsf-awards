Results from a 1992 international survey of  representative samples of adults in 24 economically and  geographically diverse nations will be analyzed in detail.    Three broad types of investigation will be conducted: 1) Various  analyses of individual-level survey data will be conducted to  test models of the nature and sources of environmental concern  within nations, as well as across nations;  2) Results from the  foregoing analyses will be used to create aggregate-level  measures of public perceptions for each nation, and these will be  combined with existing data on the economic, social, political  and environmental characteristics of these same nations to allow  aggregate-level model testing at the national and regional  levels;  3) Potential links between national-level  characteristics and individual-level perceptions will be  investigated using a variety of contextual analysis techniques.   In all of these analyses, special attention will be paid to how  perceptions of global change are interrelated with perceptions of  a wide range of environmental phenomena.  %%%       In addition to providing unprecedented information on public  perceptions related to global environmental change that will be  of value to research and policy-making communities, this study  offers an opportunity to test general theories and extend  existing social science research on the nature and sources of  environmental awareness and concern.    ***",
