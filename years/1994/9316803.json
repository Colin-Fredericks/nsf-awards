While VRH by  non-interacting electrons is well understood, recent experiments  have shown that VRH at low temperatures in the presence of magnetic  perturbations leads to new and unexpected phenomena, including the  possibility of a new spin-charge coupled quasiparticle.  It is  planned to investigate the many-body density-of-states and  elementary excitation spectrum in VRH conductors using electron  tunneling and magneto transport experiments at low temperatures and  high magnetic fields.  The goal is to directly measure the proposed  energy gap structure inferred from conductivity data and to  elucidate the effects of magnetic scattering on hopping conduction.    Non-technical abstract:  A fundamental problem in condensed matter  physics is concerned with the mechanism of electrical conduction in  a solid.  While the understanding of common metals and  semiconductors is highly developed, many materials exhibit unusual,  often poorly understood electrical behavior.  A commonly observed  form of unconventional electrical conduction is known as variable-  range hopping (VRH).  Since many diverse technologically important  solids are VRH conductors, it is of practical importance to develop  a more profound physical understanding of this process.  Recent  experiments have shown that VRH conduction can yield complex and  completely unexpected behavior.  In order to elucidate the  fundamental principles which underlie this electrical conductiom it  is proposed to study directly rhe microscopic properties of the  charge carriers in different VRH conductors.  ***",
