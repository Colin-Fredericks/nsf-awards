 "awd_abstract_narration": "94-08272  Sounder    An understanding of the factors underlying successful new product innovation and associated processes within different cultures is vitally important to modern managers, and equally important to today's public decision makers.  However, a major gap exists in our knowledge of new product innovation success/failure factors across multiple countries and cultures.  In response to this gap the Center for the Management of Science and Technology (CMOST) has undertaken INTERPROD, and international cross-cultural study of factors that distinguish new product successes from failures.  The entire INTERPROD study will result in a unique database of historical life cycle data on hundreds of factors that actually affected the success and failure outcomes of over 2,000 new product innovations, in over 250 firms within sixteen countries.  The sampling plan will be stratified by large and small firms within several industries, by successful and unsuccessful projects within these strata, and by high and low uncertainty new product development efforts.  Thus, the results can be analyzed across several dimensions.  A series of carefully designed questionnaires, telephone interviews and face-to-face interviews will be administered to collect the data.  This funds only Phase II of INTERPROD (includes Phases IIA and IIB).  The pilot Phase I has been completed using internally generated CMOST funds.   The decision to move on to subsequent phases of INTERPROD will depend on the outcome of Phase II.",
