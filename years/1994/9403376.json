This is a satellite conference of the  International Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors taking  place in Vancouver.  The use of high magnetic fields is an  indispensable tool for probing new semiconductor materials and  structures, and has been useful in designing practical devices.   The meting will have impact in areas of research on electronic,  magnetic and photonic devices.  It will bring together an  outstanding international group of who are at the forefront of  scientific research and state of the art technology.
