 "awd_abstract_narration": "PMSA-9353608  Memphis City Schools  Memphis, TN  Jones, Barbara    \"Memphis Minority Mathematics and Science Achievement Partnership  Project\"    Minority academic performance in mathematics and science is lower  in the southeastern United States than any other area.  With a  total of approximately 105,000 students and 84,000 African American  students, the Memphis City School system is one of largest school  systems in that region as well as the United States.  Promising  solutions may be found in national experience and experimentation  within the Memphis City School system.  However, it is becoming  apparent that effective solutions must be comprehensive and ling  term.  Comprehensive and long term solutions require the  mobilization of community wide resources for systemic adoption and  the institutionalization of effective programming for the necessary  through time effort.    This project has three goals: 1) to increase enrollment and success  of minority students in mathematics and science courses; 2) to  increase minority enrollment in college and entry into mathematics  and science courses; and 3) to accomplish replication and  institutionalization of effective programming.   The project will  offer a comprehensive set of activities for student s, teachers,  and parents.  In its first phase, activities that have been  identified as potentially effective will be implemented in a set of  schools with 90% minority enrollments and 2/3's of the Memphis City  School system's students and teachers.  Required community  resources will be mobilized through a collaborative led by memphis  City School that includes a historically Black college, a  comprehensive university, health sciences university, and a  nationally unique community base coordinating agency.  In its  second phase, effective activities will be identified and extended  systemwide based on the results of careful and timely monitoring,  assessment and analysis.  A \"bottom up\" strategy empowering  teachers and school site level staff  and a \"top down\" strategy  involving school system, higher education, community  representatives, and community political and business leaders will  be used to bring about systemic change.  ***",
