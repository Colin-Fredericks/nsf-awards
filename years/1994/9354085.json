 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    ESI-9354085    A National Curriculum Development and Evaluation Project for High          School Scope, Sequence, and Coordination in Science    The National Science Teachers Association(NSTA) will lead a  carefully focused project in developing and evaluating an (SS&C)  program at the high school level. Thirteen high schools having  diverse populations and resources will participate in this project,  along with suitably identified control classes that utilize  traditional curricula. These schools are from California, Iowa,  Montana, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Washington, DC. The  140 participating teachers will attend inservice workshops which  provide the philosophical constructs of the SS&C science education  reform and prepare them to use instructional materials which are  congruent with the SS&C approach. The evaluation of the project is  comprehensive considering both the teacher enhancement  component  and student outcomes.      The project will focus on: (1) the natural science, i.e. biology,  chemistry, earth sciences, and physics; (2) the high school level  from grade 9 through grade 12; (3) the specification and  incorporation of the basic tenets of SS&C at all sites; (4)  coordination of teaching the science subjects, designed so as to  achieve integration of the sciences by students; (5) answering  important evaluation questions, regarding the efficacy of the SS&C  approach, before embarking on widespread implementation.    All sites will: follow the SS&C principles of providing every  science subject every year, explicitly taking into account  student's prior knowledge; provide a sequence of content from  concrete experiences and descriptive expression to abstract  symbolism and quantitative expression; revisit concepts,   principles, and theories at successively higher levels of  abstraction; coordinate learning in the four science subjects so as  to interrelate basic concepts and principles.    The project will work closely wit h the National Science Education  Standards Development process at the NRC. The SS&C Framework for  grades 9-12 will be revised to meet the requirements of those  standards, while conforming to the tenets of SS&C Materials will be  prepared in the form of Anthologies of appropriate readings and  core laboratory experiments adapted from extant sources. Project  evaluation will establish, through evidence in the form of student  achievement, that a program based on SS&C tenets will achieve the  fundamental goal of the SS&C reform: to make the natural science  understandable by, accessible to, and useful in, the lives of all  students.",
