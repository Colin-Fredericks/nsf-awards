The study will address such questions as research productivity, area oriented versus problem oriented studies, applications to real world problems, the role of graduate and post graduate students in long term studies, etc.  The study will use four approaches: (1) a survey of published papers; (2) a survey of knowledgeable scientists in the field; (3) citation analysis; and (4) a review of positions held and accomplishments of former students associated with long term projects.%%%  %%%  The analysis of the role of long term ecological research in the development of new ecological theory is important to the historical and scientific development of ecology.  This synthetic and integrative approach will offer new insights into the current status of ecological theory.",
