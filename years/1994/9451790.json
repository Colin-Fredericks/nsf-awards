The laboratory centers on the speed and versatility  of computer workstations and powerful software for modeling actual  chemical systems.  Rather than creating a new course, we are  incorporating modeling into several existing courses, beginning  with introductory chemistry for science majors.  Our intent is to  increase general retention in science and particular interest in  chemistry.  Students are becoming more and more familiar with the  sophisticated software as they progress through their educational  careers and are developing a high degree of proficiency and  independence in the use of the laboratory.  Students are using this  laboratory both in guided exercises and in self-paced and more  independent projects.  Questions of \"What if...?\" and \"How  come...?\" are posed and addressed once the student appreciates the  power as well as the limitations of computational approaches.  We  feel strongly that these tools for investigation are allowing our  chemistry majors to develop their creativity by relieving some of  the mathematical barriers and giving them a ready environment to  test their own ideas.  In this way, our students are being better  prepared both for careers in industry and also for graduate school  as they look to the future.",
