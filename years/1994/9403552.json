A recently proposed  finite element approximation scheme for the Reissner-Mindlin plate  model will be analyzed to determine whether it avoids the \"locking\"  problem which causes most methods to give poor approximations for  thin plates. A numerical study of this and other schemes proposed in  the literature will also be done to compare their effectiveness. A  related portion of the  project is to study formally \"higher order\"  plate models,  providing both a systematic derivation and  mathematically rigorous error estimates for the stresses and  displacements. The aim is to determine when any of these models can  be rigorously shown to give better approximations to the full three  dimensional equations than the simplest biharmonic model, thus  providing a justification of the models and a way of deciding which  models are the most appropriate in various circumstances. The second  area of focus of the project is the study of space-time finite  element methods for the approximation of two problems in Mechanics.  The first problem involves a system of nonlinear  partial  differential equations which models the planar motion of a class of  inextensible elastic rods. The system has an energy which is  conserved and the goal of the project is to develop a family of  arbitrary order energy conserving finite element schemes for this  problem, in order to obtain more accurate approximations with less  computational effort than are possible with a finite difference  method previously developed by the PI.  The second problem is  concerned with surface diffusion.  Specifically, the goal is to  rigorously establish the stability and convergence of a family of  space-time finite element methods  developed by the PI for the  approximation of a system of partial differential equations that  model the changes of shape in duced in  an isotropic and homogeneous  solid body of constant density under  the influence of mass diffusion  within the body. Providing a          rigorous foundation for these  methods gives confidence that the numerical approximations provide  accurate predictions of the behavior of the model       The first area of focus of the project is the numerical and  analytical study of two dimensional plate models, commonly used by  engineers to predict displacements and stresses of thin three  dimensional elastic bodies when various forces are applied. The use  of the computer to obtain approximate solutions is necessary for  these problems, since except in very special cases, exact solutions  are not known. Hence, one important aspect of this project is the  analysis and comparison of computational algorithms. Since many  different two dimensional plate models appear in the literature, a  related portion of the project is to determine when any of these  models can be rigorously shown to give better approximations to the  full three dimensional  equations than the simplest model currently  used, thus providing a justification of the models and a way of  deciding which models are the most appropriate in various  circumstances. The second area of focus of the project is the  development of efficient computational algorithms for the  approximation of two problems in mechanics. The first problem  involves a mathematical model for         the planar motion of a  class of inextensible elastic rods. The  dynamics of inextensible  rods is important for applications ranging from flexible space  structures to the modelling of the dynamics of long chain molecules  such as polymers or DNA. The second problem to be investigated is  concerned with shape changes of a body driven by surface tension. The  particular mathematical model to be studied models the changes of  shape induced in an isotropic and homogeneous solid body of constant  density under the influence of mass diffusion within the body. The  aim is t o both develop new approximation schemes and provide a  rigorous analysis of the errors. The latter is important in providing  confidence that the numerical approximations obtained are giving  accurate predictions of the behavior of the models.",
