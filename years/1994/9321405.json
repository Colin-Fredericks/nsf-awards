 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to extend predictive frost heave  models to full 3-D forms in an effort to better understand the  processes involved in development of patterned ground, such as  earth hummocks, that occurs in periglacial environments.  Of the 19  mechanisms thought to be important, either singly or in  combination, for formation of patterned ground, only two have been  incorporated into mathematical models.  The objectives of this work  are: 1) to use published laboratory frost-heave data to test a  simplified form of the 1-D secondary frost-heave model of O Neill  and Miller which can be generalized to 3-D; 2) to ascertain the  ability of a new differential frost-heave model based on this  simplified form of the O Neill and Miller model to describe earth  hummocks whose relevant properties have been characterized; 3) to  refine this differential frost-heave model based on the laboratory  and field observations; and 4) to explore the applicability of this  model to describe features of other forms of patterned ground.  In  addition to improving models of periglacial processes, this work  will benefit researchers correlating ancient geomorphic features  with past climate as well as engineers developing construction  projects in periglacial regions.",
