 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224553  Karimabadi  Of the six types of shocks (fast, slow, and four types of  intermediate shocks) allowed by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Rankine-  Hugoniot relations, intermediate shocks are the least understood.   Besides being of great theoretical interest, the study of  intermediate shocks (ISs) is essential to the understanding of  diverse space plasma phenomena, such as the magnetopause and shock  fronts associated with coronal mass ejections.  ISs provide an  important dissipation process in space plasmas and are one of only  two plasma discontinuities that allow for the rotation of the  magnetic field, with the other being the rotational discontinuity  (RD).  Although the existence of ISs has recently been established  within the resistive MHD framework, far less is known about their  properties in collisionless plasmas.  This work is to investigate  the formation and properties of ISs and their relation to RDs in  collisionless plasmas with applications to space plasmas.  For the  first time many important effects, such as temperature anisotropy,  will be included in the calculations.  We will examine the  hypothesis that field rotations at the magnetopause and in the  solar wind are due to ISs rather than RDs.  Two approaches will be  taken.  One is the study of ISs as a single structure removed from  external perturbations.  The other approach involves the formation  of multiple discontinuities and their interactions, much as would  occur during reconnection events.  The goal of this study is to  determine the conditions under which ISs can be formed, and whether  they can remain stable in the presence of perturbations.  The  primary tools of our investigation are state-of-the-art kinetic  numerical simulations, although for comparison, MHD simulations  will also be performed.  ***",
