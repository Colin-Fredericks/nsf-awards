 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411025  Miller    This research projects concerns theories of electoral competition  between political parties competing for public office in  democracies.  Electoral politics are dynamic.  This research  examines the dynamic interactions between election rules, public  opinion, and the behavior of political parties.  A distinguishing  feature of the proposed research is that it employs computer  models to discover patterns of political party behavior over a  series of elections and across electoral institutions.  The  models in the project are advanced forms of computer simulations  that are new to the social sciences though they have been used  extensively in the natural sciences.  Among their advantages,  these models allow for flexibility and descriptive accuracy in  developing theories of political behavior.  The current research  will continue to develop theories of electoral competition  through the use of computers and mathematical modeling, and then  test these theories using survey data from the United States and  Europe.    The research consists of three parts.  The first part is the  computer modeling, which continues previous research of the  collaborative research team.  This research has already generated  explanations and predictions about the effects of electoral  institutions and public opinion on the behavior of political  parties, both in the way parties campaign for public office and  in the policies they enact once in office.  The second part of  the project involves using mathematics to substantiate the  findings from the computer model.  using both techniques, the  researchers have so far confirmed the validity of earlier  computer findings and made several predictions of political party  behavior.  The third part uses survey data from election studies  in the United States and Europe to test the predictions generated  by the computer models.  One central theoretical finding from  their previous research has generally been supported by survey  data from the American Nati onal Election Study 1972-1988.  The  collaborators intend to undertake more research on real election  data as a portion of this research project.    The research has two main objectives.  First, to understand more  fully the way different democratic institutions create incentives  for political elites to change governmental policies to appeal to  voters.  Knowledge from this research may be helpful in the  design of constitutions for emerging democracies.  The second  objective is to extend the use of computer modeling in the social  sciences, and to establish computational standards for testing  social science models for completeness and accuracy.",
