They are proposing to  collaborate with the Workshop Center at City College of the City  University of New York, the NYC Central Board of Education, and the  Educational Development Center to plan a local systemic teacher  enhancement effort for improving the teaching and learning of  science in the elementary schools of both districts.  The grant  will allow the districts to conduct a better needs assessment which  would include examining staff abilities in terms of their teachers'  ability to use inquiry teaching methodologies knowledge of science  content and process, and ability to change.  They will also be  identifying possible lead teachers based on their willingness to  work with colleagues and ability to serve as mentors.  Once the  expertise has been identified a model will be developed which will  include:  designing the organizational structure; defining the  curriculum; identifying the content of the inservice; defining  avenues for collaboration with other NSF projects and community-  based agencies, including the USI effort, and coordinating with  informal science centers.  ***",
