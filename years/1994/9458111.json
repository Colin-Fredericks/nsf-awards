 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458111  Povinelli  This award provides support to Dr. Daniel Povinelli under the  National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.   The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young  faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic  career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for  research and educational activities, and to foster contact and  cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that  support research and education.  Dr. Povinelli has already made  significant research contributions to the field of physical  anthropology, and he has the potential to become a leader in  academic research and education.    This award will allow the investigator to build on his existing  research on self-awareness and to undertake series of studies of  chimpanzees and young children's understanding of agency,  intention, and knowledge and belief, in both themselves and  others.  The research holds promise of making considerable  progress toward constraining our interpretations of the  psychology underpinning complex social behavior in chimpanzees.   Furthermore, it will allow a determination of the extent of  overlap in human and chimpanzee cognitive development related to  mental state attribution.  This will allow evolutionary  biologists to produce more precise reconstructions of the  primitive cognitive features of the great ape-human clade, as  well as a determination of the more derived features of human  cognition.",
