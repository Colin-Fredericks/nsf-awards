 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glossiphoniid leeches, including various species of  Helobdella, are useful for in depth analyses of  developmental processes for two reasons: first, they are  relatively simple animals with large, accessible embryos  that are suited for combined cellular and molecular  techniques.  Second, since leeches belong to the phylum  Annelida, an otherwise poorly studied group, the results  obtained are useful for making interphyletic comparisons.  Such comparisons are essential to distinguish general  developmental processes from phylum-specific ones, and also  to learn how evolutionary modification of developmental  processes leads to the appearance of diverse animal types.  For example, annelids and arthropods resemble each other  (and differ from molluscs) in that they both have segmented  body plans.  In both annelids and arthropods, segmental  tissues arise from longitudinally oriented, ventrally  situated arrays of cells, termed the germ band (in  arthropods such as the fruitfly Drosophila) or germinal  plate (in annelids).  In leech, the germinal plate arises in  strict head-to-tail (rostrocaudal) progression by repeated  divisions of specialized embryonic stem cells called  teloblasts.  Homologs of several genes involved in  rostrocaudal patterning of Drosophila seem to be expressed  in homologous patterns during rostrocaudal patterning of  leech.  This suggests that the molecular genetic processes  of differentiation and morphogenesis in later development  will be quite similar in the two phyla.  But the early  Helobdella embryo is strikingly different from the early  Drosophila embryo and strikingly similar to the molluscan  embryos.  Thus, the question of how cell fates are  determined in the early leech is of considerable interest.  The first part of this proposal contains experiments  designed to further previous investigations of how distinct  fates are assigned to particular cells in the developing  embryo, with emphasis on the assignment of mesodermal and  ectodermal fates to individual ly identified cells that are  born when the embryo contains only 10 cells, and to look for  similarities between Helobdella and Drosophila in this  regard.  A second question of interest is that of how the  \"molluscan\" mode of early leech development meshes with the  \"arthropodan\" mode of later development.  A critical aspect  of this process is the spreading of one layer of cells over  the entire surface of the embryo during the formation of the  germinal plate in Helobdella.  The experiments in the second  part of this proposal are designed to elucidate the cellular  processes involved in these morphogenetic movements.",
