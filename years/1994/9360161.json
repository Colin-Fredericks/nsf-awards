 "awd_abstract_narration": "9360161  Sun    A number of industrial processes, including incinerators and  metallurgical processes, typically emit large numbers of fine  particles.  Measurements at an operating sewage sludge incinerator  have shown that heavy metals (including Cadmium, Chromium, Nickel,  Lead, and Zinc) are concentrated in the fine particle  (approximately 0.25 mocrons) leaving the incinerators.  Venturi  scrubbers have been typically installed to remove particulate from  these flue gas sources.  The classical scrubbers are not capable of  removing particles smaller than about 0.5 microns.  The process  proposed in this project is the use of the submicron particulate  penetrating the Venturi scrubber as condensation nuclei for steam  injected into the flue gas to supersaturate it with water vapor.   Theoretical analyses show that water droplets as large as 1.0  micron can be produced with reasonable steam rates and contact  times.  These water droplets (a dilute suspension of the fine  particulate) are removed from the  flue gas stream with a high  efficiency mist eliminator and drained to the scrubber sump.   Preliminary analyses have shown that heavy metals in the fine  particulate leaving the Venturi scrubber can be reduced by 90%  using this process.    With a relatively modest construction effort, the process proposed  here can reduce fine particle and heavy metal emissions from  incinerators equipped with wet scrubbers.  The process is  applicable to flue gas streams cleaned by wet scrubbers including  incinerators, metallurgical processes, and coal-fired power plants  with wet scrubbers for sulfur dioxide emission control.  ***",
