 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408120  McConnaughay    In plant ecological research, differences among plants of  different genetic identity (e.g., species) or among plants  grown in different environments are usually assessed by  comparing plants at a single, often arbitrary, point in  time. This static view of plant responses does not recognize  the dynamic and indeterminate nature of plant development.  Most characteristics of plants change during growth and  development; the ratio of root: shoot biomass, for example,  is usually high in seedlings ald then declines as the plant  grows in size. Furthermore, plants of different genetic  identity or in different environments may differ in rates of  growth and development. Thus differences observed at any one  point in time may not represent an adapative response to a  given environment, but rather may be due, at least in part  to differences in the developmental stage or size of the  plant. In the last several years, there has been a  widespread recognition that a broad understanding of  environmental and genetic differences among plants requires  a dynamic characterization of plant growth and development.  We must shift our focus from snapshots of plants at one  point in development to the dynamics of development itself.    Biomass allocation patterns (i.e., relative amounts of  biomass put in to varying plant structures) have received  considerable attention from plant ecologists and plant  evolutionary biologists. For example, these traits have been  used to describe functional adaptations to environmental  constraints. Since allocation patterns may change during  plant growth and development, different allocation patterns  may result from flexibility in allocation per se (allocation  plasticity) or in overall plant growth (plasticity in growth  or developmental rates). In cases where allocational  plasticity is strictly due to alterations in growth or  developmental rates, much of our current theory concerning  optimal growth patterns and functional adaptations of plants   to variable environments may need to be revised.    We propose to separate the effects of resource availability  on plant growth rate and biomass partitioning. We will grow  plants in environments with different levels of resource  availability (CO2, light, nutrients and water) in order to  determine if differences in biomass allocation result from  differences in growth rates, partitioning, or both. These  experiments will provide much needed information concerning  plant functional adaptations to environments differing in  resource availability. ***",
