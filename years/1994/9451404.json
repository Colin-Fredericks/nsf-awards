 "awd_abstract_narration": "9451404  Wing  This proposal describes current revisions being made in the  laboratory portion of Biol 322 Genetics. The Genetics course is  required for all Biology majors. The enrollment in the Genetics  course has, over the past six years, been approximately 50% women  while our graduates over the same time period have been only 45%  women. The revisions being made in the Genetics lab are designed to  promote cooperative learning experiences which are frequently more  positive educational experiences for women than traditional  pedagogical methods. It is hoped that the combination of  cooperative and investigative lab experiences provided in the  Genetics lab will encourage more women to stay in the discipline of  Biology.     In order to give students the opportunity of working on projects  related to the area of molecular genetics, equipment in addition to  what is currently available in the department is required. Thus,  this proposal requests matching funds for the purchase of six  horizontal electrophoretic systems, six vertical electrophoretic  systems with appropriate power supplies, densitometer, and  transluminator. Also requested are three microcentrifuges, pipets,  incubators, water baths, and vortex mixers needed for the isolation  and preparation of samples for electrophoresis.",
