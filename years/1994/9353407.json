The project will :  * Increase the number of inquiry based middle school  science and mathematics teachers in the Western Region  from 180 to 600 in the period 1994 to 1996.  * Provide institute training to 54 mathematics and  science coordinators or administrators.  * Recruit and train 9 West Region college and/or  university faculty to be content experts in the summer  institutes  * Recruit 18 additional middle school teachers to serve  as institute faculty.  Academic leadership teams to staff the summer  institutes for teacher enhancement consist of one  scientist, one mathematician and two master teachers.  Three teams will be trained for each region one in  mathematics and one each in physical and life sciences.  These teams will then offer intensive summer institutes  to groups of teachers and administrators from every  school in the West Region.  Each teacher will receive 144 contact hours in one  content area in a summer institute with 48 contact  hours in the academic year follow up.  In addition the training of a large group of regional  science and mathematics coordinators and administrators  in the same inquiry model, will provide a mechanism for  horizontal and vertical translation of the model in  every school district.  The Western Region of Ohio serves a large urban,  racially and ethnically mixed population as well as a  more homogeneous group scattered over a large rural  area.  Cost share is 120%.",
