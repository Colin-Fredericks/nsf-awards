The Summer Science Camp Program seeks to  provide minority students of intermediate academic ability--  students who, without strong encouragement, would otherwise not  enter a university--with the tools and the encouragement necessary  for them to pursue such educational opportunities.  In the Summer  Science Camp students will be trained in research techniques and  study skills, writing skills and, given hands-on experiences in  conducting laboratory experiments from several scientific  disciplines.  Teachers from area public schools will  collaboratively plan chemistry, physics and mathematics classes  with Houston Community College-Northeast College instructors and  University of Houston professors.  Classroom activity projects and  lessons will be team-taught by chemistry, physics and mathematics  university and community college professors.  Instructors will  mentor students, working in classrooms and labs, and making field  trips to enhance their understanding to reinforce the goals and  objectives of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics  Curriculum and Evaluation Standards and revised Texas State  Curriculum for Mathematics and Science.  TexPrep materials from the  University of Texas-San Antonio will be integrated into the summer  camp curriculum.    Students will be exposed to scientifically and technologically  based careers through interaction with minority scientists and  engineers.  undergraduate students wi ll escort students from class  to class.  After the academic activities, students will participate  in recreational activities such as swimming, bowling, rap sessions  (discussing topics relevant to teenagers), and the like, that will  be planned and supervised by undergraduate students.  One hour and  a half will devoted to study time so students can complete homework  assignments for the next day.  Participants will be residentially  housed at the university from Sunday evening through Friday  afternoon, spending the weekends at home.  Graduate students will  serve as mentors and role models for participants.  In addition to  the responsibilities mentioned above, undergraduates who are  majoring in scientific and engineering fields at the university of  Houston and who are themselves minority students mentors, tutor (if  necessary) and supervise recreational activities for Summer Science  Camp Program students.    ***",
