 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funding of this proposal will significantly enhance  ongoing research, undergraduate research training, and will  provide an Internet service to the national undergraduate  chemical research community by providing high performance  computing and information infrastructure equipment. The  requested equipment will substantially upgrade our ability to  analyze NMR data and add a completely new computational and  modeling ability for direct use in our research projects and  research training activities.                Use of this equipment for current research at PLU will  focus on the following projects. Biotechnology: Hypothetical  enzyme inhibitors will be modeled and evaluated for their  potential effectiveness before synthetic work is undertaken.  New inhibitors and mechanistic probes will be designed.  Enzyme active sites and other aspects of tertiary structure  will be modeled using the requested software. Polymers: Model  phase diagrams for polymer blends will be generated for use  in studies of phase separation kinetics and local segmental  dynamics. Potential blends will be screened to focus on the  systems with the greatest potential. Polymer characterization  by NMR and modeling of pertinent thermodynamic, solution, and  conformational data will be needed in the phase diagram  calculations. Bioengineering: Studies on the generation of  electrokinetic fields in bone will be enhanced by extension  of the current studies to three dimensions. Prediction of  field effects in whole bone will thus become possible.                In terms of research training, we will target two  communities: local and national. First, we will utilize this  equipment in our existing undergraduate research training  courses. Second, an Internet accessible resource will be  established for undergraduate students doing chemical  research both in our program and around the country. In this  on-line \"community,\" students can exchange research ideas,  find useful information, and take part in Internet based   undergraduate research poster sessions.                The console for our QE-PLUS 300 MHz FT-NMR will be  upgraded allowing access to stored data through an ethernet  connection. For the molecular modeling and NMR data analysis,  a Silicon Graphics and an IBM RS6000 workstation will be  acquired. The Silicon Graphics workstation will be primarily  for graphical modeling software, and the RS6000 will be used  for the computationally intense programs as well as a host  for the Internet service. Biosym's Modeling packages, Spartan  Modeling software, and NMR software (Felix) will be the core  analysis tools for the research components. List/mail and  gopher servers will be used for the Internet service for  undergraduate chemical research.",
