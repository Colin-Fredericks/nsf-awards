It will build on existing data concerning World War II federal  investments by encoding data contained in General Services  Administration reports on federal properties, classified  according to the function performed (research and development,  industrial, administrative, and miscellaneous) and by the agency  controlling the installation.  Analysis will examine the effects  of these facilities on several dimensions of county-level growth:  value added in manufacturing, employment, wage levels, and  education level of the work force.  %%%       In addition to addressing issues of central concern to  social scientists, this research will generate valuable  information for the policy makers who are making decisions  concerning the redirection of federal investments and prime  contracts in the post Cold War era.  Specifically, there is  widespread concern that counties in which major military  installations are being closed or reduced in size will experience  significant economic dislocation in the coming years.   Additionally, there exists much disagreement over the possibility  that federally-owned toxic waste sites, especially those used for  nuclear weapons production, may inhibit local economic growth.   Because the data set will include military bases destined to  close and toxic waste sites, the findings generated by this  research can assist policy makers to anticipate which counties  will experience the greatest economic dislocation.    ***",
