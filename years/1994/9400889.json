 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400889  Keisler       Many existence theorems in analysis have standard proofs  using convergence arguments and nonstandard proofs yielding  stronger results using lifting arguments.  The investigator has  recently introduced a new model-theoretic method of proving  existence theorems, where one can often make an easy computation  to obtain an approximate solution to a problem, and then invoke a  general forcing theorem to get a harder result giving an exact  solution.  The present project will continue development of this  method.       For a variety of problems in both pure and applied  mathematics, it is easy to show that there are approximate  solutions but very difficult to show that there are exact  solutions.  This is typical for stochastic differential  equations, optimization problems, and equilibrium problems.   Keisler's new approach to such problems, which is justified by a  theorem in mathematical logic, can often dramatically simplify  the construction of exact solutions.  This method has already  produced several new results and has the potential of becoming a  valuable and broadly applicable tool.  ***",
