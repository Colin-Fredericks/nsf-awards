 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320392  Robertshaw    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Peter Robertshaw  and his colleagues will conduct archaeological research in the  region of Bunyoro-Kitara which is located in Uganda. Prior work  has revealed the presence of large earthworks which bespeak to  the past presence of large scale highly organized societies. More  recent work by Dr. Robertshaw has also located numerous  archaeological sites which are not associated with such  structures. Over the course of three field seasons the team plans  to excavate a series of these sites. During the first season the  potential for excavation of known earthworks will be assessed,  further archaeological surveys will be conducted and a program of  thermoluminescence dating of pottery will be initiated. During  the second season, work will focus on the intensive excavation of  several sites. It is anticipated that this will result in the  location of both elite and commoner areas and the recovery of  substantial samples of artifacts, and vegetal and faunal remains  which will provide a basis for the reconstruction of social  organization and economy. In the final season, an additional site  will be excavated, survey will continue and recovered materials  will be analyzed.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex social units such  as states arise. Evidence indicates that this process took place  independently in many parts of the world and through comparison  of individual cases it should be possible to discern the  underlying causes responsible. Although relatively little work  has been done in this area, Africa has much to contribute.  European explorers, when they entered this region, found well  developed states and many have been ethnographically described.  Because groups in the region have extensive oral traditions, this  source of data provides valuable additional insight. However very  little archaeological work has been done and the prehistory of  these observed entities is poorly understood. Dr. Robertshaw's   research should help to correct this situation.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It should increase our  understanding of how state formation takes place and will  encourage international collaboration between U.S. and African  scientists.  ***",
