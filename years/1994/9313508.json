 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chapman         This award will allow the University of California at  Los Angeles to renovate and modernize approximately 14,000  square feet of lab space  into a computer modeling research  facility in the chemical and biological sciences.  The  existing space does not conform to current fire, life  safety, code, and access requirements.  The renovation of  the fourth floor of the south wing of Young Hall will make  available a Chem-Bio Research Visualization and Learning  Center dedicated to high-resolution computer graphic display  instruction and research, as well as support spaces.  This  facility will be used by researchers, students, both  undergraduate and graduates, and postdoctoral fellows.  The  vision for this center  has been responsible for creating an  environment that will foster interaction among various  groups for innovative computer utilization.  Novel methods  are also employed by the new center arrangement to provide  means of enhancing the chances of minority and women in the  life sciences.  This project will be cost-shared with the  State of California and is an integral part of their science  challenge designed to attract and retain students in science  and to improve the attitudes of students towards science.  ***",
