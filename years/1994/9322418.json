 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9322481  Dhir     Vapor-liquid interface shape during saturated or subcooled film boiling on a vertical surface is governed by Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability whereas it is the Raleigh-Taylor instability that governs the configuration of the interface during film boiling on horizontal surfaces. The evolution of the interface and the induced flow field govern the heat and mass transfer across the interface and in turn the heat transfer from the heater surface. In this study a complete numerical simulation of the evolution of the vapor-liquid interface and the accompanied flow and temperature field in the vapor and the liquid is proposed. The simulation will be carried out without introducing any empirical constants and will include both linear and non-linear growth of the interfacial instabilities. In the first phase, the effort will be limited to only two dimensions, and spectral collocation method along with SIMPLE algorithm will be used to numerically integrate the governing equations. The numerical results will also yield the wall superheats at which a continuous vapor film could not be supported on the heater surface. Thus the results will provide a completely theoretical basis for prediction of minimum heat fluxes. The numerical effort will be supported with experimental data already reported in the literature. If deemed necessary, existing experimental facilities will be used to obtain the required data on vertical and/or horizontal plates.",
