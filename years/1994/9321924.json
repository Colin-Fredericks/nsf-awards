 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fisch  This research focusses on experimental investigations of strongly  interacting self-assembled systems.  Static and dynamic light  scattering techniques will be used, at atmospheric pressure and  at high pressures, to study the physical properties of semidilute  and concentrated bulk surfactant solutions. We intend to  investigate a wide variety of systems including zwitterionic  surfactant solutions, mixed surfactant solutions and solutions  that contain either rod-like or tubular micelles. The two  dimensional phase behavior of tubular aggregates on the surface  or an isotropic fluid will be studied both optically and through  direct physical measurements. Studies of model systems that  consist of small particles on a vibrating table will complement  these measurements. Overall, this program will provide essential  thermodynamic information and an improved microscopic  understanding of bulk semidilute and concentrated micellar  solutions and new insights and model systems for understanding  phase transitions in two dimensions.  %%%  The objectives of this research are: 1) to obtain a better  understanding of the properties of semidilute and concentrated  self-assembled systems by using optical and physical chemical  techniques; 2) to study the properties of these solutions when  the self-assembled aggregates form a 3-d solution and when they  are confined to the surface of an isotropic fluid, thus forming a  2-d nematic phase. Overall, this program will provide essential  thermodynamic information and an improved microscopic  understanding of bulk semidilute and concentrated micellar  solutions and new insights and model systems for understanding  phase transitions in two dimensions.",
