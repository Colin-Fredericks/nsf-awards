 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413915  MacAdam    A Q-switched YAG laser, a pulsed titanium-sapphire laser and a  pulsed dye laser will be supplied to the research program in the  properties and collisions of highly cited (Rydberg) atoms at the  University of Kentucky.  This project will study collisions of  singly charged positive and negative ions with Rydberg atoms at  kinetic energies for which the projectile and electron speeds are  comparable.  This is the condition under which cross sections are  largest, theories have yet to be perfected, and new phenomena of  the quantum-mechanical three-body collision problem await  discovery.  Charge transfer, inelastic and ionizing collisions  will be measured at energies 10-5000 eV.  The lasers are a  necessary foundation for preparing the state-selected targets in  this work.  Funding of the proposal would bring the pulsed laser  facilities in the Department of Physics and Astronomy up to a  high current standard and would allow the extension of research  into the unexplored collisional properties of coherent circular  and elliptical alkali Rydberg atoms.  With the same laser and  Rydberg crossed-beam apparatus, detailed studies will also be  undertaken of efficient state-to-state switching processes that  are mediated by the application of digitally generated and  profiled electric-field pulses.  ***",
