 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416469  Lacy  During the Northridge, CA earthquake, the upstream face of the  Lower San Fernando dam spread laterally upstream several feet.  Surface cracks and sand boils developed.  The documentation of  the behavior is during of this during the Northridge earthquake  provides an opportunity to validate an existing state-of-the-art  method to analyze the seismic stability of earth dams, including  the prediction of liquefaction and permanent displacements.    Data collected at the Lower San Fernando dam during the  Northridge earthquake will be used to assess the reliability of  the dam during and after an earthquake event.  This will be  achieved by generating a sequence of possible realizations of the  ground motions and soil properties and analyzing each  deterministically using a general two-phase nonlinear finite  element procedure.  The ground motion at the base of the dam is  simulated according to a spectral content derived from  measurements at nearby bedrock sites.  The material properties  pertinent to the occurrence of liquefaction and strength are  treated as spatially varying random fields with mean, variance  and, where possible, spatial correlation structure derived from  actual measurements at the site.  The saturated soil in these  problems is treated as a two phase continuum of soil skeleton and  pore fluid. the porewater and soil skeleton behavior are fully  coupled, thereby accounting for the interaction between the two  media as the soil deforms.  The nonlinear elasto-plastic behavior  of the soil skeleton is modeled by multi-yield surface  plasticity.  for each analysis, time histories of soil response  are produced, including accelerations, displacements and pore  water pressures.  The resulting sequence of soil responses is  processed statistically to yield estimates of reliability of the  earth dam system.  ***",
