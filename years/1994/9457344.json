 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Stanton is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and implement   many-body ab initio molecular orbital approaches to the study of   photochemical processes.  The approach is based on equation-of-motion and   Fock space generalizations of the coupled-cluster approximation for   electronic ground states.  Specific aims of the research include: 1) the   theoretical formulation and computational implementation of techniques   for calculating reduced density matrices, electronic properties and   analytic energy derivatives for final states parameterized by a class of   Fock space methods that allow a spin-adapted, size-extensive, many-body   treatment of open-shell states; 2) extensions of existing   equation-of-motion methodology that will permit application of these   methods to the calculation of nonadiabatic processes; and 3) the design   of algorithms that will make these theoretical methods applicable to   relatively large systems.    Photochemistry tends to drive many of the important chain reactions that   determine the complex chemistry of the stratosphere, as absorption of   solar photons typically leads to photodissociation.  Of current   importance is the photolysis and subsequent photofragment chemistry of   chlorine containing compounds, as these systems have unambiguously been   implicated in catalytic mechanisms leading to destruction of ozone in   polar stratospheric regions.  Stanton's studies of excited states of   these open-shell molecules will assist in their theoretical   characterization and detection by spectroscopic techniques.  His research   will also contribute to the calculation of potential energy surfaces for   excited states which can be used to simulate photodissociation events",
