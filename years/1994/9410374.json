 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Julie d'Itri  CTS-9410374    The objective of the project is to develop new environmental technology which will allow quantitative determination of mass transfer rates and chemical reaction kinetics of gas-aerosol atmospheric systems.  An apparatus and methodology for measuring mass and chemical reactions rates in dispersed media will be developed.  These rate data are essential to accurately estimating global atmospheric changes and the effect of pollutants on the environment. The system will be designed to allow determination of gas and aerosol compositions and precision control of the aerosol particle diameter and composition.  The developed technology will be tested initially by examining the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate, which is the major pathway in forming sulfuric acid rain.  Mass transfer and chemical reaction rates will be measured and by kinetic modeling, rate and constants and rate expression will be established.  The relative importance of O3-catalyzed versus non-catalyzed heterogeneous (on aerosol surfaces) oxidation of  sulfur dioxide will be delineated.      The research will lay a foundation for better understanding and quantificatio of  the atmospheric reactions of sulfur containing species.  A method to determine atmospheric reactions of whole families of chemicals, including nitrogen oxides and organics, in dispersed media will be established.  ***",
