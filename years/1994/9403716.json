 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mittelman       The main emphasis of the project is the development of  computational techniques, their implementation on advanced  computer architectures, and their verification and utilization on  nontrivial application problems of current interest.  The area of  research is capillary flows and surfaces.  The investigator  analyzes in detail static capillary surfaces in singular cases and  searches for new surfaces with certain properties such as  symmetry.  A sophisticated computer code for partial differential  equations, to which he has contributed (PLTMG), is generalized to  the Navier-Stokes equations.  Flows in which capillary effects are  prominent are analyzed, including mixed buoyant-thermocapillary  convection as it occurs in crystal growth and welding.       The force that shapes waterdrops, lets nutrients rise to  treetops, and is governing the flow of contaminated groundwater is  called capillarity.  While it is important in our terrestrial  environment, it becomes dominant in the microgravity regime of  space.  Many environmental but also manufacturing issues, such as  crystal growth and welding, will greatly benefit from a better  understanding of the effects of capillarity.  With state-  of-the-art computational techniques and resources the investigator  studies both the shape of liquid surfaces and the flow inside  liquids.  Challenging problems of current interest serve as  paradigms and applications for the work.",
