 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this work is in the area of algorithms for   reconstructing evolutionary history.  The evolutionary history for a set of    species S is described by a rooted tree called an evolutionary  tree (also called  phylogenetic tree or phylogeny) in which the  leaves represent the species in S  and the internal nodes  represent the common ancestors.  There is a wide range  of methods  for constructing phylogenetic trees given in the literature, and  most of these are based upon optimization criteria.  That is, an  optimization  criterion is given with which to evaluate a given  phylogeny, and the objective  is to find a phylogeny with an  optimal score with respect to that criterion.  Almost all of the  optimization problems have been shown to be NP-hard score  with  respect to that criterion.  Despite this, a plethora of  heuristics have  been developed for constructing phylogenetic  trees.  The standard modus  operandi is to analyze the data set  using many different methods for tree  construction, and compare  the outcomes of these methods in order to select a  phylogenetic  tree.   This research effort with respect to phylogeny construction  has three basic components:  (1) the development of a comprehensive mathematical  framework by  which current methodologies can be compared;     (2) the development of efficient algorithms for phylogeny construction   with meaningful output; and (3) application of these techniques to   problems in biology and linguistics.",
