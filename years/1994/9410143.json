The principal objective of  this effort is to present in a concise and effective manner the  vast research and development accomplished to date in these areas.       Rapid solidification processing, with accompanying large  undercooling and high cooling rates, originally used for the study  of metastable phase formation, has emerged as a viable commercial  method for the production of a wide range of extended solid  solution alloys, dispersion strengthened alloys, intermetallics,  and in-situ composites.  Light weight, high strength aluminum  alloys, high strength steels, oxidation-resistant nickel base  superalloys, and high temperature alloys have been successfully  produced by rapid solidification processing.  The products that  result from this grant will be usable as course material for senior  undergraduate and graduate level students of manufacturing science  in universities, for short courses, and for in-house training of  materials and manufacturing engineers in industry.",
