 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308078  Wendorf    With National Science Foundation support Drs. Fred Wendorf and  Angela Close will continue their study of the prehistory of the  Eastern Sahara Desert of Egypt. They will focus their work on the  Late Neolithic period, which dates from approximately 6,500 to  5,000 years ago and investigate two areas. The first is Nabta where  a large megalithic complex of standing stones has been located.  These are associated with a very large and deeply stratified site  which will be excavated. Through the recovery of faunal and floral  materials it will be possible to reconstruct subsistence patterns  and determine the extent of reliance on domestic vs. wild plants  and animals. The investigators will also conduct a survey of the  Nabta and adjacent basins and record all Late Neolithic  occurrences. A second area near Safsaf has yielded evidence of  herding camps which date to the same time range. By collecting and  refitting artifacts between sites, the investigators hope to trace  herders' movements and determine how they used this area.     Egypt is extremely important to our understanding of human  prehistory because it marked the cradle of one of the world's great  prehistoric civilizations. While much is known about the Pharonic  period, the roots of this civilization are not well understood. In  particular archaeologists wish to learn whether this culture  developed largely independently or whether, as many believe, it is  largely derivative from Southwest Asia. Drs. Wendorf and Close  believe that important cultural developments along the Nile were  strongly influenced by those in the desert to the West and this  research will provide relevant data. It will also increase our  understanding of how people at a relatively simple level of  technology adapted to the harsh fluxuating conditions in the  Sahara.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase our  understanding of how complex society develo ped and how humans adapt  to environmental stress.   ***",
