 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450702  Fine              A master plan will be developed for making sweeping changes in what  we teach in chemistry and how we teach it, in light of  revolutionary ways for improved learning that will be widely  available before the end of this decade.  At the heart of the   systemic changes proposed is a broadening of the curriculum across  traditional academic and professional boundaries to better reflect  the needs of a productive lifetime in society for students of  different backgrounds, abilities and interests.  At the same time,  by conceiving a new curriculum plan from the top down, it will be  possible to produce one that is inclusive, not exclusive, allowing  those who complete the major to share ideas and develop points of  view and attitudes that have a common origin with those students  who drop away earlier into alternate careers.  For those who do  drop away, the curriculum plan provides a realistic sense of what  is exciting and important in chemistry and how it fits into their  lives.  Proposed curriculum changes depend on delivery systems that  take advantage of the technological transformation that is  presently altering learning through electronic communication and  visualization of information.  This planning proposal will have a  significant impact in bringing about change in the entire chemistry  curriculum at Columbia and it will be transferable to chemistry  departments in other institutions.  Other institutions working on  this project are IIT, MIT, Stevens Institute, Northwestern,  Wisconsin, North Carolina.",
