 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314691  DRUFFEL    The major goal of this continuing research is to construct time   histories of high-precision 14C in past surface ocean water regimes  using annual coral bands from fossil and living corals. These data,  when coupled with stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements (18  O and 13C), reveal important information regarding the cycling of  14CO2 in the upper ocean and the exchange of 14CO2 between air and  sea.  Four experiments will be conducted 1) To determine whether  decade time-scale variations in 14C were present in ancient oceans  using fossil coral sequences that have been absolutely dated using  230 Th by thermal ionization mass spectrometry.  Two time periods  will be studied in corals from Vanuatu and from Biscayne National  Park, Florida.  This will allow for the comparison of 14C in two  major ocean currents (the South Equatorial Current and the Gulf  Stream, respectively), during extreme thermal conditions that  existed in the Holocene: the Little Ice Age and the Hypsithermal.   2) To determine the presence or absence of decade time-scale  variations in 14C in the North Pacific during the late Little Ice  Age (AD 1680-1730), and compare this record to that obtained from  the southwestern Pacific where large 14C variations correlated with  ancient El Nino events.  Corals from the North Atlantic will also  be studied, to examine the extent to which the 14C variability was  world-wide.  3) The Suess effect (lowering of 14C due mainly to  14C-free fossil fuel CO2 since late 1800s) will be measured at  three sites in the northern Pacific, where no measurable Suess  effect was found 4)Collection and high-precision 14C analyses are  proposed for a coral from Fernando de Noronha.  The equatorial  Atlantic is presently the only location in the temperate and  tropical oceans for which a post-bomb 14C record is not available.  Its importance for parameterizing tracer penetration into the  Atlantic cannot be overstated.  A limited number of high-precision  14C analyses will b e made using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)  techniques, with multiple graphite target analysis for each sample.  The remainder of the samples (75%) will be measured to high-  precision at the UCI Radiocarbon Laboratory using conventional,  gas-counting techniques.",
