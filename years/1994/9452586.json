A Silicon Graphics IRIS INDIGO workstation has been  acquired for use in Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry and student  research projects. In addition, the workstation is being used in  Natural Science 100, a new required core course for all entering  students not enrolled in a regular natural science course.  In the  physical chemistry curriculum, the workstation is networked to  Macintosh computers, so that an entire class can perform  quantum-mechanical calculations on the workstation while preparing  input and analyzing output on the Macintosh platforms. In the  biochemistry curriculum, the workstation is being used to study the  crystal structures available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank,  and for molecular dynamics simulations. Student research projects  in computational chemistry and X-ray crystallography are greatly  enhanced with the acquisition of the workstation. The graphics  capabilities of the workstation are being used in the Natural  Science course to illustrate molecular interactions in biochemical  systems, with particular emphasis on the interactions of enzymes  with substrates and DNA-binding proteins with DNA.  A primary goal  of this proposal is the development of two laboratory manuals. The  first will contain meaningful exercises in quantum chemistry, while  the second will be a graphics course centered on enhancing the  understanding of biochemistry.",
