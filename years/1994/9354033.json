This Collaborative is unique,  providing leadership through CSU, a research-oriented, land-  grant university which has the largest secondary science  teacher education program in the state; UNC, a university  that holds a state-recognized mission for teacher education  and one of the largest elementary and middle school teacher-  preparation programs nationally; and MSCD, a four-year  college in downtown Denver committed to training teachers for  urban schools and the largest middle and secondary math  education program in the state.  RMTEC partners will design a  national model to better prepare middle and secondary  preservice teachers in science and mathematics by  emphasizing: the ongoing collaboration between teacher  education institutions, community colleges, and K-12 school  partners for the reform of science and mathematics by  emphasizing: the ongoing collaboration between teacher  education institutions, community colleges, and K-12 school  partners for the reform of science and mathematics teacher  preparation: the redesign and delivery of targeted science  and mathematics courses for majors, with a central focus on  research-based teaching and learning strategies such as  inquiry, problem-solving, and constructivist approaches and  utilizing appropriate interactive technologies; the   enhancement of preservice teachers' Pedagogical Content  Knowledge (PCK) by integrating content, pedagogy, and  practice through the modeling of effective teaching,  developing a new CORE experience for student cohorts, and  integrally involving experienced mentor teachers; the  development of faculty, mentor teacher, and student skills in  addressing classroom diversity issues and the recruitment and  retention of women and other underrepresented groups in  mathematics and science teacher preparation programs.  The  RMTEC institutions have also committed funds to  accomplishment of project goals, and project staff are  working collaboratively with the participants in the Colorado  Statewide Strategic Initiative.  Dissemination of the  national models will occur through presentations at regional  and national conferences; publications in science,  mathematics, and education journals, and conference sponsored  by each of the partner institutions.  ***y",
