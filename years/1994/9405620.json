 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405620  Kunk       One of the most widely used techniques for measuring  radiometric ages of rocks and minerals is the so-called  40Ar/39Ar or argon-argon method, a variation of the  potassium-argon or K/Ar method. Both methods make use of the  known decay rate of  natural 40K to 40Ar and the retention  of  the daughter product argon inside the mineral grain. The  argon-argon method is further dependent on irradiation of  the unknown sample in a nuclear reactor in order to convert  some 39K to  39Ar by an n, p nuclear reaction. A calibration  standard of known age is irradiated at the same time as the  sample. The precision of all ages reported by this method  are determined by the precision with which the standard is  known. This award will provide partial funding to allow  personnel of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Geological Survey to bring  state-of-the-art methods to bear on producing the most  reliable mineral standard possible for interlaboratory  calibrations of argon-argon dating. The standard will be  made available to the geochronology research community  through distribution by the Standard Reference Materials  Program of NIST.  ***  9406684  Johnson       This award provides partial funding for the support of  a technician assigned to the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory  in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the  University of Wisconsin, Madison. The technician will assist  in the operation and maintenance of the laboratory's  equipment that includes a multicollector thermal ionization  mass spectrometer and associated instrumentation for sample  preparation and data analysis. The laboratory is a resource  for mass spectrometric analysis needed in research and  teaching projects in the earth sciences by a large number of  researchers on-campus and off-campus. Research applications  include work on Arctic Ocean sediments, mantle geochemistry,  volcanism, geochronology of carbonates in the Michigan Basin  and Wisconsin Arch provinces,  and Archean and Proterozoic  granites. The technician will also participate in the  technical developmental work of the laboratory, including  the development of new methods for the quantitative  measurement of the isotopes of hafnium.  ***",
