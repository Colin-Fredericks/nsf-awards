 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318447  Rivin    Dr. Rivin has isolated a maize mutant, termed, dks8  (defective kernel shootless-Mu8), that disrupts the early  establishment of a functional shoot meristem, but does not  perturb the normal morphogenesis and differentiation of the  cotyledon and primary root. These features are unique among  the embryo mutants of maize, and they indicate that the gene  identified by the dks8 mutation is required for a  fundamental step in the formation of the embryonic shoot. By  examining the role of this gene during embryonic  development, determining if it plays part in post-embryonic  development, and identifying its sequence and product, one  of the cellular processes critical to plant development may  be defined. The research program has the following  objectives: 1) Identify other alleles of dks8 from existing  mutant collections and by targeted mutagenesis using EMS-  mutagenized and Mutator transposon stocks. 2) Clone and map  the Dks8 gene using the Mutator transposon tag. The dks8  mutation appears to have been caused by the insertion of a  Mu8 element of the Robertson's Mutator transposable system.  The sequences flanking this element will be cloned and used  to map the dks8 locus. They will be analyzed to discover the  product of this developmentally important gene. 3) Determine  how and when the dks8 mutation prevents embryonic shoot  development. Histological and molecular criteria will be  used to test whether the shoot apical meristem cell  population is initiated and maintained in the first stages  of embryogenesis in dks8 mutants. Somatic embryogenesis and  manipulation of endosperm genotype will be used to examine  whether dks8 gene action is intrinsic to the developing  embryo or whether it acts as part of the larger ovule or  seed environment. 4) Determine it the Dks8 gene product is  required outside of  embryogenesis for the specification or  function of the shoot apical meristem. Clonal analysis of  cell lineage will be used to determine the effect of the  dks8 genotyp e on the developmental fate of cells in an  established shoot apical meristem.    ***",
