 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307179  Sen  This project proposes new efforts in the feedback control of plasma instabilities which could have relevance for a variety of plasm sources and devices used in the manufacturing industry.  All plasmas are subject to instabilities and consequent fluctuations, which cause nonunforimities in the plasma, increased transport, and possibly microscopic breakup.  The elimination of instabilities is sometimes imperative, but their suppression is always desirable for better performance.  The proposed modulated ion beam suppressors are unique truly non-perturbing remote type controllers applicable to most plasma devices.  State feedback and optimal control schemes proposed are generic control systems suitable for complex systems with many modes of instabilities.  Furthermore, adaptive and neural net controllers are proposed for the challenging problem of controlling controlling plasmas with partly unknown dynamics.  Lastly, the proposed study of anomalous transport (including its scaling behavior) addresses a fundamental open question in plasma science and engineering.  All the proposed studies focus on common problems and propose generic solutions relevant to all plasma devices, irrespective of their appplications.    ***",
