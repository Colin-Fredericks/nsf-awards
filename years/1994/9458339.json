 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458339  Baldwin  This award provides support to Dr. Dare Baldwin under the  National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.   The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young  faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic  career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for  research and educational activities, and to foster contact and  cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that  support research and education.  Dr. Baldwin has already made  significant research contributions to the field of cognitive  psychology, and she has the potential to become a leader in  academic research and education.    This award will allow the investigator to build on her existing  research on the interpretive and information-gathering abilities  children possess that support the rapid expansion of world  knowledge.  During the next few years she will study the language  learning and information-gathering abilities of infants and young  children.  Through analysis of what enables children to resolve  the inductive difficulties intrinsic to word learning and  language comprehension, she will try to ascertain if the  mechanisms of interpersonal inference that we have found to  figure so importantly in language acquisition likewise expedite  knowledge acquisition in other domains.  Through analysis of  children's abilities to seek new information through direct  investigation, she hopes to determine if it may be possible to  point to the involvement of a relatively open and versatile  inductive capacity which promotes knowledge acquisition from a  very early age.  From analysis of children's abilities to elicit  new information through indirect, social channels, her goal is to  discover whether the human ability to appreciate others as  repositories of information plays a critical role in the  efficient transmission of knowledge between individuals.    The findings from this research program have the potential to  provide major new insight s into complex interrelations between  neurological change, social cognition, and knowledge acquisition  in human development.",
