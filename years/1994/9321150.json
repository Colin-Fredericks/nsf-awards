 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321150  Skitka  Should the government insure people who choose to live in high-risk areas such as in flood plains or near fault lines?  When is government assistance perceived to be humanitarian versus foolhardy by the public who ultimately pays for it?  Using the framework provided by the Contingency Model of Distributed Justice (Skitka & Tetlock, 1992). the author will explore willingness to provide help to victims of the Midwest floods of 1993 as a function of whether the affected communities or individuals took measures to protect themselves (e.g., used community tax dollars to build levees, or as individuals purchased flood insurance).  A random-digit-dialed telephone survey of 1,000 adult members of households in the continental United States is proposed.  It is predicted that people will be willing to provide immediate humanitarian assistance, but willingness to help rebuild will vary as a function of perceived health of the U.S. economy, attributions of responsibility, and political orientation of the respondent.  ***",
