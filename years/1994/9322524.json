 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322524  Krawinkler  This research project will develop basic data needed to  formalize and implement a demand/capacity based seismic  design methodology that explicitly considers the inelastic  response characteristics of structures.  The objective is to  make the design process transparent and equally applicable  to the seismic evaluation of existing structures and seismic  designs of new structures, using conventional structural  systems as well as new structural systems, materials, and  innovative energy dissipation or base isolation systems. The  design objective is to provide a structure with sufficient  strength, stiffness, and ductility such that the deformation  demands imposed by design earthquakes do not exceed the  deformation capabilities associated with design limit states  (e.g. serviceability, collapse safety).    It is intended to achieve a consistent level of seismic  protection for structures of different configurations and  structural systems, which may be located in regions of  different seismicity.  The proposed research is directed  towards achieving this goal by focusing on the following  objectives: (1) evaluate, refine, modify, and develop (if  needed) the basic concepts on which a consistent and  transparent seismic design methodology can be based; (2)  develop a comprehensive set of information on seismic demand  parameters for inelastic SDOF systems, which will form the  basis for the design of MDOF structures; (3) develop the  knowledge needed to modify the SDOF demand parameters in a  manner that accounts for multi-mode effects present in real  MDOF structures; (4) investigate the effects of ground  motion characteristics for expected cumulative damage  effects; and (5) formalize and test the proposed seismic  design methodology in order to make it useful for the  engineering profession.  The information on demands and  capacities created in the project will have an impact on the  state of knowledge and will facilitate and accelerate the  adoption of more realistic  and transparent design  procedures.  ***",
