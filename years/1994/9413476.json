 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413476 Galipeau  The proposed major research instrumentation is for the fabrications and characterization of thin film materials and devices requiring advanced materials and processing techniques.  The proposed instrumentation includes:  (1) scanning probe microscope, (2) manual RF sputtering-etching system, (3) wafer spinner, (4) contact angle goniometer, (5) ultrasonic wirebonder, and (6) humidity/temperature chamber.  This instrumentation is being requested to enhance and expand the capabilities of the Microelectronics and Materials Laboratory (MML) at South Dakota State University.  The MML consists of over 1500ft2 of  class 10,000 and 100 cleanroom space designed to conduct research on the fabrication, processing, and characterization of electronic materials and devices.  The lab is adminstered by the Electrical Engineering Deopartment and the College of Engineering.  The Electrical Engineering Department is strongly committed to both undergraduate and graduate research training.  Since the existing MML facility is the principle research laboratory  of the department, it is the objective of this project to maintain state of the art research instrumentation in this lab.  This will improve the research training at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, build a foundation for a Ph.D. program, and improve the research quality of the faculty.  The research and research training being conducted in the MML laboratory is focused on electronic materials used for electronic devices and packaging, sensors. and memory devices.  Current emphasis is on polyimides and piezo/pyro/ferroelectric polymer/copolymer materials. Polyimides are used in microelectronic applications as dielectrics in multichip modules (MCM)s and integrated circuits (IC)s, and as protective layers or coatings.  Of particular interest is using a novel microsensor to study the effects of surface treatments such as ions sputtering on water permeation in the polymer.  This water permeation can affect the adhesion and corrosion of m etal conductive layers which in turn can effect device reliability.  The requested surface probe microscope would allow for studies of the surface structure treatments.  The sputtering system would provide ion sputtering capabilities necessary for surface modification, while the contact angle instrument would provide information on surface energy, also important for understanding wetting and adhesion.  This project will also upgrade and expand the fabrication equipment and test apparatus necessary for this research.  Piezo/pyro/ferroelectric polymer/copolymer materials are used for ultrasonic and pyroelectric imaging and ferroelectric non-volatile memory devices.  Of current interest are the high-frequency dielectric and electromechanical properties of new advanced ferroelectric copolymer sensor materials.  If this project is funded by NSF, the research work would be extended to the fabrication and characterization of advanced ferroelectric copolymer materials and sensor processing techniques.  This work is important for ferroelectric switching and non-volatile computer memory applications.  The sputtering system would permit the deposition of well-adhered metallic test electrodes on thin film samples and the fabrication of this film integrated piezo/pyro/ferroelectric sensors.  The surface topology and adhesion of these thin films is best studied with the scanning probe microscope and contact angle instrument.",
