 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313436  Guiltinan       This award allows Pennsylvania State University to renovate their  complex of six  greenhouses, a total of about 28,500 square feet of research and  research training space.   These greenhouses were built in 1949 and have not  undergone any renovation since that  time.  The types of research carried out in  this space include control of plant gene  expression, control of plant cell  expansion, biosynthesis of starch, plant growth  regulation, effects of air  pollutants on plants, and the molecular basis of cell recognition  in plants.  These  greenhouses are also used for various graduate and undergraduate  courses in  plant science and specifically an interdisciplinary training program in  advanced  root biology.  These facilities are used by 20 faculty, 8 postdoctoral fellows,  60  graduate students and about 145 undergraduate students. Thus, the renovations  will  impact a large number of mature researchers and existing research projects  but a larger  number of students being trained in biotechnology issues concerning  plant science.  This  modernization project is important because of it's potential  regional and national impact  on the growing biotechnology infrastructure.  ***",
