 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406069  Varanasi       Several civilian nondirectional communication applications   such as mobile radio telephony and personal communication services  require bandwidth-efficient multiple-access radio communication as  well as a tremendous flexibility in system design. The dynamic  channel sharing strategy of Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) is  particularly well-suited and its feasibility for such applications  and is currently being actively investigated. This project will  advance the theory of optimum receivers under complexity  constraints for CDMA communication in fading multipath radio  channels through research on several aspects of this broad subject.  The asymptotic performance measures of near-far resistance and  fading resistance will be defined in order to succinctly  characterize the effects of estimable and inestimable interference  in multiuser fading channels. The design and analysis of optimum  linear detection rules for slowly fading and time-varying but  memoryless multipath fading CDMA channels is proposed. Linear  adaptive receivers that are near-far and fading resistant will be  developed for dynamically time-varying multipath fading channels  with memory. The concept of group detection will be studied in the  context of Gaussian as well as time-varying multipath fading CDMA  channels in order to address the need for strategies with  complexities ranging between those of linear and optimal detectors  that bridge the wide gap in performance between them in  applications requiring bandwidth efficient communication. Receiver  optimality is also addressed through the design of signature  waveforms that optimize the performance of fading channel detectors  under bandwidth constraints. The results of this research effort  will yield optimum centralized CDMA receivers under various  complexity constraints that are well-suited for implementation at  base stations and that will serve as ideals in both function and  performance to be emulated by decentralized signal reception   schemes constrained by even lower complexities.  ***",
