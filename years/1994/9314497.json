The project leaders are  Frederick C. Gouldin, Cornell, and Iskender Gokalp, CNRS/Orleans.   The objective of their research is to improve combustion models  for premixed turbulent combustion systems.  The collaboration  brings together experimentalists at Cornell and Orleans with  theoreticians at Poitiers and Cambridge University.  The project  takes advantage of new methods for making critical measurements  of important properties of premixed turbulent flames developed by  the U.S. and French researchers.  This data will be used for  model validation and refinement in cooperation with the modelers  at Poitiers and Cambridge.    Premixed turbulent combustion is of considerable practical  importance, and premixed combustion systems account for a  significant fraction of fossil fuel consumption worldwide.  This  project will lead to new models for premixed turbulent combustion  which in turn can assist in the design of efficient, low-emission  combustors.  ***",
