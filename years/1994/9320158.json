 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320158  Weyhenmeyer    Angiotensin is a small protein hormone that is important in  regulating cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, and nervous system  activities.  Although angiotensin is principally known for its role  in the regulation of blood pressure and thirst, there is now  evidence indicating that this protein is involved in variety of  central nervous system processes, including cell to cell  transmission, learning and memory, and cell growth and development.   The recent identification of multiple types of angiotensin binding  proteins or receptors have led to the suggestion that functional  specificity may reside at the level of individual receptor  subtypes.  Dr. Weyhenmeyer will identify the cellular and molecular  features of individual angiotensin receptor subtypes to determine  which of these receptors are specifically involved in the growth  and development of nerve cells.  to accomplish this, he will grow  cells in culture that express different angiotensin receptor  subtypes and expose them to a battery of growth factors.  Each of  growth factors is likely to cause a neuronal response.  Dr.  Weyhenmeyer will determine how the different growth factors  interact with the different receptor subtypes to induce distinct  neuronal responses such as proliferation, survival, differentiation  and neurite extension.  Understanding how individual angiotensin  receptor subtypes mediate their activity at the level of the cell  should not only provide important insights into their role in  controlling important physiological behaviors such as blood  pressure and thirst but may also open new perspectives in the  complex field of brain development, and perhaps, cell regeneration.  ***",
