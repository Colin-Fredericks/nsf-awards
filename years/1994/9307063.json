The only index of this type, it is a major abstracting service to the botanical community as a primary source of chromosome information, a subject of unique importance in botany.  It also functions as a serviceable, general reference work, though by its nature incomplete, for current plant systematic research.  The botanical literature is reviewed by the approximately 25 worldwide contributing members of the project.  Data are forwarded to the editor, Peter Goldblatt, who coordinates the reviewing activities of the contributors and is responsible for compilation of published annual or multi-year indexes prepared from computer tape by a commercial printer.  Data are sorted by computer using programs developed specifically for the project at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  Data from published chromosome indexes are placed on-line immediately after publication and are available free of charge through the Missouri Botanical Garden's TROPICOS data base system and through internet.   This award provides funds for the continuation of this important bibliographic resource project in botany for another 5-year period.  %%%   Approximately 25 botanists review the world-wide published literature and forward any new information on plant chromosome numbers to Dr. Peter Goldblatt at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  There the information is added to a computer data base from which regular annual or multi-year volumes known as the Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers  are published.  This index is an important resource or research tool for plant systematists and other botanists, agronomists, horticulturists, etc. throughout the world.  Thus, this ongoing project provides a unique and valuable service to the scientific community.  ***           Y                                                                                                 wwwwwww jy  wwwwwww   F9307063  Goldblatt   The Index of Plant Chromosome Numbers is a compilation of original chromosome counts for plants published i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             !         !         !         !
