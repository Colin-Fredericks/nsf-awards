 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321187  Altmann    The detrimental demographic consequences of inbreeding have been well documented for many kinds of animals, including a number of mammalian species.  Although these deficits have been associated particularly with early stages of life, such as mortality during the neonatal period and reduced litter size at birth, proximal mechanisms producing these outcomes remain largely unexplored.  Furthermore, most previous studies have associated the detrimental effects of inbreeding with some deficit in the offspring, and have not considered the possibility that inadequate parental care may be the cause.    The doctoral-dissertation research of Ms. Susan W. Margulis will investigate behavioral aspects of reproductive success, and those factors that may manifest themselves later in an individual's life, such as behavioral adequacy of parenting by inbred parents, and will distinguish between parental and offspring effects.  The effects of inbreeding on mating behavior, parental behavior, and reproductive success will be studied in two captive populations of deermouse, one derived from an isolated, island population, and one from a widespread, mainland population.  Differential reproductive success and adequacy of parental behavior will be evaluated in pairs in which both parents are inbred, neither is inbred, only the mother is inbred, and only the father is inbred.    The information gained from this study may be incorporated into management plans for captive populations and endangered species.",
