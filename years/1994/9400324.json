 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research of Prof. Eric Stade into the  Ramanujan Conjecture.  This is a well known conjecture in the  theory of automorphic forms that connects two apparently  unconnected spectrum.  Today,  the result is firmly established  in a few special cases.  This research falls under the general heading of Number Theory.  Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers  and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning  problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to  creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the  discipline. One of the philosophies of modern number theory is  that many facts about numbers can be studied using calculus.   This approach is very evident in the theory of automorphic forms.   This kind of number theory is very technical and deep, but it has  had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory.",
