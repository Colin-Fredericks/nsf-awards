 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322143  Sheffield  This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Temple  University to continue a successful REU site for a combined  academic year and Summer program of undergraduate research.  This  program will draw on experience as an REU site awardee for  previous years, and also incorporates elements of other Temple  programs.  It is the goal of this program to provide a rich  research environment and a sense of community among promising  students in order to encourage them to enter careers in the  biological sciences.  The program is designed to help students  develop self confidence that will allow them to progress from  dependence to independence in research.  The Biology Department  at Temple University is in a unique position with respect to  biological research and education of underrepresented groups.  As  a department in a major research university, they have an active  faculty and substantial grant support.  At the same time, Temple,  as an urban university, attracts a diverse student population.   Many of the students are the first in their families to attend  college.  Temple was found that a large number of these students  have not considered a career in research despite their abilities.   and can benefit significantly from a program such as this.  ***",
