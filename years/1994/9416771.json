 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416771  Anderson  The research under this project will focus on experimental  and analytical evaluation of two design modifications which  have been suggested for welded beam to column connections.  These modifications are intended for both the repair of  connections which were damaged during the Northridge  earthquake and for the strengthening of welded connections  in new construction.    Large scale beam-column components which are representative  of damages during the earthquake will be considered.  Cyclic  testing of eight specimens having beam to column connections  which are reinforced using variations of two different  schemes will be carried out.  The initial scheme will  consider the addition of reinforcing plates to the bottom  and/or top flange.  The second will add a knee bracket plate  (structural tee) to the bottom flange of the beam along with  associated stiffener plates in the column.    Parallel finite-element analytical studies of the  distribution of stresses and strains in the joint region  will be conducted.  The nonlinear behavior of the connection  model will be evaluated under equivalent static monotonic  loading.  These results will be calibrated against the  experimental results.    These studies will suggest repair procedures or design  modifications for new construction to supply the moment and  rotation capacity demanded by the earthquake ground motion.  Recommendations for modifying the connection details so as  to strengthen the connection region and avoid these types of  failures will be presented.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
