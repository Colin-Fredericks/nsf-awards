The overall  objective appears to be retention of girls who have expressed and  interest in and demonstrated some ability in SEM careers by  providing on-going contact, increased exposure to hands-on activity  and professional role models.  In addition, the project proposes to  expand the pool of individuals who can encourage the interests  these girls express in SEM careers on an on-going basis by  conducting workshops for significant adults in the lives of these  girls (parents, organization leaders, teachers) to SEM careers and  engaging them in hands-on science and math projects and  demonstrations which show these subjects as fun and easily  replicable in other situations.    The overall project approach and the evaluation plan have merit and  will make specific attempts to encourage the participation of  Native American female participants.  As participation of members  of this target group have been minimal in previous projects, it is  recommended the PI's contact the American Indian Science &  engineering Society Headquarters (located in Boulder, CO) and get  recommendations on the best approach for including Native American  girls in this project and a letter of endorsement which can be  taken to the reservation during the recruitment effort  ***",
