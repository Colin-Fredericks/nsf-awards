 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400362  Eisenberger  The   Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering  Center  (MRSEC)   at   Princeton  University   supports  interactive  research in three major groups addressing the synthesis  and  understanding   of   mesoscopically    structured    complex  materials  with  the  ultimate goal of  rational  design  of  materials for industrial applications.    The  group which is focused on electronic transport in  non-  Fermi  liquid  materials combines expertise  in  theoretical  physics  and synthesis of electronic materials  with  a  new  high  magnetic  field facility to explore the properties  of  novel   materials  with  restricted  geometries   and   low-  dimensionality. The study of these materials is  unified  by  common theoretical concepts and the prediction of properties  not observed in standard materials.  The group investigating  organic thin films and quantum structures is exploring a new  class  of engineering structures and materials based on  the  controlled  growth, at the monolayer level, of a wide  range  of  semiconducting organic thin films.  Investigators in the  group  concerned  with microstructured  macromolecular  soft  materials  deal  with materials formed from complex  fluids.  Soft  materialq with complex microstructures are  formed  by  the  spontaneous evolution of structure in the liquid state;  they  are  self-assembling.   This  group  seeks  a  unified  understanding of the materials science of such materials.    The  MRSEC  also  supports  the development,  operation  and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for  materials  research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research.  The   center  participates  in  an  undergraduate  materials  science  certification  program and  in  a  summer  research  program for undergraduates.  The MRSEC is associated with an  educational outreach program with emphasis on attracting and  retaining women and underrepresented minorities in materials  science  and co-sponsors a materials science  and engineering  training  program for K-12 teachers.  The MRSEC  administers  an  industrial  outreach and visitors  program.   The  MRSEC  currently  supports  20  faculty,  6  postdoctoral  research  associates, 1 technical staff member, 22 graduate  students,  and  a  significant number of undergraduates  through  their  summer research program.  The Princeton MRSEC is directed by  Professor Peter M. Eisenberger.  ***",
