 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately half the proteins that are present in living  systems are associated with biological membranes, and these  proteins preform some of the most interesting and important  functions in the cell.  The proposed work is directed at  studying membrane proteins called ion-channels which  facilitate signaling in nerve cells.  In order to understand  how the nervous system operates, information on the  molecular structures of ion-channels will be required, and  it will be necessary to characterize the specific changes in  these structures that control nerve cell activity.  At the  present time there is not a single ion channel from the  nervous system that is characterized at the molecular level.  In general , there is a lack of molecular information on  membrane proteins because efficient experimental techniques  to study these types of proteins have not been developed.    This proposal will develop new methodologies to examine  membrane protein structure.  One approach will use a  technique called mass-spectrometry, and it will be combined  with traditional chemical labeling techniques to determine  how proteins are structured in biological membranes.  Dramatic improvements in mass spectrometry in the past few  years have made it a very powerful and ideal technique to  investigate proteins.  A second approach will place  molecular probes called spin-labels at specific sites in  membrane proteins to provide information on structure and  changes in structure.  These techniques will be applied to  an ion-channel called the acetylcholine receptor.  The  acetylcholine receptor is a membrane ion channel that  functions at the neuromuscular junction, and it is typical  in size and complexity to many other ion channels in the  nervous system.",
