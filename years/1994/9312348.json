Recently there have been significant advances in understanding  the interplay between some interacting particle systems (Markovian spatial  stochastic models) and the class of differential equations traditionally used  to model ecological systems.  The stochastic models extend the traditional  deterministic biological models and open new issues for probabilists and  biologists alike.  Indeed a fresh perspective and foothold has been gained in  this well established area of mathematical modelling which promises to quite  fruitful.  On the one hand the broader view may be used to justify various  simulations done by biologist as well as give new ideas for simulations, while  on the other hand it raises several interesting probability questions about  new stochastic models.  Recent collaboration between researchers in  interacting particle systems and mathematical biology has shown that analyses  of stochastic biological models which have been done in the past can sometimes  be clarified using the modern probablilisitic viewpoint.  Seen from this new  light, the original stochastic models introduced by mathematical biologist and  ecologists acquire a unified meaning besides presenting a number of important  new biological insights.  This conference represents a unique opportunity to  advance mathematical biology, probability, ecology, and epidemiology in a  unified forum.  ***",
