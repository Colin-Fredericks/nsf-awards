 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313847  Stolfo  We study solutions to the performance bottleneck in expert  databases using the PARADISER  10  distributed rule processing  environment as our testbed.  We purpose an approach that combines  statically computed restrictions on the rules of a rule program for  partitioning the workload of rule evaluation among an arbitrary  number of rule program replicas evaluated at distinct processing  sites, and dynamic load balancing protocols that update and  reorganize the distribution of workload by modifying the  restrictions at runtime.  (Rules are not redistributed.)  Our  techniques utilize one form of \"meta-data\", namely, statistics  gathered on the attribute values and size of relations of the  underlying database (e.g., number of distinct values of an  attribute, number of tuples in a relation etc.) in the algorithms  that compute the restrictions on the rules.  We analyze the dynamic  load balancing protocols in terms of efficiency and scalability  criteria, which provide guidance on the expected behavior of the  protocols with increasing database size.    The proposed research falls into three main categories:  (a)  workload distribution paradigms among processing sites to  ameliorate the performance degradation resulting from scaling up of  database size, (b) a suite of load balancing protocols for dynamic  \"logical\" reorganization of the underlying database, and their  scaling characteristics, and , (c) experimental validation in the  PARADISER expert database environment, using a suite of benchmark  rule programs.  A fully operational and transferable rule  processing environment will be constructed that embodies these  results.",
