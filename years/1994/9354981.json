 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased utilization of natural gas in place of petroleum-  based products would benefit the environment as well as the  National economy.  However, technological hurdles currently prevent  much greater use of natural gas in several key applications.  The  School of Chemical Engineering and Materials Sciences (CEMS) at the  University of Oklahoma is the lead department in a  multidisciplinary, multi-institutional center being formed to  develop environmentally friendly natural gas technologies.   Research goals include technologies for methane conversion to  higher value chemicals, high density natural gas storage at  moderate temperature and pressure, technologies for natural gas  vehicles' emissions control, and improved natural gas fuel cells.         The five Graduate Research Traineeships will help build the  foundation of the new center and contribute to its mission.  The  traineeships will be awarded in Fall, 1994 to five graduate  students entering CEMS.  Trainees will be involved in collaborative  research with colleagues in industry, in other disciplines, and at  other universities.  Trainees also will have the opportunity to  serve as mentors for undergraduate researchers, a program designed  to enhance the research experience of the trainee and influence the  undergraduate to consider graduate chemical engineering study.",
