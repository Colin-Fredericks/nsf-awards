 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400833   Larsen        This award funds the investigations of Prof. Michael Larsen  into monodromy representations of fundamental groups especially  as they arise in number theory.  Prof. Larsen will attempt to  compute monodromy groups in particular cases and study variations  caused by changes in the base data.  He would like to be able to  construct examples where the monodromy group is prescribed  beforehand,  an inverse problem based on the invariants of the  induced representation.         This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic   geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,   algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the   plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number   theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as   divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,  seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from   the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual   influence has increased greatly. The result has been an increased  understanding of both areas of mathematics.",
