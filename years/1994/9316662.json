 "awd_abstract_narration": "McClung  9316662  Rhythmic biological phenomena which recur at approximately 24 hour  intervals in the absence of environmental time cues are termed  circadian rhythms, and their timing is regulated by an endogenous  biological clock. The molecular basis of circadian rhythmicity is  not understood in any biological system. Our study of such rhythms  in Arabidopsis thalania will be continued by, 1) Investigating the  ontogeny of the circadian clock and of the role of light in the  induction and phasing of circadian rhythmicity in seedlings. 2)  Identification and analysis of mutants with altered clock  properties (specifically, altered period length) using a screen  based on the circadian resistance to sulfur dioxide exposure  conferred by the circadian rhythm in stomatal aperture and 3) The  analysis of the circadian regulation of RCA transcription, a gene  involved in carbon assimilation.  %%%  The experiments to be done are designed to elucidate the molecular  basis by which time information is generated by the biological  clock and used to regulate plant gene expression. The circadian  clock regulates the expression of a number of Arabidopsis genes,  including genes involved in light harvesting, in carbon  assimilation, in photorespiration and in nitrogen assimilation. The  interaction between the circadian clock and light indicate that any  complete understanding of plant response to environmental stimuli,  such as light level and light-dark regimen, must include an  understanding for the endogenous capacity of plants to measure  time.  ***",
