 "awd_abstract_narration": "Posner    With National Science Foundation support, the University of  Oregon will purchase a Dual Purkinje Eye Tracking system and  related accessories. Developed by Stanford Research Institute and  Forward Technologies, the eyetracker determines the direction of  eye gaze over a large two-dimensional visual field. It operates  with infrared light and does not interfere with normal vision.  The system is accurate to 1 minute of arc and outputs a signal  every millisecond. This temporal as well as spatial accuracy are  essential in tracking smooth pursuit eye movements.    Dr. Michael Posner and his colleagues will use the instrument to  pursue three lines of research. The first involves a study of  communication between identified neural areas in reading.  Previous studies have shown that specific neural areas are  involved in processing visual, phonological and semantic codes of  visually presented words. Under the planned research, studies  will be extended to actual reading situations. Eye movement will  be monitored and brain electrical activity recorded. A second set  of experiments involves the role of attention in language  production. The eye tracking system will be used to measure  allocation of attention in real time while subjects produce  descriptions of animated events they witness. A final area of  research involves perceptual-motor transformations in the visual  motion domain. In instances where apparent motion of a stimulus  differs substantially in velocity from its real motion, the  investigators wish to discover which course the eye actually  tracks.",
