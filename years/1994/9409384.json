 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409384  Price    With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Price and  his colleagues will examine the usefulness of barium as a  paleodietary indicator. Considerable research done focussing on  strontium has shown that it is discriminated against relative to  calcium in biological systems. Therefore relatively less  strontium is present in herbivores which eat plants than in the  plants themselves. Likewise bones of carnivores contain less  strontium than do bones of their herbivore prey. Preliminary  analyses conducted by Dr. Price and colleagues indicate that the  same holds true for barium and that in this latter case the  differences between trophic level are even more pronounced.  Relatively little is known however about how barium moves through  ecological systems and preliminary data again indicate that the  patterning is complex. Marine, arid and non-arid terrestrial  systems all seem to act differently. To gain insight into this  issue, Dr. Price and colleagues will study how barium moves  through several ecosystems. He will examine the food webs in  selected regions of the Alaskan coastline, Alaskan interior, US  Great Basin desert and the Guatemalan tropics. He will also  analyze human prehistoric skeletal materials from many regions of  the world.    Because food is essential to human existence and subsistence and  social systems of necessity are built around this need,  archaeologists pay a great deal of attention to the  reconstruction of prehistoric diet. This has proven extremely  difficult because various classes of food are differentially  preserved in archaeological sites. Plants for example which  formed an essential part of prehistoric diet are rarely  preserved. Chemical analysis of bone has proven extremely useful  since different diets may leave telltale chemical fingerprints in  skeletal remains. The proposed work by Dr. Price and colleagues  will help to develop a new technique which may yield insight not  only into diet but paleoclimate as well.    This wo rk is important because the technique, when developed will  provide a useful way to address a number of archaeological  questions in many parts of the world.",
