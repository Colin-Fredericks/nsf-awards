Purdue University  and the University of Florida is adding the University of Oregon  (including Oregon State University, the Oregon Graduate Institute  of Science & Technology and Portland State University) as research  sites in the I/UCRC for Software Engineering (SERC).  Seven  companies will join SERC inconjunction with the University of  Oregon becoming an additional research site in the Center.    The Center's research agenda will be increased by research projects  on \"Time Insensitive Binary to Binary Translation; \"Entropy-Based  Measure of Software Complexity and Its Application to Software  Testing\", \"Visual Programming Languages\", \"Human Computer  Interaction\", and \"Software Engineering Tools for the Construction  of Network Applications.\"    The researchers of involved with the Center are qualified to  perform the research projects.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Bruce Barnes, Program  Director of the Computer Computation Research Program at NSF.      The Program Manager recommends the University of Florida be awarded  $25,000 for the first year of a five year continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommends support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
