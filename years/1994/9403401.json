The first type of problem involves studying  periodic Schroedinger operators that are perturbed by potentials  that are localized in space. These perturbations give rise to  discrete eigenvalues in the gaps of the pure crystal's electron  energy spectrum. The PI plans to develop numerical algorithms for  the calculation of these impurity levels and to study their  properties. He plans to extend known results about such systems  from one dimension to n dimensions. Among the properties to be  studied are eigenvalue trapping, cascading, and threshold  behavior. The second type of problem involves study of the  time-dependent Schroedinger equation for molecular systems. Some  of the problems to be studied are: 1) Development of a model to  describe non-adiabatic effects caused by avoided crossings of  electron energy levels. 2) Interactions of molecules with  electromagnetic radiation. 3) Computation of high order  Born-Oppenheimer correction terms. 4) Study of the validity and  high energy behavior of the impact parameter model in molecular  scattering.  The PI  plans to study several mathematical problems  in quantum mechanics. Part of this project involves the study of  a model that describes the energy levels of electrons in crystals  that have impurities. These levels determine the colors of some  crystals, such as rubies and sapphires. The rest of the project  involves the study of chemical reaction dynamics at the molecular  level.",
