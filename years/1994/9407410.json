These  awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific  effort of the nation.  As researchers in the mathematical sciences expand  their interactions with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases  between the various areas of mathematics itself, opportunities for  postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly important.  The  fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research environments  that will have maximal impact on their future scientific development.  The  fellowship is designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18  academic-year months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The recipient may  choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which allows for full-time support  for any 18 academic-year months in a three-year period, in interval not  shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research Instructorship option  which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be taken as 9 months of  full-time support and 18 months of half-time support.  Not more than two  months of summer support from this Fellowship may be received in any calendar  year.         David Karger will receive his doctoral degree from Stanford University,  and will pursue research under the guidance of Robert Tarjan at Princeton  University.  The research will be conducted in the area of analysis of  algorithms and combinatorial optimization.",
