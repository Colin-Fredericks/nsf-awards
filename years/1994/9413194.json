 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wenck  9413194    This award supports Allen R. Wenck, a doctoral student of  Professor Laszlo Marton at the University of South Carolina  (USC), for a three-month visit to the Max Planck Institute for  Developmental Biology in Cologne, Germany.  There he will carry  out research on gene transfer in Arabidopsis thaliana with   Dr. Csaba Koncz in the Laboratory for the Genetic Basis of Plant  Development.  The objective of his dissertation-related research  is to examine the influence of homologous gene sequences on gene  transfer mediated by Agrobacterium.  He will experiment with  various lengths of homology bounded by specific types of internal  genetic markers referred to as an \"in-frame reporter system\",  which will enable him to monitor the site of the gene transfer.   After constructing plasmid vectors and transgenic plants in South  Carolina, he will spend several months working with Dr. Koncz on  the analysis of the genetic integration process.   Professor  Marton and his research group at USC has been working on  homologous recombinantion for several years using Agrobacterium  mediated gene transfer.  They pioneered the transformation of  Arabidopsis root cultures and the maintenance of transgenic  plants in permanent root culture.  The group at the Max Planck  Institute in Cologne offers unusual expertise in the analysis of  integration events during Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer.   The Institute in general is one of the best plant molecular  biology Laboratories in the world.      Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer has been used extensively to  create transgenic plants.  It offers a number of advantages over  direct methods, but the detailed sequence of integration events  is not well understood.  In particular, the influence of the left  end sequence homology has not been examined until now.   Mr. Wenck's proposed research will clarify site selection of  transfer DNA integration.  This will be important in the design  of plasmids for Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer.  In   addition, this research will contribute to the development of  \"in-frame reporter systems\" for plants, which is a long term goal  of many plant genetics laboratories around the world.  ***",
