 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322042  Penner       The investigator will continue his study of the geometry and  topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.  Specifically,  he will study a natural simplicial completion of Teichmueller  space, where the associated compactification of moduli space is  conjectured to be an orbifold; this compactification should be a  useful tool for several enumerative problems in geometry.   Various arithmetic aspects of moduli space will be studied:  polylogarithm identities should be derived from canonical forms  on moduli space; there should be a map from moduli space to  Volodin space relating the cohomology of moduli space with  algebraic K-theory; number fields associated to fatgraphs a  la Grothendieck's dessin d'enfant should be calculated for the  investigator's existing database of fatgraphs.  This same  database should be used to calculate homology groups of various  moduli spaces on the computer.  There are, moreover, many  outstanding analytic and arithmetic questions to be studied about  his universal Teichmueller space, which is simply the space of  orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle modulo the  Moebius group.  Several of the projects above are closely  related to various developments in physics.       A basic object in mathematics, called the \"moduli space of  Riemann surfaces,\" has been studied for centuries.  Roughly, this  moduli space is the collection of all possible geometric shapes  on a fixed two-dimensional surface.  In the last decade or so,  our understanding of moduli space has increased, both because of  developments in mathematics, as well as new and exciting  interfaces with high-energy physics.  Indeed, many idealized but  interesting real physics problems amount to questions about the  geometry of moduli space itself, and this has provided a  remarkable influx of techniques, questions, and ideas, both to  mathematics and to physics.  In this project, the investigator  will continue his ongoing mathematical study of moduli space and  furt her study certain of these interfaces with high-energy  physics.  ***",
