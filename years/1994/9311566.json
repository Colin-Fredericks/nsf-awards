 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311566  Shen  High energy resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements  will be carried out on high quality single crystal samples.  Doping  of the samples will allow to vary Tc.  The photoemission studies  are aimed at understanding the gap anisotropy in HTS materials  where an improved energy and angular resolution will be utilized.   The study of Bi2212 will be extended to YBCO, TI2212, TI2201, and  NCCO.  Studies of the normal state will correlate the results of  photoemission measurements with transport data aimed at  understanding the doping behavior of Mott insulators.  High  efficiency core level photoemission spectroscopy will be used to  investigate changes in the local electronic structure due to the  opening of the superconducting gap.  The proximity effect studied  near normal metal/superconductor interfaces and ferromagnetic  materials will be investigated with respect to the role of oxygen  in determining differences in the electronic structure of  transition metals and transition metal oxides.  %%%  Photoemission is a powerful experimental tool in which impinging  radiation leads to the ejection of electronic carriers from a  solid.  Measurement of the energy and angle of emission can yield  important information about the electronic structure of the solid.   The photoemission technique has proved to be an excellent technique  to study the electronic properties of high temperature  superconductors.  In the present study the technique is extended to  various different materials which are available as very high  quality single crystal samples.  A much improved spectrometer will  be employed in this work.  The technique will be extended to other  materials, notable ferromagnetic solids.  Of particular interest  will be to compare transition metals such as nickel and iron with  their respective oxides.  ***",
