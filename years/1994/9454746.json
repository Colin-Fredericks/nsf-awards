 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454746  Matray    The Ultimate Electronic Field Trip...from abyss to Andromeda  supports the creation of K-12 testbeds, whose respective teams join  with science researchers and business/industry communities to  create, test and pilot innovative approaches to science education  that will serve as a proving ground for information technology,  learning and teaching, and work world interactions.  Given the goal  of life long learning, the philosophical premise shall be that  students/clients ask their own questions, pose and solve their own  problems...where students/clients and educators both function in  the roles of facilitators and constructors of their  learning...where volition is the moving force rather than  motivation; it will be organized around the teaching/learning  process utilizing technology for cognition and instructional  systems designs for the teaching of science.  The parameters of the  project reside in the area of regional and global marine and  environmental studies and astronomy.  Three overarching and  interactive elements guide the process to use a network linking  testbed classrooms with video images and data from research  institutes, museum, and aquaria to promote interactive learning  through virtual field trip experience: high-speed data  communications access (ATM, ISDN and Frame Relay) and computer  technologies are made available to K-14, IHEs, scientific research  communities, and libraries by business and industry partners.   Given access, educators, scientists, engineers, and technicians  will work collaboratively to sort and identify relevant electronic  data sources based on real world applications and work world  interactions.  This information, both asynchronous and real time,  becomes available via a Regional Environmental Electronic Library  (REEL) to the student/client groups involved in the testbed sites  and field trip development.    Access to the ultimate field trip utilizing such an infrastructure  will result in:            improved quality and eff ectiveness of instruction and            learning in the areas of regional/global marine and            environmental studies and astronomy;            the use of data communications to increase access to            informational, instructional and technological resources            (voice, video and data);            models for integrating the most cost-effective            telecommunications networking into the school science            curriculum;            a migration model to allow schools and/or agencies to            move from one science tier to the next as their needs and            applications change;            improvement of learning resources management;            definitions of the role of voice, video and data            communications in teacher training;            a model for product and service dissemination,            collaboration between diverse agencies, and military base            closure reuse blending with education.",
