 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411748  Kastner      Large single crystals, about a centimeter cube in volume, of  layered copper oxides grown at Massachusetts Institute of  Technology will be used for non-chemical methods of adding charge  carriers.  Photoexcitation of electrons and holes will be studied  using transient photoconductivity and photo-induced optical  absorption.  External electric fields will be applied in a field-  effect-transistor geometry to add electrons or holes.  Two  compounds, previously studied using chemical doping and, which  become superconducting when electrons and holes are added,  respectively will be investigated.  Also to be studied is a third  compound which cannot be doped by other means.    %  %  %  %    High temperature superconductivity results from chemical doping of  oxide semiconductors to change the density of electrons in them.   To understand the mechanism that leads to this interesting and  potentially useful phenomenon one would like to introduce electrons  without the disorder which is inherent in chemical doping.  The  proposed work will use large crystals of the copper oxides to  explore two ways of doing this.  In one, electrons will be added by  exposure to light.  In the other they will be added by an external  electric field.  ***",
