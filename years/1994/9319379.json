 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for a cooperative agreement supports the technical  foundation of an aerogeophysical facility that is required for  several projects within the Polar Earth Sciences and Polar  Glaciology Programs.  The facility is referred to as SOAR, the  Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research.  The function of SOAR  is to facilitate aerogeophysical research over continental  Antarctica toward an understanding of the dynamic behavior of the  ice sheet and the nature of the lithosphere beneath the ice sheet.   SOAR will support peer-reviewed research requiring high precision  laser altimetery, gravity, magnetics and navigational data sets.   Tasking for SOAR will be negotiated annually.  The first projects  to be supported are investigations in West Antarctica.  West  Antarctica is characterized by two kinds of the Earth s most  dynamic systems, a continental rift (the West Antarctic Rift  System) and a marine based ice sheet, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  (WAIS).  Active continental rift systems, caused by divergent plate  motions, result in thinned continental crust.  Associated with the  thin crust are fault-bounded sedimentary basins, active volcanism,  and elevated heat flow.   Marine  ice sheets are characterized by  rapidly moving streams of ice, penetrating and draining a slowly  moving ice reservoir.  Evidence left by past marine ice sheets  indicates that they may have a strongly non-linear response to  long-term climate change which results in massive and rapid  discharges of ice.  Understanding the evolution of the ice stream  system and its interaction with the interior ice is the key to  understanding this non-linear response.  In addition to these  specific projects, SOAR will provide information essential to site  selection decisions for a West Antarctic ice core as well as  critical information for selection of locations of over-snow  seismic transects.  SOAR represents a unique experiment in research  support for the US Antarctic program.  It has the potential to  revolutionize  the conduct of Earth Science and Glaciology research  in Antarctica.",
