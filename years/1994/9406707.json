 "awd_abstract_narration": "9406707  Sheridan    It is well known that the pancreas produces hormones that  regulate such critical processes as metabolism, development,  and growth.  The best known pancreatic hormones are insulin  and glucagon.  Recent studies have shown the existence of  multiple forms of somatostatin, a peptide hormone originally  isolated from the brain and found to inhibit growth hormone  release from the pituitary gland, but subsequently found to  be located in the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and  elsewhere of many animals.  The special significance of the  multiple forms of somatostatin and the roles these factors  play in coordinating aspects of metabolism, growth, and  development remain to be determined.  With this project, Dr.  Sheridan will evaluate how somatostatin influences, directly  and/or indirectly (via interactions with other pancreatic  factors such as insulin), lipid metabolism in fish.  Specifically, he will determine in what tissues and through  what specific cellular processes somatostatin influences fat  uptake and breakdown.  In addition, he will distinguish the  actions of two pancreatic somatostatin forms (the co-  existence of which is unique to fish).  These results will  contribute significantly to the overall understanding of how  metabolism is regulated and provide important insight into  the evolution of somatostatin action.  ***",
