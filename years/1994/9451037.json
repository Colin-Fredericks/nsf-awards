Because of the isolated location of  ASC, the educational opportunities offered by the Department of  Biology are primarily restricted to those which can be accommodated  with limited on-campus facilities and equipment. While a program in  field and environmental biology has traditionally been strong at  ASC, undergraduate experiences in modern \"bench\" biology have been  constrained by a lack of essential instrumentation. This is  particularly true in upper division laboratory courses to be  impacted by the equipment proposed herein, including: Comparative  Animal Physiology, Cell Biology/Genetics Laboratory, Immunology,  and Molecular Biology where currently many procedures/experimental  approaches can only be described and \"hands-on\" experience is  inadequate or lacking altogether.  The instrumentation requested in  this proposal will be enormously productive in terms of enhancing  the ability of the Department of Biology to provide a wide range of  sophisticated, contemporary laboratory experiences to ASC Biology  majors in our advanced laboratory courses. As a result, the  educational experience of ca. 125 students per year for a projected  period of ten years will be impacted directly (with many other  students being impacted indirectly), allowing them to compete  successfully for positions in graduate and professional schools and  for professional biotechnical careers following graduation from  Adams State College, as well as enhancing science education in area  public schools. Specifically, the Macintosh/MacLabTM-based  analog/digital data acquisition system is a state-of-the-art  apparatus that permits complex analyses of data collected from an  extremely wide range of modern input devices to be easily  accomplished. The ease with which complex analyses o f real data  acquired by this system may be undertaken will allow an inquiry  approach in the teaching laboratory as well as enabling  undergraduate student research.",
