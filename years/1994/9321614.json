 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321614  PULIDO       As geographers and other scientists become more aware of the  spatial distribution of pollution and other environmental  problems, the tendency of minority ethnic and racial groups to  have disproportionate exposure to many risks has become more  evident.  Unfortunately, much of the research on this topic has  tended to provide only \"snapshot\" views, examining relationships  for a limited time period.  As a result, knowledge about the  processes through which minority groups are adversely impacted is  limited.  This Research Planning Grant will enable a productive  young investigator to explore new approaches to this important  problem.  Both micro- and macro-level analyses will be examined  through a pilot study of the impacts of abandoned toxic-waste  sites on African Americans and Latinos in Los Angeles.  The  distribution of toxic-waste sites through the city will be  examined using historical records.  In areas where abandoned  sites are located, the evolution of land-use, industrial,  residential, and workplace patterns will be studied.  This  information will be combined with information about the changing  demographic and social patterns of minority groups in order to  better assess the nature of minority exposure to toxic wastes.  After research methods have been refined through this pilot  study, the investigator plans to conduct parallel analyses of the  exposure of these minority populations to other environmental  problems, including commercial hazardous-waste facilities and  toxic air pollution.       Through the conduct of this project, new insights will be  gained regarding the factors that have resulted in many minority  groups being exposed to more severe environmental problems than  other groups.  Refinement of methods that incorporate a  historical dimension to empirical analyses will significantly  enhance theoretical discussions of \"environmental racism.\"  This  research planning grant also will provide valuable assistance to  a promising young Latino  woman at a critical early stage in her  independent research career.  ***",
