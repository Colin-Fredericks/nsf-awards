This research project, at the interface of  chemistry and biology, investigates the extent to which the  chemical communication systems of the Hawaiian species have  diverged from those of their  continental counterparts.    Pheromones are chemicals synthesized by one individual that  affect the behavior of another individual.  Dr. Laurie  Tompkins, a biologist at Temple University, and Dr. Larry L.  Jackson, a chemist at Montana State University, are  investigating the  pheromones of a Hawaiian Drosophila species, D. adiastola.  This species is of particular interest because males raise  their abdomens over their heads, emitting droplets of fluid,  while performing courtship in response to females.  Drs.  Tompkins and Jackson have discovered species-specific  chemical compounds in the males' droplets.  Moreover,  females of this species will mate only with D. adiastola  males, and they can distinguish D.  adiastola males from males of other, closely related species  even if they cannot see the males.  These observations  suggest that perception of the chemicals in males' droplets  enables females to distinguish different males.  Accordingly, Drs. Tompkins and  Jackson will attempt to identify the pheromones in males'  droplets.    Drs. Tompkins and Jackson have also shown that waxy  compounds on the cuticle (\"skin\") of D. adiastola females,  many of which are species-specific, stimulate males to court  the females and enable them to distinguish D. adiastola  females from females of another,  closely related species.  The researchers will attempt to  identify the compounds on females' cuticles that enable  males to tell different females apart.  In addition, since  some of the waxy compounds on males' cuticles are species-  specific, the researchers will try to determine whether or  not any of these compounds acts as a pheromone.",
