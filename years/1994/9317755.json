 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317755  Green    In the normal development of flowers and vegetative shoots  of plants, there is a highly coordinated pattern of gene  expression and morphological change.  Dr. Green will study  both processes and their mode of interaction.  Expression  gradients are postulated to set up physical expansion  gradients which lead to the spontaneous complex folding of  tissue.  This is a new proposal for the origin of  periodicity and pattern.  The morphological change is  postulated to act back on expression via stretch receptors  or cytoskeletal responses.  This completes a generative  cycle for morphogenesis.  Organ pattern on the sunflower  head emerges in strict developmental sequence behind a  circular generative zone which moves from the rim into a  central field of undifferentiated cells.  The major aim is  to determine the relative sequence of expression events and  of folding events in this meristem.  Pattern and tissue  folding are to be followed in detail by a non-destructive  SEM replica method.  Expression is to be studied by in situ  hybridization.  Similar analysis is proposed for other  systems, including morphological mutants.  Dr. Green will  study changes brought on by non-invasive physical  perturbation.  The nature of the cyclic interaction of  expression and morphological response should become clear.  ***",
