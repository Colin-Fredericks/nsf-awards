The transition from the Industrial Age to the  Information Age is causing great change in the institutions of  our society, and the universities and colleges are not exempt.   New technology--powerful computers, sophisticated client-server  systems, high-resolution  graphics for visualization,  multi-media, virtual reality, and broad-band fiber-optic cable  are transforming our economy and our society; they will alter  forever what we mean by \"education.\"  An Alliance of the  University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA),  California State  University, Fullerton (CSUF), and twenty-four community  colleges in the greater Los Angeles area has worked together  for many years in improving chemistry instruction.  The  Alliance now requests funds to plan a proposal that will  reorganize content into a new molecular science curriculum and  make maximum use of new educational technology.  In preparing  this proposal our attention is focused on informing our  faculties, gaining broad faculty support, and achieving  consensus for action.  To achieve these goals, we propose four  planning grant activities.  First, we  will host a seminar that  features distinguished speakers in economics, technology,  curriculum reform, science philosophy, science education,  cognitive science, and educational innovation.  Second,  Professor Orville Chapman of UCLA will present a one-quarter  seminar course that defines the issues, presents the proposal,  and facilitates debate and discussion.  Third, members of the  planning group will travel to sites of technological  innovation.  Finally, we will have a two-day faculty retreat at  Lake Arrowhead to fine tune the new curriculum and plan for  action.  ***y",
