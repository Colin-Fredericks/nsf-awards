 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313102  Turro  The photochemical behavior of supramolecular systems will be   studied, in particular guest-host complexes and   supermolecules. The guest systems include precursor ketones   which produce triplet geminate radical pairs and metal   complexes that serve as electron donor acceptor transfer   pairs. The host systems include colloidal micellar   aggregates, double helical DNA and porous molecular   crystalline zeolites. The supermolecules include biradicals   produced by photolysis of large ring cyclic ketones and   donor-acceptor complexes separated in space at fixed   distances by a DNA spacer. The objectives of the proposed   research include the discovery of new knowledge which will   allow the control of the chemistry of supramolecular systems   that involve highly reactive species such as biradicals and   micellized radical pairs, and the photoinduced electron   transfer processes between metal complexes.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Nicholas J. Turro at Columbia   University. Supramolecular chemistry has been defined as the   chemistry beyond the molecule. Two important classes of   supramolecules will be studied: guest-host complexes and   supermolecules. Guest-host complexes consist of two or more   molecules that are held together by attractive forces,   rather than chemical bonds. The supermolecules to be studied   can be viewed as a consisting of two or more subunits,   connected by spacer units. The structure and dynamics of   these supramolecules as well as reactive intermediates that   will generated by photolysis will be studied. The results of   this study will find applications to technological   activities involving chemistry at interfaces, the   characterization of materials possessing unusual properties,   and to an understanding of the binding of small guest   molecules to biomolecules.  ***",
