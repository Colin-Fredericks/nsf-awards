 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spear  9401254  This award is for partial support of a conference entitled \"Virus  Assembly\" to be held under the auspices of the Federation of American  Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) from July 23 to 28, 1994, at  the Vermont Academy, Saxtons River, Vermont. The purpose of the  conference is to bring together scientists working on all aspects of  virus assembly and structure (including the initial disassembly steps  associated with viral entry into cells) for bacterial, plant, animal  and human viruses. The intention is to encourage communication of ideas  and hypotheses about virus assembly and structure, across the usual  taxonomic barriers, and to promote dissemination of results obtained  with a variety of different viruses using a variety of different  experimental approaches, including biochemical and genetic methods as  well as X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and image  reconstruction. There are no other conferences devoted entirely to  problems of virus assembly and structure, across the viral taxonomic  groups, except the previous two FASEB conferences on this topic held in  1990 and 1992.  The previous conferences in this series were enormously  successful and achieved the kind of communication desired. It seems  likely, given the current rate of progress in this field, that the  FASEB conference of 1994 also achieve the desired goals.  %%%                             The purpose of the conference is to bring together, for exchange of  information, the leading researchers on the structure and assembly of  viruses. Viruses infecting humans, animals, plants and bacteria are all  included in the program because their similarities and differences help  to define the general principles of virus structure and assembly. It is  important to understand these general principles, in part because the  assembly of proteins and nucleic acids into complicated structures is  vital to the functioning of human cells and tissues as well as of the  viruses. In addition, some of the  most promising new antiviral drugs  and agricultural pest control strategies are likely to act by  interfering with virus assembly. Understanding the structures of  viruses allows one to predict the properties of agents that should be  able to block virus assembly and therefore prevent the spread of virus  infection.  ***",
