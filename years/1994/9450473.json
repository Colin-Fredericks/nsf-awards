 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research includes a study of two enzymes, the  redoxyendonuclease and formamidopyrimidine/8-oxyguanine-DNA  glycosylase, which initiate the repair of oxidative base damages in  the DNA.  The levels of both enzymes will be quantified by  biochemical assays in extracts of rat kidney tissue subjected to  physiological oxidant stress as compared to the undamaged kidney  tissue from the same animal as well as untreated controls.  The  results of these studies will lead to a better understanding of the  induction of DNA repair activities in response to oxidative DNA  damage and provide a basis for future studies on the fundamental  mechanisms underlying free radical-mediated damage in animal  tissues.    Interactive activities include: teaching a revised graduate level  pharmacology course with emphasis on molecular biology principles  and techniques; organizing a panel discussion focusing on the  differences in which men and women conduct science; and offering a  recombinant DNA technology short course to undergraduate and  graduate students as well as interested faculty.",
