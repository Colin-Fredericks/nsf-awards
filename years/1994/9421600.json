 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421600  Nail    This project funds a meeting to have industry/university  interaction to explore the potential to form an Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Pharmaceutical Processing at Purdue  University.  The meeting will try to identify the possible projects  of most significance to industry.  It will also determine if there  is sufficient interest and funding potential to establish this  Center.    Research areas being proposed for this potential Center include:   1) a continued focus on development of proteins, peptides, and  other biotechnology-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents;        2) development of more potent therapeutic agents which are  effective in ever smaller doses; 3) more sophisticated  pharmaceutical dosage forms such as novel vaccines, liposomal  formulations, and other complex disperse systems; 4) continued  emphasis by regulatory agencies worldwide on using the best  available technology to improve sterility assurance of injectable  products, and 4) productivity improvement by using higher speed  equipment, particularly for solid oral dosage form.    The researcher are well qualified to hold an industry/university  meeting to explore the potential for an I/UCRC.      The possible Center has been coordinated with Dr. Fred Heineken of  the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.    The Program Manager recommends Purdue University be awarded $10,000  for one year for this meeting.",
