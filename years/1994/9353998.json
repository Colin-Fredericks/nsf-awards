 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353998  Hieggelke  This two-year national program, based on a successful pilot  project, will provide eight workshops (four each year) designed  for experienced community college physics teachers at several  geographically-dispersed community college campuses.  One set  of workshops acquaints participants with (1) the use of  microcomputer-based laboratories; (2) the construction of  physics simulations; or (3) the development of conceptual  exercises and overview case studies.  Another workshop provides  an update and an opportunity for more advanced experiences with  microcomputer-based lab technology for previous workshop  participants.  Each three-day workshop is being led by two  community college physics professors and two university/college  physics professor who play a major role in these areas.  These  workshops acquaint participants with the contemporary use of  the recent developments and findings of cognitive physics  research and participants are provided with extensive materials  based on these findings.  As a result of these intensive  workshops, participants are able to evaluate these developments  and they are able to return to their campus to start  implementing the workshop findings.  Thus, these workshops  facilitate the rapid incorporation of this knowledge and  technology at community colleges.  The impact of the workshop  is being reinforced by the establishment of a networking system  employing a telecommunications bulletin board system and a  newsletter.   The ultimate goal of this project is to help  community college students develop a stronger understanding of  classical and contemporary physics.  The task of updating  physics programs at community colleges is difficult but  essential for the nation and for science because of the large  number of students, particularly women and minorities,  attending community colleges.  ***",
