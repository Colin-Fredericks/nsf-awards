We will  develop, investigate, and characterize nanocrystalline silicon  which has been produced by spark processing, a technique that is  markedly different from commonly employed preparation methods  (i.e., anodic etching). We intend to develop further understanding  of the mechanisms responsible for the photoluminescence of spark  processed nanocrystalline silicon and to possibly produce an  efficient light emitting test structure.   %%%   The proposed research has high likelihood for leading to new  scientific discoveries and insights into basic mechanisms of light  emitting silicon. Research of this type on \"porous\" silicon may  eventually lead to efficient silicon-based light emitting diodes,  advanced display systems, optical memories, or possibly lasers.    An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications.    ***",
