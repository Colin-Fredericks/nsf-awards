 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320686  Postawko    This three year award is designed to provide support for the  cooperative field project \"Schools of the Pacific Rainfall  Climate Experiment (SPaRCE)\" involving middle school, high school  and college level teachers and students from various Pacific  island and atoll nations. The project is coordinated on the  U.S. side by Dr. Susan Postawko, Dr. Mark Morrissey and   Dr. Victoria Duca from the University of Oklahoma. At present  over forty college and school sites have been identified for  participation under SPaRCE.  Donald Edgeworth, Principal of the  Papaaroa Adventist College located in Rarotonga in the Cook  Islands, is one of many foreign counterpart investigators  participating in the program.    Climate change is a primary concern to people of the Pacific  islands due to the vulnerability of their islands to sea level  and rainfall pattern changes. Numerous models of earth-atmosphere  systems have been developed in an effort to diagnose and predict  future climate trends. Surface rainfall observations are crucial  to test and validate satellite algorithms. This program benefits  the participants by allowing students to participate in a real  research project, and by providing them with educational  materials on climate and climate change. Data collected by  participants is compiled into data sets for distribution to  climate researchers. Funds in this award will be used to support  a number of functions including travel by program staff for  teacher training and equipment maintenance purposes, the support  of a student Project Coordinator to organize and analyze incoming  data, and to facilitate communications with the school network  gathering rainfall data.     The project plans to focus a considerable amount of activity on  regions such as Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana  Islands, all U.S. Territories; the Republic of Palau, a U.S.  Trust Territory; and the freely associated states of the  Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. On e of  the initial activities included under this award will be a  seminar on basic weather and climate with hands-on instruction on  the use of meteorological instruments and data analysis to be  conducted for SPaRCE investigators at the Annual Pacific  Educational Conference to be held in Saipan in August 1994.",
