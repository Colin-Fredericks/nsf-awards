It is expected that, as a result of this meeting, a clearer picture of \"where we need to go to enhance technology\" will emerge.  A brief proceedings of this meeting will be published.    In addition, we believe that this conference will aid the commercialization of these sources and their applications at time when new products are badly needed by US industry.  The support provided by NSF will be used specifically to enable university faculty and students to attend this conference.  This will encourage more work in a field expected to become vital in electronics, optics and medicine.  ***",
