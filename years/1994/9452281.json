The Engineering Technology Department at Old Dominion  University offers televised upper-division programs at three  locations throughout the state of Virginia with other sites planned  for the future. In addition to these three main sites, there are  two satellite sites which receive only televised courses. The upper  division curriculum in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering  Technology programs are offered through a combination of televised  and live courses taught on the campus of the community colleges  participating in the program. Inadequate laboratory facilities to  teach upper-division courses in Mechanical Engineering Technology  Program, at the remote sites, has been the biggest draw back of the  program since its inception. Two subject areas where laboratory  equipment is critical in maintaining the quality of the program are  Fluid Mechanics and Automatic Controls.  It is proposed to develop  a Mobile Instructional Laboratory built inside a 4O feet long  trailer to house equipment for Fluid Mechanics and Automatic  Controls. The laboratory facility will move to one of the sites and  stay there for four weeks. It will be equipped with four modular  workstations which can be changed quickly to accommodate a variety  of equipment. Utilization of this facility for two subject areas  and between three sites offers a cost effective solution without  comprising the quality of the program.",
