 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award supports mathematical research  in the field of iterative methods for large systems of equations  arising in image processing.  Application to image processing and  medical imaging is planned.  The central problem of image  restoration is the estimation of the original image, given a  version of the image degraded by noise and blur.  Work will be done  developing and analyzing new fast algorithms for the computation of  the estimated image.  Two different approaches to image restoration  predominate, (i) algebraic restoration, viewed as a linear,  possibly ill-conditioned, system of equations and (ii) stochastic  restoration where one regards the problem of estimating vectors  subject to random disturbances.  Numerical methods for both  approaches will be developed.  Either approach yields linear  systems of equations that have a structure that can be used in the  development and analysis of efficient algorithms for image  restoration.  The structure depends on the assumptions made on the  image and the noise.  The matrices in these systems are typically  quite large.  The computational work, even with efficient methods,  is demanding.  Since many applications require real-time image  restoration, the development of algorithms for parallel computers  is important.  Work done on this project focuses on the development  of iterative methods that lend themselves will to implementation on  multiprocessors.",
