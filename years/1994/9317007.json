The  purpose of the work is to characterize the dynamic environment and  ice stratigraphy to aid in the assessment of Siple Dome as a  potential deep ice core site, and to determine whether the  configuration of ice stream flow in the region was different in the  past than now.  The work involves measurements of the configuration  and continuity of internal layers in the ice, using radar echo  sounding and determination of velocity field, based on standard GPS  surveying.  The goals of the work are relevant to understanding the  dynamics of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), its past history  and its potential future behavior, including possible effects on  global sea level.  This work is a collaborative project between the  University of Washington, the University of Colorado and St. Olaf  College.  ***",
