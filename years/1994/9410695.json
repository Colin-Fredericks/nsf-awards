 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410695  Thonnard       This award provides funding for the development of a  laser-based resonance ionization spectroscopy technique  capable of measuring the isotopic abundances of noble gas  constituents krypton-81 and krypton-85 in natural samples.  The project is to be carried out in the Institute for Rare  Isotope Measurements at the University of Tennessee.       Accurate measurements of the radionuclei of krypton-81  and krypton-85 can contribute to a better understanding of  processes in the environment, including dating of polar ice  and very old groundwater, deep ocean circulation rates, and  modern water flow patterns. These isotopes have half-lives  of 210,000 and 10.8 years respectively and are found in  natural samples with isotopic abundances usually less than a  part per trillion. Accurate analysis is a problem that has  not yet been solved. The PI and colleagues on this project  will develop a multi-step technique aimed at achieving an  analytical procedure capable of measuring hundreds of  environmentally significant samples per year.  ***  9405805  Craig       This award provides 75% of the funds required for the  acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted  and reflected light to be used in the rare gas isotope  laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the  University of California, San Diego. The University is  committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the  acquisition.       The microscope system is mainly to be used by  researchers working with fluid, glass, and crystalline  inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic rocks that have  been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope is  needed for the location and identification of these small  inclusions prior to extraction of the rare gases (argon,  helium, and neodymium) for isotopic analysis. The  researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are  using the isotopic content of the rare gases brought up from  the mantle to understand the geochemical evolution of the   mantle.  ***",
