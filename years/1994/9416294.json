To comprehend the many  factors involved, it is necessary to conduct research on a  multidisciplinary, comprehensive and coordinated level.  Accordingly, the LMER sites have met regularly, through  funding from NSF  to facilitate the cooperation needed to  solve common problems, compare results, focus on shared  goals and coordinate research with various coastal ecosystem  programs.    The LMER Coordinating  Committee and  the Coordination  Office have developed an awareness of  the LMER  program  within the scientific community as well as facilitated  opportunities for cooperative research, coordinated LMER  activities with other federal agencies, and created ties to  international coastal research efforts. The Coordination  Office has greatly increased communication among the  projects and facilitated the organization of special focus  scientific meetings.    This project will provide support  for the continued  operation of the LMER Coordination Office at the Marine  Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, support  the activities  of the LMER Coordinating Committee and  organize regular  meetings of  the LMER scientists and others to provide a  comprehensive and integrated approach to the  study of these  environmentally important ecosystems.",
