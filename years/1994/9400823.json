Computation techniques that combine interpolation   and approximation into a single process (called interproximation)   will be developed.  The curve and surface  representations that   will be considered here include B-splines, NURBS, Beta-splines and   rational Beta-splines.  Different ways of building polynomial   (integral) and rational B-spline curves and surfaces as well as   their properties when viewed as digital filters will be studied.    A general model for the automatic smoothing of sharp corners and   edges formed by intersecting parametric surfaces in the design and   modeling process will be built.  This work will also include   filling an n-sided hole with an n-sided patch with n > 3.  A   general model will be developed for the automatic smooth connection   of disjoint parametric surfaces.       Computational techniques for shape modeling and design are   rapidly becoming important tools for modern industrial design and   manufacture.  Computer models are replacing physical models.  They   are cheaper to construct, easier to change, and simpler to analyze.   Computer-generated images increase productivity by allowing rapid   and accurate visualization during design. Applications include the  design and manufacture of car bodies, ship hulls, airplane wings,  and mechanical parts as well as a large variety of ducts, blends,  and fillets.  Many important open theoretical and practical issues  need to be explored to provide effective tools for industrial  design.",
