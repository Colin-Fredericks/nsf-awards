 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kremer  9317380    Models and estimates of primary production and biogeochemical  cycling in the Southern Ocean must account for processes occurring  in at least four distinct regions:  the open ocean, the marginal  ice edge zones, the pack ice zone, and the coastal regions.  Of  these regions, the least studied is the pack ice zone, where rates  of primary production and nutrient cycling remain unknown.  This is  due to it's relative inaccessibility and the present lack of remote  sensing technology to evaluate the potential for primary production  in ice or ice covered waters.  Therefore, assessing primary  production and nutrient cycling in pack ice requires either ice  breaking capabilities and/or the establishment of temporary remote  facilities.  During 1992, the first drifting ice station in  Antarctic waters, Ice station Weddell #1 (ISW-1) was established in  the perennial pack ice of the Western Weddell Sea.  ISW-1 provided  a platform for conducting the first time-series investigations  assessing primary production, nutrient cycling and net accumulation  of biogenic particulate matter in Antarctic pack ice.  During ISW-1  operation, additional ice cores were obtained by the ice physics  group and are now archived at the Cold Regions Research and  Engineering Laboratories (CRREL). Processing these cores for the  determination of biomass (as pigments, particulate organic carbon  and nitrogen) and biogenic silica will compliment the existing ISW-  1 biological data set, and extend the assessment of the new  production/accumulation of biogenic particulate matter to include  additional study sites and ice types that were not analyzed during  routine ISW-1 operations.  Additionally, studies of primary  production, biomass distributions and nutrients in pack ice will be  extended to the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas through a cruise  in August and September 1993.  This project will provide the  resources and time necessary for processing samples collected at  CRREL and from the Bellingshau sen-Amundsen seas and for the   interpretation of the results.  The data sets generated from ISW-1  operations and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen cruise will extend the  knowledge of the relative contribution of biogenic particulate  matter in the Southern Ocean and will be utilized in the  construction of or as verification of pack ice primary production  and nutrient cycling models presently under development.  ***",
