 "awd_abstract_narration": "Susan Tucker is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study solvent effects   on solute reactivity in supercritical fluids.  In the supercritical   regime, solvent properties vary dramatically, but continuously, with   modest changes in temperature and pressure.  Tucker will use computer   simulation techniques, such as reactive flux molecular dynamics and   umbrella sampling Monte Carlo, to explore the microscopic details of both   dynamic and static solvent effects on solute reaction rates.  Initially   she will focus on the hydrolysis of alkyl aryl ethers, e.g. anisole,   2-methoxynaphthalene, in supercritical water.  The rates of these charge   transfer reactions are sensitive to solvent properties, and thus provide   a stringent test of theoretical predictions.  These reactions have also   been subjected to extensive experimental studies.  In addition,   mathematical models for solvent effects within the generalized Langevin   equation and the Caldeira-Leggett/Zwanzig Hamiltonian will be explored in   order to develop new theories for describing the effect of changing   solvent properties on solute reactivity.    Supercritical fluids have found widespread application in many industrial   extraction processes.  They are also being used for environmental   remediation.  A unified theoretical description of the unique behaviors   observed in supercritical fluid solvents would provide a significant   contribution to predicting how thermodynamic conditions might affect   solute reactivity in supercritical fluids, and aid in the development of   industrial processes which make use of these technologically important   solvents.",
