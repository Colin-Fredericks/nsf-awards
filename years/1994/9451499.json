The lab will  also be used as a test bed for student experiments including class  projects, parallel programming assignments and undergraduate  research projects. These projects will include, but will not be  limited to, designing and testing of parallel algorithms, measuring  performance of parallel algorithms, designing and implementing  distributed programs, setting N-way dynamic connection on LANs, and  implementing remote procedure call packages. Students will gain  practical experience in parallel programming, network system  programming for distributed applications, and application  development for neural networks, pattern recognition, and fuzzy  logic control systems.  The proposed parallel computer system will  consist of four SUN workstations (already in place), a parallel  CNAPS computer and a SUN Sparc Station. The SUN Sparc Station will  act as a front end for the CNAPS computer and as a server for the  four SUN workstations. This parallel and distributed system will be  connected to the department's existing LAN via a gateway which will  allow students to develop projects without interfering with the  operation of the LAN.  Due to the increasing importance of  parallel/distributed computations and computer networks, the  proposed laboratory will better prepare students for both  professional and academic careers. The lab will enhance the senior  year and the minority summer research programs supported by the  College of Arts and Sciences at Georgia Southern University. We  expect that the Physics and Biology Departments as well as the  Engineering studies and Engineering technology programs will also  benefit from this project.",
