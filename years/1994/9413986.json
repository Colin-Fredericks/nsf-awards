 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funds requested in this proposal will be used to  implement a Biotechnology course at Villa Julie  College. The course will be designated as an  upper-level course for undergraduates majoring in  Biology, or related fields, leading to a Bachelors  degree. The acquisition of the state-of-the art  equipment, including a laminar flow hood, Co2  incubator, ultrafreezer,  ultracentrifuge,  spectrophotometer, and equipment for protein  electrophoresis will allow the students access to  more modern instrumentation and enhance their skills  and knowledge of  current technologies. Presently  the Science Department offers upper level courses in  Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry.  The development of a Biotechnology course will  complement these courses and prepare the students  for graduation and their future endeavors. Students  completing this course will be able to use their  knowledge and skills to help them obtain employment  in biotechnology and life sciences fields upon  graduation with a baccalaureate degree, or they may  wish to pursue a Masters or Doctoral degree.    The Biotechnology course will include both the  theory  and practical use of the following: a)  centrifugation, both low and ultra speed, b)  isolation and electrophoresis separation of proteins  and nucleic acids, c) Recombinant DNA Technology;  specifically plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme  analysis, cloning, and analysis of foreign DNA  expression, d) the growth and maintenance of  bacterial, yeast, and animal cell cultures, e) the  propagation and isolation of viruses, and f) the use  of antibodies to identify specific proteins by ELISA  and Western Blot procedures.                                       3",
