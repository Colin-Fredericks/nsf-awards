The insitu portion of the project is basically one dimensional;  that is, only a vertical profile of small-strain material  stiffness, in terms of shear wave velocity, will be measured at  each site.  No investigation of the lateral variability of the  stiffness profiles is proposed.  The one -dimensional (1-D)  approach is taken due to the one year time frame for the project,  also because of the high cost involved in installing numerous  boreholes that would be necessary to develop two-dimensional (2-  D) profiles using borehole seismic techniques.    The objective is to develop 2-D (and in one case, 3-D) stiffness  profiles.  Borehole seismic techniques (such as crosshole  testing, downhole testing or suspension logging) will not be  employed.  Instead, the nonintrusive SASW technique involving  Rayleigh-type surface waves is utilized.  The technique is  nonintrusive because both the source and receivers are placed on  the ground surface.  Measurement of surface wave dispersion is  performed in the field.  Forward modeling is then used in the  laboratory to determine the shear wave velocity profile at the  site.  In addition to the cost benefit of being nonintrusive, an  important benefit of SASW testing is that it can be used to  measure softer layers sandwiched between stiffer layers, a  potentially critical measurement in engineering studies.    This project involves SASW testing (spectral analysis of surface  waves) at two sites:  The Tarzana site and the La Cienega and I-  10 highway interchange.  In both cases, unusually high ground  shaking was measured with surface stations.  At each site, in  situ seismic testing will be performed using a high-energy mobile  vibrator (Vibroseis).   This source, coupled with multi-channel  recording of four or more 1-Hz geophones, should permit profiles  on the order of 100 to 300 m in lateral  dimension (depending on  the site) to be developed to a depth on the order of 30 to 60 m.  In the case of the Tarzana site, profiling will be performed in  both the north-south and east-west directions, allowing a 3-D  image of the underground shear stiffness to be developed.    The results of this study have the potential to offer an  important contribution to the understanding of ground shaking  levels generated during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake as well as  to the development of cost-effective 2-D and 3-D seismic  profiling for the prediction of ground response during future  earthquakes.  ***",
