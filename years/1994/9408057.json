 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408057  Chapman       Molecular data from nuclear and organellar DNA, in conjunction  with numerical algorithms for phylogenetic analysis, have  revolutionized the study of plant evolution.  Dr. Russell Chapman  of Louisiana State University has been a leader in the application  of these molecular and taxometric methodologies to the analysis of  green algae and of so-called lower land plants such as mosses and  club-mosses.  Focussing primarily on nuclear ribosomal gene  sequences, he has shown that the bryophytes (mosses, liverworts,  and hornworts), while likely to be the earliest diverging lineages  of land plants, are themselves not a single evolutionary unit but  a series of terrestrial \"experiments.\"  Additional DNA data are  being collected to test the phylogenetic affinities of various  bryophyte groups, and in particular to assess the utility of the  current classification of mosses into 17 distinct suborders.  As  samples become available, molecular analyses will also be applied  to related groups of primitive vascular plants, the lycophytes  (club mosses and relatives).       In association with morphological and ultrastructural studies  underway in other laboratories, the molecular phylogenetic analyses  of nuclear ribosomal DNA conducted by Dr. Chapman are providing  insight to the direction and tempo of change in plants as they  adapted to life on land.",
