A common function of protein  phosphorylation is in signal transduction.  In prokaryotes,  phosphohistidine formation is a key step in a two-component  regulatory system.  Although signal transduction roles for  phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine are known in  eucaryotes, the phosphohistidine system is poorly characterized.   Recently with improved methods for studying phosphohistidine in  proteins, it is now clear that histidine kinase and histidine  phosphatases both exist in eucaryotic cells.  To begin to  understand the role of histidine phosphorylation in these cells, we  will identify protein substrates for the enzymes.  Studies will  first determine how much histidine phosphate/protein occurs in  cells and how many proteins are involved in this change.  Studies  will be performed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.  Proteins  shown to contain phosphohistidine will be purified to homogeneity  and their amino acid sequence will be determined.  This information  will be used to clone the gene(s) for each phosphorylated protein  involved.  Cloned genes will then be used to determine the copy  number and the presence of near homologues in parent yeast cells.   Cloned genes may also be used as tools in gene disruption and over-  expression experiments to get a better understanding of the  substrate requirements and metabolic role of protein/histidine  phosphorylation eucaryotic cells.  %%%  Most cells respond to external signals.  For example, bacteria can  sense the concentration of nutrients and swim in their direction.   Animal cell growth and development is regulated by hormonal signals  also from outside the cell.  The hormonal signal is passed from the  sensor (the molecule in the animal cell that detects the signal) to  the receptor (a molecule that responds.)  In bacteria, many  different signal systems have been described, and one common  feature  of them all is a reversible change in chemical structure of  a regulatory protein that links the sensor to the effector.  For  example, the change may be the presence, or absence, of a phosphate  on a specific histidine in a protein.  Similar protein changes also  occur in animal/yeast cells but their role is not as well  understood.  The idea in this study is that a specific change, such  as a protein histidine phosphorylation, is involved in animal cell  signal  transduction, as in bacteria.  To test this, the first aim  of our research is to determine how much histidine  phosphate/protein there is in animal/yeast cells, and how many  different proteins are histidine phosphorylated.  The histidine  phosphorylated proteins will be isolated and cloned.  Finally, the  cloned genes will provide the basis for molecular genetic studies  to determine the function(s) of protein histidine phosphorylation  in animal cells.  ***",
