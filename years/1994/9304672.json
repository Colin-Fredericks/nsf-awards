One such  nucleolar snRNA designated U14 snRNA is essential for the  processing of pre-ribosomal RNA. The evolutionarily conserved  ability of fungal, amphibian and mammalian U14 snRNAs to  intermolecularly base-pair with 18SrRNA suggests that this  hydrogen-bonding interaction is important in U14 snRNA function and  ribosomal RNA processing events. We have demonstrated that the  mouse U14 snRNA genes are located within introns 5,6 and 8 of the  constitutively-expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a  positioning which led to experiments confirming that an intron-  processing pathway for U14 snRNA production exists. This is the  first example of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA intron which is processed to  yield a stable, biologically functional RNA species. We will  continue characterizing U14 snRNA synthesis, structure and function  while exploring the evolutionary conservation of those parameters.   The processing sequences/structures essential for U14 snRNA  excision will be determined by several different approaches. We  will examine the developmental expression of U14 snRNA/hsc70 pre-  mRNA in Xenopus laevis. We will examine the genomic organization of  U14 snRNA genes in evolutionarily diverse eukaryotic organisms.  %%%  RNA is utilized both as a structural molecule for protein synthesis  as well as a messenger molecule in the same process. Smaller RNA  species have been found to be essential to the correct synthesis of  the ribosomal and messenger RNAs and a number of them have been  isolated and characterized. U14 snRNA is one such molecule, but one  which is unique in that it was found by this laboratory to be  located in introns of another gene, the hsc70 heat shock gene. This  is the first example of an intron which is processed to yield a  stable, biologically functional RNA species. The process of  producing the U14 snRNA will be studied more extensiv ely as well as  the developmental expression and the evolutionary conservation of  this RNA species.  ***",
