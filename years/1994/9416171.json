 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416171  Murray  Numerous reports of fractures in beam flange-to-column  flange welds in steel moment resisting frames after the  Northridge earthquake suggest the need for a new connection  configuration.  No reports of end-plate moment connection  distress or failure are known.  In this project the endplate  and all-bolted moment connections will be studied to develop  an alternate to field welded connections.  Because both of  these connection types require tension bolts and the  associated problems with prying forces, a shim plate is  placed opposite the beam tension flange or the tee-stub  tension web.  Using the shim ensures that the bolt tension  will not increase until separation of the end-plate or tee  stub flange and the column flange occurs.  If the design is  such that the pretension force is sufficient to develop the  strength of the connected beam, in effect the connection is  tested at the time the bolts are tightened.    The project consists of three tasks:  Task I is a survey to  determine if end-plate or all-bolted moment connections  exhibited distress or failure because of the Northridge  earthquake.  Task II is the development of a design  procedure for shimmed end-plate and all-bolted moment  connections, which is a relatively uncomplicated procedure  because the effects of prying forces do not need to be  considered.  Task III is a set of four verification tests,  two for each connection type.  One test in each set will be  designed so the connection is the controlling limit state  and the second so the beam is controlling limit state.    Successful completion of the proposed research will result  in a steel beam-to-column moment connection which does not  require welding but with sufficient strength to resist large  forces from seismic events.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
