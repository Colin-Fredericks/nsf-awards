Interestingly,  reproductive experience also alters the brain, demonstrating  neural plasticity in the adult female mammal.  So far, only  the endogenous opioid system has been shown to be altered  both behaviorally and physiologically by reproductive  experience.  The goal of this Research Planning Grant is to  utilize in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) to  determine if there are permanent changes in brain opioid  prohormone gene expression as a consequence of repeated  reproductive experience.  During the 18 months of the  planning period the ISHH technique will be set up and  tested.  When the technique has been perfected research will  start to determine the long-term effects of repeated  reproductive states.  The levels of message RNA of the  opioid prohormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), will be  examined during the estrous cycle and during pregnancy in  the brain of female rats will undergo steroid regimens that  mimic pregnancy to uncover the mechanism underlying this  effect.  To demonstrate that repeated pregnancies and  lactations produce long-term, possibly permanent, changes in  the brain of the adult mammal has important implications for  the study of neural plasticity and reproductive  neurobiology.",
