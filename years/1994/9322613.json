 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322613  Nyikos       This project is aimed at some problem areas where  interaction between topologists and set theorists seems likely to  lead to significant progress in both areas.  Set-theoretic  topology has grown explosively in the last two decades as a  result of such interaction, stimulating much fruitful research in  set theory as well.  In the last few years, however, the flow of  results has shown signs of abating, and the development of new  set-theoretic axioms and techniques will probably be needed to  keep this area of topology in good health.  The problem areas on  which particular stress will be laid are hereditary normality;  the structure and products of countably compact spaces; and the  theory of nonmetrizable manifolds.       Set-theoretic topology is more of a foundational subject  than the rest of topology, primarily concerning itself with very  abstract spaces and with the impact on topology of the adoption  of variants of the axioms of set theory.  Secondarily, it has  applications not only to set theory and the rest of topology, but  also to analysis and algebra, particularly the theory of Boolean  algebras.  Nyikos's research has emphasized all these aspects.  For example, he has done an extensive study of the differential  structures (i.e. smoothings) that can be imposed on the long  line, and of the associated 2-dimensional manifold of its tangent  vectors, providing valuable heuristics for those wishing to  understand nontrivial smoothings of more familiar but  higher-dimensional manifolds. (This is a subject of major  importance today, especially in 4 dimensions, where the interplay  with theoretical physics is strong.)  Some of the smoothings of  the long line required axioms outside the usual axioms of set  theory.  Nyikos has been a leader in the use of these axioms in  set-theoretic topology ever since his involvement over a decade  ago in the discovery that a famous unproved conjecture concerning  Moore spaces was actually independent of the usual basic axiom s  of set theory.  Moreover, this conjecture was shown to be  inconsistent with the Cantor Continuum Hypothesis, a far more  familiar proposition that most working mathematicians would be  likely to choose if they had to make a choice.  This result  suggests the flavor of the best set-theoretic topology.  ***",
