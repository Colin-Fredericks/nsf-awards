The student will conduct  participant observation in the school, and study the development  through its colonial history of the school's customary practices  and the educational values of both teachers and students.  In  addition the student will do a survey of a sample of students in  their home communities, to assess their cultural backgrounds.  The focus of the study will be to determine how the students'  cultural backgrounds and knowledge of history interact with the  school's program as developed through its own historical  trajectory through colonialism and independence to the present  situation of many global influences.  The focal event to be  explained is a violent attact against girls by boys protesting  some administrative decisions in a similar elite school in Kenya  in 1991.   This research is important because schooling is commonly thought  to be the unique road to cultural and social advancement in  developing nations.  Understanding how one elite school works in  historical context will provide a case study that will be  valuable in interpreting and reacting to student protests and  activities in similar schools in similar countries.  ***",
