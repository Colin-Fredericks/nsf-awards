In  particular, R. maximum covers over half a million hectares of  southern Appalachian forest. Dense thickets of this species,  called \"slicks\", inhibit the growth of canopy trees. These dense  growths are often close to streams making R. maximum a keystone  species in the interface between terrestrial and aquatic  ecosystems of the southern Appalachian mountains. Although R.  maximum must have a significant impact on several ecosystem  processes, the \"role\" of R. maximum in functions of the  Appalachian forest have been only rarely studied. The influence  of R. maximum on ecosystem hydrology may be one of the important  impacts of this species on the Appalachian forest system. The  objectives of this proposal are: 1. to determine the factors that  regulate water use patterns in R. maximum; 2. to develop  mathematical functions that predict water use patterns from  environmental conditions; 3. to collect evidence for possible  competition for water between R. maximum and an important canopy  species. Experiments are designed to fit into the currently  funded research program at the LTER site at Coweeta Hydrological  Laboratory. Results from this proposal will clarify the  importance of R. maximum in the ecosystem water budget for the  regulation mechanisms therefore for R. maximum water use, and  determine if competition for water between this important  understory species and a canopy dominant species is likely.    ***",
