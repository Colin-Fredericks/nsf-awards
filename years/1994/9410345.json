The key goals of the proposed conference are fourfold:    1) to develop a thematic understanding of elections in  established democracies.    2) to integrate, synthesize and consolidate theoretical,  empirical and institutional studies comparing elections, parties,  and voters.    3) to disseminate the conference results widely to an  international readership through publication of an edited book.    Comparative research on democracies has traditionally drawn  heavily on the experience of major Western countries.  Through  this conference, the research will be updated to take account of  substantial changes within many established democracies during  the last decade, as well as the growth of 'third wave'  democracies in the Southern Mediterranean, Central and Eastern  Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa.    The conference will bring together colleagues with expertise in  established and emerging democracies.  One set of participants  will contribute papers providing an overview and synthesis of  existing theoretical and empirical work on key topics associated  with the study of political parties and elections in established  democracies.  A second set of participants will write papers  focussing on similar themes from the perspective of newer  democracies.  The conference objective is to integrate these sets  of papers to develop a broad understanding of democratic systems  that includes established and emerging democracies.",
