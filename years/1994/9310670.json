 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognition of the importance of multiagent coordination has  mounted over recent years, to the degree that it has now assumed a  genuine sense of urgency.  In the engineering literature, attempts  have been made to address this issue in areas as varied as  multiuser information theory, the theory of distributed estimation  and detection, and decentralized control.  Economists have also had  a long standing concern with these issues.  Coordination of  distributed means, desires and information using market mechanisms  is a central area of economic research.  Computer scientists  working on distributed computing also have begun to address  coordination issues over the past decade.  A glance at any popular  science magazine will reveal the increasingly distributed nature of  information in today's world and the timeliness of addressing this  trend intelligently.  In particular, it is of considerable  importance to combine ideas form such diverse areas as engineering,  economics and computational sciences, and fashion them into a  coherent theory of coordination.      The proposed work on multiagent coordination theory can be roughly  classified as (i) establishing fundamental bounds on the costs of  enabling coordination, (ii) understanding the optimal mechanisms of  coordination, and (iii) investigation aggregation methods for  situations where large numbers of agents are involved in the  coordination task.",
