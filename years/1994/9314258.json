 "awd_abstract_narration": "The creation of error-free software of any sort is a notoriously  difficult activity.  For real-time software systems, which must interact with  the world in a timely fashion, the difficulties are even greater.  Since these  systems are often used in safety-critical  applications, it is especially  important that they be correct.  The objective of this project is to create  tools for the automated verification of various correctness properties of  real-time programs.  The goal is to guarantee rather than to test these properties   probabilistically.  Therefore, the development of formal models and analysis  techniques is a major part  of this research. This project defines  techniques for controlling the state space explosion problem in  reachability-based real-time analysis.  Several techniques of this kind have  been defined for (untimed) concurrency analysis.  These techniques have yielded  excellent experimental results, for instance, in the case of Petri-net-based  deadlock detection in Ada programs.  This project extends existing  techniques for concurrency analysis to real-time analysis and defines new  techniques for reducing state space size for real-time programs. The   product is a set of software tools for the verification of real-time programs  These tools would answer timing and other queries about programs written in a  high level  language, using the program source code and information about the  timing properties of the underlying hardware.",
