 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312695  Azam         This is a joint research proposal (F. Azam and H.  Ducklow,  co-PIs) to perform quantitative studies on the  significance of bacteria in mediating and regulating  biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in the Arabian  Sea, as a component of the US JGOFS Arabian Sea Process  Study.  We propose a program of core measurements to  quantify carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes as well as  mechanistic studies to understand the response of the  bacteria-mediated processes to dramatic changes in many  primary production that occur regularly due to monsoonal  reversals in the Arabian Sea.  The JGOFS core measurements  will include bacterial abundance and biomass, bacterial  production (by both 3H thymidine and 3H leucine  incorporation methods), DOC, POC and PN.  Our research is  design, further, to address two key questions concerning  microbial heterotrophic  processes identified by US JGOFS:  1) How do the community structures which occur during the  oligotrophic vs eutrophic periods differentially impact  carbon storage and export fluxes?  2) Does the decomposition  of sinking particles slow down in the suboxic zone and  result in enhanced vertical flux though this layer?  We  hypothesize that sequential occurrence of highly eutrophic  and oligotrophic productivity regimes creates a uniquely  robust microbial loop during the oligotrophic period at the  expense of slow-to-degrade DOM which accumulates during the  eutrophic period.  We  predict that the strong dominance of  the microbial loop renders the oligotrophic period net-  heterotrphic and this has implications for spatial and  temporal patterns of carbon oxidation and exchange.  The  'stored' DOC may also support high bacterial carbon demand  (higher than would be supported by particle flux)  below the  mixed layer following shoaling of the pycnocline.  A second  hyothesis we wish to test is that sinking particles in the  surface waters are rapidly solubilized by hydrolytic  ectoenzymes of colonizing bacteria but t he enzymatic  solubilization is greatly reduced in the suboxic layer  resulting in much slower depth-dissipation of POC.",
