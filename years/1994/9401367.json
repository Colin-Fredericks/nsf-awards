More  precisely, he plans to work on the mathematical foundations of  topological sigma model-quantum cohomology theory, to use  topological sigma model invariants to study Calabi-Yau manifolds  and surfaces of general type, to continue to work on symplectic  extremal rays and symplectomophisms, in particular, degenerate  fixed points of exact symplectomorphisms.       Topological properties are special properties that  remain unchanged under the small deformation of objects that the  investigator studies.  Studying topological properties in all  branches of mathematics has been in the center of mathematics for  the past century.  This project studies some topological  properties arising from mathematical physics, in particular, from  string theory.  But those topological properties are not ordinary  topological phenomenon known before.  They belong to a new kind  of topological theory-Symplectic topology, which the investigator  believes will provide much better understanding both for topology  theory and for string theory.  ***",
