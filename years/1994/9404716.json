 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. T. S. Zwier of Purdue University will investigate the   properties of gas-phase solute-solvent clusters by resonant ion-dip   infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence-dip infrared spectroscopy.  These   studies concern the solvent structure in complexes involving aromatic   molecules, conformers of biomolecules, and intramolecular H-atom   tunneling.  Among the several systems to be investigated are those of   water, methyl alcohol, chloroform, hydrogen chloride, methane, and   acetylene as the solvent species for benzene.  Additional studies focus   on the conformations of aromatic amino acids, their analogs, and their   solvent-containing clusters, and on tropolone and several of its   derivatives in which the H-atom tunneling reactions of the   intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded hydrogen atoms play a role.      Weak intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that involve a   hydrogen atom are known as hydrogen-bonding forces.  These play a   significant role in defining the shape and conformation of especially   large biomolecules and the association of molecules into cluster   aggregates.  Gas phase clusters provide an important testing ground for   theories aimed at understanding the hydrogen bond and its consequences.    The importance and complexity of water and the alcohols has prompted much   experimental and theoretical work on their gas phase clusters.     Experimental data on the variations of cluster properties with cluster   size are sparse and are needed to test theoretical models.   In the   condensed phase the interaction between solute and solvent must consider   both the disruption of the solvent's structure imposed by the solute   molecule and site-specific attractions and repulsions between solvent and   solute molecules.  The present research will serve to obtain a better   understanding of these problems in physical chemistry.",
