 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454715  Manning    The school networking project \"Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh\" has  begun to create a networked educational environment in the  Pittsburgh Public Schools.  The project has highlighted a number of  research questions involving the issues of student usage, community  access, teacher enhancement, institutionalization, dissemination  and content.  It is proposed to extend \"Common Knowledge:  Pittsburgh\" with the formation of a new Urban Research Laboratory  in which these questions can be thoroughly addressed.    The Urban Research Laboratory involves \"Common Knowledge:  Pittsburgh,\" the Pittsburgh Public Schools, and a set of affiliated  institutions which include vendors, universities and other school  districts.  Each of the participants in the Laboratory's activities  helps to address one or more of the research questions mentioned  above.    Project activities within the Urban Research Laboratory are  identified through a competitive process in the school district and  are carried out in classrooms of the Pittsburgh Public Schools.   Typical projects use the wide area network connectivity provided by  \"Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh\" to access remote resources or  facilitate collaborations with groups outside the school classroom.    The same connectivity provides the thread which binds the three  groups which contribute to the activities of the Urban Research  Laboratory.    \"Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh\" is itself a collaborative effort,  with technical support provided through the Pittsburgh  Supercomputing Center, assessment support and project management  through the University of Pittsburgh, and educational support from  the Pittsburgh Public Schools.",
