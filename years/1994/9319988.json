The symposium focuses on integration of engineering and  clinical expertise in developing devices that restore  function for individuals with motor impairments; to expedite  the transference of neural prostheses from the engineering  laboratory to the clinic and manufacturing industry; and to  educate young researchers.  The international scientific  meeting is the fourth in a series of conferences held every  three years.  Sessions to be held include neural prostheses  for lower extremity, upper extremity, bladder, and  respiratory; electrodes, leads, and connectors; muscle and  muscle properties; feedback control strategies; command  control; and technology transfer.    Presenter participants in the symposium are world leaders in  neural prostheses for motor control.  Funding requested from  the NSF would provide partial support for invited  participants.  Four papers will be submitted for peer  reviewed journal publication by symposium participants,  thereby making symposium results available to a large  audience.  ***",
