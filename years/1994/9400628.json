 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400628  Scholtz       Spread spectrum (SS) communications, once a military approach  to jam-tolerant modulation design, is now being considered  seriously for commercial purposes.  The typical military design,  using a form of SS modulation called code-division multiple access  (CDMA), requires that each multiple access channel be assigned a  distinct spreading code that makes a user's transmission look like  wide-band noise to a receiver attempting to listen to another  user's transmission.  This noise, called multiple access noise, is  generated in the receiver's correlator, and is related to the cross  correlation properties of the signals employed by different users.  It is a primary limitation to the multiple access system's  capacity.  Recently research has been directed toward a common code  multiple access (CCMA) system in which all of the users employ the  same wideband noise like carrier which is repeated every baud  interval.  Signals are separated at the receiver simply by their  arrival times, because wide bandwidth signals have inherently a  high time of arrival resolution capability.  Hence two signals that  are present at the same time do not catastrophically interfere  (collide) with each other, unless their baud clocks are aligned to  within the reciprocal of the common wideband carrier's bandwidth.   If matched filter (correlation) reception is used in this  environment ,then the system suffers degradation caused by both  multiple access noise and collisions.  In contrast to matched  filter reception, inverse filter reception nearly eliminates  multiple access noise in the receiver at the cost of a small  delay (a few baud times) in the receiver.  Inverse filters have  been developed primarily for RADAR applications.  One recent paper  has proposed common code modulation with inverse filtering as a  receiver.  The objective of this project is to determine if CCMA  systems with inverse filtering as a receiver component are  competitive with or superior to traditional CDMA syst ems.  Particular attention will be given to: (a) the tradeoff between the  residual multiple access noise and processing delay in an inverse  filter receiver, (b) signal design optimization, (c) the effects of  multipath and impulsive noise on common code receiver design and  system capacity, and (d) approaches to hybridizing CDMA matched  filter systems with common code inverse filter systems to obtain a  system that has the stronger points of each modulation.  Potential  payoffs include increased system capacity because of multiple  access noise elimination, reduced power control requirements, and  simpler central receivers, all in a system architecture with  complexity comparable to current designs.  If the payoffs turn to  be real, a new paradigm for multiple access design will result.  ***",
