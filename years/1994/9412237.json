 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412237  Wine              This four year program will involve continuing research aimed  at elucidating the kinetics and reaction mechanisms which control  the atmospheric oxidation of sulfur compounds, with particular  emphasis oxidation pathways for dimethylsulfide (CH3 \\SCH3, DMS).   The goals of the program is the definitive determination of the  rates and mechanisms for conversion of reduced sulfur compounds to  relatively stable S(IV and S(VI) and products such as sulfur  dioxide (SO2), sulfuric acid (H2S04), sulfoxides, sulfones and  sulfonic acids.  Direct, \"real time\" observations of reactive  intermediates and stable end products is emphasized because only  through such observations can results with a unique interpretation  be obtained.  The research will contribute significantly to our  understanding of the global sulfur cycle, thus facilitating  accurate assessment of the contribution of both biogenic and  anthropogenic sulfur to such problems as climate modification (or  regulation), visibility reduction, and acid precipitation.   Specific experimental investigations will focus on DMS, DMS  adducts, DMSO (CH3SOCH3), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and S03 H2)  adducts.         The experimental methodology will involve coupling radical  generation by laser flash photolysis with a number of time-resolved  detection techniques including pulsed laser induced fluorescence,  atomic resonance fluorescence, UV-visible absorption using both  incoherent and laser light sources, infrared tunable diode laser  absorption, photoionization mass spectrometry, and resonance  enhanced multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry.  In these  mechanistic studies, th ability to obtain time-resolved data on 10-  7-10-3 s time scales is critical to defining the detailed reaction  sequences leading to product formation.         The investigators will, of course, keep abreast of progress in  other laboratories and new developments in the area of tropospheric  chemistry, and may alter their sub-tasks somewhat to accomm odate  newly identified research needs.   ***",
