 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404701  Nawrocki    The comparison of wetland hydrological functions in headwaters of  the Mississippi (USA) and the Volga (Russia) could provide us with  credible information how alternative management strategies impact  runoff, peak flow and water quality under changing climate.  The  macro scale \"field experiment\" in both areas, having close natural  similarity, is already on the way.  Wetland conservation vs  drainage is now the prevailing policy in Upper Mississippi basin.   Economic problems in Russia do not let this policy to become a  priority.  Peat mining, reservoir construction on lowlands and  drainage for farming and private gardening are common.    The project will focus on problems, how the extent and positioning  of wetlands affect runoff and peak flow; what is the role of  wetlands for diffuse pollution prevention and sediment deposition;  what are the relationships between distribution of wetlands, other  land uses and flood risk, water quality under variable climate  conditions; how to determine criteria for wetland conservation in  headwaters, ensuring environmental sustainability and  multiobjective resources use.  Assessments of wetland functions  will be based on hydrological models, GIS and remote sensing.   Integrated comparative analysis of representative watersheds in  both basins will be performed.  Procedures for scaling information  from local to regional level will be developed.      The objectives of the research planning stage (1 year) are to  conduct feasibility studies of available hydrological models, and  their sensitivity analysis; to select the methodology for wetland  impact assessment, combining modeling and GIS; to implement the  search and analysis of scattered multi disciplinary sources of  data; to develop procedures to fill the detected data gaps and to  convert heterogeneous formats into a set of input data, compatible  with the selected methodology; to prepare the subsequent research  proposal for the full scale project.    The full scale project  (3 years) will be aimed at the development  of a multi layered hierarchical base of GIS data for headwater  watersheds of the Mississippi and the Volga; comparative analysis  of wetland impacts on hydrology of the rivers; obtaining the  relationships between natural and human induced factors of wetland  functions under climate change and variable strategies of wetland  conservation; defining criteria and thresholds for wetland system  stability with regard to flood risk and water quality; outlining  recommendations for wetland management in the headwaters.",
