The proposal originates from the Biology  Department at Illinois Eastern Community Colleges, a two-year,  publicly-supported college in southeastern Illinois. The students  served by IECC and the Biology Department are largely from rural  areas, having attended high schools where science programs are  limited by a lack of funds and instructional resources. Since class  sizes are often very small, many local high schools are often  hardpressed to provide fulltime science faculty. As a result, the  community college system provides the first opportunity many rural  students have to become familiarized with investigative science and  more sophisticated scientific tools & methods. The proposed  laboratory improvement project is designed to change students'  perception of science as simply a succession of \"cookbook  experiments\" and allow them to explore, in depth, a key scientific  issue - the significance of phytoplankton (commonly referred to as  algae), in the ecosystem. The addition of a modern culture  incubator system in the college's laboratory will provide the  vehicle for supporting this investigative approach to undergraduate  science.",
