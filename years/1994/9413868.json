 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is sought acquire computer equipment to enable the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis  University (SLU) to expand the accessibility and number of products available from UNIDATA for both teaching and research.   The proposal requests a UNIX server and several UNIX workstations.  The additional equipment would expand student  access to UNIX-based workstations with X-windows capabilities.  Presently only one UNIX terminal is available and it is  five years old.  Moving to a UNIX environment would allow an expanded use of several very capable UNIX-based UNIDATA  software packages.  PC-based (OS/2)  software packages are used extensively at SLU for many teaching and research  applications.  However, the upgrade path for PC-based UNIDATA   software appears limited and the use of PC-based application packages will be phased out in favor of the UNIX platforms.   The requested equipment upgrade will provide us the opportunity to more fully integrate UNIDATA software into the SLU  curriculum and expand student experience with new technology and software.",
