 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408900  Ho  The plant hormone, gibberellin (GA), exerts regulatory roles in  several important physiological and developmental processes such as  seed germination and post-germination growth, stem elongation and  flower induction.  Gibberellin and another hormone, abscisic acid  (ABA), are known to regulate the synthesis and secretion of several  enzymes which are responsible for the utilization of nutrients  stored in cereal grains.  The most abundant among these enzymes are  the starch-degrading alpha-amylases and the storage protein-  degrading proteinases.  As the continuation of long term effort in  elucidating the mode of action of these two plant hormones, the  effect of hormones on the coordinated expression of alpha-amylase  and protease genes will be studied in the aleurone layers of  germinating barley seeds.  Specifically it is planned to: 1)  analyze the cis-acting elements in the protease promoter that are  responsible for hormonal regulation, 2) investigate how GA and ABA  regulate the level/activity of this DNA binding protein, and 3)  isolate and characterize cDNA clones for \"early\" GA-induced genes  whose expression has been suggested to be important for later  alpha-amylase and proteinase expression.  It is hoped that the  information obtained in this proposed project will contribute to  our understanding of the molecular action of these hormones on gene  regulation in plants.  ***",
