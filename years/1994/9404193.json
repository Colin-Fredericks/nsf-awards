 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, develops  computational methods for the study of Born Oppenheimer breakdown in excited electronic  states, and their application to the study of photochemical pathways.  Methods using analytic  energy derivatives for multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) wavefunctions are  employed to locate low energy surface crossings and avoided crossings.  The theory is applied  to the study of spin-forbidden, non-adiabatic processes relevant to gas lasers and atmospheric  chemistry such as photodissociation of ozone, at wavelengths below 310 nm, to produce both  singlet and triplet products.    The central goal of this research is the development of the quantum mechanical theory of  elementary chemical reactions of molecules in electronically excited states, usually resulting from  the absorption of light of an appropriate frequency.  An important feature of these photochemical  reactions is the fact that these excited molecules can jump from one electronic state to another  with a concomitant transfer of energy between electronic, vibrational, and translational degrees  of freedom.  This theoretical research project provides deeper insight into such molecular  processes revealed by spectroscopic and kinetic experiments.  This project develops basic  theoretical tools widely applicable to photochemical processes, in particular, to computer models  of ozone depletion in the atmosphere.",
