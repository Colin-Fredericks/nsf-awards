 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year standard grant, supported by the Chemistry and Molecular   and Cellular Biosciences Divisions, facilitates investigations into the   structure of enzymes that have been modified with polyethylene glycol.    Spectroscopic studies, including circular dichroism, uv-visible, and   electron spin resonance will be used to characterize the structure of the   modified enzymes as they exist in organic solvents.  Horseradish   peroxidase, and the related enzyme, cytochrome P 450, will be the focus   of these investigations.  These studies should permit the   characterization of enzyme intermediates that are not easily studied in   aqueous environments, due to their extremely short lifetimes, and will   allow enzymes to be used for targeted synthesis in organic solvents.    Professor Mabrouk and her students will characterize the structure of   enzymes that have been modified with polymers, which allow for   stabilization of these species in organic solvents.   One of the enzymes   to be characterized in this study, cytochrome P 450, is an important   partner in the biochemical pathway for conversion of oxygen to carbon   dioxide. The implications of this research include the ability to   characterize normally inaccessible intermediate structures, and the   development of viable commercial catalysis methods based on enzyme   chemistry.",
