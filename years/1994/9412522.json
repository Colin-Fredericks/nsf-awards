 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just before World War II, Robert Merton wrote in his doctoral  thesis that the scientific revolution in England was accepted  because of the rise of the Puritan ethic.  Merton noted that  Puritanism itself was neither a sufficient nor a strictly necessary  condition for the rise of the new science since \"other functionally  equivalent ideological movements could have served to provide the  emerging science with widely acknowledged claims to legitimacy.\"   This \"Merton thesis\" has been widely debated since he first  presented it.  By implication, the thesis argues that the  acceptance of the new science was dependant upon the rise of  protestantism.  This thesis gains weight in light of the  condemnation of Galileo after he published his Dialogue between the  Two Chief World Systems.  A number of scholars have examined the  acceptance of the new science among Protestants.  Few have examined  its acceptance among Catholics.    Dr. Harris, under this grant, is completing a study of another  group which was, he argues, a \"functionally equivalent ideological  movement\" to Puritanism.  This group was the Society of Jesus, i.e.  the Jesuits of the Catholic Church.  He has found remarkable  parallels between teachings and research by Jesuit and Protestant  scientists during the period of the triumph of the new science.   These results lead to several questions:  why and how were these  developments in the Catholic Church ignored?  Was the religious  situation during the Scientific Revolution much more complex than  the Merton thesis allows?  Rather than focusing on the theological  or ecclesiastical differences that distinguish and separate  Protestant from Catholic, should we not look to the deep  institutional parallels and common methods that religious leaders  of various movements used in their struggle to instill a \"Christian  way of life\" in their followers?  By answering these questions,  this study promises to make significant new contributions to our  understanding of the historical relationshi p of science and  religion.",
