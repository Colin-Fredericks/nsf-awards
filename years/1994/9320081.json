 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320081  Granger  In the past decade policy makers have become increasingly  concerned with the environmental and atmospheric consequences of  the deforestation of the world's tropical forests.   Unfortunately, high level decision-makers have had very little  hard data with which to form their policies regarding the  utilization of forest resources.  This project intends to use a  newly available economic and ecological dataset for the Amazon  region in Brazil to analyze the long-run economic and  environmental consequences of various forestry-related activities  under a variety of regimes.  On of the major issues to be  analyzed is how the presence of roads or the existence of land  tenure programs may influence the long-run effects that forestry  activities have on the economy and ecology of a region.  By  providing a better understanding of how many factors interact  over time to affect both the environment and the economy, this  study would provide policy makers with valuable information and  contribute to the effort to balance human economic need with  environmental concerns.  ***",
