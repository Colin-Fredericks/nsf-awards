This agreement will facilitate the  continuing development, promotion, and implementation of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, with special emphasis on integrating and synthesizing its various parts, and to broaden ARCSS so that it involves other presently neglected areas such as the human aspect of global change.  ARCUS will work to increase communication among arctic researchers, academic institutions, federal agencies, and logistical field facilities and projects; to inform policy-makers, funding sources (federal agencies, private foundations, corporate bodies), and educators on the need, opportunities, and benefits in arctic research; and to improve offerings and programs in arctic science education.  ARCUS will facilitate an Arctic Week, combining several of these activities to increase participation of all interested arctic groups and individuals, to foster interdisciplinary exchanges and to make the most effective use of available resources.",
