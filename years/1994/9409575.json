 "awd_abstract_narration": "The needs of many application domains are not met by current  database system technology.  Relational database systems (RDBMSs)  excel at providing high-level, associative (i.e., query-based)  access to large sets of flat records.  Object-oriented database  systems (OODBMSs) on the other hand, provide more powerful data  modelling capabilities, but primarily support navigation-based  access to the data.  The goal of this research is to develop  flexible workstation/server database systems which can dynamically  adapt to the requirements of a wide range of applications, allowing  those applications to exploit database capabilities and benefit  from the continuing rapid gains in workstation and local area  network price/performance.  Such database systems will be able to  adaptively choose between query-oriented and navigation-oriented  strategies based on both compile-time and runtime considerations.   The approach taken will be to extend the techniques that have been  recently developed for navigation-oriented OODBMSs to co-exist with  techniques from the more traditional query-oriented (relational)  approach.   To achieve this end, however, will require significant  work in performance modeling and analysis, the development of new  data management algorithms and new query optimization techniques,  and the resolution of numerous database systems architecture  issues.  The results of this project will include analyses of the  tradeoffs between data-shipping and query-shipping, algorithms for  cache maintenance, query optimization, and memory management, and  detailed performance analyses based on simulation and  implementation of these new techniques.",
