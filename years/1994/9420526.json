A pool of qualified engineers is critical to the success of remediation strategies and waste management.  However, current remediation engineering practice and teaching lags for behind the results of recent and current research.   To improve the implementation of research developments in design practice, we propose to develop a new lecture course and a mesoscale laboratory facility for training undergraduate and graduate engineering students in in-situ groundwater/soil remediation technologies.  The lecture course will feature a participatory learning environment with remediation case studeis being provided by industry and national laboratory participants as a supplement to the lecture materials.  The laboratory facility will contain equipment for experimentation at a range of scales (one-dimensional bench-scale to three-dimensional mesoscale systems)  with a mesoscale apparatus being the centerpiece of the facility.  The experiments conducted in the mesoscale apparatus will be representative of field conditions, but will not have the problems inherent in field-scale experiments such as high costs, long clean up times, and lack of control.  The facility will be integrated into existing and new, undergraudate and graduate curricula, and will realize direct benefits from ongoing and planned research activities.  The educational activities in the proposed facility will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of investigators, bringing expertise from Chemical, Environmental, and Geological Engineering.  These courses will be offered in the three participating departments (Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Geological Engineering), and will draw from at least 250 senior-level engineering and  50 graduate students in the three departments.  At least 75 students, from the three engineering departments will participate in this new curriculum each year.  In addition, about 30 minority high school or undergraduate students and one minority faculty will be involved in laboratory activities each year.  This project will yield graduate engineers that are better able to apply fundamental research developments to in situ remediation strategies, design more effective and efficient treatment systems, and deal with complex, interdisciplinary problems.  The facility itself, in conjunction with the educational activities, will lead to further advancements in the application of remediation research to real world problems.  ***",
