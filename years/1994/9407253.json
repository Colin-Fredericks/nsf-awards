This research asks two general questions:  What is the engineering design of propulsion systems in fishes in  terms of the skeleton, muscles, and tendons? And what patterns of  change have occurred in the design of fishes' bodies throughout  evolutionary history? The approach used to address these  questions is a combination of anatomy, video analysis, computer  modeling, and modern techniques of studying evolution. This  combined approach will reveal the mechanics and history of two  locomotor systems in fishes: side-to-side locomotion by the tail  and the rowing mode of propulsion with the paired fins.       The fishes to be studied in this project are fishes of the  family Labridae, which are one of the most diverse species  radiations in the oceans of the world. Labrid fishes use multiple  locomotor strategies, and they vary in their use of drag-based  and lift-based fin locomotion. A central goal of this research is  to develop and test computer models of the mechanics  (transmission of force and motion) of the swimming behavior of  fishes. Computer models will   use data on anatomical design to  establish the geometric relations between muscle contractions and  transmission of force to the fins that cause forward thrust.  These prediction are tested by measuring swimming in live fishes  using high-speed video analysis.       The significance of this research is that it will design  features of aquatic locomotion for which no complete mechanical  understanding exists. Mechanical testing of fish swimming may  provide practical information for application to bio-engineering.  Labrid fishes are indicators of biodiversity on tropical coral  reefs, and further understanding of their behavior and function  will contribute to our knowledge of high diversity ecosystems.  this project will culminate by tracing the evolutionary changes  in locomotor mechanics onto hypotheses of labrid evolutio n.  ***",
