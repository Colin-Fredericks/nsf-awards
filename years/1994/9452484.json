 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both teaching and research in plant biology are improved by  providing students with opportunities for investigative experiences  in the areas of plant ecology and physiology. In the required  introductory plant biology course, students measure the effects of  environmental variation. Research-based laboratory modules enhance  students' knowledge of physiological processes and of scientific  inquiry. Advanced ecology students study the importance of  environmental variation on primary production in lakes of  contrasting water quality. Experiments designed by ecology students  test hypotheses concerning the effects of environmental variation  on plant structure, and research projects may involve collaborative  studies in plant physiology, ecology, and molecular biology.  Students also gain an understanding of plant processes affected by  environmental variation; an improved ability to design, execute,  and interpret experiments; and an increased appreciation of the  role of plants in ecological systems.",
