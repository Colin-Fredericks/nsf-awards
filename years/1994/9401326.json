 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401326  Shoureshi    Electric power source has a major impact on the overall electric  power distribution on a national level.  The optimal process of  energy generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization  directly impacts economics of every industry.  An  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced  Control of Energy and Power Systems at Purdue University could  provide a better mechanism to stimulate industrial innovation in  the development of new technologies in the advanced control system  or methods for energy and power systems.    A number of companies have committed to support this effort.   Currently there are seven sponsors for the Center committing  approximately $400,000.    The Principal Investigators are internationally recognized  scientists who have the resources and capability to run this  Center.    The Program Manager recommends Purdue University be awarded $50,000  for the first year of a five-year continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:   1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
