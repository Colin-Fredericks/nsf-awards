The mechasism is an intensive 3 week summer session in which 25 7th and 8th  grade girls from rural areas (Isle of Wight and Charles City counties) reside at CNU during the  week.      The girls will participate in projects in biology, chemistry, computer science, math, engineering,  and physics, all of which relate to the theme of living spaces.  There will be almost no lecture -  - the girls will actually learn by doing:  for living in the home, they will study electricity and  build circuits; for living in the community, they will study the environment and measure  greenhouse gases; and, for living in space, they will visit the Richmond Math and Science  Center, and experiment with being scientists in a simulated control lab, as well as being  astronauts in (simulated) space.  In addition to doing SEM activities, the girls will learn about  themselves and about careers in science through off-site visits and through guest speakers.   Contact will be maintained with the girls after they leave through email, and with two visits  during the next school year.  ***",
