 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404949  Tarn     The objective of this project is the design and experimental study of a dual-robot assembly workcell based on the event-based planning and control method developed at Washington University.  The workcell will be able to perform various coordinated/cooperated assembly tasks and capable of automatic response to some unexpected events such as the occurrence of obstacles or the misplacement of parts.  Several problems related to fundamental computer and robotic engineering need to be solved to achieve the above stated goal.  The focus of the work will be on the following specific problems: (1) Integration of sensed event with the action planning and control of robotic manufacturing system, and (2) Develop a computing and control architecture and computational algorithm to experimentally implement the event-based action planning and control method for dual-robot assembly workcell.     The proposed research project is aimed (1) to elevate dual-robot assembly workcell to a new level of task performance capabilities and (2) to reduce the down-time of robotic workstations in various application environments.  ***",
