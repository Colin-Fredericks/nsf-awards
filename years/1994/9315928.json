Specific research objectives include (i) the  continued scrutiny of the highly regulated PEPC-kinase signal-  transduction chain by in situ studies with intact C4 and CAM plants  using an integrated biochemical, immunological and/or molecular-  genetic approach, and the further elucidation of the complex C4  PEPC-kinase signal-transduction chain by in situ studies with  intact C4-mesophyll cells and protoplasts.  The outcome of these  objectives could strongly affect our basic understanding of the  regulation of PEPC activity by L-malate, the negative allosteric  effector.  Conversely, project (ii) will focus on the opposing  control of C4/CAM PEPC activity exerted by positive phosphorylated  effectors (e.g., glucose 6-P, triose-P) by mapping this activator  binding domain with photoaffinity-labeling and site-directed  mutagenesis techniques.  Finally, project (iii) will critically  assess the possible regulatory phosphorylation of nonphotosynthetic  PEPC in leaves and root-nodules from C3 plants by integrative in  vivo (detached leaves and nodules), in situ (intact leaf  protoplasts), and in vitro (isolated PEPC and PEPC-kinase)  analysis.  Results from these three projects will not only  delineate important details of the control of C4- and CAM-  photosynthesis, and details of general C/N metabolism in plants at  the level of cytosolic PEPC, but at the same time will provide much  needed insight into enzyme regulation in higher plants by  reversible protein phosphorylation.  %%%  This project is focused on the posttranslational regulation of the  carbon dioxide (CO2)-fixing enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  (PEPC) in higher plants.  While this enzyme is best known for its  role in CO2 fixation during C4 photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid  metabolism (CA M) in crops as maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and  pineapple (CAM), it also functions in general plant carbon/nitrogen  metabolism.  Besides these important physiological and functional  considerations, the PEPC enzyme represents one of the few well-  known examples in higher plants of an enzyme that is controlled by  the opposing action of a protein phosphatase and a protein-serine  kinase.  Consequently, this complex regulatory phosphorylation  cycle forms the central focus of many of our present studies.   Understanding about how the cycle operates is important in  regulation of CO2 assimilation and in plant metabolism in general.   It can form the basis for biotechnological engineering of plants to  improve growth and productivity.   This project is supported jointly by Metabolic Biochemistry  Program, MCB and the Plant Integrative Biology Program, IBN.  ***",
