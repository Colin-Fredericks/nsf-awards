The graduate  student, Ms. Juanita Urban-Rich, will carry out oceanographic  research in cooperation with faculty of the University of Tromso and  the University of Bergen, Norway.  She will participate in a series  of research cruises off Northern Norway related to two major  Norwegian research programs on particle flux and the carbon cycle in  Arctic waters.  These will give her the opportunity to collect  invaluable data for her dissertation research on the contribution  made by zooplankton fecal pellets to particle flux and carbon cycles  in different geographical locations.     She will carry out experiments to measure the chemical composition  and dissolution of particulate organic carbon to dissolved organic  carbon from fecal pellets and \"marine snow\", an aggregate of organic  and inorganic detritus.  She hopes to determine whether the two forms  of detritus contribute significantly different forms of organic  carbon to abyssal waters and sediments as they decay, due possibly to  different decay rates, different composition, or differences in the  transformation of particulate to dissolved organic carbon.   These  data will be compared with data she will collect in the Arabian Sea  under other sponsorship.    Macrozooplankton fecal pellets and marine snow are important  transporters of organic carbon as well as nutrients, pollutants and  trace metals from the upper ocean layers to deep water and the  sediments.  However this contribution can take several paths and it  varies seasonally.  In addition to this contribution to vertical  flux, they are an important food source for other animals.  Increased  knowledge of the composition and fate of these organic particles  will contribute to improved models and understanding of global  biogeochemical cycles.",
