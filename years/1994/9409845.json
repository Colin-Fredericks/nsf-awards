 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiprocessor database machines, with their promise of high  availability, scalability and performance, are increasingly the  systems of choice for large applications.  Efficient resource  utilization is crucial for maximizing both a response time of  individual queries and the overall system throughout.  Resource  utilization issues include how to allocate memory to workload  components, how many and which queries to run in parallel, how to  share the system resources to improve the system performance.  We  restrict our attention to parallel shared-nothing database systems.   In our previous research, batch scheduling of the query workload  was studied.  We demonstrated that sharing low-level query  operators can provide significant savings.  In this project, we  shall perform research into the following areas: 1)  Memory  Management for Mixed Workloads.  These workloads mix simple queries  and short ad-hoc read transactions.  We shall study an incremental  memory allocation method for processing a mixed workload.  2)  Data  Placement.  For a system consisting of several hundred nodes, full  declustering can lead to a performance degradation.  Alternative  placement methods will be examined.  The proposed research will  involve both the development of algorithms for problems in these  areas and their experimental analysis using a precise simulation of  a parallel shared-nothing system.",
