 "awd_abstract_narration": "Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in quantum   dynamics.  Three areas of research are being studied: 1) wave packet   interferometry is being extended to nonlinear spectroscopy as a sensitive   method for studying highly excited states; 2) a technique is being   developed for calculating photon absorption and Raman scattering cross   sections for systems with few quantum degrees embedded in a bath of   classical ones, e.g. an electron solvated in a zeolite; and 3) a time   dependent theory is being developed for treating exciton formation and   tunneling in confined semiconductor structures, e.g. quantum wells,   wires, dots and clusters.    There are many interesting biochemical, chemical and solid state systems   in which an electron interacts with a complex environment.  The   spectroscopy of the electron connects this interaction to observable   quantities and gives us a chance to understand the underlying dynamical   mechanisms.  Furthermore the properties of electrons and holes in   confined semiconductor structures are being extensively studied in the   hope of using them in opto-electronic and tunneling devices.  Metiu will   employ the techniques of time dependent quantum mechanics to study the   behavior of electrons, holes and excitons in these systems.  This work   will help to provide useful intuitive models for the behavior of these   complex systems.",
