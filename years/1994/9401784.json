 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401784  Werner       Professor Werner proposes to continue her research in Banach  space theory and convexity theory. In convexity theory she wants  to investigate further properties of floating and illumination  bodies of convex bodies as well as their connection with affine  surface area and approximation of convex bodies by polytopes. In  Banach space theory she plans to continue her work on problems  related to the Radon Nikodym property.       A solid body is called convex in case a line segment joining  two of its points stays within the body. Convex bodies can  frequently be described as intersections of nice convex sets such  as half-planes. One of the questions considered here is whether a  convex body can be nicely approximated by convex bodies having  only a finite number of vertices. The approximation is to be good  in the sense that volumes of the approximating bodies are close  to the volume of the original body or in the sense that their  surface areas are close. The second project involves abstract  mathematics that has applications to probability theory.  ***",
