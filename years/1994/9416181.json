The  investigators  are developing models for estimating uninhabitable  dwellings from future earthquakes affecting the San Francisco Bay  Area.   This  project  takes advantage of the unique  opportunity  provided  by  the Northridge earthquake.  The investigators  will  determine  if the entire modeling process (including damage-based  intensity  mapping and dwelling unit data collection  techniques)  can  be  transferred to southern California and  to  a  different  fault mechanism (thrust vs.  strike-slip).  The project's goal is  to  examine  the effects of the Northridge earthquake on  housing  stock  and  mass care requirements to improve emergency planning,  disaster  response, and residential rebuilding efforts in  future  earthquakes either in southern California or other areas.  ***",
