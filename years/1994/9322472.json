 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,   is focused on the development of Field Flow Fractionation (FFF), a   technique based on the use of orthogonal force fields to separate large   molecules and small particles.  The analyte mixture is pumped into a   rectangular channel, and a force is applied 90 degrees relative to the   direction of flow.  In particular, this grant will explore the use of   thermal gradients and gravitational forces to effect the separation.  In   addition, analytical split flow thin cell (SPLITT) fractionation, a   method where the separation occurs along the channel width, and where   splitters are used at one or both ends of the channel, is investigated to   determine it's potential for analytical separations.  Here, the   separation is based on hydrodynamic lift forces, which allows   characterization of species based on diffusion coefficients.  These   techniques can be used to characterize a variety of biological and   synthetic materials.    This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support   research into improved methods for the separation of large molecules and   small particles using field flow fractionation.  This is a procedure   invented by Professor Giddings in which crossed force fields are used to   separate small (micron-sized) particles or molecules based on differences   in shape, density, and electrical characteristics.  This methodology will   have wide-ranging applications in the fields of biotechnology and   materials science.",
