 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405979  Champion  The proposed research will utilize resonance Raman scattering and  its time domain analog, coherent impulsive scattering, to probe  the electronic and nuclear structure/function relationships of  biological molecules such as heme proteins (myoglobin, hemoglobin  and cytochrome c) and photosynthetic systems (light harvesting  antennae and reaction centers).  Related techniques, such as  electronic absorption and infrared spectroscopy, will also be  utilized, and theoretical models that link a variety of  experimental measurements will be developed.  Absolute cross-  section measurements will be used to directly extract the  electron-nuclear coupling strengths while the temperature  dependence of the optical absorption lineshape yields the  coupling of low frequency motion and its role in damping.  The  studies of low frequency protein motion will be complemented with  ultrafast impulsive scattering techniques, which allow real time  measurement of such motion.  Further experimental and theoretical  studies involving the spectroscopic and kinetic effects of  protein distributions are also proposed.  Dynamic studies will  include the measurement and analysis of ligand binding and  electron transfer under a wide variety of sample conditions, as  well as pump/probe experiments designed to monitor protein  folding and conformational relaxations.  Laser mediated thermal  perturbations will be followed using Stokes/anti-Stokes Raman  scattering.  Studies of dynamic processes induced by  photoreduction and kinetic studies of biological single crystals  will also be extended.  %%%  The general scientific objectives are to achieve a better  understanding of the dynamics of motion of large biologically  important molecules and their absorption and resonant light  scattering properties.  The aim is to apply this knowledge to  elucidate their mechanism of action.  These studies are  significant not only in their relationship to the biological  sciences, but also in their connection to our u nderstanding of  the interaction of light with complex material systems in the  condensed phase.  ***",
