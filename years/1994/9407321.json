 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407321  Brautigan    This grant will provide partial support for the third FASEB summer conference on Protein  Phosphatases.  Research on protein phosphatases is proceeding at a brisk pace, revealing the  fundamental importance and unexpected complexity of these enzymes in the signal transduction  pathways that govern cell growth, structure and metabolism.  Within the past year dozens of new  phosphatases and phosphatase regulatory subunits have been cloned.  Now there is appreciation  that protein phosphatases initiate important intracellular events such as G2 to M progression in  the cell cycle.  Particular phosphatases already have been identified as the targets for natural  toxins such as microcystius and cantharidin.  Like other FASEB summer conferences this meeting  will select about 150 participants from applications, including representatives from industry and  academia, including senior scientists, postdocs, and graduate students.  There is a constant  infusion of new researchers into this area and the 1994 conference will be important for a  focused, yet comprehensive, introduction to the genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology of protein  phosphatases.  The conference will consist of eight sessions, each with a discussion leader and  four speakers who will be selected from investigators that have made important recent  contributions.  In addition, two poster sessions will be organized, with published abstracts.  At  the prior conference on this subject more than eighty posters were presented for two days, each  providing an important format for scientific exchanges.  Inclusion of women, minorities, and  students as speakers and participants is a special priority.  The 1994 summer conference on  Protein Phosphatases will orient new researchers, disseminate current information and identify  areas for investigations.  ***",
