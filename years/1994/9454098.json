 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hydrological cycle is the most fundamental of all earth system  cycles, linking together the solid earth, the oceans, and the  atmosphere.  The endless cycling of water through these earth  system components yields interactions over the full spectrum of  spatial-temporal scales.  Only recently has the picture emerged  that the two-way nature of these interactions has profound impacts  on climate, weather, biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics.   The view that hydrological processes simultaneously affect and are  affected by physical, chemical, and biological processes, in all  compartments of the earth system, provides the framework for a  multi-disciplinary GRT program in hydrological sciences at UT  Austin.  With this educational and research theme, we hope to  impart to our students the scientific underpinnings which are  currently absent from traditional hydrology programs, while  cultivating a pool of scientific talent to provide long-term  leadership in the field of hydrology.  Given the recent addition of  new hydrology faculty in the Department of Geological Sciences,  including state-of-the-art analytical and computer modeling  facilities, combined with existing hydrological strength in the  department-affiliated Bureau of Economic Geology, the Institute for  Geophysics, and the Center for Space Research, as well as in the  Department of Civil Engineering, a critical mass now exists so that  truly unique, interdisciplinary research and education initiatives  can be launched under the unifying theme of a GRT program in  hydrology-earth system interactions.  Our GRT program includes a  number of structural innovations, including collaborative  arrangements with federal research organizations, progressive new  course offerings, teaching effectiveness seminars for fellows,  teaching opportunities for fellows involving advanced technology  applications in the classroom, and opportunities for fellows to  mentor undergraduates in a local \"partnership\" institution.   Recruitment pl ans include a consortial arrangement with the local  partnership institution, a department-sponsored seminar forum and  endowed lectureships, and an outreach program to regional Texas  colleges with large Hispanic or African-American enrollments.",
