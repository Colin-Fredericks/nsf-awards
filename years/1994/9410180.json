 "awd_abstract_narration": "Routine, time-consuming, and repetitive information processing  tasks performed by employees in organizations can be potentially  automated.  Possible benefits from automation include relieving  employees to concentrate on relatively fruitful and productive  jobs, and in improving the quality of work by eliminating human  errors that are inadvertently introduced due to the tedious nature  of work.         A candidate task for automation is that of scheduling meetings  between individuals.  Though past efforts have produced necessary  techniques for building distributed agents that can schedule  meetings on behalf of associated users, much work remains to be  done in encoding user goals and constraints before a useful system  can be implemented.  The proposed research will produce an  efficient implemented system that effectively schedules meetings  without compromising user preferences and constraints.  This will  fill a void in the currently available calendar management  software.         This research will involve developing a language and inference  procedure to specify and reason about user preferences, building  models of agents from limited information, and developing  negotiation mechanisms to coordinate partially cooperative agents.   A unique contribution of this research lies in developing  intelligent agents that are adaptive to the environmental demands  and the needs of associated users at the same time.  These  techniques will be a significant contribution to the evolving field  of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, and can be gainfully  applied in fields like Cooperative Information Systems and Computer  Supported Cooperative Work.",
