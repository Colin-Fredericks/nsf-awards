 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319955  Rudwick  Modern analyses of the practice of scientific research have  generally focussed on laboratory work.  But much scientific  knowledge is (and has been) produced in two other locations, namely  in the field and in museums.  Understanding how scientific research  generates reliable knowledge would be enhanced by closer study of  such non-laboratory settings.  Historical studies are particularly  important because they help distinguish intrinsic--or at least  long-term--features of the process from those that contingently  characterize our present moment in history.  Dr. Rudwick is  consequently undertaking a study of a major development in the  history of science for which the original research took place  almost entirely in the field and in museums, not in laboratories.   Specifically, he is examining what he has called the \"discovery of  time.\"    Three centuries ago, a cosmic history totalling a few thousand  years seemed so obviously reasonable that is was simply taken for  granted by almost all educated people.  It has been replaced by one  in which the age of the universe, and indeed of the earth, is  routinely estimated in billions of years.  This revolution in  perspective should be considered, however, not primarily as a mere  expansion of the timescale, but rather in terms of a reconstruction  of an unexpectedly long and complex history of nature, in which  human beings turn out to have been relative newcomers.  Learning  how to make such a reconstruction was largely worked out by  geologists during a mere half-century, a period equivalent to no  more than a single scientific lifetime.  The most decisive part of  this research was the reconstruction of geologically quite recent  history:  specifically it entailed learning how to relate recorded  human history to the far earlier periods of prehuman history.    This grant continues support for Dr. Rudwick's study on this  outstandingly important field- and museum-based scientific  research, on the basis of a detailed analys is of relevant books and  articles, correspondence, and field and museum notes.  This study  should help to deepen our understanding of how reliable scientific  knowledge is generated in settings other than that of the  laboratory.  ***",
