 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321375  Kling  This study examines how computer specialists, managers and workers'  values shape computerization projects and change working  conditions.  The key research questions are:  To what extent and  how do work values influence the selection and eevelopment of  information technologies in the workplace, and how do people  integrate these technologies into their worklives?  Research  activities include both theoretical and empirical components.   Theoretical components focus on developing an understanding of some  of the ethical implications of computerizing work and the ethical  issues faced by key participants in computerization projects.   Identification and analysis of these issues proceeds by examination  of existing case studies and participation in discussion of the  design and site selection for the empirical work as well as some of  the field interviews.  Empirical research involves surveys and  field interviews of computerized work systems in three  organizations.  The organizations will represent three ideal types  of work values:  (a) rationalization, streamlining work for  efficiency, organizing narrowly defined jobs, and computerizing so  as to reduce workers' discretion; (b) flexible professionalization,  organizing work to encourage responsibility, initiative taking and  learning, and developing computer systems to support enhanced work;  and (c) incremental accommodation, computerizing so as to support  new services or activities while minimizing the changes in work  relationships.  The investigators will refine and pilot test their  work values questionnaire in the two or three organizations  selected, and undertake initial field studies.  Results will be  disseminated through presentations and case reports. One journal  article will be developed.  ***",
