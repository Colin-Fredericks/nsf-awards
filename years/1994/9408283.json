 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408283  Wee        Freshwater, scale-covered algae called \"golden algae\" are  common throughout the world, but their taxonomic classification is  problematic and their phylogenetic relationships are poorly known.   Most collections are identified as the genus Mallomonas or as  Synura, but considerable variability hides within the bounds of  these convenient categories.  Dr. James Wee of Loyola University,  with colleagues at Tulane University and elsewhere, is addressing  this problem by studying morphological features of the siliceous  scales and cellular ultrastructure while adding significant new  data from DNA sequencing of nuclear ribosomal genes.  Mutational  differences among species in these synurophyte algae will be  assessed and used to construct likely phylogenetic trees, which in  turn can be used to evaluate changes in morphological features  employed as taxonomic discriminators.       Synurophyte species are key environmental indicators in lake  acidification studies, are associated with taste and odor causing  compounds in potable water supplies, and are used in basic  biological research on cell structure.  Reliable taxonomic  identification, stable classification, and robust phylogenetic  analysis will improve both their utility and our understanding of  their ecology and evolution.",
