These  experiences benefit biology and chemistry majors as well as science  education and nursing students.  Opportunities are created for  students to gain practical experience in techniques used in  research, diagnostics, and genetic testing.  Students  undertake  the large-scale production, isolation, and purification of DNA and  proteins from microorganisms and eukaryotic cells by using a  fermentor, high-speed centrifuge, and homogenizer, and they  characterize these molecules by polyacrylamide and agarose gel  electrophoresis. The students also explore technologies of  molecular probing by fluorescence microscopy and Southern and  Western blotting with nonradioactive probes.",
