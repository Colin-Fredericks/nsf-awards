The project aims to  explore social ecology of child development.    The Carolina Consortium involves the University of North  Carolina, North Carolina State University, and Duke University.   The Brazilian Consortium involves the University of Brasilia,  University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto, State University of  Campinas, Federal University of Pernambuco, and Federal  University of Fluminense.  Research topics in this group-to-group  interaction include the construction of semiotic means in  adult-infant interaction; cooperation and competition in  children's peer-group relations; co-constructivist analysis of  parental and teachers' roles in educational settings; life-course  analysis; and children's development of literacy in sociocultural  contexts.  All of the institutions involved in this collaborative  effort will benefit from an exchange of knowledge and  methodologies and the establishment of an organized framework  among Brazilian and U.S. developmental scientists.  ***",
