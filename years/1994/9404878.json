 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of the research proposed is to  understand how the precise arrays of different cell types  within an organism are generated.  The question will be  addressed by utilizing the legs of the Drosophila  melanogaster adult as a model system.  The leg bristle  pattern is established in part through the functions of two  genes 'hairy' and 'achaete'.  In most leg segments, achaete  is expressed in eight longitudinal stripes corresponding to  the primordia of the bristle rows.  'Hairy' is expressed in  four longitudinal stripes located between every other pair  of achaete stripes and corresponding to the primordia of  bristleless cuticle.  The periodic expression of  'achaete'  is established in part through the function of 'hairy' which  represses 'achaete' expression within its domains of  expression and defines one boundary of each 'achaete'  longitudinal stripe.  Since 'hairy' is expressed in a  spatially restricted pattern that is required for the  patterning of two different pattern elements, bristleless  and bristled cuticle, a study of the regulation of 'hairy'  expression should provide insight into the mechanisms by  which leg pattern is generated.  We will investigate both  cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms involved in the  production of the 'hairy' leg longitudinal stripes of  expression.  The cis-regulatory elements that gorvern  expression of the 'hairy' leg longitudinal stripes of  expression will be located by both transgenic and genetic  approaches.  This region will be dissected to identify the  minimal elements necessary for producing the 'hairy' leg  stripes and to determine whether the 'hairy' leg  longitudinal stripes are regulated independently or in  concert.  A comparative analysis of the 'hairy' leg cis-  regulatory elements from Drosophila melanogaster and  Drosophila virilis will be performed to identify conserved  regions that may correspond to binding sites for trans-  regulatory proteins.  The potential function of these  sequences will be tested  by a mutational analysis.  The  possible roles of the segment polarity genes in patterning  'hairy' leg expression will be investigated by monitoring  'hairy' expression in: a) leg discs homozygous mutant for  adult viable or temperature-sensitive allele segment  polarity alleles, b)  leg discs mosaic for null segment  polarity alleles produced by FLP mediated recombination, c)  leg discs misexpressing certain segment polarity genes.  In  addition a comparison of the 'hairy' leg stripes of  expression with segment polarity gene expression will be  performed.  In summary, a study of the the genetic  regulation of 'hairy' in the leg disc should be an excellent  opportunity to learn how periodicity is generated in a  cellular field and for comparison of the mechanisms for  generation of striped expression in two different  developmental fields.",
