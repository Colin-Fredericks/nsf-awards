 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361240  Dreizin       From spot welding to soldering, joining metal wires to one   another or to substrates is a major part of the assembly process   for electrical and electronic devices.  This program will develop   an entirely new method for welding such joints using filler metals.   In this novel method, 50-500 micrometer diameter monodisperse   droplets of high temperature filler metal are generated remotely   and then transported and deposited at the joint to be welded.    Since there is no direct contact between the energy source and weld   site, thermal or electrical damage to components is eliminated.    Droplet size and temperature can be controlled so that the weld can   be tailored to specific requirements.  Almost any metal can serve   as weld filler, including refractories.  Welds of copper and   aluminum wires to aluminum and silicon plates (copper or aluminum   filler) and of tungsten wires to tungsten or molybdenum plates   (tungsten or molybdenum filler) will be made.  The weld strengths   will be measured and correlated with experimental parameters such   as droplet metal identity, size, and temperature.        This new method for making permanent electrical and electronic   connections will be useful for applications requiring high   durability connections such as for printed circuit boards for use   in vibrating or accelerating environments or for attaching lamp   filaments to base connections.  The technique could replace   environmentally unsatisfactory solders in many electrical and   electronic assembly processes.",
