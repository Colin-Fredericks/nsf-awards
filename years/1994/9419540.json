 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419540  Silevitch    This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to  support the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the  Enhancement of Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME).  This  Center, organized within the framework of the I/UCRC model, is a  multi-sector partnership of federal, state, private foundation, and  industry partners.  CESAME enables K-12 elementary and secondary  teachers in the State of Massachusetts to design and implement  their own innovative ideas of teaching science and mathematics to  children.  CESAME is concerned with fostering projects conducted by  teachers concerned with enhancing K-12 education.  By applying the  IUC approach to education, CESAME is systematically disseminate  results and nurture the development of \"teacher-mentors.\"  These  leaders are vitally needed to spark widespread positive changes in  the U.S. educational system.  Minimum funding for the CESAME effort  consists of a three-way match between the NSF (the prime federal  partner), the Bay State Skills Corporation (BSSC) (the prime state  partner) and other federal, industry and private education  foundation sponsors.  This mixture of state, federal, and private  sector participation is critical in an area such as precollege  education.  This program has been coordinated with Dr. Joyce Evans  of the Teacher Enhancement Program, Division for Elementary and  Secondary Education, Directorate for Education and Human Resources.    The U.S. Department of Army has provided additional funding to  augment the Centers ongoing research and to obtain a membership in  the Center.    The Program Manager recommends Northeastern University be awarded  $100,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award.  An  additional $15,000 is recommended for one year with funds provided  by the U.S. Department of Army Natick RD&E Center.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager will  review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria,  includ ing the following:  1) the extent to which the  university/industry interaction is being sustained and growing; 2)  the extent to which the support base of $100,000 is met and  expanded; and 3) the extent to which a robust educational program  is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager  will recommend support for the next year.  The total amount of this  three year continuing award is $300,000.",
