Kim, Kangwon University, Choonchun, Korea,  for a period of  24 months, research on polyphosphate accumulation in bloom-  forming cyanobacteria: effects of irradiance and cell  carbohydrate.  Specifically, the project will involve the study  of (1) the effects of irradiance and cellular carbohydrates on  polyphosphate accumulation in bloom-forming cyanobacteria,  (2) the carbon flow from photosynthesis during polyphosphate  accumulation, (3) competition for energy by polyphosphate  accumulation and nitrogen fixation, and (4) any temporal and  spatial distribution of polyphosphate synthesis in the water  column during vertical migration.  This study will include both  laboratory experiments and field investigations.    Buoyancy regulation by cyanobacteria is a unique physiological  characteristic which contributes to their dominance in eutrophic  waters.  Although the physiological mechanism of its regulation  appears to be complex and not yet completely understood, this  ability can place them at depths that may offer optimal photic  and nutritional conditions.  Studies will be conducted at Lake  Soyang, Korea, and, in the laboratory, on bloom-forming species  from Lake Soyang and other Korean waters.    The PI and his Korean collaborators are experienced investigators  in the field of this research.  Under their work plan, the PI  will be responsible for tasks number 1 and 2, above; the Korean  collaborators will conduct task number 4; and the PI and his  collaborators will jointly investigate task number 3.  This  project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers  through the exchange of sci entific information, ideas, skills,  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  interest and benefit.  Participation of the Korean collaborators  in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
