Dynamics of the Mediterranean general circulation.  Several  different modeling approaches will be used, both with idealized  conditions to identify internal parameters important in the mixing  processes, and with realistic fluxes to simulate actual conditions  in the Eastern Mediterranean for comparison with field studies to  be carried out by neighboring countries.  Previous work, carried  out under POEM (Physical Oceanography of the Eastern Mediterranean)  has been very successful and has involved scientists from several  countries bordering the region of interest.  ***    9403471  Rizzoli  In this project, the PIs will continue process studies of: I.
