 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flora  9410486  This is an award to provide support for research on a novel  approach for biological treatment of water containing halogenated  organic contaminants.  The process involves use of a mixed  culture of anaerobic microorganisms that are cultivated on a  cathode while an electric current at low potential is passed  through the solution.  Formation of hydrogen on the cathode  produces reducing conditions at the cathode that can induce the  biologically mediated dehalogenation reaction.    Results of this project are expected to provide knowledge about a  process that has the potential of removing pollutants without  producing undesirable byproducts.  The mathematical model the  investigator plans on being able to build and calibrated with  experimentally determined data can be used in engineering design  of processes using this novel approach to decontamination of  water.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in  accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program.  ***",
