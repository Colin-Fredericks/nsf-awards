 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion of types is an important concept in both the  design of  programming languages and in the theoretical investigations of  programming languages.  While a significant understanding of type  theoretic  issues in a programming language context exists, fairly  basic questions remain  open.  Similarly, while it has been  suggested that sophisticated type systems  enhance the expressive  power of languages, very little has been done to set-up  a formal  work to investigate this idea.  Two related issues form the core  of  this work: language expressiveness, and types and operational  semantics. A notion  of expressiveness for typed programming  languages is described.  The expressive power of  a language relative to another is measured  by comparing the sets  of abstract data types implementable in the two  languages.  Preliminary results suggest that the resulting expressiveness  hierarchy of programming languages in non-trivial.  This research  conducts  a detailed investigation into the relationship  between this notion of  expressiveness, and various type  disciplines and language mechanisms.    Answers  to these questions have a definite impact on the  design of  programming languages. The research investigates some  questions  about types in an operational semantics context; these  are related to questions  studied in the context of lambda  calculus and type theory.  Two specific  classes of questions that are addressed follow: (1) orthogonal extension  questions:  does  type system A, when added to a languages based on type system  B,  invalidate any existing observational equivalences; and (2) type  isomorphism  questions:  given a pair of types in a programming  language is there a pair of  definable functions (from one to the  other) which are observationally inverse.  These lead to further  questions about axiomatization of observational  equivalence in  fragments of typed programming languages.",
