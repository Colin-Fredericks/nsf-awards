 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department recently implemented changes to the  laboratory components of its General Biology courses. The changes  institute an experimental approach to laboratory study centering on  open-ended investigative experiments and introducing selected  instrumentation, statistical analysis and formal report writing.  Each course contains three weeks of lab study of respiration; in  the first semester the focus is on anaerobic fermentation by yeasts  and in the second semester on whole organism respiration of  cockroaches. We presently use a modified Scholander apparatus that  measures gas pressure changes in a closed system. Funds are  requested for the purchase of Li-Cor Portable Photosynthesis  Systems, capable of rapid accurate measurements of CO2 fluxes  produced by living material placed within a measurement chamber.  These instruments will replace the relatively unreliable equipment  we are now using and will extend the instructional capability of  the laboratory in the following ways. The fast response time and  high sensitivity of the system will allow each student to run more  replicates during a three hour laboratory, improving the  sensitivity of statistical analyses performed later.  Students will  be able to choose from a wider range of treatment effects when  designing their own investigations, because finer distinctions  among rates will be possible. In addition, the equipment will  significantly improve the quality of laboratory investigations into  photosynthesis in the General Botany course.",
