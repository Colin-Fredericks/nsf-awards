 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401352  Geronimo       Work supported by this grant focuses on the application of  wavelets to signal and image processing as well as to numerical  analysis.  The wavelet approach to problems in these areas has  followed two basic paths: developing the wavelet from the  solution of a scaling equation or via splines.  A third procedure  to be pursued in this work derives from recent construction of  fractal interpolation functions.  The construction has advantages  of both of the previous methods, namely explicit regularity  results, easily calculated inner products and linear phase as in  the spline case and orthogonality, compact support and continuity  as in the dilation equation case.  The method also has a  multidimensional generalization that gives wavelets which are  not tensor products of univariate functions.  This project  continues investigations into the construction and application of  wavelets using fractal interpolation functions in one and  higher dimensions.  In one dimension, the focus will be on  constructing smoother (at least differentiable) compactly  supported and orthogonal wavelets.  In higher dimensions, the  goal is to construct continuous, compactly supported orthogonal  wavelets. Applications will be made to image processing by  exploiting the unique properties (e.g. symmetry and regularity)  of the wavelets.       The study and applications of wavelets represents are   relatively new branch of harmonic analysis in which single  functions are used to generate Hilbert (or other) space bases by  which functions may be represented.  While this in itself is not  too difficult, one seeks wavelets with additional properties such  as smoothness, compact support, localization in time and  frequency.   Coupled with all of these demands, one also asks for  computational simplicity.  Remarkably, there are such functions.  The goals of this research are to extend and refine basic  knowledge in this field by combining existing techniques  with those developed in parallel within t he field of  fractal interpolation.",
