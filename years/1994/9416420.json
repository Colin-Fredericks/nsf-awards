The objectives of this project are to:    (a)  evaluate the effectiveness of pre-event planned  optimal routes by comparing them to traffic patterns after  an earthquake;  (b)  evaluate the effectiveness of a GIS-based  methodologies for the estimation of damage and loss to  transportation systems; (c)  estimate the expected travel  costs to the users based on time delays due to damage of  transportation network components;  (d)  evaluate the effectiveness of GIS-based resource  allocation, hence the interaction of the transportation  network and the critical facilities for emergency responses;  (e)  determine the general effectiveness of mitigation  activities over the past two decades.    A complete inventory of the system in the region and partial  damage data are already available to the project team.  Upon  completion of data collection, a series of network analyses  and simulations, taking full advantage of geographic  information system and relational database technologies,  will be conducted to draw conclusions on the availability of  routes in emergency situations, time delays and travel costs  due to traffic congestion in a possible future earthquake  event.  Optimal strategies for the movement of available  resources and methodologies for identifying critical  structures that need to operate in an emergency situation  for resource allocation will be studied.    It is anticipated that the results of the research will  contribute to seismic hazard mitigation in the areas of post  disaster planning and emergency management.  the assessment  of the effectiveness of the available tools and  methodologies will have a significant impact towards the  development of future mitigation policies, in the  identification of critical structures for traffic  management, in the decision making process for retrofitting,  and  in the development of better earthquake preparedness  management.  The careful collection, organization, and  spatial and tabular storage of structural damage and post  disaster performance data from the 1971 and 1994 earthquakes  will provide an invaluable source of information for current  and future studies of the effects of earthquakes on  transportation systems.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
