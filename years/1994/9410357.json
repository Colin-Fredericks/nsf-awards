 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCR 9410357  University of South Carolina  Suresh Singh  RIA: Networking Issues in Mobile Computing    In the near future mobile users will be able to access a wide  variety of services that have so far been available only to users  connected to fixed networks.  Mobile users will be able to access  data while on the move.  Numerous problems from diverse areas such  distributed data management, security, networking protocols, etc.  have to be solved to enable this environment.  The focus of this  work is on identifying and solving a wide range of networking  problems such as developing practical network architectures to  support mobility, protocols to manage mobile connections in ways  that guarantee uninterrupted service, defining quality of service  guarantees and ensuring graceful service degradation in situations  where user demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them.   The problem areas targeted in this work are fundamental to  developing workable mobile computer networks.  The approaches  undertaken are practical in the sense that they will hopefully lead  to engineering solutions that will be incorporated into actual  designs in the future.  An attempt will be made to provide  solutions which will facilitate easy integration of the mobile  networks into the high-speed networking technology in the fixed  plant.",
