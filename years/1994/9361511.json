 "awd_abstract_narration": "9361511  Zheng  This proposal conducts feasibility study for the development  of a microprocessor which will become the brain for  intelligent buildings (BIB).  The brain discerns the state  of the building by evaluating signals from the sensor  network and issues appropriate commands to active and  passive controllers to moderate the effects of seismic  disturbance.  The BIB will merge two technologies, (i)  active pattern recognition and analysis and (ii) adaptive  fuzzy logic control using a dynamic knowledge base.  These  methods can respond to the dual needs of such a processor:  inference under uncertainty and adaptability to change.  Uncertainty is the result of stochastic disturbance, noise,  incomplete sensor data, or fuzziness of information.  Change  occurs during extreme hazards but also from deterioration of  the building, its sensor network, and actuation systems over  time.    The proposed design has innovative features.  Via active  pattern recognition process, BIB interacts with the building  to probe and monitor its operating state.  Dynamic, adaptive  control module has two sets of meta rules that adjust  control rules according to environmental conditions.  By  incorporating fuzzy logic, BIB leverages any tolerance for  imprecision into simplicity in design and hence gains in  efficiency and lower costs.    The study through software simulation will focus on its  performance in extreme events and address BIB's reliability  to degrading sensors and actuators.    This is an SBIR Phase I project.  ***",
