The proposed project will bring together recently established  social-theoretical research in the public understanding of science  with rhetorical and feminist analysis of scientific and technical  discourse.  The research will 1) compare the structure, content,  administration, and philosophy of U.S. and British mine safety  education programs and training requirements; 2) identify domains  of expert and contextually-generated knowledge about risk and  safety in U.S. and British mines; 3) define the visual and verbal  conventions and rhetorical assumptions that govern operational  training tesxts in the U.S. and Britain; 4) define how programs  assign responsibility and authority to various social groups for  hazard prevention in mines; 5) explore the social understandings  and expertise that enable miners to interpret and actively make  sense of safety procedures and risk in the mines; and 6) draw  broader conclusions about the role of social understandings in the  construction and interpretation of safety procedures and  instruction manuals.  The results of the research will be presented  in papers and at conferences.  The investigators also plan to make  results available to government agencies with responsibilities for  mine safety, and to offer some practical recommendations for  developing more effective safety training and education programs to  reduce risk in mines.  ***",
