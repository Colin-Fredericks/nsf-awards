 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317613  Hawley       This project will be a biochemical analysis of the proteins  and DNA sequences that determine the in vitro elongation behavior  of human RNA polymerase II.  The major goals of these experiments  are to answer questions in three general areas.  First, why and  how does pol II become transcriptionally blocked at arrest sites  and what does the behavior of pol II at such sites reveal about  the function and structure of elongation complexes?  Initial  studies addressing these questions have focused on the mechanism  of transcription arrest in vitro at the adenovirus major late  arrest site.  The DNA sequence elements contributing to arrest at  this site are being defined and characterized.  These studies  will be extended to several additional sites at which arrest  and/or termination is observed, with a particular emphasis on  understanding what features of the site specify transcript  release.  The second set of questions addresses the roles of two  elongation factors, SII and TFIIF.  SII has been shown to promote  readthrough of arrest sites and to stimulate a 3' --> 5'  exonucleolytic activity of pol II, whereas TFIIF has been shown  to enhance the overall rate of elongation.  The biochemical  characterization of these activities will continue, focusing on  several specific questions that address possible physiological  roles for the exonuclease activity and the possibility that TFIIF  activity is important for moderating that activity to promote  efficient elongation.  Finally, the ability of pol II elongation  complexes to translocate backwards on the template will be used  to pose and answer questions about the structure of the  elongation complex, focusing particularly on the possibility that  RNA secondary structures can inhibit the backing up reaction by  inhibiting reformation of the DNA:RNA hybrid and that pol II may  respond to termination sites encountered while backing up.  %%%  One of the most important and fundamental questions in biology is  how genetically i dentical cells differentially use the genetic  information to become specialized for different functional and  structural roles in the organism.  The specific morphology and  function of a cell are determined by what proteins that cell is  making; the information specifying production of all the possible  proteins the cell could make is encoded in the genes.  Thus, in  each cell type, some genes must remain \"off\" (not expressed),  while others are turned on (expressed).  The first step in gene  expression is the synthesis of a copy of the gene.  This copying  process, called transcription, produces an RNA molecule that is  then used by the cell's machinery to direct production of the  protein encoded by that gene.  Transcription is performed by an  enzyme called RNA polymerase, which must not only select the  genes that are to be expressed in a certain cell but then must  make a complete copy of that gene.  Both the initiation and the  completion of transcription are regulated, and this regulation is  an important part of the mechanism by which different cells make  different sets of proteins.  This research will focus on  understanding how transcription is regulated at the level of  continuation and completion of the copying process.   Specifically, there are signals within some genes that cause  transcription to stop, and there are proteins that have been  identified that alter the ability of the RNA polymerase to  respond to or ignore these signals.  This project is a  biochemical analysis of the interaction of the RNA polymerase  with these signals and proteins and is directed at understanding  the molecular details of these interactions and their importance  to the regulation of gene expression.  ***",
