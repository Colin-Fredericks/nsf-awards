 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411664  Fan  With recent dramatic increase in available computing power,  numerical optimization has become an attractive tool for analysis  and design of complex systems.  There are a large number of  problems in science and engineering which can be formulated as  convex optimization problems involving linear matrix inequality.   This problem is inherently difficult to solve as the  nonsmoothness usually occurs at the solution.  Further, as  systems are becoming more complex, the resulting optimization  problems tend to have a large number of decision variables as  well as constraints.  Therefore, several basic computation  components such as inversion of a matrix, eigenvalue and  eigenvector calculation, or evaluation of the Hessian matrix,  that needed for most methods become either prohibited or very  costly to perform.  It is then necessary to use approximations  and yet have the fast rate of convergence preserved.  ***",
