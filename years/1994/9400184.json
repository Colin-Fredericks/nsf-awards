 "awd_abstract_narration": "Site grant support is requested for a Research Experience for  Undergraduates (REU) program for the next three years at the  Geophyical Institute.  This program will give research  opportunities to undergraduates majoring in physics and closely  related disciplines.  The program objective is to acquaint  undergraduates with life and wwork at a research institute.  This  is done by providing summer educational work in which  undergraduates become interns participating in the research  activities of the Geophysical Institute.  Research topics available  in this program concentrate on space physics, aeronomy and global  change (atmospheric science), but also include, ice and solid Earth  topics within the Geophysical Institute, and solid state physics  and laser physics at the Physics Department.  The aim is to  encourage \\the undergraduates to continue their education in  graduate school and become research scientists.  In this program,  the interns are assigned to conduct research with principal  investigators who direct their work and serve as mentors through  their internship.  There is a common program of weekly lectures and  field trips designed to expose interns to fields of research beyond  the scope of their own projects.  Through their close relationship  with their mentors, contacts with graduate students, attending  seminars, lectures and thesis defenses, and participating in field  trips, the interns gain a first hand perspective on life and work  as a research scientist.",
