 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407030  Hou    This project will support research on several problems in the  areas of fluid mechanics and materials science.  Specifically,  three-dimensional subharmonic instability of three-dimensional  Stokes waves, three-dimensional weak water-wave turbulence,  singularity formation in fluid interfaces strongly mediated by  surface tension, reconnection of fluid interfaces, and  interaction of ocean free surfaces with moving objects will be  studied.  Investigations will be conducted on fundamentally  difficult fluid dynamical and materials problems by developing  and applying robust, efficient computational tools, including  novel time integration schemes allowing large time-steps,  spectrally accurate spatial discretizations, fast summation  techniques and the level set formulation which can effectively  compute flows undergoing topological changes.    Large-scale computation and computational mathematics are now  primary tools in studying physical processes characterized by  randomness and strong nonlinearity.  Such processes include  complex pattern formation and growth problems in diffusion  dominated systems, and wave interactions on the ocean's free  surface.  Closely related are problems with singular or near  singular behavior, such as flows undergoing changes in  topological type, or the breaking of water waves.  These fluid  dynamical and materials problems will be studied by developing  and applying state-of-the-art numerical methods to large-scale  computation, and through analytical, numerical and modeling  studies of important constituent processes.  The research will  promote inter-disciplinary interactions among applied  mathematicians, physicists and material scientists and should  have a potential impact in application areas such as high  performance computation, interfacial fluid dynamics, and  materials science.  The work on water waves would have  application to the study of radar scattering from free surfaces.   The work on Ostwald ripening provides more detailed inf ormation  on the state of materials whose manufacture depends on phase  transitions.",
