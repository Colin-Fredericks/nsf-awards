The  collaborators are Steven Manson of Georgia  State University and Pranawa Deshmukh of the   Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.  During  the initial phase of the project, the Indian  collaborator will be supported with travel and  living expenses to do developmental work using  the computational facilities at Georgia State  University.  The proposed research will study  i) the influence of relativistic interactions  in the photoionization of high-z atoms using  the RRPA formalism with enough channels to  obviate truncation errors, ii) investigate the  inner shell threshold behavior of  photoionization cross sections, iii)  explore  the photoionization of ions with the RRPA  technology, iv) examine the systematics of  generalized oscillator strengths for neutral  atoms, excited states, and atomic ions.      Scope:  This research will provide training for  graduate and advanced undergraduate students in  the methods of calculating and understanding  atomic and molecular structure and collisions.   The techniques and computer codes developed  will strengthen the theoretical physics program  at the collaborating institutions.  The results  will provide further insight into the basic  nature of these fundamental atomic processes  which are important in plasma physics,  atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation  physics and therapy, and for studies of  possible x-ray and nuclear-pumped laser  mechanisms.   ***",
