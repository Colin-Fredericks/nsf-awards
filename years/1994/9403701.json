 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403701  Laskowski       Dr. Michael Laskowski will continue his research in the  field of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  He  expects to obtain more information as to the possible mechanisms  making a type inevitable in the setting of superstable theories  that do not have the Dimensional Order Property (DOP).  Laskowski  expects to complete his classification of those countable  theories for which there are two non-isomorphic models that can  be forced isomorphic by a forcing with the countable chain  condition.  Finally, he will continue his research into an  inherent asymmetry between two new methods of constructing models  of small, superstable theories.       Most of the field of model theory (as a branch of  mathematical logic) is concerned with developing methods for  building algebraic structures with certain properties.  The  problem of whether there is a structure having an element  satisfying an infinite set of properties (i.e., realizing a type)  is well understood: such a structure exists if and only if, for  every finite subset of the type, there is an element satisfying  each of these properties.   However, it is a much more subtle  question to ask whether a given type is inevitable, i.e., whether  EVERY structure contains an element realizing the type.  Without  adding additional restrictions to the class of structures under  consideration, it is known that there can be no satisfactory  criterion for which types are inevitable.  Laskowski will  continue his research on what additional constraints must be  placed on the algebraic structure to yield a natural  characterization of inevitability.  ***",
