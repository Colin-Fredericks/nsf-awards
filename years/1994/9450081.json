 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on devising and analyzing practical  numerical algorithms for the solution of large nonsymmetric  eigenvalue problems.  Such problems arise frequently in the  numerical simulation or analysis of physical or man-made systems in  many different disciplines.  The algorithms are based upon Lanczos  recursions, are not application specific but will be tested on  matrices arising in various applications.  Arnoldi algorithms will  also be considered but only as they relate to Lanczos algorithms.   The basic forms of both these types of methods do not explicitly  transform the iteration matrix, and this is crucial for very large  matrices.  These algorithms are of interest because they appear to  be able to compute other portions of the spectrum in addition to  the magnitude dominant eigenvalues, and preliminary numerical  experiments indicate that this is a very promising approach.  There  are however many open questions about both the applicability and  viability of nonsymmetric Lanczos procedures.  Therefore, the  overall goals of this research are understanding the strengths and  weaknesses of both of these types of methods, their applicability,  and what is required to obtain practical robust Lanczos algorithms.  This research will be a combination of analysis and extensive  numerical experiments.    Three types of interactive activities being carried out are:  (1)  A graduate course on practical numerical algorithms for large scale  eigenvalue problems; (2) A 'field-directed' interdisciplinary  seminar with a significant proportion of women speakers; and (3) A  brown bag lunch series for women students only, designed to serve  as counselling sessions on any topics proposed by the students.",
