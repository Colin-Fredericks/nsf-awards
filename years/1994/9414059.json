In addition to the importance  of developing a more comprehensive relationship among the  engineering education communities of the two countries, this visit  may influence the Chinese to adopt US engineering education  standards - based on a four year undergraduate degree - rather than  the 5.5 year German standard.  This is of importance for US  engineering firms hoping to do business in China, since the  standards selected by the Chinese government could exclude US-  trained engineers.  Opportunities for expanded cooperation in other  mutually beneficial areas of engineering education will also be  discussed.",
