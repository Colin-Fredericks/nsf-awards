 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing project, in the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the discovery of   reactions that can be used in the development of new transition metal catalyzed reactions for   hydration and amination of olefins in aqueous and liquid ammonia solutions, respectively.  It is   anticipated that such processes would minimize the amount of organic waste that would be   generated in the synthesis of alcohols or amines.  Specific aims include the synthesis of new   complexes of groups 8 metals of ligands that will provide for solubility in water and liquid   ammonia, and the identification of complexes that will activate the O-H and N-H bonds of these   solvents.  One strategy to be employed is the oxidative addition reaction of a cationic complex   of water or ammonia with a low-valent complex of the same or a different group 8 metal.  NMR   spectroscopy will be used to detect hydride complexes.    A major objective in the chemical  industry is the minimization of waste materials that require  disposal or incineration.   Organometallic compounds are used as catalysts in a number of  important industrial processes;  however, all of these use organic solvents.  The use of water, or  other easily purified materials  such as liquid ammonia, as solvents is one way that may help to  minimize such waste.  The  objective of this research is to explore the possibility that  organometallic chemistry can be done  in water or liquid ammonia.  Ethyl Corporation, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is collaborating on  this project.",
