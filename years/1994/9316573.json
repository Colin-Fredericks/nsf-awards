 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316573  Wright         Since the advent of plate tectonics, earth scientists have  increasingly emphasized the importance of the lateral growth of  continental crust by the processes of terrane accretion and  magmatic arc development.  The Cordilleran orogen of North America  is one of the prime examples of such crustal growth, and the  Alaskan portion of this belt is considered to have been constructed  almost entirely by the process of terrane accretion.           This study will undertake an ambitious geological and  geophysical transect across the northernmost portion of the  Cordilleran orogen in the Bering-Chukchi region of the Arctic,  between mainland Alaska and Russia.  The main goals of the research  are to provide us with greater insight into the details of the  creation, evolution and modification of the crust beneath  Cordilleran-style oroginic belts, to give us a better understanding  of the coupling between tectonic and petrologic processes at deep  and shallow crustal levels, and to help us determine the general  links between processes at the scale of the crust and those at the  plate tectonic scale.          The project is a collaborative effort by researchers at  Stanford (Miller and Klemperer), Rice (Wright), UC Santa Barbara  (Gans), and Western Washington (Engebretson).  The project also  involves scientists from the USGS Branches of Pacific Marine  Geology (Scholl, Childs), of Alaskan Geology (Grantz, Moore), and  of Seismology (Brocher), and three well-known Russian scientists  from Khabarovsk (B. Natal'in), Yakutsk (L. Parfenov) and Magadan  (M. Gelman).  ***",
