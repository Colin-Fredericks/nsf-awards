In many species of flowering plants, this developmental transition is regulated by photoperiod.  The principal site of photoperiodic perception is the leaf, where inductive processes are proposed to lead to the synthesis of a floral stimulus that is translocated to target cells of the apical meristem where floral evocation is triggered.  This process therefore involves interorgan signaling mediated by a translocatable chemical messenger of darkness.  The biochemical and molecular basis of photoperiodic perception and signal transduction to the apex, however, remains a major unsolved problem in plant development.  Recently, Dr. O'Neill has identified N-acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine, or melatonin, in several photoperiodic plant species and has determined that the concentration of this methoxylated indoleamine in the photoreceptive tissue of Pharbitis nil is correlated with dark induction of flowering.  Melatonin is a well-known hormone involved in the regulation of seasonal reproduction in many diverse eukaryotic taxa including vertebrates, insects, and algae where it functions as a chemical messenger of \"darkness\".  The detection of melatonin in plants, and the rhythmic cycling of its concentration, suggest the possibility that melatonin may also be an important biochemical component of photoperiodic signal transduction in plants.  In related research, Dr. O'Neill has also characterized a set of mRNAs whose abundance cycles in parallel with photoperiodic floral induction.  These results suggest  that photoperiodic responses in the leaf may be mediated by activation of gene expression.  ***   9       :   $   ;   \\   <       =   ,   >       ?   \u00d5   @   b   A       B       C       >                               Z   l   H   T   I   S   K   I   O   \\   b               X EU        V F  F t  ^ & ? t +  q  v$ v\" F  P F  P      F  V   u     L  v$ v\"      F\" V$ F  F u     N  ^    ^  F &   t~ v & D 9317249  O'Neill    Flowering involves the developmental transition of the shoot meristem from vegetative to reproductive growth    P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           K   P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      !               !
