 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a new instrument for both x-ray  magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and hard x-ray spin-  polarized EXAFS (SPEXAFS) experiments. In 1992, our group  was the first to demonstrate soft x-ray MCD on a dilute,  paramagnetic bioinorganic sample, using the Fe center in the  proteinPyrococcus furiosus rubredoxin. Temperatures below 4K  and fields near 6 Tesla were used to fully magnetize the  sample. Although this experiment was a successful proof of  principal, better instrumentation is needed to fully exploit  the tremendous potential of this technique.    In the XMCD experiment, the absorption of left- and right-  circularly polarized x-rays by a magnetized sample is  compared. The resulting difference spectrum can reveal the  orientation of the magnetic moment of the x-rav absorbing  element. Comparison with the field direction then reveals  whether this species is ferromagnetically or  antiferromagnetically coupled with respect to the bulk  magnetization. In the related SPEXAFS experiment, changes in  the EXAFS with photon helicity are used to distinguish the  spin-orientation of neighboring atoms. The combination of  the two techniques thus reveals a great deal about the local  magnetic structure.    The goal for the new instrument is to achieve one to two  orders of magnitude greater sensitivity for the XMCD and  SPEXAFS of dilute bioinorganic samples. We hope to  accomplish this primarily by canceling monochromator and  beam instabilities with a rapidly switching magnetic field.  We also hope to increase the efficiency of fluorescence  photon detection by capturing a larger solid angle with a  much faster detector. In consultation with commercial  vendors, a design with a 1 Tesla superconducting magnet and  a ~0.4 K 3He cryostat has been developed that can accomplish  this goal.    To conduct these experiments, we will initially employ  circularity-polarized x-rays from bend magnet beamlines at  the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), the  Stanford  Synchrotron Radia tion Lab (SSRL), and the Advanced Light  Source (ALS)  in Berkeley. Following these initial studies  we will use a more powerful elliptical wiggler source  currently under development at the ALS.    Better XMCD and SPEXAFS instrumentation will allow  characterization of paramagnetic metal clusters in many  bioinorganic systems. Mixed-metal and/or mixed-valence  clusters appropriate for study include nitrogenase P-  clusters and Fe- Mo cofactor, Ni-Fe centers in hydrogenase  and CO dehydrogenase, and the photosystem II Mn cluster. The  methods developed for these problems will be generally  applicable to nearly all paramagnetic transition metal  complexes.",
