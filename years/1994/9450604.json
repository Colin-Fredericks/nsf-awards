At this point, it  represents a working plan that will be extensively modified in the  next year as we gather background information and advice from  institutions both within and outside the core group of four.  The  core of the first two years is a two-semester sequence that covers  the essences of organic, bioorganic, and bio-inorganic chemistry.   This core is preceded and followed by a group of one-semester  courses that, on the one hand, introduce the basic elements of  chemistry and, on the other, deal in greater detail with specific  areas that bridge the class divisions.  This new program of  instruction will require a body of teaching materials that, at  best, must be brought together from many different sources.  Other  essential teaching aids must be developed from scratch.  In the  next nine months we intend to explore available resources and to  begin the development of these new materials.  We are especially  keen on developing integrated packages of audio-visual aides to be  used in lectures as well as hands on, interactive packages of  audio-visual aides to be used for student self-study.  Further, we  anticipate that faculty from other departments and colleges within  the universities involved (University of Texas at Austin, Trinity  University, St. Edwards University, and Austin Community College)  will be able to contribute substantially to the development of the  curriculum and also be directly involved in instruction.  We will  also interface with institutions outside the primary group of four,  seeking their involvement in this planning stage as well as  possible participation.",
