The objective of  the project is to develop theoretical  techniques for use in dynamical systems by  integrating analytical and topological methods,  and then to apply them to several problems  arising from systems of reaction diffusion  equations.  Two other Japanese researchers --  Hiroshi Kokubu of Kyoto University and Hiroe  Oka of Ryukoku University -- will also  participate in the project.    During his visits to Japan, Professor  Mischaikow will attempt to combine two  viewpoints of dynamics and bifurcation theory:   an algebraic-topologic approach, based  primarily on the Conley index, which is his  expertise, and an analytic approach based on  singular perturbation theory represented by the  three Japanese researchers.  The long-range  goal of the project is to use the information  to understand the appearance of complicated,  possibly chaotic, dynamics in specified  dynamical systems generated by partial  differential equations.  Some prototype models,  new approaches, and preliminary results have  already been achieved through prior  collaboration of the U.S. and Japanese research  groups.  ***",
