Data collected during the COARE IOP (1 November 1992 - 28  February 1993) from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring  arrays, ships, surface and sounding stations, and Japanese  Geosynchronic Meteorology Satellite (GMS), and wind analyses from  the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) will  be analyzed.    The proposed research will focus on the variability of large-scale  atmospheric environment in which deep convection is promoted or  surpassed on the intraseasonal time scales.  Specifically, the  proposed project will:       (i) Detect the intraseasonal variability of surface wind and  convergence, surface/boundary-layer thermal conditions (including  surface turbulent heat fluxes, humidity and temperature, moist  static energy, etc.), vertical thermodynamic and dynamic structures  of the atmosphere, and surface precipitation;       (ii) Explore intraseasonal coherent signatures of these  variables with tropospheric winds and satellite cloud entitles  subdivided by areal extent and cloud-top height.    Through the case studies of the three TIO events during the COARE  IOP, the PI and the co-investigators of the project will attempt a  synthesized view of the large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic  structures of the TIO.  The synthesized view of the TIO will  include the spatial structures, evolutions, and interrelationships  of three-dimensional wind field, surface and boundary-layer thermal  conditions, atmospheric vertical structures, convective cloud  populations and organization, precipitation, and characteri stics of  air-sea interactions associated with the TIO.  The results from  this project will provide necessary information for enhancement of  our overall understanding of the TIO and for improvement and  validation of theories and numerical modeling of the TIO.",
