 "awd_abstract_narration": "Capone  9314252    This project continues  studies into the ecology, physiology  and biochemistry of Trichodesmium and other planktonic N2  fixers, undertaking several cruises in more widespread areas  of tropical North Atlantic, W Caribbean, NE &  NW Australia  than pervious efforts. One objective is to assess  Trichodesmium population abundance and N2 fixation along  with concurrent assessment of phytoplankton population  abundance and N assimilation, new and regenerated nitrogen.  Species distinctions will be done using ultrastructure and  nifH gene sequencing.  This will involve protein labeling  and ultrastructural studies and  molecular biological  approaches.  The next objective is to  determine whether the  phenomenon of diel periodicity in nitrogenase activity is a  common characteristic of these populations as well as  further examining the basis for this periodicity and the  mechanisms of O2 protection.  The project will continue to  examine the fate of Trichodesmium C and N, determine the  release rates of labile organics (glutamate and other amino  acids) and the grazing rates by harpacytacoid copepods.  With respect to grazing, the project will to assess the  importance of the presence of toxins, which inhibit grazing  as a function of the species of Trichodesmium.   In  addition, the project will examine the mechanisms of  Trichodesmium buoyancy reversals, along with field research  on adaptational significance, and the use of isotopic and  biochemical \"biomarkers\" for tracking the fate of  Trichodesmium biomass.  Finally, Trichodesmium population  measurements will be coupled with biooptic measurements with  the goal of developing remote sensing algorithms. Overall,  the project will provide information to assess critically  the inference that Trichodesmium is a quantitatively  significant input of new N.  This informantion will  contribute substantively towards obtaining a complete  understanding of the ecology, physiology and biochemistry of  planktonic N2 fixers and their role  in C and N fluxes in the  oceans.  ***",
