Yodh, University of California, Irvine and  R. Cowsik, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Director,  Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore are the  organizers.  This conference is unique in its interdisciplinary  approach to discussing the close interconnections among  apparently diverse areas of study.  It is dedicated to the  discussion of the fundamental physics that emerges from diverse  areas of non-accelerator particle physics such as: Solar Neutrino  Astronomy, Cosmic Rays, Particle Physics, Neutrino Physics and  the Detection of Dark Matter.  Substantial progress has been made  in these fields during the past five years and it is widely  thought that definitive answers to several questions in Physics  beyond the Standard Model can now come from Non-Accelerator  methods of inquiry.  The conferees will review recent  developments in various areas of Particle Physics, their  implications in astrophysical situations, the experimental  detection of dark matter, theoretical interpretation and  empirical/physical models of the large scale structure of the  Universe.     Scope:  This conference will precede the start of a major  institutional collaboration among several members of the  Universities of California and the Indian Institute of  Astrophysics, Bangalore in areas of research discussed at the  conference.  Therefore, the conference will be an important  initiating activity for the interdisciplinary research program   and for launching the IIA into modern areas of study.  Since  considerable research is going on in the US in all fields to be  discussed, this will be an opportunity for the US researchers to  present their work to some of the most distinguished scientists  from all over the world.  The proceedings will be published.  ***",
