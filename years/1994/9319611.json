Recent research shows that people sometimes make  these judgements without even realizing it, and despite their best  intentions to avoid them. These \"spontaneous trait inferences\"  (STIs) can affect subsequent judgements, without the judge's  knowledge. Reaction time methods, and word-stem completion  measures, allow us to detect and study these unconscious STIs.  STIs can be abstract or concrete (e.g., \"good\" vs. \"charitable\").  What determines their level of abstraction? The researcher will  investigate their abstractness, and the possibility that prior  evaluations of the person affect STI's generality. For example, if  someone acts generously, that might be spontaneously interpreted as  \"good\" if you already feel positively about the person, but merely  as \"charitable\" (a less general influence) if you feel negatively.  Previous demonstrations of STIs have all been based on the target  person's behaviors. But we also form impressions from how others  act toward the target person. A second set of experiments will  investigate whether we do this spontaneously. Just as traits can be  spontaneously inferred, perhaps goals and/or behaviors are also  spontaneously inferred. The third set of experiments will explore  this possibility. In addition, all these experiments seek  personality differences between those who readily make STIs and  those who do not.  This basic research on impression formation has  potential applications to personnel assessments and diagnoses of  psychopathology, as well as to understanding stereotyping, daily  social interaction patterns, and long-term social relationships.",
