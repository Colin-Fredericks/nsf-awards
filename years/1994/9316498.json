It is to be carried out from the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work  proposed here is the deployment of three instrument systems to  measure momentum, heat, and salt fluxes from the pycnocline (a  surface separating higher density deep water from lower density  surface water) upward to the ocean-ice interface.  In the surface  layer these instrument systems will provide a hierarchy of direct  flux and dissipation measurements which will identify several  dynamically distinct layers: the surface constant stress layer, the  turbulent boundary layer, and the active mixed layer.  Continuous  time series of these measurements will be made at each of the two  fifteen day drift stations to observe both quiescent background  conditions, and the response of the upper ocean to the short,  severe, storm systems that are characteristic of the area.     These measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the  ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice  cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only marginally  stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward heat flux,  which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection, and  a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***",
