 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Proposed major research instrumentation        This proposal is a request for an imaging -- recording  center which will enhance the  capabilities of an existing confocal microscope, replace an  out-of-date image analysis system,  and introduce techniques such as time lapse micrography that  are not currently available at the  Medical College of Pennsylvania. The major optical  components of the system consist of an  ultraviolet laser for a Biorad MRC-600 confocal microscope,  an inverted Zeiss microscope,  cooled CCD camera, a gel analysis system, and various  analysis, storage, and output devices. A  complete system for several electrophysiological recording  techniques will be incorporated into  the light microscope setup. This will include facilities for  whole cell and single channel patch  clamping, sharp microelectrode work, and microinjection of  cells for molecular biology  manipulations. The resulting system will add a state-of-the-  art facility for the combined imaging  and recording of cells which will greatly extend the scope  of the investigators to pursue studies  of cell function.    Type of research/research training conducted        The interests of all of the investigators represented  in this proposal center around issues  of cell function including intracellular signaling,  regulated exocytosis, and mechanisms of  development. While several individuals study neuronal  preparations, we feel strongly that the  major questions in cell biology will be answered by studies  of many cell types and should be  approached by a broad spectrum of techniques. Technical  expertise within the group in this  proposal includes physiology, biophysics, imaging, and  molecular biology. The investigators are  all supported by funds from government and private sources.  The existence of a multi-  disciplinary, multi-technique center will greatly benefit  both the investigators and training at all  levels from graduate students through advanced post-doctoral  fellows.    Activity th at would result if funded        The research community at the Medical College of  Pennsylvania is a relatively small but  highly interactive and productive group. The equipment  requested is too expensive to be  justified by individual grants. The existence of an imaging  - recording center will both extend  and enhance the research programs of individual  investigators, and will increase the amount of  interdisciplinary interaction. Several of the individuals  listed in this proposal participate in an  interdepartmental \"Secretion Journal Club\". If this research  is funded we would extend the scope  of the Secretary club to include other aspects of cell  development and communication.        A major benefit of such a center is that imaging and  electrophysiology will be combined  in one location, lowering the barriers for individuals to  perform experiments using unfamiliar  techniques. Although the imaging center will be administered  by the Department of Anatomy  and Neurobiology, it will be made readily available to other  individuals and departments. The  presence of the confocal microscope during the last year and  a half has motivated several  interdepartmental collaborations. Enhancement of imaging and  recording resources will greatly  expand the number and strength of such collaborations.",
