 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313204  Desai       Competitive and innovative designs for semiconductor and   packaging manufacturing are dependent on the knowledge and   understanding of the thermo-mechanical behavior of materials and   interfaces in various chip-substrate and packaging systems.  The   currently available constitutive models and computer software to   characterize such behavior are not adequate to allow for various   important design factors such as elastic, plastic and creep   strains, damage, degradation and softening, relative motions   (slippage, delamination and warping), fatigue and cycles to failure   under thermal, mechanical and other environmental (e.g., moisture)   loadings.  Appropriate laboratory testing devices and procedures   that can allow macro and microlevel measurements leading to   determination of realistic material constants for both solid ( chip   and substrate) and interface materials are also not readily   available.  The objective of this research is to develop:  (1) a   unified constitutive modelling approach that can permit inclusion   of the above factors for solids and interfaces, in a common   mathematical framework that can permit selection of simple to   advanced models depending upon the specific application need, (2)   to perform comprehensive laboratory tests.  (3) to determine   material constants for the proposed models using the test data, and  to verify the models with respect to the test results,  (4) to   implement the models in nonlinear, time dependent finite element   procedures with attention to their robustness and reliability, and   (5) to develop software that can be used for improved and optimized   designs and manufacturing.       The availability of the proposed computational tools will   allow the design of more reliable and higher performance packages   for semiconductor devices.",
