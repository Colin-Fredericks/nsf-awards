 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319994  Berliant  The location of consumers, producers and marketplaces is in  a state of transition. We need tools, models and conceptual  frameworks to address the most important questions  concerning the economic role of cities. Why do cities form  where they do? What are the driving forces behind the  formation and growth of cities? The answers to these  questions are clearly relevant to urban policy decisions,  but before these applications can be made, relevant theories  that answer these basic questions must be developed. This  research attempts to fill part of this need by extending two  basic models of location to the point of obtaining a  conceptual framework for analysis and then using this  framework to answer some of the critical questions.The  analysis treats prices and quantities of goods produced and  consumed as endogenously determined. The endogenous location  of consumers, producers, and especially marketplaces will be  highlighted. After obtaining existence of a stable  (equilibrium) state of the system and studying its  efficiency properties for each model, the work is extended  to analyse the effects of changes in policy variables.  The  empirical part of the study uses simulation exercises to  find equilibrium for special cases.  ***",
