 "awd_abstract_narration": "9458329  Brubaker  This award provides support to Dr. Rogers Brubaker under the  National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.   The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young  faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic  career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for  research and educational activities, and to foster contact and  cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that  support research and education.  Dr. Brubaker has already made  significant research contributions to the field of sociology, and  she has the potential to become a leader in academic research and  education.    This award will allow the investigator to build on his existing  research on comparative historical sociology and political and  cultural analyses of nation states.  His research interests are  in the areas of international migration, citizenship, nationhood,  and nationality.  During the next few years he will extend his  initial work in this area which focussed on Western Europe to  resurgent nationalisms in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet  Union.  He will focus on the dynamic, and potentially explosive,  triangular interplay between national minorities, the  nationalizing states in which they live, and the external  national \"homelands\" to which the minorities belong by ethnic  nationality though not by legal citizenship.  The project will be  a sustained effort to try to understand the dynamics of  nationalism before the Soviet Revolution relate to those that  have emerged in the wake of the collapse of the USSR.  This will  include the long-standing histories and geopolitical patterns of  conflict, and the impact of Soviet nationalities policy and other  intervening events and variables.    This research promises enlightenment about both politicized  ethnicity and fundamental social theory.  Through sustained  comparative analysis of the closely interlocking political fields  of national minorities, nationalizing state s and external  national homelands, it seeks to grasp the interactive processes  through which nationalist claims and counterclaims arise,  intensify, and subside.",
