 "awd_abstract_narration": "Figueroa  9410343  This is an award to provide support for research on the potential  removal of uranium from aqueous solution by its precipitation as  the oxide after a reduction process resulting from actions of  mixed cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria.  The investigator's  hypothesis is that bioreduction is the dominant mechanism for the  process which is augmented by solution characteristics such as  initial concentration of the uranium, ionic strength, pH,  presence and concentration of adsorption sites and presence of  other redox couples.    Results of this project are expected to be a better understanding  than now exists of the  contributions that bioreduction,  biosorption and chemical reduction have on the process by which  uranium is initially reduced and then precipitated from solution.  This knowledge is expected to be used in the engineering design  of bioreactors for removal of uranium from contaminated water and  wastewater.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in  accord with NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program.  ***",
