 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223482  Todd  A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing  software systems which take real world engineering problems,  expressed in engineering rather than mathematical terms, and  convert these problems into systems of mathematical equations.  These equations may then be analyzed using the symbolic and  numerical facilities of a general purpose mathematics package.  This approach separates application specific engineering  knowledge from the application independent capabilities of  general purpose mathematical software.  In the last four  years, Variational Geometry has emerged as a natural and  powerful language for the expression of mechanical engineering  problems; particularly, problems in the realm of engineering  mechanics.  The opportunity to be addressed by this project is  to develop an engineering mechanics package which will serve  to convert a variational geometry based description of the  engineering problem into a symbolic mathematical description,  which may then be analyzed inside a general purpose  mathematical package.  The Phase II research will develop a  prototype system capable of accepting an engineering problem  phrased in terms of Variational Geometry and outputting a  symbolic mathematics description of the problem.  ***",
