 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410411  LIU       Ice cores drawn from glaciers provide an important source of  information about changes in climate, vegetation, and other  phenomena over tens of thousands of years.  Analyses of oxygen  isotopes can generate proxies for temperature, and analyses of  soluble and insoluble aerosols can provide indications of wind  strength and direction, volcanic activity, and drought.  Measurement of the thickness of annual ice layers yield valuable  information about precipitation patterns.  Pollen contained  within ice cores has not been studied as extensively, but these  fine particles offer great potential as sources of information  about past patterns of vegetation.  This collaborative research  project will extract a long-term pollen record with a high  temporal resolution from ice cores extracted from the Dunde Ice  Cap in western China.  This pollen record will supplement other  climate proxy data to provide a detailed regional history of  changes in the climate and related variables over the last  100,000 years.  Special emphasis will be placed on the use of  these data to examine vegetational responses to monsoon  circulation changes induced by changes in the Earth's orbit.  Analyses also will be undertaken to consider vegetational  responses to cooling during the \"Little Ice Age\" and to  greenhouse gas-induced warming during the late Pleistocene and  Holocene periods.       This project will provide valuable new data to facilitate  the reconstruction and analyses of climatic changes over the last  100,000 years.  Because subtropical glaciers like the Dunde Ice  Cap contain far more pollen than do glaciers at higher latitudes,  they permit examinations with relatively great temporal precision  of changing patterns of climate and vegetation.  They also  provide valuable sources of data regarding current rates of  change, and these data can be used to help validate a number of  different climatic models.  ***",
