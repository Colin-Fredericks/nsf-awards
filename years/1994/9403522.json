The project will investigate critical velocities  and phase-slip in the flow of superfluid helium-4 through submicron  and micron-size apertures in thin, free-standing films of submicron  thickness.  The aim of the work is to understand fundamental  quantum vortex processes involved in the first onset of dissipation  in superfluid flow as the velocity is increased from zero.  Use is  made of a high-Q superfluid resonator to excite oscillatory flow of  the superfluid through the aperture and to sense the onset of  dissipation.  %%%  This is a research effort in the area of low temperature physics.   The project involves the study of superfluid helium, which does not  transport heat energy as ordinary fluids.  The heat energy in such  systems requires generation of vortices, analogous to smoke rings,  that can by generated as the superfluid moves through microscopic  apertures.  The research will study fundamental aspects of vortex  generation and energy dissipation in superfluid helium-4.  The work  is of fundamental significance but may as well have technical  importance in the general field of fluid hydrodynamics.  The  project includes computer modeling of the fluid hydrodynamics under  experimental observation.",
