 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309525  Heckman  This grant supplements the budget of a grant (SES-9111455) to  explore both analytical and empirical issues that arise in  evaluating the impact of government training programs on  trainees.  The original study is based on unique data from an  ongoing evaluation of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).   Supplemental funding would permit acquisition of data from  several new sources and completion of new tasks that would  greatly enhance the research outlined in the original proposal.      More specifically, funds are requested to collect data on state-  determined performance standards that affect training center  incentives to enroll certain categories of trainees.  These  financial incentive schedules are in the public domain but are  not available in any central location.  Knowledge of these  incentives permits construction of a model of bureaucratic  decision making and response to incentives that is of interest in  its own right.    Funds are requested to collate and utilize a rich new body of  data on subcontracting by training centers.  These centers use  subcontracts with their vendors to shift the risk of  noncompliance with state performance standards.  Access has been  gained to a valuable source of data on contracts let by training  centers and bids submitted by vendors.  The analysis of these  data will greatly aid in the development of a behavioral model of  training center behavior.  It will, also provide valuable new  evidence on central propositions in the economics of contracting.  ***",
