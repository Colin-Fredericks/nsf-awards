Racial elections typically pit a Black  candidate against a White candidate and are characterized by high  voter turnouts and racially polarized voting.  Aggregate data from  26 major American cities will be collected from 1969 to 1994.  Data  on election results and registration are gathered from the city,  county, or state offices, while local newspaper accounts are used  to determine the number of races involving Black officeseekers.   These data will be analyzed to address the following questions:   First, what demographic, political, and attitudinal factors are  associated with high voter turnout in mayoral primaries, runoff  primaries, and general elections?  Second, what demographic,  political, and attitudinal factors are associated with racially  polarized voting in such elections?  It is hypothesized that the  racial composition of the city, its political structure, and the  political context have important contributory effects on turnout  and racial voting in mayoral elections in additon to the racial  attitudes in the community.  ***",
