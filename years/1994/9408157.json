 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation grant is for research to analyze the influence  of women in supervisory positions on the attainment of the  individuals they supervise.  The first part of the study focuses  on the impact of female faculty on the educational and labor  market success of female students.  Data from the National  Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1973 and the High  School and Beyond sophomore cohort will be utilized for the  analysis.  Statistical analysis of the these data will shed light  on the issue of whether there is a positive role model effect of  female faculty on women's education and success in the labor  market.  The second part of the project analyzes the effects of  supervisor gender on male and female employees using the concept  of compensating wage differentials.  The major data source is the  National Longitudinal Survey Youth Cohort.   Of special interest  is whether there is a mentoring effect for women having a female  supervisor.  This research is important because it will shed  light on the importance of role models and mentors in reducing  educational and labor force attainments differences between men  and women.",
