 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320049  Partridge    The cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) reaches us  from a time near the Big Bang origin of the Universe.  As a  consequence, it encodes unique information about the  physical properties of the early Universe and about the  early evolution of structure within the Universe.  A recent  satellite detection of angular variations in the CBR has  provided important clues to the origin and evolution of very  large-scale structure in the cosmos.  The research to be  conducted in this award is a study of the CBR on smaller  scales, better matched to the size of structures we see in  the Universe today, such as galaxies and clusters of  galaxies.  The Principal Investigator will make a deep radio  map of a region of the sky at microwave frequencies.  This  will be the most sensitive radio \"portrait\" of the sky ever  made.  He will study the same area using the Hubble Space  Telescope and other instruments to provide complementary  information.  In particular, it is hoped this research will  provide a much clearer picture of when and how galaxies  formed.    In addition this work will enable studies of the properties  of foreground sources, including radio galaxies.  These  sources are of interest in their own right.  In addition,  their emission interferes with attempts to study the CBR  itself.  The observations will help astronomers characterize  and minimize this interference.    Undergraduate students will be fully involved in all the  observations and analysis.  The Principal Investigator is  regarded as a leader in this research area.  ***",
