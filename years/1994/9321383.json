The work involves both analytical and numerical points of view.   The emphasis is on collisional effects in problems arising in  plasma physics.  This involves the modification of the Vlasov-  Maxwell systems through the addition of collision operators of  Boltzmann- and Landau-type.  The major thrust of this effort is  dedicated to the study of Landau damping, in which the long time  behavior the initial value problem for the linearized Vlasov  equation is prescribed.  Work has already been done on finding  optimal decay rates in the relativistic case, in which the range  of validity is restricted by the fact that collisional effects  are neglected.  Emphasis will now be placed on understanding  decay in the nonrelativistic setting.  Studies will also be made  on the Vlasov-Einstein system to include a fully relativistic  model for stellar dynamic problems.  The work is important  because of its relation to cosmic censorship.         Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.   ***",
