 "awd_abstract_narration": "Object-oriented programming promises to make programs  easier to write, easier to extend, and easier to reuse.  The Cecil project aims  to help object-oriented technology deliver on this promise through integrated  language design, implementation, and programming environment research.    The  Cecil language is a purely object-oriented language which is serving as a  vehicle for investigating new language features.  Current research includes  studying more flexible kinds of method lookup based on symmetric multiple  dispatching, investigating the effectiveness of advanced static type systems at  expressing practical object-oriented programming problems, and developing new  module constructs that support application-specific tailoring of objects.  Programming environment support for these and other features of object-oriented  languages is crucial for effective use of object-oriented programming styles.  Advanced language designs and programming styles only impact practice if  efficient implementations are available.  The Vortex compiler project is  investigating whole-program analysis.  Interprocedural analysis of  object-oriented programs is the foundation of this work, dynamic profile  information is treated as an integral component of the compiler, helping to  focus the compiler's efforts on profitable optimizations.  Incremental  recompilation techniques for object-oriented languages help to keep turn-around  time short.  The Vortex compiler initially targets the Cecil language, with  front-ends for other languages such as C++ planned for the future.  The Vortex  compiler is written in Cecil itself, providing feedback for the language design  research and a realistic benchmark for the compiler research.",
