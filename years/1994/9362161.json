 "awd_abstract_narration": "9362161  Coleman  The objective of this project is to evaluate a biological  nutrient removal process that provides an alternative to chemical  treatment methods, which produce a residue for disposal.  The  success and reliability of the biological process depends on the  ability to produce a fermentation product from the wastewater;  namely acetate and propionate.  Primary treatment sludge is  fermented to provide additional acetate, but where this has been  used, the acetate production has been below theoretical  expectations.  This may be due to the growth of other sulfate  reducing and methane forming organisms that consume the acetate.   The process to be evaluated in this project involves a primary  sludge fermentation system that uses intermittent oxygenation to  inhibit the organisms and thus greatly increase the fermentation  yield.  Experiments designed to test this concept will also  investigate the use of oxidation-reduction potential measurements  to control the process.  A higher acetate and propionate  production will greatly improve the reliability and performance  of biological phosphorus removal systems.  Experiments are  designed to test this innovative concept using primary sludge at  the City of Yakima WWTP.  Oxygenation frequency, duration and  control methods will be studied and the effect on acetate and  propionate yield will be followed.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  An improved primary sludge fermentation process  with a process control system using ORP measurements is expected.    This involves process technology, equipment design and a process  control system that can be marketed.  There is a significant need  for improved technology for biological phosphorus removal  economically competitive with chemical treatment systems.",
