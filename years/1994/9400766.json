 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400766  Xia       The project involves work in three directions. First work is  proposed on finding complete unitary invariants for operator  tuples. The operators in these tuples commute and are chosen from  classes of non-normal operators with trace class  self-commutators. The goal is to derive trace formulae for  products of commutators and to establish some K-theory related to  the cyclic cohomology associated with almost commuting operators.  The second problem is to study the operators of the form P+Q  where P is a partial differential operator. The project here is  to derive results on the cyclic cohomology associated with a  product of twisted commutators for this type of perturbation and  to study the related spectral analysis. The final project is to  study the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of a Poisson algebra and its  quantized version.       This is a project on operator theory. The roots of this  project can be traced back to mathematical physics and the study  of the electron. The behavior of the electron was modeled by a  pair of mathematical objects called operators. The states of the  electron are determined by the \"spectra\" of the operators. Here  the project involves a study of tuples of operators that are  similar to the pair studied in quantum mechanics. The results  will have applications to quantum mechanics and the mathematical  areas of pseudo-differential operators and algebraic geometry.  ***",
