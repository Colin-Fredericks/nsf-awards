 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450369  Young    American Indians are the least represented of all minorities in Science, Engineering and  Mathematics (SEM).  The overall goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive interactive  All-Nations Alliance and network to increase substantially the quality and quantity of American  Indians receiving baccalaureate degrees and graduate degrees in SEM.  The foundation of this  alliance is 24 participating tribal colleges located in the following nine (9) states: MT, WA, ND,  SD, NE, MN, MI, WI, KS.  The tribal colleges are the functional units of the alliance  developing and implementing project activities, recruiting and selecting students, tracking  students, maintaining a comprehensive telecommunications network, establishing retention  programs, and providing student support services.  The alliance will develop and implement  innovative programs with input from both the Indian community and the SEM community to  enhance matriculation of American Indian students at the following three critical transition  points:  (1) high school to college (tribal/community/four-year); (2) two-year college  (tribal/community) to four-year SEM degree-granting institutions; and (3) four-year institutions  to doctoral degree-granting programs in SEM fields.  Tribal colleges will develop a pipeline  network by establishing linkages with local middle/high schools and four-year SEM degree-  granting institutions.  Through this unique longitudinal pipeline networking program, the All-  Nations Alliance proposes to increase the numbers of American Indians receiving baccalaureate  and doctoral degrees in science and engineering by six to ten-fold by the year 2000.  One of the  objectives of this proposal is to reduce by a least one half the dropout/stopout rate for American  Indians in the education pipeline with effective retention programs.  The All-Nations Alliance  will be supervised by a Governing Board and administered by two institutions: Salish Kootenai  College (SKC), a tribal college, and M ontana State University (MSU), a SEM degree-granting  institution.  Initially, SKC, working closely with 23 tribal colleges, will be responsible for  programmatic activities and MSU will be responsible for fiscal management.  By Years 4 and  5 of the five year program, both programmatic and fiscal management will be transferred to  SKC and the participating tribal colleges.  The All-Nations Alliance will establish a collaborative  network of research scientists at universities and research laboratories to serve as mentors for  American Indian students.  In addition, the alliance will establish productive linkages and  partnerships with other SEM-based programs, businesses, industry, organizations, state/federal  agencies and foundations.  The two lead institutions, SKC and MSU, offer a comprehensive  array of in-kind contributions to the project.  Additional sources of support for this project in  cost sharing/matching have been identified by the tribal colleges through other grants and  foundations.  Project evaluation and assessment will be a continuous process and will follow the  NSF User Friendly Handbook.  A seven (7) person Extramural Peer Evaluation Team will  conduct periodic detailed evaluations of program activities, accomplishments, and identify  specific needs and deficiencies.  Information on successful programs will be disseminated to  other institutions via monthly newsletters, telecommunications, video tapes, and annual reports.  ***",
