The curriculum is based upon the PEACHES  and GEMS materials.  Project activities include: introduction to  science and mathematical concepts through the life and physical  sciences; participation in hands-on sciecne and mathematics  experiences integrated with language arts; introduction to  appropriate instructional strategies for young children;  participation in early childhood professional conferences in the  area of science and mathematics and presentation of orientation  sessions on project curriculum by participants to teachers and  parents at their schools.  The project will develop and conduct 3  summer institutes, each three weeks in length and each enrolling 40  pre-school and kindergarten teachers.  In addition two academic  year sessions will be conducted each year for project participants  to carry out dissemination to the schools.  Fifty parents,  administrators and teachers from participants' schools will be  involved in one academic session each year at the Lawrence Hall of  Science.  The Handbook for Early Childhood Science and Math  Explorations for teachers and parents will be revised and published  by year four of the project.",
