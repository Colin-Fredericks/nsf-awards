 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416366  Roth  Twenty-three years after the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake, the  1994 Northridge, CA, Earthquake caused substantial damage to  earth structures, water conduit systems, and electrical equipment  of the Van Norman complex of the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power (LADWP); specifically the Lower and Upper San Fernando  Dams, the Tailrace, and the Los Angeles Reservoir.  Ground  deformations were measured on four LADWP earth structures, and  there were seventeen strong-motion recordings inside and around  the LADWP complex.  This well-instrumented site provides a  special opportunity to study the permanent deformations and  failure and the post-earthquake stability of liquefiable soils  and earth structures subjected to severe (0.98 g) ground shaking.    This project involves three institutions: the University of  Southern California (Part I), Dames & Moore (Part II), and Case  Western Reserve University (Part III).  The objective is to  analyze the ground deformations and failures in the Van Norman  complex following the 1994 Northridge Earthquake; from both  research and engineering-practice points of view, based on state-  of-the-art field and laboratory measurements.  Coordination of  the three research teams is provided by the University of  Southern California.    The objective of Part I (University of Southern California) and  Part II (Dames & Moore) is to compare the 1971 with the 1994  observations of ground motions, and to investigate the validity  of nonlinear dynamic finite element analyses in well-documented  field studies.  The objective of Part III (Case Western Reserve  University ) is to characterize the soil and to establish its  liquefaction potential, using the unit energy method, at a number  of sites in the Van Norman complex where field observations and  measurements are available.  The results will be assembled in a  data base and made available to the engineering community, in  addition to being used in Parts I & II of this project.    It is expected th at this project will assist practicing engineers  and regulatory agencies to evaluate the capabilities and  limitations of available models for the seismic response of soils  and earth structures.  This action is to support Part II (Dames &  Moore) of this collaborative research project.  ***",
