Ward,  Professor of Entomology at the University of  California/Davis,to survey the distribution and  abundance of ants in tropical forest habitats in  Madagascar, and  compare the results to known  patterns of vertebrate distribution.  The aim of  the project is to test the hypothesis that  patterns of diversity, endemism and rarity of  insects differ from those of birds and mammals,  with insects showing greater between-site  variation and local endemism.  A primary  objective is to develop standardized methods of  assessing ant diversity that can be used in any  tropical wet forest.  The project will develop a  database regarding the distribution of ants in  the most biologically diverse region of  Madagascar.  Altitudinal ant surveys will be  conducted at five sites in the eastern tropical  wet forest of Madagascar.  Species richness and  abundance will be calculated for each elevation  at each locality, and compared to those extracted  from existing data bases for vertebrates.  This  information will allow estimates of the degree of  protection the Malagasy invertebrate fauna  receives in existing reserves.     This study will illuminate a question fundamental  to conservation biology:  \"Are 'indicator' taxa  really indicators?\"  In the course of the  project, young Malagasy biologists will be  trained in inventory, curation and identification  techniques.  This study is being conducted in  collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature  - Madagascar, and the Xerces Society.  Augmenting  the usual channels of publication in scientific  journals, these two non-profit organizations will  assist in diffusing the information collected to  other scientists, conservation biologists, and  government agencies in Madagascar.  ***",
