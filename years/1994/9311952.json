The project will  focus on newly discovered travertine deposits in  Morocco.  Travertine is a limestone that forms at  the surface from spring waters due to biotic and  abiotic processes.  The investigators (Drs. H.  Chafetz from the University of Houston and B.  Akdim from the University of Fes) will conduct  field and laboratory work to determine whether  these newly discovered but as yet unstudied  travertine deposits display multiple episodes of  formation and whether they are cold or hot water  deposits.  By answering these questions, Chafetz  and Akdim will evaluate paleoclimatic conditions  as well as provide valuable insights into the  origin and diagenesis of travertines.  Project  funding will enable the researchers to jointly  conduct fieldwork and to visit each other's  laboratory over the course of this three-year  study.    This project in geology and paleontology fulfills  the program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Morocco to combine  complementary talents and conduct research in  areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
