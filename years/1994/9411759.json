 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411759  Hawkins  During the devasting Northridge earthquake in January 1994,  unexpected damage occurred to many parking garages of various  prestressed construction types.  Such damage revealed serious  questions as to the design adequacy in terms of gravity as well  as lateral load-resistance of such structures.  Important  engineering lessons could be learned from studying the earthquake  response or damage data collected from post-event field  investigations.    The Principal investigator, with assistance provided by the  prestressed/precast concrete industry and trade association,  conducted a comprehensive field investigation and has collected a  rather complete set of relevant data/information pertaining to  parking garage structures and their damage.  This project will  enable an indepth study to be carried out to address some of the  critical issues as follows:  (1) to determine reasons for  observed damages and identify common features, (2) to determine  seismic risk to existing garages and (3) to recommend necessary  building code changes.    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project is supported,  due to the importance of the anticipated learning, as a part of  the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's Post-  earthquake investigation activity.  ***",
