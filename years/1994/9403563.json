 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott         The investigator develops an approach to scientific  computation that incorporates research in numerical analysis,  aspects of computer science, and solution of model problems in  mechanics.  Three research areas are the focus of the project:  computational problems in incompressible fluid dynamics (including  free--boundary problems and high-order, mixed method  discretizations in two and three dimensions), diffusion  acceleration techniques for particle transport, and algorithms for  parallel computers.  This research includes an analysis of each  algorithm, yielding a rigorous justification that it accurately  approximates the phenomenon under study.  Finally, the research  involves prototype implementations of the algorithms in computer  programs via techniques that can assure a robust and easily  maintained code.  In collaboration with specialists in related  disciplines, these  computer programs are used to study basic  physical phenomena in a variety of areas.       The overall objective of the project is to improve the  foundations for software for solving problems in science and  technology that involve large scale, multidimensional models in  continuum mechanics.  These models are the basis for computer  simulation used in engineering design in manufacturing processes,  in environmental modeling and the development of remediation  techniques, and in various aspects of biotechnology.  The research  involves the development of new algorithms for several problems  too difficult to solve by existing techniques.  It emphasizes the  efficient use of high-performance computers in realistic  simulations.",
