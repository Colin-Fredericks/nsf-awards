 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322488  Horanyi    The fragments of the recently discovered Comet Shoemaker-Levy  are expected to return to Jupiter on July 25, 1994.  During the  approximately 1 week long trip, as Comet Shoemaker-Levy crosses  Jupiter's magnetosphere, it will produce more dust in situ than the  total mass of the main jovian ring (  5 x 1010 g).  Dust grains, once  exposed to the plasma environment, will collect electrostatic charges  and interact with the magnetic and electric fields of the  magnetosphere.  These grains will be dispersed or focused  depending on their size and location in the plasma environment.  Research on this award will allow extended computer simulations of  the trajectories of a large number of test particles accounting for all  the relevant interactions.  This test particle code has been developed  by the PI and has been successfully applied to charged dust  dynamics around other planets, and also in the Earth's  magnetosphere.  These same routines will be used for the case of  Comet Shoemaker-Levy entering Jupiter's magnetosphere.  It is  quite possible that new dust rings may be formed around Jupiter as  a result of this comet impact.",
