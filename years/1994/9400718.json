It is an experimental laboratory  study of the emergence of cooperation in exchange networks.   Previous research has focused on positional power, and on how  those actors in high power positions can gain resource advantages  despite the actions of other actors in the network.  However,  power advantages in some networks require a degree of  coordination between actors in different network positions in  order to be realized.  Some network structures induce this  coordination; other inhibit it.  The present research will: 1)  test a new theoretical extension of network exchange theory based  on this idea of interactive power; 2) investigate the effects of  structural variations and levels of communication on the  emergence of cooperation between self interested actors in  exchange networks, and 3) test a measure of relational power that  shows the temporary effects on power of the pattern of use of  different relations in a network.  %%%       This experiment contributes to structural social psychology,  developing and testing additions to a widely-accepted theoretical  approach.  Although the research is abstract, the theoretical  principles are believed to apply to work groups, families, and  decision-making bureaucracies, so scientific advances may  contribute indirectly to improvements in administrative and  management techniques.  In addition to the scientific gains to be  achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a  highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.  dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific  manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next  generation of social scientists.    ***",
