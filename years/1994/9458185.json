Group II introns are often required for the processing  of pre-RNAs in the mitochondria of plants and yeast. The tertiary  architecture, or folding of the group II intron is of great  interest because it cannot be solved using conventional  base-pairing rules and preliminary work suggests it is different  from any RNA studied previously. The specific objectives being  studied are: 1) to determine the location an identity of tertiary  interactions stabilizing group II intron folding. In particular,  characterize interactions between Domain (D1), which binds the  5'-exon, and Domain 5 (D5), a small catalytically essential RNA  that binds D1 in-trans. 2) Provide a complete kinetic framework for  the folding pathway and chemical mechanism of the wild-type group  II intron, enabling a precise interpretation of mutational   results. 3) Solve the three-dimensional structure of the group II  intron through a combination of biochemical, X-ray crystallographic  and molecular modeling studies. 4) Utilize Group II intron  substructures derived from catalytic D5 and nucleophilic D6 as  covalent probes to scan for group II introns in humans. 5) By  swapping small nuclear RNA components Or the spliceosome with  domains of the Group II intron, search for evidence that group II  introns and spliceosomal RNAs are related in structure or function.  %%%  This research program is investigating the folding patterns and  chemical mechanisms of the Group II intron, which is a  structurally complex catalytic RNA involved in gene expression in  plants and yeast. The folding of the group II intron is of great  interest because it cannot be solved using conventional  base-pairing rules for nucleic acids and preliminary work  suggests it is different from any RNA studied previously. These  studies may serve a s an interesting and biologically relevant  model for novel forms of RNA tertiary organization that are  stabilized through nucleic acid base-backbone contacts, metal ion  bridges, and other unusual inter actions. Catalytic RNAs  (ribozymes) such as the group II intron provide a particularly  effective means of characterizing RNA tertiary interactions  because ribozymes report on changes in their structure through  changes in their catalytic activity. These studies will provide  kinetic evidence for group II intron folding as well as solve the  three-dimensional structure of the group II intron. Studies will  also be done to scan for human group II introns to see if they  occur in animal cells which is not known to date.  ***",
