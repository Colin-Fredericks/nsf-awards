Advances in nonlinear control theory will substantially improve  the design of control systems for light-weighted robot arms, for  autopilots and guidance systems of highly maneuverable aircrafts,  increase the flexibility and energy efficiency in the regulation  of chemical plants, facilitate the real-time reconfiguration of a  control system after the occurrence of a failure.         Among the many problems which must be confronted, a most  important one is the design of feedback laws achieving a  prescribed performance objective, usually expressed in terms of  the response to a prescribed set of command inputs for the  control of a physical system in the presence of substantial model  uncertainties.          A methodology which, in the case of linear systems, has  proven very effective in the design of robust controllers in the  presence of unstructured perturbations, is that based on the  minimization of the maximal amplitude of the frequency response  to exogenous disturbance inputs.  The purpose of this research is  to contribute to the extension of this design methodology to  nonlinear systems and to show how this can be effectively used to  address a number of relevant problems which arise in the design  of nonlinear feedback laws achieving robust performance.  ***",
