 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310529  McCormick    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research  in applied mathematics and advanced scientific computing among  U.S. and French research teams at the University of Colorado  (Denver and Boulder), Texas A&M, and INRIA Rocquencourt (French  National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied  Mathematics) and ONERA.  The objective of the research is to  investigate domain decomposition and multilevel techniques for  parallel numerical simulation of fluid flow and structural  dynamics.  The idea behind this approach is to develop new  methods in a parallel computing environment to allow modeling of  more sophisticated engineering problems.  They will focus the  research on four applications:  (1) flow transition to  turbulence; (2) zoning-coupled flow modeling; (3) transport  phenomena; and (4) fluid-structure interaction.  The proposed  areas arise in many civil and aerospace engineering applications.    The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in  parallel computing, multilevel and domain decomposition  techniques.  This is complemented by the French team's experience  in domain decomposition, fluid flow and parallel computing.   Their joint efforts could lead to improved algorithms for large  scale parallel computing.  ***",
