 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315506  Crawford       The sunflower family of plants, the Compositae or Asteraceae,  is one of the largest in the world, with ca. 20,000 species, and  has attracted a large proportion of scientists in taxonomic and  evolutionary biology.  Since the last international meeting where  a synthesis of information was attempted on the family, in 1975,  the Compositae have been the subjects of new molecular methods of  DNA analysis and of numerous other studies on morphology, life  histories, natural products, and ethnobotanical uses.  Dr. Daniel  Crawford of Ohio State University is coordinating travel grants for  several U.S. participants to attend an international conference on  the systematics and evolution of the Compositae, to be held at the  Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England.  Graduate students and  faculty researchers are eligible for travel supplements to attend  this two-week conference.  Recent studies of phylogeny, genome  organization and change, hybridization, diploid-level speciation,  natural products chemistry, pollination and dispersal, life history  evolution, and ethnobotany will be highlighted.  The conference  anticipates attendees from many countries in America, Europe,  Africa, Asia, and Australia.       The first international conference on the Compositae, held in  1975, led to publication of a synthesis volume with wide and  lasting impact on studies of systematics and evolution of the  sunflower family of plants.  The second conference at Kew is likely  to achieve similar distinction, and in particular will highlight  recent findings from new molecular technologies applied to DNA and  genome organization in these plants.",
