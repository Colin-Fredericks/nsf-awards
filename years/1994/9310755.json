The first  meeting was held in March 1985, and, since  then, major developments have taken place in  the field of remote sensing.  Sessions planned  include: design and development of active and  passive, surface airborne and spacecraft remote  sensing systems; satellite receptions and data  processing; remote sensing data processing;  data archiving and retrieval; meteorological  and hydrological applications; agricultural and  forestry applications; oceanographic, fishing  and aquaculture applications; land use and  geographic applications; geology and mineral  resources; remote sensing applied to energy and  fuels problems; pollution and waste heat  monitoring; remote sensing for the commercial  and private sector; government's role in remote  sensing; space shuttle remote systems and  results; and remote sensing education.    Scope:  The proposed meeting will be open to  scientists from many countries in South Asia  and the Middle East, in addition to the main  participants from India and the U.S.  The   lecture texts of the invited lecturers will  be published before the Symposium-Workshop.   The Workshop reports will be published as one  volume after the meeting and will be made  available to interested organizations in the  U.S. and India and to the participants.  ***",
