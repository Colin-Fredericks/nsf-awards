The equipment is  being utilized in a new undergraduate course: Field and Laboratory  Techniques in Hydrogeology.  In addition, the new equipment is  being used in other classes and is increasing undergraduate  research opportunities.  This field and laboratory course is being  taught for the first time in the Spring of 1994 and the field  component is being conducted at the new San Diego State University  (SDSU) well field site.  The new equipment is being included in  several of the field exercises of this new course.  Several  peristaltic pumps, a bladder pump, and a set of packers are being  used in the following exercises: Water Sampling, Well Purging,  Tracer Testing.  A pump, water level probes, pressure transducers  and a data logger are being used for the Water Level Measurement  and Well Pump Test exercises.  Permeameters are being used in the  laboratory estimation of core sample permeability, while specific  ion electrodes, meters and a fluorometer are being used in the  Tracer Test exercises.",
