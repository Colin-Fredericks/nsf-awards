 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9450302  Newburgh Enlarged City School Dist.  Newburgh, NY  Saturnelli, Annette    \"Summer Microscopy Institute For Middle School Students\"    This program is designed to provide 50 minority 7th grade students  with the goal orientation needed for success.  As individual  aspires to reach a goal, only if he/she believes it can happen.   The goal creates the appetite for learning.  An environment (a  uniquely designed high-technology, simulated research and  development facility) has been created where students will engaged  in problem-solving projects and provided with opportunities for  sustained interaction with minority role models so that they may  begin to imagine themselves in these roles, project themselves into  the future, and visualize themselves as scientists, engineers, and  science teachers.  In addition, as science teaching/mentoring  experience will be provided for 8 minority high school students,  members of the New York State Science Honor Society and currently  enrolled in higher level science courses.  An inservice course will  be conducted that will enable teachers to acquire appropriate  strategies for teaching science in a multi-cultural setting to  minority students and to develop and implement intervention  strategies for a awakening interest in and increasing participation  of minority students in science.  The program also includes  activities for the parents of the students.  The proposal focuses  on teams of students, equipped with advanced technology, who are  engaged in integrated science and math problem-solving research  appropriate for students entering the 7th grade.  The approach  takes advantage of and encourages the students' imagination and  natural curiosity with the world.  At the core of this learning  environment are two scanning electron microscopes, a scanning  tunneling microscope, and a transmission electron microscope  (already donated by, or on loan from, our industry/higher education  partners).  The interactiveness of the microscopes emphasiz es  visual and kinesthetic learning and addresses the need for a mode  of learning congruent with the student's perception of what science  education should be like today.",
