 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353970  Winfrey  This project involves an intensive two and one-half week  laboratory workshop in molecular biology for undergraduate  faculty. The workshop allows 20 participant faculty per year to  learn the basic principles, techniques and applications of  modern molecular biology. Consideration is given to faculty in  need of re-training or those who teach women and minorities.  The principal goal of the workshop is to provide participants  with hands-on techniques, experiences, and educational  materials to implement effective undergraduate molecular  biology laboratory instruction into their curriculum.   Participants isolate and separate DNA, clone genes, and analyze  the cloned genes by Southern blotting, nucleic acid  hybridization, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA  sequencing, and computer assisted sequence analysis. Also,  laboratories are supplemented with lectures on the principles  of methods used and by seminars presented by experts from  academia and industry on various applications of molecular  biology. Sustained interaction among the participants will be  maintained by networking and holding follow-up workshops and a  mini-symposium after completion of the original two and one-  half week workshop course.   ***",
