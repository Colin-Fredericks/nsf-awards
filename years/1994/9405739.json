 "awd_abstract_narration": "9405739  Reiter       In an effort to further understand the synthesis,  structure and function of the plant cell wall, a direct  biochemical screening procedure has been used to isolate  mutants of Arabidopsis with alterations in their cell wall  polysaccharide composition.  Three different loci have been  identified that either lead to the complete absence of L-  fucose in cell wall material (mur1) or to an approximately  50% reduction in the amount of this monosaccharide (lines  mur2 and mur3).  To fully exploit the usefulness of these mutant lines, it is  necessary to understand the biochemical or regulatory  lesions leading to the mutant phenotypes, and to get access  to the affected genes.  The proposed research will use  biochemical tools to define the changes leading to the  observed alterations in cell wall composition.  Experiments  will be carried out to determine whether the mutant lines  show defects in precursor availability, or whether they are  deficient in some aspects of glycosyl transfer.  These  questions will be addressed by quantifying the amount of GDP-  fucose (the substrate for fucosyltransferase) and by  determining structural changes in fucose containing cell  wall polysaccharides.  The studies will be complemented by  assaying fucosyltransferase activities , and the activity of  enzymes in  the de novo synthesis of GDP-L-fucose.  All selected mutations will be mapped relative to molecular  markers as a prerequisite to get access to the affected  genes by map-based procedures.  The mur1 mutation appears to  be particularly amenable to genetic analysis because a large  number of independent alleles is already available, and an  easy immunological screening procedure can be used to  construct a genetic map of high resolution.  Accordingly,  attempts will be made to clone the MUR1 gene either from  tagged libraries or by map -based procedures.  The  availability of this gene would allow some insights into the  regulation of sugar nucleotide interconversion pathways in  hi gher plants, and permit the modification of cell wall  composition in other plants including economically important  species.  %%%    The cell walls of higher plants play pivotal roles during  plant growth and development, and determine the physical  properties of all parts of the plant.  Examples include the  softness of fruits, the strength of textile fibers, the  digestibility of forage, and the processing characteristics  of wood during paper production.  Furthermore, plant cell  walls present the interface between the plants and their  environment and play important roles in the defense of  plants against pests.  Finally, plant cell wall material  accounts for most of the newly synthesized terrestrial  biomass, making it the most important renewable source of  reduced carbon, which can be used as raw material for the  chemical industry and for fuel production.  Accordingly, it  is highly desirable to understand the mechanism by which  plant cell wall material is synthesized, and to get access  to the genes controlling the properties of plant cell wall  material.  This will ultimately open up opportunities to use  tools of biotechnology to modify plant cell walls in ways  that are desirable from an economically and/or ecological  point of view.    ***",
