 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320149  COMAROFF, John  COMAROFF, Jean  This project will examine the various forms of resistance that  arose among black South Africans, and especially the Southern  Tswana peoples, in response to colonial overrule, 1830-1920; it  will also explore how these forms of resistance laid a basis for  present-day struggles toward democracy.  The study, which will  have a strongly comparative focus, conceives of \"resistance\" as  an ensemble of strategies, a continuum ranging from everyday acts  of refusal through dramas of alterity, carnivals of terror,  rebellions and social movements, to formal political  organizations.    In exploring the conditions under which black South Africans have  defied those who rule them, and in describing the means by which  they have done so, the study seeks to answer a number of  questions about the nature of resistance.  In what circumstances  do disempowered peoples seek remedy and redress in the law?  When  and why do they resort to other means, means either illegal or  alegal?  Do some forms of insubordination encourage or preclude  others?  What is the role of consciousness and intention in the  motivation of protest--and in determining its historical  significance?  Is it possible to move beyond a purely reactive  view of defiance to grasp the active cultural construction of its  means and ends?  How do we understand the roles of social class,  ethnicity, race, gender, and generation in resistance?    The investigation will involve the analysis of documentary  sources, supplemented by interviews, in Southern Africa and  Britain.  The product will be a book, the third in a large-scale  study of the social and political effects of colonialism.",
