 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 570  Lawson  Alabama Laser Research Initiative    The Alabama Laser Research Initiative proposes to establish a  unique world-class Laser Research Facility at the University of  Alabama at Birmingham which will provide spectrally tunable laser  pulses for photonics research and development.  The facility will  help to develop systemic linkages between the science,  engineering, and mathematics infrastructure in Alabama in the  area of lasers and photonics.  Specific areas of research to be  pursued in this initiative include the development of new active  media for future commercial laser systems, research into new  types of nonlinear optical materials for optical switching, and  research into new types of optical systems for laser beam profile  modification to enhance the efficiency of laser systems.  The new  active media research (solid state impurity doped and color  centers) is spurred by the need for lasers at new wavelengths,  and will result in the development of new   irradiated color  centers and impurity doped crystals.  These new active media will  ultimately have applications  as new types of products for  commercial laser companies, including spectrally tunable solid  state lasers, passive Q-switches, and mode-lockers.  The  nonlinear optical materials research is motivated by Department  of Defense (DoD) and commercial applications such as sensor  hardening, optical processing or computing, and optical  switching, and will involve the development of new highly  photorefractive NLO materials.  Color-center laser-based  experiments will be used to characterize these materials.   Ultimately, this will lead to improved nonlinear optical (NLO)  materials for DoD and commercial applications.  The beam profile  modification research is motivated by the need to transform a  Gaussian laser beam profiles into a more uniform irradiance  distributions for applications such as projection processing of  materials.  The proposed research in the area of novel beam  reshaping will lead  to beam reshapers for use in producing  massive arrays of micro-optical elements.    This Alabama Laser Research Initiative will provide opportunities  to educate undergraduate and graduate students (including  participants in the Alabama Alliance for Minority Participation  program) in laser  and photonic sciences and technologies.  The  emphasis of this educational process will be to develop applied  skills that will be directly used (i) in new commercial laser and  photonics companies located in Alabama; and (ii) to modernize  current Alabama based industries.  In addition to educating  students, the proposed research will help to develop new laser  and photonics technologies that can be transferred to Alabama  industries to develop new products and to improve manufacturing  processes.",
