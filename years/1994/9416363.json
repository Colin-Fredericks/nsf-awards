These failures can be categorized either as Ostructural,O  which is associated primarily with larger ductilities and  local strains in the steel members and welds than is  envisioned in design, or Ometallurgical,O which is  associated primarily with weld defects, poor weld  workmanship, lack of toughness in thick sections of wide-  flange members, and the presence of stress risers such as  backing plates.  The resolution of the primary cause of the  failures will determine the provisions of the seismic design  specifications which must be modified.  It will also dictate  the nature of the repair and rehabilitation that will be  required in steel frames, since the retrofit strategies will  differ depending on the primary cause of failure.    This project addresses the problem of structural behavior by  examining both the load and resistance aspects of the  problem.  With respect to resistance, this research will  investigate whether the presence of a composite floor slab  and the occurrence of yielding in the panel zone region of  the connection significantly increased the local strains  near the critical welds.  A combined analytical-experimental  investigation will be conducted to focus on the local  behavior of the welded connections, and in particular on the  region near the bottom beam flange, where most of the  fractures occurred.  The experimental program will include  tests of three beam-to-column subassemblages, including one  with no slab, one with a slab having partially composite  action, and one with a slab having fully composite action.  Three-dimensional nonlinear continuum finite element  analysis will be used to quantify the local strains near the  welds and the effect on force transfer of partial composite  action at the concrete/steel interface.  With respect to  loading, this research will address th e probable force  distribution in the structure during the earthquake through  the use of a three-dimensional, nonlinear, transient dynamic  frame analysis program capable of tracking both horizontal  and vertical accelerations.    This research will have a profound effect on the design of  steel structures if it can be demonstrated that current  seismic analysis and design methodologies for steel frame  lateral-resistance systems are inadequate, since they  usually exclude the effect of the composite floor slabs on  the structural behavior.    This is a Northridge Earthquake project.  ***",
