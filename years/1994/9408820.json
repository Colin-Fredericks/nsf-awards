 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408820  Briggs         This research by a social anthropologist from Vassar College  involves the recording and analysis of narratives by Native  Americans about epidemic diseases which recently struck their  poor, forest community.  There was a devastating cholera epidemic  as well as measles and whooping cough epidemics, none of which  the Indians recognize as traditional diseases.  Their stories  represent the diseases as being inflicted by non-Indians in order  to weaken their society.  By analyzing how these narratives are  formed, transmitted, and circulate from Indian to non-Indian  contexts, the project will study how the symbolic aspects of diseases are represented.         The knowledge to be gained form this research will help  government agencies and NGOs communicate with ethnic groups to  ameliorate the devastating impact of health crises in this area,  and will add to our understanding of how ethnic groups who do not  have a bio-medical understanding of diseases form their own  cultural models of the diseases and how individuals in the groups  use these models for social and political advantage.  This sort  of knowledge will be valuable for dealing with similar situations  of inter-ethnic contact where each group's understanding of the  source of the crisis is different.",
