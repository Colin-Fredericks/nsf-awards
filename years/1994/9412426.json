 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412426  Koch    The goal of this study is to understand how the electrical  signals (called spikes) generated by nerve cells encode  information.  Studying nerve cells that are part of the  early visual or auditory pathways in the nervous system  provides an opportunity to directly relate visual or  auditory stimuli with the trains of spikes generated by  these neurons.  To understand how the nervous system works  it is important to understand how time-varying signals such  as the velocity of a moving target in the visual field of an  animal is encoded in such spike trains.  Another important  issue is to understand how information encoded in neuronal  spike trains depends on the biophysical properties of the  nerve cells, the hardware of the nervous system.  This group  of investigators will apply methods of information theory,  which up to now have been mainly used in the engineering  sciences, to estimate the rate, in bits per second, at which  nerve cells can transmit information and to understand  better the nature of the encoding of time-varying signals in  neuronal spike trains.  The role of the biophysics of single  cells in this information transmission will be investigated  by performing realistic computer simulations of nerve cell  activity.",
