 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307098  Balsara    This research is a study of the thermodynamic properties of blends  of polymethylbutene (PMB) and polyethylbutene (PEB) containing  polymethylbutene-polyethylbutene (PMB-PEB) block copolymers to  examine the possibility of forming complex fluids.  Small angle  neutron scattering and light scattering will be the primary tools  for this study.  The required model polymers will be synthesized by  \"living\" anionic polymerization of dienes under high-vacuum and  subsequent hydrogenation, or deuteration for creating neutron  scattering contrast.    The proposed study will consist of two stages.  First, the  thermodynamics of mixing of PMB/PEB/PMB-PEB mixtures will be  obtained from small angle neutron scattering measurements on  homogeneous, single-phase mixtures.  These data will provide the  thermodynamic basis for the rational design of the dispersed phase  in phase-separated systems.  The second stage will consist of  examining such systems.  The evolution of the two-phase structures  which will be studied by time resolved small angle neutron  scattering and light-scattering measurements on thermodynamically  unstable mixtures.  The experiments are designed so that the  transition temperatures from single-phase to two-phase systems are  experimentally accessible (in the vicinity of 170 C).  The  scattering experiments will determine the shape and size of the  dispersed phase, the interfacial activity of the block copolymer,  and whether or not the morphology is at equilibrium.    These polymers belong to one of the largest and most important  polymer blend family, namely that arising from polyolefins-  polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene and their copolymers.  In  spite of their commercial importance, there is virtually no data on  the thermodynamics of mixing of these multi-component systems.  ***",
