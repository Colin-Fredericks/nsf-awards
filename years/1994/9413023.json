Saleh Ajaz, from the H.E.J Research Institute  of Chemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan,  in a collaborative project with Dr. David L.  Smith of the Medicinal Chemistry and  Pharmacognosy Department at Purdue University.   The project is intended to isolate and  determine the structures of certain proteins  and natural products.  Specifically, two  important classes of proteins will be examined:  casein isolated from camel milk, and  hemoglobins from several species of birds.  It  is intended to locate sites of phosphorylation  in the casein and to compare the three-  dimensional structural features and dynamics of  casein and hemoglobin from different species.   The utility of new mass spectrometric  ionization methods (electrospray and laser  desorption) for determining the molecular  weights of biologically active natural products  that cannot be analyzed by conventional mass  spectrometric methods will also be  investigated.    Scope:  This project seeks to accomplish two  objectives:  the analysis of specific proteins  using modern and innovative techniques; and  familiarizing the Pakistani scientist with the  modern techniques used in the U.S. to enable  him to maintain a parallel research activity at  the H.E.J. Institute in Pakistan, for joint  work with the laboratory of Dr. Smith.  The  long- term parallel activities will be  beneficial to both sides because of the access  in Pakistan to different species, and their  ability to do first-rate analytical chemistry  research.  The development of this long-term  linkage meets the objectives of the Division of  International Programs.  ***",
