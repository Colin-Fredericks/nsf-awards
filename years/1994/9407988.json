 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves ecological and behavioral studies of  a group of passerine birds native to Australia.  Species in  this group exhibit a variety of interesting patterns of  behavior, the study of which will aid in understanding  evolutionary processes and social behavior in non-human  species.  Individuals live in large social groups, and the  offspring from one generation remain in the territory and  help the parents raise young in successive breeding  attempts.  Despite the close social ties among individuals  in the same group, females generally mate with males outside  their social group.  By testing hypotheses for the evolution  of this type of social organization, Dr. Pruett-Jones hopes  to elucidate the factors important in the very general  problem of mate choice by both males and females.  In his  study of reproductive patterns, he is using the technique of  DNA fingerprinting and other molecular techniques.  One of  these techniques, microsatellite analysis, has not been used  before in such studies.  Thus apart from the topic under  study, this research will contribute to the field of  molecular genetics and the development of new techniques of  analysis that may have applicability in human research.  Two  of the species under study, the striated grasswren and  mallee emu-wren, are endangered and restricted to mallee  scrub habitats, perhaps the most limited and endangered  habitat in Australia.  In their ecology, these two species  share many characteristics with other vertebrate species  restricted to mallee habitats.  This study will contribute  to the conservation of mallee habitats and provide  information critical to the management of endangered mallee  species.",
