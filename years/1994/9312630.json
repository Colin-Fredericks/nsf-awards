While considerable research has been directed at  producer services and towards manufacturing, a significant  gap exists in our knowledge of how manufacturers develop  connections with and use producer services. The expectation  is that those firms which are better able to tap into  appropriate producer services will perform better and be  more innovative. This project tests several hypotheses  regarding factors that influence the ability of  manufacturing firms to connect with and benefit from  producer services. A major hypothesis is that those  industrial firms which are more peripherally located are  less likely to have well developed relationships with  producer service firms and to perform at lower levels. Other  factors expected to influence the intensity of producer  service-manufacturing firm interaction include whether or  not firms are part of a larger organization, the firm's  position in the product life cycle, and size of firm. A  large mail survey will be conducted for firms in upstate and  downstate New York, followed by in-depth interviews with a  small number of representative firms.       This research will contribute important new insights  into the relationship between manufacturing firm  productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness and the  factors affecting the degree and type of producer service  interactions. As such, the project will make substantial  contributions to theories related to industrial and producer  service location, organization, and performance as well as  to issues of intense interest to regional and economic  development policy.",
