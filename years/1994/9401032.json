This has three parts.  The first is to understand the  structure theory of the invariants themselves.  For manifolds of  simple type, this has been accomplished by Kronheimer and Mrowka  and, using completely different techniques, by the investigator  and R. Stern.  The investigator and R. Stern have also proved a  blowup formula for the Donaldson invariant of a general  4-manifold, and one expects that this formula, together with the  techniques used in the simple-type case, will lead to a general  structure theory.  The second part of this project is the  calculation of Donaldson invariants.  The investigator intends to  use his technique of 'rational blowdowns' to provide  calculations.  This involves giving a general formula for the  Donaldson invariant of a rational blowdown, which has essentially  been done by the investigator and R. Stern (some details remain  to be checked) and which leads, e.g., to the calculation of  complete Donaldson invariants for all elliptic surfaces and many  other interesting examples.  The final part of the project is to  produce new examples to which these invariants can be applied in  order to find some order in the classification theory.       Four-dimensional manifolds are spaces which locally have the  structure of 4-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g. 3 'spatial' and  one 'time' dimension).  These manifolds play a central role in  topology, for in 4 dimensions both the powerful techniques of  higher dimensional surgery and the more special and intricate  techniques of lower dimensions break down.  This is, of course,  also the most physically relevant situation, and there is a vast  literature in theoretical physics related to 4-dimensional  topology.  For many years 4-manifolds were studied by applying  techniques from both higher and lower dimensions, and the results  were mostly unsatisfactory.  In 1 984, Simon Donaldson introduced  a powerful technique stemming from the interplay between  4-dimensional geometry and theoretical physics via the Yang-Mills  equation.  Donaldson's techniques have had startling  consequences, and a school of topologists and geometers has  formed in the hope of using these techniques to understand  4-dimensional topology completely.  (That this is not too far  removed from the physics which helped spawn the theory is  evidenced by the many contributions by physicists such as  Witten.)  In the last year, especially, progress has been very  rapid.  The investigator hopes to make further contributions both  to the understanding of the Donaldson invariant and to the  classification of 4-dimensional manifolds.  ***",
