 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316449  Martinson  This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part of an  integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the  western Weddell Sea.  The field work was carried out from an ice  camp jointly occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February  to June 1992.  The data set obtained by the principal investigator  had as its objective the definition of the vertical and horizontal  thermohaline fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre.   Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the Reynolds  stress and the turbulent heat flux directly were suspended from the  ice at the camp and maintained throughout the duration of the  drift.  Also, a remote buoy to measure upper ocean temperature,  salinity, and current structure was emplaced to make observations  on the larger scale variability within which the turbulence data is  embedded, and which is expected to have some effect on the  turbulence intensity.  The analysis program will be carried out in  conjunction with those of other concurrent experiments to quantify  the energy brought to the underside of the ice, working toward the  general goal of tracing the flux of energy from the ocean through  the sea ice cover to the atmosphere.  ***",
