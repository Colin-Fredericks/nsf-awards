 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416441  Moehle  It has been common practice in building seismic design to  assume part of the building resists all the seismic forces  and the remainder of the building resists only gravity  forces.  Though code provisions require the gravity-load-  carrying system to be designed to accommodate the imposed  lateral drifts, it is not clear that the procedures for  checking the imposed drifts are adequate, and it is not  certain that many engineers actually check the gravity  system for lateral drifts.  Several reinforced concrete (RC)  buildings designed in this way sustained damage and collapse  associated with failure of the so-called gravity columns  (the columns not designed to resist lateral forces.    This project is to develop improved understanding of the  factors leading to failure of RC gravity columns, as well as  to develop improved designed approaches.  This need is  relevant to evaluation and upgrading of existing buildings,  and equally relevant to the design of new buildings.  The  proposed research will address this need using analytical  methods based on experimental evidence, and will involve  both academic researchers and design professionals.    Specifically, the research tasks include:  (a) study of the  deformability of reinforced concrete columns; (b) study of  deformation demands imposed on columns by practical building  systems; (c) examination of practical procedures for design  and evaluation; (d) transfer of findings to relevant  code/guidelines activities; (e) coordination of other  Northridge research projects that are related to the ongoing  NSF R/R program; and (f) contribution to the professional  papers series to be assembled by NEHRP agencies, as well as  other publications and professional presentations.    This is a Northridge earthquake project.  ***",
