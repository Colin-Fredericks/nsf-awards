This research conference  is held every two years; the next meeting will be held February 6-11, 1994, at the Doubletree Hotel,  Ventura, California. Seven conferences have been held since 1981 and they have proven to be extremely  productive based on the large number of applicants and the post-meeting evaluations. Funds are requested  to partially support travel, subsistence and registration costs for speakers and session chairs from the  United States and one individual from Canada. All attendees at the past two conferences were invited to  submit suggestions for the prograrn to be presented in 1994. Nearly one half replied, and their suggestions  were used along with those from some principal advisors to select and invite the speakers listed in the  1994 program. All speakers have accepted the invitation to describe their frontier research on oxygen  radicals in biology. Topics to be covered include: (i) superoxide radical, superoxide dismutase, familial  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), SOD mimics; (ii) nitric oxide and peroxynitrite chemistry and  pathology, nitric oxide synthesis, nitric oxide progenitors and toxicology, nitric oxide and cell signaling,  (iii) oxidants and gene regulation, antioxidants and gene regulation, free radical base damage and DNA  replication, reclox regulation of gene expression and DNA repair, (iv) in vivo sources of iron and  generation of oxidative stress, iron regulatory element and ferritin gene expression, (v) in vivo radical  detection methods, (vi) antioxidants and peroxidation of lipoproteins, radical damage and disease. In  addition there will be a plenary evening lecture on the biological consequences of oxidative stress. Two  separate poster session of two  days each are scheduled for an anticipated 75-80 posters. Total attendance  is limited to 135 by Gordon Conference rules. The Gordon Research Conference provides an excellent  and needed forum for the diversity of both participants and research areas. The main strength of this  Gordon Research Conference is the opportunities offered for scientists in different disciplines to interact  in an extended and uninterrupted fashion. Cross fertilization of cognate fields occurs and attendees  frequently establish new collaborative research initiatives. The Gordon Research Conference on Oxygen  Radicals in Biology plays a crucial role in establishing frontier research in an increasingly important and  clinically relevant field.  %%%  The Gordon Research Conference on \"Oxygen Radicals in Biology\" is designed to provide chemists,  biophysicist, biochemists, cell biologists, clinicians, radiologists and other biomedical scientists with  \"cutting edge\" science on oxygen radicals in chemical and biological systems. This research conference  is held every two years; the next meeting will be held February 6-11, 1994, at the Doubletree Hotel,  Ventura, California. Frontier research on oxygen radicals in biology will be presented and discussed in  detail in an informal setting. Topics to be covered include: (i) key aspects of diseases that appear to be  related to failure to protect against the toxic effects of oxygen. Thus the Conference will learn the latest  information of the active forms oxygen, the superoxide radical, and the enzyme, superoxide dismutase,  recently found to be associated with Lou Gehrigs disease. This disease of the motor functions of the  central nervous system is also known as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). New agents and  possible drugs for the disease, superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics will be described including how they  may in the future substitute for the damaged SOD that appears to have undergone mutation in some of  the patients with FALS. A most exciting aspect o f the Conference will be the sessions on the cell  signaling system based on a toxic gas, nitric oxide, (NO). This compound is also important in the killing  of foreign bacteria by its reaction with active oxygen, superoxide radical, to form an even more toxic  compound. peroxynitrite. The chemistry and pathology of this compound should provide very important  information about various systems in the body that are important for our protection by the white cells or  leukocytes of the blood against infections. We now know that oxygen-based stress can cause gene  regulation, thus the need for antioxidants such as vitamin E to protect against gene damage can be related  to free radical base damage and repair. In vivo sources of iron generate oxidative stress by activation of  oxygen. Thus, iron regulatory element and ferritin (an iron carrying protein) gene expression are essential  for the control of iron in the body. These will be discussed in some detail. In vivo radical detection  methods, antioxidants and peroxidation of lipoproteins, radical damage and related diseases are also topics  for the Conference. In addition there will be a plenary evening lecture on the biological consequences of  oxidative stress and relationships to human diseases and aging. Two separate poster session of two days  each are scheduled for an anticipated 75-80 posters. Total attendance is limited to 135 by Gordon  Conference rules.
