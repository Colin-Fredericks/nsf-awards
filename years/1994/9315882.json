The project was begun in 1992 an involves other  U.S. investigators from the Brookhaven National  Laboratory, Florida State University, the  University of Illinois, and Iowa State  University.  Other Japanese investigators are  from Yokohama National University, Iwate  University, Seikei University, and Waseda  University.    The specific issues to be covered in this phase  of the collaborative effort are:  (1) improvement  in critical currents in high-Tc superconductors,  (2) conductor issues other than critical  currents, and (3) magnet issues.  The United  States and Japan are the leaders and rivals in  superconducting magnet technology and are the  nations most intensely engaged in high-Tc  superconductor research and development.  At  present, since the R&D effort in Japan on high-Tc  superconductivity, both in university and  industry, is substantially grater than it is in  the United States, it is likely that this  exchange program will benefit the United States  researchers.  ***",
