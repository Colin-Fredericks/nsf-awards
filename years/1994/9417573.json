 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417573  Ramirez  The primary objectives of this research starter grant are to clone and characterize the genes  REC1 and REC3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought function in the overlapping   processes of mitotic recombination and DNA repair. rec1- and rec3- strains have been shown   to be defective in mitotic recombination and possess temperature sensitive phenotypes     rec 1- is a ts-lethal at 39{SYMBOL 176 \\f \"Symbol\"}, while both rec1- and rec3- are ts with respect to mitotic   recombination, X-ray sensitivity and sporulation at 36{SYMBOL 176 \\f \"Symbol\"}. Additionally, both these mutations   define distinct genes which map to chromosome 11. A yeast genomic library will be used   to transform rec1- and rec3- strains of S. cerevisiae in order to clone the corresponding   wild-type genes by complementation. Previous studies aimed at cloning the REC3 gene   resulted in the isolation of a suppressor of rec3-, RPD3. (RPD3 is thought to encode   pleiotropic transcriptional regulator encoded on chromosome XIV). Hence, we will focus   our efforts on characterizing clones which complement the rec1- and rec3- mutations and   which specifically hybridize to chromosome Vll DNA on a Southern blot of electrophoretically   separated whole chromosomes. To accelarate cloning of REC3, we will also test a genetic  clone that maps closely to the REC3 locus (i.e., a clone containing genetic material   adjacent to the AR02 gene) to determine if it contains sequences which complement the   rec3- defect. Once cloned, the REC1 and REC3 clones will be sequenced. The resulting   genetic sequence will be compared to other sequences genetic sequence data bases to   gain insight into the function of the proteins encoded by these genes. Cloned REC1 and   REC3 DNA will also be used to create null mutations to provide definitive mapping   information, to determine lethality, and to assay gene expression by Northern   hybridization. Since we have found that RPD3 suppresses the rec3- defect, an additional   objecti ve of this proposal is to determine the possible role played by RPD3 in recombination.  This will be tested by testing the sensitivity of rpd- strains to ionizing radiation, methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), and measuring rates of recombination.    %%%  The information generated frorm, this basic research project will contribute to our knowledge   of the regulation and/or enzymology of recombination and DNA repair in eukaryotes.  ***",
