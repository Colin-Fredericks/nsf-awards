Many  experiments that have traditionally been performed in a laboratory  are being augmented or replaced by computational simulations. A  computational scientist or engineer applies computational  technology in innovative and essential ways to advance the  respective discipline. Computational scientists and engineers work  to obtain a better understanding of some phenomena through a  judicious match of the scientific problem, the mathematical model  that describes it, the numerical technique employed in its  solution, the computer language and the computer architecture used  in its implementation, and the assessment of each of these steps  through visualization.  This project builds a visualization laboratory to support the  undergraduate computational sciences curricula. The goal is the  integration of visualization with the computational science courses  taken by all science and engineering undergraduate majors. We are  establishing a classroom demonstration and a visualization  laboratory available for the students use during scheduled  laboratory hours. The instructor uses the classroom demonstration  to bring to life important aspects of the material. The  visualization laboratory is integrated into courses that use a  problem driven paradigm for the presentation of the material. This  enhances the retention of computing technology by engineers and  scientist and facilitates their use and integration into other  areas of science and engineering curricula.",
