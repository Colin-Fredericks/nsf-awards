Half of the  educators are elementary, middle school and secondary school  science teachers and half are college faculty.  The purposes of the  project are three-fold: i) to use the international experience to  enhance the leadership of the teachers within their own local,  regional and national networks; ii) to introduce teachers to issues  of chemistry and science education in other countries expanding  their knowledge and classroom implementation options; and, iii) to  sensitize teachers to ways of teaching chemistry to different  cultural groups, especially those of Hispanic and African ancestry.   Participants attend two orientation workshops, one prior to and one  during the conference, to enhance their participation in the formal  program and to plan networking activities upon their return to the  United States.  Teachers also visit schools in Puerto Rico.   Networking activities include participation in an ACS-supported  symposium on the San Juan Conference at the 1995 ChemED Conference;  regional workshops and lectures; and articles in journals,  newsletters, and teacher magazines.",
