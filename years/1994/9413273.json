These data include the  largest horizontal ground motion ever recorded.  The damage  associated with these large ground motions is well  documented.    In some of the near-field accelerograms, particularly the  Sylmar station, there is evidence of a significant long  period displacement pulse in the ground motion.  The  existence of such motion has recently been the subject of  great concern as it relates to the design of base isolated  and high-rise structures. These structures are particularly  susceptible to large input displacements.  There is a  recognized need to better understand the nature of this long  period motion and, ultimately, to be able to model and  predict is occurrence.    Present routine techniques for the processing of strong  motion data tend to remove or distort the long-period  information from recorded accelerograms.  However, under a  recent NSF exploratory grant, techniques have been developed  to recover much of the long-period information in  accelerograms.  This is accomplished by nontraditional  baseline correction and signal processing that is based on  an improved understanding of the physics of the ground  motion and the nature of the recording instruments. The  techniques have been verified for ground motions from the  Landers earthquake.    The goal of this research program is to apply the recently  developed data processing techniques to a suite of  earthquake records from the Northridge earthquake.  The  ultimate goal is to provide a basis for guidelines that may  be used to characterize the long-period content of  earthquake motion for structural design.  This exploratory  investigation addresses the following questions:    1.  What is the nature of the long period (displacement)  content of ground motion from this type of thrust  earthquake?    2.  How does this vary with distance from th e epicenter and  orientation with respect to the fault plain.    3.  How is the long-period content (peak displacement)  related to the short-period content (peak acceleration)?    4.  What generalizations can be made to future events of  this, or another, type?    5.  Is there a correlation between the observed long-period  ground motion and structural damage?    The research is based on digital data obtained from the  California Division of Mines and Geology and the U.S.  Geological Survey.  ***",
