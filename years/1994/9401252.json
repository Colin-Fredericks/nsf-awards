 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401252  Jorgensen       Professor Jorgensen will continue his research on  representations and harmonic analysis of algebras arising in  deformation theory and quantum group duality. The emphasis will  be on identifying positive energy representations, putting at  disposal methods from operators in Hilbert space. The problems  include: stability of isomorphism classes under variation of the  deformations and also continuity as fields of C*-algebras for  variations within the stability domain. He will also work on  spectral duality for Borel sets in n-dimensional Euclidean  space of finite measure; and, more generally, on duality theory  for operator algebras, e.g., for periodic elliptic operators.  The isomorphism invariants for spectral pairs turn out to be  affine fractals with self-dualiy in their harmonic analysis.  Jorgensen plans to study this, as self-duality appears also to be  an important tool for other fractal objects arising in geometric  iteration theory. The methods include a recently discovered  (by Jorgensen in joint work with S. Pedersen) duality for pairs  of representations of the Cuntz-C*-algebras. This project  involves multi-dimensional wavelet generators. The method of  wavelets is a new mathematical field which, in the past few  years, has attracted much attention from natural scientists,  engineers, and experts in signal processing. Among new  mathematical disciplines, it is unique in providing so  many immediate and medium-term applications in so many diverse  fields. With wavelets, one can now expect, for example, clearer  transmission and more bands in such down-to-earth applications  as cellular phones, high-definition television and  high-fidelity music reproduction. Wavelets appear to imitate  biological processes like the eye and ear in that they  concentrate on borderlines or edges. Thus they are potentially  the natural interface for neural nets, the brain imitators of the  computer world. Though wavelet theory as a scientific discipline  was \"born\" in 1988, it  has its roots in the work of geophysicist  Jean Morlet, who devised an ad hoc wavelet-type tool to help  find underground oil deposits. The problem involved was a  familiar problem of inverse scattering. This is the point at  which Jorgensen's research in operator theory and harmonic  analysis can be applied.  ***",
