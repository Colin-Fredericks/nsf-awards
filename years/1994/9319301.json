These models use mathematical descriptions of  the physiology and behavior of individuals to predict properties of  populations.  The PIs view individual-based models, not as an end  in themselves, but as part of a process that can allow them to  develop testable theory.  They aim to identify those components of  individual physiology that are key to predicting population  dynamics.%%%       The system for which these questions will be explored is the  zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food supply.  This system is  appropriate for many reasons.  Daphnia is an important genus in  many natural lakes and ponds and previous studies have identified  common dynamic patterns across many populations; thus any  understanding gained from the population models is likely to be  ecologically important.  The physiology of the more common Daphnia  species is well documented, in part because of their common use in  toxicological studies, and the PIs have a major on-going program of  research on the energetics of individual Daphnia.  Daphnia  populations in large stock tanks have been studied by one of the  PIs and by one of our collaborators, Dr. E. McCauley at the  University of Calgary.  Thus the chosen system offers the  possibility of studying the individual-to-population link in  systems of increasing complexity.%%%     The \"deliverables\" from the project will be of three kinds: (1)  increased insight into the population dynamics of the chosen  system, (2) sharper understanding of the processes of formulating,  testing and simplifying individual-based models, and (3) new  general theory.***",
