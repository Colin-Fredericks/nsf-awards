 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320845  Hart         This project continues research on the financial structure  of firms and bankruptcy reform that were stimulated by and are  relevant to the political and economic changes in Eastern Europe  and the Former Soviet Union.  Specifically, the investigator and  collaborators have devised new bankruptcy procedures which appear  to be superior to Chapters 7 and 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.   This project will study theoretical and practical questions  raised by the procedure.  The investigator will also continue  work on entrepreneurial debt contracts, corporate financial  structure and the theory of the firm.         Under the previous project the investigator studied  bankruptcy procedure as part of the transitions to capitalism in  Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union.  This research led to  a new bankruptcy procedure that the investigators found to be  superior to existing procedures.  Under this bankruptcy  procedure, a bankrupt firm's debts are cancelled, all the equity  is given to the former creditors and these creditors as the new  owners decide whether the firm should be sold off for cash or  reorganized as a going concern.  The judge supervising the  procedure solicits cash and noncash bids.  In a noncash bid,  someone offers securities in the post-bankruptcy firm instead of  cash.  For example, the old management team or a new management  team could offer the new owners of the firm a combination of  shares and bonds in the post-bankruptcy firm.  The creditors  would decide by a simple majority vote which bid to select.  The  firm then exits from bankruptcy.  This procedure is superior to  existing bankruptcy law because it transforms a group of people  with different claims and therefore different objectives into a  homogeneous class of shareholders with a common objective (value  maximization) and then puts the firm's future to a simple  majority vote.  The procedure avoids costly and inefficient  haggling over the division of the assets of a bankrupt firm  be cause it provides a mechanical procedure for the division of  the pie.           This project pursues a number of extensions and elaborations  of the proposed procedure.  These extensions include analysis of  alternative voting arrangements, more precise estimates of the  benefits of adopting this new procedure, and an ambitious effort  to derive optimal bankruptcy procedures in an incomplete  contracting setting.",
