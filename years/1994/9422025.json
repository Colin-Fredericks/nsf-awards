 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      This project is a workshop and is a contribution to the  Arctic System Science Program. It will  be held  at the Byrd  Polar Research Center  where key scientific questions  related to processes and environmental change in the Russian  Arctic  continental  shelves and adjacent lowlands will be  defined.  A total of 35 participants, covering a range of  disciplines in the bio-, geo- and social sciences will be  invited to  formulate scientific priorities.  This workshop  will focus on defining interdisciplinary and circumarctic  research themes that would elucidate land/shelf  interactions.   A broad topical, temporal and spatial  framework for the workshop is proposed to attract a wide  group of scientists and identify the most compelling  research ideas.    The direction and mechanisms of climate change cannot be  adequately addressed without a  better understanding of  processes and environments of the shelf seas of the Russian  Arctic and the adjacent lowlands.  Epicontinental shelf seas  bounded by the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans  comprise  25% of  the shelf  area of oceans and modulate key climatic  parameters  such as the exchange of oceanic heat,  atmospheric gases, sea-ice and fresh water input.   Large  uncertainties  remain on the cause, magnitude and timing of  past glaciations in Siberia and concomitant changes in sea-  ice, vegetation, fluvial discharge and animal migrations.  Many present  day issues relating to land/Arctic Ocean  interactions also need to be evaluated.    This is a \"ground up\" effort to assess the American  scientific community's sense of  priorities for research in  the Russian Arctic.  The workshop is an important step for  the integration of North American scholarship with that of  Russian colleagues who have decades of experience on these  problems.   The consensus of research priorities will  provide a conceptual nucleus for proposing a  Russian Arctic  Science dimension for ARCSS.",
