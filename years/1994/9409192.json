 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409192  Barber    This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  funds initial exploration of artificially-intelligent agent-based  architectures for manufacturing automation.  Manufacturing  automation engineers agree that the manufacturing domain is complex  and dynamic. Manufacturing solutions must move toward agent-based  architectures which better model real world behaviors and  knowledge at any instance in time. Agents perform a particular task  or responsibility to achieve a specified goal. A multi-agent system  is comprised of these intelligent agents responsible for their own  communication, diagnosis, repair, control and configuration.   One  of the critical considerations for sensible agent behavior is level  of autonomy.  The extent of autonomy can be distinguished from  locally-autonomous to consensus (negotiation) to command-driven.  The level of autonomy describes the ability of an agent to execute  behaviors independent of approval or direction from other agents  within the system.    This research addresses two topics vital to the success of  manufacturing automation:  formal engineering methodologies and the  distribution of planning, monitoring, and control through  autonomous agents.  The proposed research objective is to develop  a theoretical model for the stability analysis of autonomous agent  behaviors operating in distributed, multi-agent systems.   Responsibility-driven object-oriented methodologies will serve to  provide a formal procedure by which agents are identified,  specified, modified, and maintained.  The theoretical stability  analysis model promotes the practical deployment of autonomous  agents in manufacturing solutions by enabling agents to analyze and  consequently behave sensibly incorporating an understanding of both  global and local goals.",
