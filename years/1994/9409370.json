The purpose in the integration  of these two technologies, which up to now had been developed  mostly in isolation from each other, is to obtain machine learning,  inferencing, and interaction with teachers via multimodal  interfaces which may incorporate natural language and other  modalities in an integral system.  The planning process includes an  extensive literature search, study of possible interfaces for  integration with learnability models, identification of critical  issues in interactive learning research and learning algorithms,  and preliminary design of a prototype for assessing the  effectiveness of such learning systems.",
