The U.S. investigators are Bonnie Dorr and  Martha Palmer, and the French investigator is Patrick Saint-Dizier.   They will collaborate on topics concerning lexical representations  for French and English.  The objective of their research is to  develop a conceptual description for thematic roles and argument  structures.  They will emphasize cross-linguistic distinctions and  the meaning components which are necessary for lexical selection  during machine translation.    Current machine translation systems encounter problems when  extended to new languages or domains.  This joint project will not  only advance our understanding of that problem, but is likely to  lead to a new lexical based framework that can be applied to  machine translation, information retrieval, and automatic lexical  acquisition.   The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration  expertise in lexical-semantic representation.  This is complemented  by Dr. Saint-Dizier's theoretical work in computational  linguistics.  ***",
