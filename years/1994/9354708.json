 "awd_abstract_narration": "9345708  Williams  Both the ACM Task Force on the Core of Computer Science and the  NSF Disciplinary Workshops on Undergraduate Education recommend  scheduled, structured laboratory sessions for undergraduates  studying computer science.  In our experience, students can  make little progress during a lab session when they are working  in a traditional programming language.  Therefore, we are  creating lab software and manuals for a series of \"visual labs\"  in which students use a visual programming environment instead  of a traditional programming language.  They create and test  models (of a CPU, a robot's sensor configuration, a finite  state machine , a database query, or a genetic algorithm, for  example), rather that write code.  Each set of labs is based on  one knowledge area from the Task Force curriculum.  We have  previously created labs for computer architecture, programming  languages, and robotics.  We are now creating labs for database  and information retrieval and for two other knowledge areas  (tentatively artificial intelligence and software methodology  and engineering).  Each set of labs is created by:  defining  pedagogical goals; designing user interaction; developing  specifications and designs for the software; implementing the  software in the C programming language and in the EYES visual  programming toolkit; writing and desktop publishing a manual;  conducting user tests of the software and manual; and revising  the software and manual based on the results of the user tests.   The software and manuals are then used in class.  Our previous  studies revealed that visual labs improve student performance,  compared to no lab at all.  We are currently conducting formal  studies to compare visual labs to traditional programming labs  that cover the same concepts.  We are using an experimental  design developed in conjunction with the university's human  subjects committee.  These studies will reveal whether visual  labs are a useful adjunct to the undergraduate computer scie nce  laboratory curriculum and will yield information about the  usefulness of visual programming for instruction.  Results will  be published in journal and conference papers.  The lab  software and manuals are available for distribution to other  interested colleges and universities.",
