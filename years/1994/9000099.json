 "awd_abstract_narration": "9000099  Blumenschine    With National science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Blumenschine  and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological  research at Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania. They will focus  on two stratigraphic horizons which date to just under 2 million  years ago and which preserve traces of human activity. Dr.  Blumenschine and colleagues will sample these horizons through  carefully controlled excavation and will collect both stone  artifacts and faunal remains. Because each horizon extends over a  considerable horizontal distance, through comparison of samples,  the team will be able to reconstruct a broad range of hominid  (and likely non-hominid) activities, gain insight into  geographically varied behavior, and place this in an  environmental framework.    This research is significant for two primary reasons. First it  will shed new light on the emergence of human cultural  capabilities. Olduvai Gorge has yielded not only important  hominid fossil remains, but also numerous assemblages of stone  tools and apparently associated fauna. These materials have  provided a focus for examination of the cultural capacities of  early hominids. Using data from the Olduvai sites  paleoanthropologists have speculated on issues such as the role  of meat in early hominid diet and questioned whether such peoples  had the ability to hunt. Most of the available data comes from  \"sites\" or dense, spacially clustered groups of stone and bone  remains. Archaeologists however have come to realize that such  clusters represent only one aspect of hominid behavior and that  smaller less dense scatters and areas which have no material at  all can also provide important relevant information. Dr.  Blumenschine and colleagues will focus their attention in a  systematic fashion on both the \"clusters\" and the scatter between  the sites. Secondly, this work will help to pioneer the field of  \"landscape archaeology.\" The team will develop techniques for the  collection and analysis of non-s ite data and these methods will  be applicable in a wide variety of archaeological situations.    This work will provide insight into early hominid behavior. It  will yield data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in  the training of Tanzanian researchers. It will serve to  strengthen the scientific ties between African and United States  scientists.  ***",
