The consortium has established Long-Range Goals for a Center: to  link the consortium state-wide; to establish partnerships in  education, industry, and government that result in regional science  academies; to validate the skills requirements of regional  employers; to produce and implement interdisciplinary curricula and  methodologies for delivery of instruction in mathematics, science  and technology core courses; to produce and implement integrated  curricula in environmental technology; to strengthen enrollment,  retention, and job placement for women and minorities; to establish  a network between industry and education that results in  internships and cooperative exchanges; and to disseminate the  results of the Center's activities.  Texas CREATE anticipates the following activities during planning  year: organization of interdisciplinary teams; commitments from  regional partners that will lead to science academies;  establishment of the scope of investigation to be performed by the  center; development of communication links; brainstorming with  partners at regional meetings; development of a canvassing  instrument for surveying industries; development, testing, and  refinement of a model instruction module; development of a model  for faculty enhancement and teacher training; development of a  strategy for recruitment, retention and job placement for women and  minorities; recommendation on several environmental technology  programs and a plan for integrating environmental technology into  programs that exist; and a model for curriculum development.  ***",
