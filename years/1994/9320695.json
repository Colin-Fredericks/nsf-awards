 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320695  Levine    At times powerful governments seem to be seized by economic  forces beyond their ability to control:  during a twenty-four  hour period, for example, the British government raised interest  rates to astronomical levels, swearing under no circumstances to  devalue the pound, only to do exactly that.  At other times,  seemingly minor tinkering with policy can unleash profound and  unplanned change: the enormous changes in the former Soviet  Union, for example, seem to have been triggered by relatively  mild political reforms introduced by Gorbachev in the mid-  eighties.  This project develops and experimentally tests a  rigorous theory that makes quantitative predictions about the  strength of economic forces.  To the extent that such predictions  are correct, they are of great value, directing attention to  those types of problems and situations where policy can make a  real difference.  This project uses data from experimental  economics to validate the theory and improves the predictive  power of the theory in assessing situations where economic forces  are extremely weak, such as the case with the changes unfolding  in the former Soviet Union.",
