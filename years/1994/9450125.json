 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many large granitic bodies (plutons) are thought to originate as  partial melts at mid-crustal levels.  However, there is as yet no  clear understanding of the process of forming a large amount of  melt under such conditions nor of the source and transport of the  necessary H2O.  This detailed study of two small but well-exposed  areas in the Swiss Alps could reveal an incipient state of pluton  formation.  The proposed research will explore the feasibility of  generating a granitic pluton from such an area by using several  analytical techniques to characterize the rocks in major and  trace element composition, estimates of P-T conditions, stable  and radiogenic isotopes, and fluid inclusions.  The results will  also  contribute toward a better understanding of overall crustal  processes.    Interactive activities include; recruiting a female graduate  student to participate in the research; conducting a seminar at  graduate level and acting as a guest lecturer in undergraduate  classes with a special emphasis on promoting interest in natural  resources, environmental and social impacts of resources  exploitation, and conservation.",
