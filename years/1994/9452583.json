This will be accomplished by developing a comprehensive,  four-semester physics laboratory sequence based on the physics  education and cognitive research based curriculum of Real-Time  Physics. This curriculum relies upon the integration of  microcomputers into the laboratory to perform data collection,  analysis, and graphing, as well as to construct, execute, and  display simulations of physical phenomenon.  However, some units of Real-Time Physics are not yet commercially  available and, even when completed, Real-Time Physics will not  provide a comprehensive laboratory curriculum. Therefore, aspects  of other curricula, including Workshop Physics, Tools for  Scientific Thinking and Spreadsheet Physics will be integrated with  Real-Time Physics into a four-semester laboratory curriculum.  This project will encourage students to continue study in physics  or engineering, help prepare MCC physics courses for the next  century, and to stimulate other colleges, both two-year and  four-year, to adopt this approach.",
