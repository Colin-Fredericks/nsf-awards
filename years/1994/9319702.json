 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at determining whether glial cells in  lamprey spinal cord revert to an earlier developmental type  in response to injury.  In most vertebrates, the main type  of glial cell, the astrocyte, is filled with bundles of  filaments composed of a protein called glial fibrillary  acidic protein (GFAP).  However, in animals, such as the sea  lamprey, that show regeneration in the central nervous  system, the glial filaments are composed of keratins,  similar to the protein that makes skin tough, and are  interconnected by a network of \"spot weld\" mechanical  contacts called \"desmosomes\".  Our laboratory is determining  the reasons for this correlation.  In the lamprey, three  different keratin subunits combine in different proportions  to form filaments in glial cells of brain and spinal cord.  Near a spinal cord transection, the glial filaments become  like those found in the brain.  Since the brain develops  later than the spinal cord, this may represent a  developmentally more primitive glial cell.  The goal of the  present proposal is to determine whether this change in  keratin composition truly represents a reversion to an  earlier embryonic form and whether this comes about by a  change in the relative rates of synthesis of the three  keratin subunits.  We will clone and sequence the gene for  each of the three subunits and thus generate molecular  probes with which to determine how actively each subunit is  made.  In situ hybridization will be used on brains and  spinal cords from animals of different ages, in order to  determine how the mix of keratin subunits expressed by glial  cells changes during development.  Then we will compare this  pattern of change with the pattern seen in glial cells at  the site of a spinal cord cut.  If there is evidence from  the composition of keratin filaments for a reversion of  glial cells to an earlier developmental form, future work in  the laboratory will be targeted toward discovering the  molecules on the surface of the Glial cells  that may be  responsible for guiding nerve fibers during their  regeneration and presumably also their early development.",
