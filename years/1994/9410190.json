Such developments include models of  bargaining, optimal decisions and equilibrium under risk, and  optimal provision of incentives to individuals who possess  private information.  This project applies such models to two  issues:  (1) how democratic institutions emerge and  (2) the relationship between gender, fertility, education, and  growth both at a theoretical and an empirical level.         Most of the countries with outstanding records of sustained  economic growth throughout most of the past several centuries are  the same countries that have had some sort of democratic system  throughout most of that period.  This project focuses on the  association between stable democratic government and sustained  economic growth in these nations.  This relationship is poorly  understood.  In fact, our scientific understanding of why  democratic systems emerge at all is still sketchy.  This project  extends and evaluates (in light of historical data) a new theory  by the investigators on how parliamentary governments emerge.   This theory emphasizes how parliamentary systems can emerge  initially as a rational response to the incentive problems of  rulers caused by private information.         The other part of the project examines the relationship  between women's status and economic development, with particular  emphasis on the role of fertility and education.  Several  economic models to date have examined education and fertility  choices and their importance for economic development.  However,  all of these models completely ignore gender by studying the  behavior of fictitious, genderless economic agents.  But  empirical evidence for a number of developing and developed  countries shows that women receive less education that men.  This  project develops a two-sex bargaining model of endogenous growth  and explores the relationship bet ween gender, fertility,  education, and growth both at a theoretical and an empirical  level.",
