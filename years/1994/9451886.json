Students are trained in this area and  become involved actively with research in both classroom and  laboratory situations. They also have the option of incorporating  independent research investigations into their undergraduate  studies. Specific courses include Experimental Psychology, Child  Psychology, and Human Growth and Development. The project also  allows students enrolled in Psychology Honors Thesis and  Independent Research courses to conduct original behavioral  observation research and analyze their findings more effectively.  It is expected that the project will also add a real-life research  methodology into the curriculum and, combined with a computer  laboratory already accessible to students, will give students a  unique and sophisticated background in research methods in  psychology.",
