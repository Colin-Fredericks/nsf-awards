 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will combine their two areas of expertise,\r\ntopology and dynamical systems, to investigate open questions\r\nin knot theory. In particular, they will investigate Lehmer's\r\nQuestion. Seventy years ago D.H. Lehmer began constructing large prime\r\nnumbers using polynomials that are small in a precise sense:\r\nintegral polynomials with Mahler measure close to but\r\ndifferent from 1. Lehmer could do no better than 1.17628...,\r\na value that he achieved with a remarkable polynomial of\r\ndegree 10. He then asked if that value could improved.\r\nLehmer's Question remains open despite the best efforts of\r\nmany. Lehmer's polynomial continues to appear in surprisingly\r\nseparated fields. The investigators will attack Lehmer's Question from the\r\nperspective of topology and geometry. They will investigate\r\napplications of Mahler measure to the study of knots and\r\nlinks. Their methods will include traditional ones from\r\ncommutative algebra, group theory, geometry and topology, as\r\nwell as new techniques, many from dynamical systems. Computer\r\nmethods will be used to develop examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mathematical theory of knots arose from\r\nphysical theories of the nineteenth century. Since then,\r\nthe field has expanded greatly, attracting the interests\r\nof scientists in many fields, including biology, chemistry\r\nand physics. Some  reasons for the attraction are not hard to\r\nsee. DNA, solar plasma filaments and fluid flow, for example,\r\nall exhibit knotting or linking behaviour. The investigators\r\nwill combine their two areas of expertise, topology and\r\ndynamical systems, to investigate open questions in knot\r\ntheory. The proposed research will provide new understanding\r\nof knots and links by using techniques from symbolic\r\ndynamical systems, a mathematical branch  of information\r\ntheory. It will promote and strengthen interaction between\r\nresearchers in different fields. Undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents will participate in the project.\r\n\r\n",
