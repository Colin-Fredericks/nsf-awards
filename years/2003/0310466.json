 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complexity theory addresses the question of how much resource \r\nis needed to solve a given computational problem.  In recent \r\nyears complexity theory has found connections and applications \r\nin many scientific and engineering disciplines.  This project \r\nplans to investigate complexity theory across a broad front.  \r\nThe topics include communication complexity, decision trees, \r\nquantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, and other foundational \r\nissues in complexity theory.  Te goal is to gain deep insights \r\ninto the nature of computation, so that one can most effectively \r\nperform computational tasks in any model.  It is expected that \r\na variety of algebraic and combinatorial techniques will be \r\ncalled upon to explore these topics.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most interesting scientific developments in recent years \r\nspring from the realization that complexity theory can be utilized \r\nfor cryptography, and that quantum mechanics can be used for \r\nperforming powerful computation.  Advances in these fronts have \r\nattracted interest from scientific communities at large, \r\nas their relevance is far-reaching.  The research of this project \r\ncould lead to substantial further progress in these two areas.\r\n\r\nIn the broader domain of public education, the Principal Investigator \r\nhas given many speeches in recent years on various topics on \r\ncomplexity, cryptography and quantum computing.  Many of these talks \r\nare geared toward general audiences and often undergraduate students.  \r\nThese lectures, if thoughtfully designed, can stimulate the \r\nintellectual curiosity of young minds and develop their interest \r\nin the computing sciences.  With further advances of research in \r\nthese areas, one can expect that public awareness and interest \r\nwill be further enhanced to the good of a stronger scientific education.",
