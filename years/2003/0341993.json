 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the project are to identify and develop engineering examples and activities that can be integrated into standards-based 7-12 mathematics and science curricula; to help teachers to develop an understanding and appreciation of how mathematics and science concepts taught in their courses are used by practicing scientists and engineers; to prepare teachers to guide their students through the engineering examples and to explore the applications of mathematics and science concepts they have learned; to provide workshops for engineering professors to improve their pedagogical techniques; and to prepare a recruitment and retention plan to increase the diversity of the engineering population. Specifically targeted course materials are prepared for workshops and courses provided for pre-service teachers, in-service teachers, and university faculty members in engineering and education. Follow-up support is provided to participants to assist them in implementing the approaches learned in the workshops. The general perspective of the project utilizes contemporary constructivist theory that integrates aspects of Vygotskian socio-cultural theory, interactionist theories, and social cognitive theories under an umbrella of critical theory.",
