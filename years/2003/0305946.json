 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator applies gauge theoretic methods to the\r\nlittle studied class of 4-dimensional manifolds, namely, smooth\r\nmanifolds having integral homology of the 3--sphere times the\r\ncircle. These manifolds arise naturally as the doubles of homology\r\ncobordisms of integral homology spheres. They remain rather elusive,\r\nmainly because the conventional approach via Donaldson polynomials\r\nand Seiberg--Witten invariants fails due to the lack of second\r\nhomology. Instead, the investigator studies the flat moduli spaces\r\non such manifolds. A creative count of flat connections leads to an\r\ninvariant reminiscent of the Casson invariant for homology 3--spheres.\r\nThe investigator works on developing a torus surgery theory modeled\r\nafter Casson's surgery formula and Fintushel--Stern's knot surgery on\r\n4--manifolds, with the view of using it to relate the above\r\nCasson--type invariant to the classical Rohlin invariant. This\r\napproach is expected to lead to solution of some old and difficult\r\nproblems concerning homology cobordisms of integral homology\r\n3--spheres, smoothing of topological 4--manifolds, and triangulation\r\nof topological manifolds in higher dimensions. A part of the above\r\nprogram is a calculation of the degree zero Donaldson polynomial,\r\nwhich is of great interest in its own right. For mapping tori of\r\nintegral homology spheres, the Donaldson polynomial is identified\r\nwith the equivariant Casson invariant. For homology 4--tori, it is\r\nequal to the Seiberg--Witten invariant, at least modulo 2, thus\r\npartially confirming the Seiberg--Witten conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is an investigation of various properties of\r\nmanifolds in dimensions three and four by methods of gauge theory.\r\nThese methods, rooted in theoretical physics, have revolutionized\r\nlow dimensional topology. In the past twenty years, they have been\r\nactively used to solve many difficult problems. Nevertheless, their\r\npotential is far from being exhausted: the researcher initiates\r\napplication of gauge theoretic methods to a special class of\r\nmanifolds which was overlooked until recently but which is crucial\r\nfor understanding several fundamental questions of topology and\r\ntopological field theory. In addition to advancing knowledge in\r\nthese specific areas, the research has a broader educational impact.\r\nThe principal investigator's teaching experience shows that the\r\ngraduate classes based on the above topics are of great interest to\r\nstudents in both mathematics and physics, thus promoting closer\r\ncooperation between the two sciences. The researcher intends to\r\ndevelop further topics courses, and offer parts of his program as\r\nindependent research projects for graduate students. The research\r\nresults will be broadly disseminated at scientific conferences, in\r\nprofessional journals, and on the internet.\r\n",
