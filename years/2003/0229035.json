Since then, attention has\r\nnaturally focused on dimensions 3 and 4.  Despite dramatic advances\r\n(Thurston, Freedman, Donaldson, Jones, Witten...), many major problems\r\nin these low dimensions remain unsolved, for example the classical\r\n3-dimensional Poincare Conjecture and its smooth 4-dimensional analog.\r\nThe topological classification of 1-connected 4-manifolds was achieved\r\nby Freedman in the early 1980's, but in the smooth case there is not\r\neven a conjectural picture. By contrast, Thurston's Geometrization\r\nConjecture provides a beautiful and coherent description of all\r\n3-manifolds, but is far from established.  In the mid 1980's, Jones'\r\ndiscovery of his polynomial link invariant, together with work of\r\nWitten, led to the introduction into 3-dimensional topology of methods\r\nfrom quantum physics.  The current situation in low-dimensional\r\ntopology is that there are many different directions and methods, but\r\nlittle understanding of the relations between them.  Thus in dimension\r\n3 we have hyperbolic geometry, foliations and laminations, normal\r\nsurfaces, combinatorial geometric methods, quantum invariants, finite\r\ntype invariants, Floer homology,..., while in dimension 4 there are\r\nthe Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theories, symplectic structures,....\r\nThe aim of the conference is to address these topics, and the\r\nconnections between them, and to provide a forum for interaction and\r\nexchange of ideas between experts in the different areas.\r\n\r\nGeometric topology aims to understand n-dimensional manifolds, which\r\nare objects that locally look like ordinary n-dimensional Euclidean\r\nspace (whose points are described by n co-ordinates), but whose global\r\nstructure might be quite complicated. The cases of dimensions 3 and 4\r\nare particularly interesting, being the dimensions of our spatial and\r\nspatial-temporal universes, and it is a striking fact that it is\r\nprecisely these dimensions that are mathematically anomalous.  There\r\nhave been many developments and considerable progress in the fields of\r\n3- and 4-dimensional topology over the last twenty-five years, but, in\r\nboth dimensions, a complete picture is still lacking.  One of the aims\r\nof the conference is to encourage interaction and collaboration\r\nbetween experts in the several different aspects and techniques that\r\nare currently being pursued in low-dimensional topology, and in\r\nparticular between those people working in dimension 3 and those in\r\ndimension 4, where the methods in the two areas tend to be quite\r\ndifferent, but where there are several hints of connections between\r\nthem.  The current disparate state of the subject makes it difficult\r\nfor people beginning research in low-dimensional topology to get a\r\ngood overview of the area, and so by encouraging the participation of\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral researchers, we intend that the\r\nconference should also provide an opportunity for young researchers to\r\nget a broad perspective of the present state of knowledge, directions\r\nbegin pursued, and the main open problems. The invited speakers\r\ninclude some of the world's leading 3- and 4-dimensional topologists,\r\nwhose expertise together covers all the major aspects of the two\r\nfields.\r\n",
