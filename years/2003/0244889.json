The research program fea-tures two central themes, namely 1) The structure and interactions of nucleons and nuclei; and 2) Tests of fundamental symmetries and the standard model. Specific activities include the estab-lished international experiments: G0, HERMES, PHENIX, RCS, Muon g-2,  Lan, and  Cap.  Additionally, the group has a local feasibility effort in hydrogen atomic parity violation (H-APV) and is helping to develop a new neutron electric dipole moment (n-EDM) experiment.  The goal of all of these experiments is to help answer important questions in subatomic physics.  For ex-ample, in G0, HERMES, RCS and the PHENIX spin program, a common query is \"How is the proton built?\" The experiments use different tools such as parity-violating electron scattering, polarized electron-nucleon scattering, real Compton scattering, and polarized proton-proton col-lisions to discover the roles that constituent quarks, sea quarks and gluons (the partons) play to result in the well-known properties of the proton.  The experiments should help settle the debate about how the proton obtains its half-integer spin.  They will also shed light on the relative im-portance of different types of quarks inside the proton revealing, for example, how strange quarks contribute to the proton's charge and magnetic structure.   In the PHENIX program at RHIC, deuteron-nuclei collisions will also be studied to investigate the role that partons play in nuclei.  The Muon g-2, H-APV, and n-EDM activities are all aimed at the second theme, asking the question \"Is the current standard model correct?\"  The most mature of these efforts, g-2, has already provided exciting and suggestive evidence that some type of standard model extension might be required. Completion of this effort and possible extensions will provide either a very stringent limit on new physics or, alternatively, a strong indication that it must be present.  Other precision measurements of fundamental parameters are featured in the ULan and UCap experi-ments.  The first of these will determine the muon lifetime to a precision of one part per million, which can then be interpreted as a 20-fold improvement in the determination of the weak interac-tion strength.  The second experiment will accurately measure the least-well-known weak form factor (gP) of the proton.  This will provide a stringent test of precise theoretical predictions founded on basic symmetries of strong interactions at low energies. In addition to direct physics research out-comes, the group has reached beyond the laboratory to make significant contributions to educa-tion and outreach and will continue to do so.  Research projects contribute substantially to the education of a large number of postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
