 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) Interdisciplinary understanding first within and then among biology, earth science, and physical science is being attained by early childhood through eighth grade (EC-8) preservice teachers by incorporating inquiry and case based instruction into the science curriculum.  The strategies developed by French and Ulrich and further elaborated by Russell and French in mixed major/non-major biology courses are being adapted for use in interdisciplinary science courses designed for preservice teachers preparing for EC-8 certification. The courses support the National Science Education Standards and facilitate modeling of exemplary inquiry based science teaching.  Outcomes being achieved include: a) enhanced courses in science linked to unifying concepts in the state and national standards, b) improved understanding of science content and the nature of science both within and among science disciplines, c) improved preservice teacher attitudes toward science, and d) improved preservice teacher perceived efficacy in teaching science. Results of the project are being disseminated nationally.",
