 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large arrays of spatially distributed dynamical systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern\r\ntechnological applications.These systems can range from the macroscopic,such as vehicular platoons or\r\nUnmaned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)in formation .ight to the microscopic such as micro-mirror or micro-\r\ncantilever arrays.A signi .cant impetus for research on these systems has come from the .eld of Micro-\r\nElectro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)where the construction of very large arrays of sensors and actuators is\r\nnow feasible and economical.It is widely recognized that one of the next frontiers in this area is the systems\r\nleve design of such MEMS,as well as their integrated distributed feedback control and estimation.\r\nFrom the systems point of view,these large actuator/sensor arrays are coupled dynamical systems with\r\na large number of inputs and outputs.Traditional control and estimation techniques are not immediately\r\napplicable to these systems for two main reasons:(a)the computational complexity due to the large scale is\r\ndaunting,and (b)a crucial design consideration is the distributed nature of control and estimation,i.e.which\r\nsensors should communicate with which actuators,and the localization and decentralization requirements on\r\nthe controllers.The second problem,in its general form,is widely recognized to be a very di .cult one,with\r\nabout three decades of related research in the area of decentralized control.It is thus likely that progress will\r\nonly come from exploiting special structures inherent to certain spatially distributed control and estimation\r\nproblems.Recent work by the PI has elucidated e .ective methods for addressing both of the above issues for\r\nspatially distributed systems with certain types of invariances and symmetries.The methods also provide\r\nguidelines and benchmarks for systems that may not posses those symmetries as well.\r\nWe propose to carry out a combined theoretical and experimental research program in the modelling,\r\ndistributed controller design and estimation for large networks of sensors and actuators under a variety of\r\nrelevant design constraints.These ideas and design techniques will be applied to the multi-micro-cantilever\r\nsystems we have been testing at UCSB.\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed research are twofold.The .rst is the development of systematic\r\ndesign methodologies for distributed robust control systems which have architectural constraints.These con-\r\nstraints include the ocalization of information passing between sensors and control units.Such architectural\r\nconstraints are a compromise between fully centralized and fully decentralized control,and are thus expected\r\nto be tractable.Another important aspect of the proposed research is the synergy between MEMS problems\r\nand control theory.Integrated systems design is becoming an increasingly important issue in MEMS.Our\r\nwork in particular will contribute to this in two ways.The .rst is in using distributed estimation as a method\r\nfor simplifying sensor design in a MEMS array,and the second is in the use of feedback (electronically)to\r\nsimplify the mechanical MEMS design.\r\nBroader impacts:This project is based on a synergistic interaction between control theory and MEMS.\r\nIdeas from control engineering are used to design radically simpler MEMS systems,and architectural issues\r\nin MEMS systems are posing new control problems.Students involved in this research will have inter-\r\ndisciplinary training in both dynamics and controls and in MEMS.We anticipate that our results will\r\nenable the design of e .cient MEMS systems which are expected to become an important component of the\r\ntechnological economy.",
