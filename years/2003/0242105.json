 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Society for Risk Analysis (\"SRA\") has begun the groundwork for a series of World Congresses on Risk Analysis in the 21st century.  In partnership with other scientific, governmental and professional organizations interested in risk, SRA is launching the first of this series in 2003.  The First World Congress will be held at the Sheraton Brussels, June 22-25, 2003. \r\n\r\nThe unifying theme for the First World Congress is \"Risk and Governance,\" which reflects the worldwide trend toward making better use of risk-oriented concepts, tools, and processes (derived from both research and practice) in public decision making and risk management. Specific objectives of the First World Congress are to (1) stimulate dialogue on emerging risk issues of worldwide interest, (2) share insights about analytic methods and decision processes used in different regions of the world, (3) demonstrate and disseminate recent advances in risk assessment, management, and communication, and (4) build an organized, international community of individuals dedicated to advancing the state of the art and promoting appropriate use of risk-related tools, concepts, and procedures. \r\n\r\nTo ensure broad participation by various critical communities and decision makers interested in risk analysis at the First World Congress, SRA will use support from the National Science Foundation to provide travel stipends in three key areas:\r\n\r\n1.\tTravel and lodging support for plenary speakers, breakout leaders, and rapporteurs;  \r\n2.\tTravel and lodging stipends for participants from developing countries and Central and Eastern European countries; and\r\n3.\tTravel and lodging stipends for junior faculty or researchers.\r\n",
