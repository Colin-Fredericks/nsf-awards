 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to  investigate the integration of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) with optical switching based on Micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) to make important network elements needed for reconfigurable, high capacity fiber optic networks. Optical networks in place today consist predominantly of DWDM fiber optic links connected by electrical switches with optical interfaces (OEO Switch). The goal of next generation transparent networks is to keep the transmitted optical signals optical. In this way, the switch is as transparent as the fiber itself. A problem is that these switches are surrounded by DWDM multiplexing modules that have significant loss (6 dB each) and are relatively expensive. The goal of this proposal is to design an integrated module containing MOEMS switches with DWDM multiplexers and demultiplexers resulting in a significant size, cost and loss reduction. The MOEMS elements will use the technology developed. Two alternatives will be considered for the DWDM elements. One utilizes Arrayed-Waveguide-Grating (AWG) chips and one design uses bulk gratings. At the conclusion of this Phase I study, one design will be proposed for fabrication under Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe integrated DWDM PXC is needed for emerging reconfigurable DWDM networks, and will find application in commercial and government networks. The capacity is huge: 256 ports carrying 10 Terabit/s of data results in 2.5 Petabit/s switching capacity. The significant risk lies in the integration of the DWDM elements with the optical switch elements, and many tradeoffs need to be investigated. The development of the Internet has resulted in tremendous benefit to society as more people have access to more information, regardless of their background. Continued expansion requires larger switch capacities and reductions in cost.\r\n",
