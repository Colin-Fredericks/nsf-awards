 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for timely and effective dissemination of traveler information in rural areas is underscored by the disproportionately high percentage of traffic accidents and other incidents, exacerbated by the relatively long trip durations and lack of reliable and comprehensive communications infrastructure along the roadways in these areas. Technical and structural approaches that are prevalent in metropolitan areas simply are not feasible for rural settings. This research explores alternative technical and structural approaches to effectively disseminating traveler information in rural areas. A systems engineering approach is used to incorporate technologies and methodologies from diverse disciplines. Peer-to-peer communications between vehicles and between vehicles and roadside sensors, using recent advances in wireless technologies and ad hoc networking protocols are explored to serve as a surrogate for extensive fixed communication and information infrastructure. Human factors and inputs from private and public sector stakeholders are used to further shape the system design. Emerging technologies such as smart antennas are evaluated using requirements-based criteria and an end-to-end system design. Modeling and simulation techniques are used to conduct performance assessments and technology trade-off studies. An outcome of this research will be the design of a prototype that might be deployed in a rural area for a field trial.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will direct future investments in communications and information technology infrastructure that will suit the particular demand of rural and sparsely populated areas. The approach provides a high benefit to cost ratio that meets the structural requirements of large portions of the less populated regions of the country. The benefits go beyond improvements in safety and efficiency, as the infrastructure also supports a broad range of traveler information services that are of value to businesses that rely on transportation, such as fleet management, as well as the broader tourist industry.  The project is highly multi-disciplinary, incorporating expertise from the electrical and computing engineering as well as the transportation sector. Students involved in several facets of the work engage in research that cuts across traditional departmental boundaries. The potential that this project provides to minorities such as Native American communities is extremely high, as the lack of adequate communications and information infrastructure in their areas will be directly and positively affected by the outcomes of this research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
