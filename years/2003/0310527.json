 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Embedded Software for Domain-Specialized Platforms\r\nPI: Ingrid Verbauwhede, UCLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project develops design methods for embedded software in the context of portable, \r\nintegrated and secure platforms. An example of such a platform is a key-chain \r\nor a next-generation smart-card with integrated electronics and embedded\r\nfingerprint sensor. The key-chain allows to use biometrics as a personal key in \r\nelectronic payments or access control. The software for this platform is complex and \r\ndraws from multiple application domains, including signal processing, \r\ncryptography, and protocol transaction processing. \r\nMoreover, this software must integrate encryption and fingerprint signal \r\nco-processors.  Thus, the design method for such software must allow for\r\nmultiple design paradigms to coexist, and at the same time must also make\r\noptimal use of the constrained, embedded form factor to which it is confined.\r\n\r\nThe design method is based on two principles. The first principle is the\r\nuse of virtual machine specializations. A virtual machine allows for a\r\nsmooth, write-once run-everywhere development concept, while the\r\nspecializations allow native support of domain-specific co-processors. The\r\nsecond principle is that of flexible interconnect, which allows to shape\r\nthe target architecture to the application at hand. Both of these methods\r\nare genuine innovations in embedded software design context.\r\n\r\nOn a broader scale, these design techniques are applicable to a wide range \r\nof portable, embedded devices that provide a tighter coupling of secure\r\ninformation infrastructure with the real world. For example, currently\r\ndigital identities are insufficiently coupled to physical identities, \r\nresulting in identity theft becoming a large-scale problem. Software is a\r\nkey enabler to combat this problem, and the design techniques from this\r\nproject will have broad impact by allowing this software to migrate \r\nto the embedded context where it is required.\r\n",
