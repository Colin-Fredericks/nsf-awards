 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) proposes to engage in a \r\nresearch project on departmental/institutional factors which promote retention and baccalaureate \r\ndegree  attainment in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) fields and \r\npersistence to graduate study by members of underrepresented minority  populations at urban \r\ninstitutions.  The Alabama Alliance, established in 1991, is one of the six oldest National Science \r\nFoundation (NSF) Alliances in the nation and has been in the forefront  of efforts to increase the \r\nquantity and the quality  of underrepresented minorities receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM \r\nfields.  Thus, because of this successful experience in developing and implementing programs that \r\npromote retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of minorities, Alabama is uniquely qualified \r\nto engage in a research project of this nature.  While  the Westat  Study  (March 2000) did an \r\noutstanding job of identifying LSAMP programs that work, the questions of why they work has not \r\nbeen addressed.  This project will be a follow-up the Westat Study and will provide a complete and \r\ncomprehensive picture of LSAMP program activities.  The goal is to generate general information \r\nthat builds on the Westat Report and logically extend this work in order to efficiently and logically \r\nguide effective implementation of best practices in diverse institutions.  The objectives include the \r\nfollowing:  1. To determine departmental and institutional factors facilitating undergraduate access \r\nto science, technology,  engineering,  and mathematics (STEM) careers, including baccalaureate \r\ndegree  attainment  and  persistence  to  STEM  graduate  study  by  members  of  traditionally \r\nunderrepresented racial/ethnic groups ( specifically the keys to LSAMP success cited by the Westat \r\nStudy), and  2. To generalize these factors and disseminate resulting findings and measures to the \r\nscientific and education communities. \r\n \r\nThe Alliance will employ the services of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center \r\nfor Educational Accountability to  assist with the research.   The  Center  is  uniquely  positioned  to \r\nconduct the research activities of the proposed project.  The Center has a number of ongoing projects \r\nthat relate  directly  to  the goals  of  the  project.   The  project  will  begin  with  an  in  depth review  and \r\nevaluation of 1. All LSAMP activities at each of the twelve ALSAMP institutions, and 2. Student \r\nperformance data in SEM courses.  Appropriate surveys and interviews will be conducted, data will \r\nbe analyzed, and research findings will be published in an appropriate Educational Research \r\nJournal.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit - The project is an important step in advancing knowledge and understanding of \r\nwhy the LSAMP programs for underrepresented minorities in science technology, engineering, and \r\nmathematics are successful.  Education faculty will work with mathematics and science faculty in \r\nthis educational research project to find answers to these important questions by collecting and \r\nanalyzing data resulting from surveys and individual interviews.  The research results will add to \r\nthe knowledge base in educational research and evaluation.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts - The project broadens participation of underrepresented groups by the inclusion of a \r\nlarge  number  of  African  American  students  in  the  target  population  for  the  research  surveys  and \r\ninterviews.  In addition, a large number of Historically Black Colleges and Universities are included in \r\nthe  Alabama  Alliance  and  the  research  efforts  will  involve  a  diverse  pool  of  students  and  faculty.  \r\nDiscovery  and  understanding  are  advanced  by  the  collaboration  between  disciplines  and  institutions. \r\nEvaluation  and  assessment  findings  will  be  documented  and  disseminated  to  other  researchers  in \r\neducation and at national meetings.",
