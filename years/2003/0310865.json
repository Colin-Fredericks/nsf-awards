 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) Traditional microscopy exercises in Geology often force students into isolation as they\r\nstudy minerals, rocks, and textures using individual microscopes. Group interaction is possible, but not easy, as students must take turns looking into classmates' microscopes. An interactive and engaging classroom environment is more conducive to student learning and the development of analytical thinking skills. The intellectual merit of this proposal is to redesign the undergraduate curriculum at Illinois State University to\r\nincorporate innovative, inquiry-based learning techniques utilizing polarizing microscope workstations and digital imagery. This project is adapting the interactive mineralogy and petrology program developed at Hamilton College.  The goals and broader impacts of the project are: 1) to expose students to modern research and instructional equipment, 2) to enhance student analytical reasoning and problem solving skills, 3) to encourage more students to engage in research utilizing petrographic methods, and 4) to encourage a higher percentage of our students to continue their educations at graduate school, particularly in petrology.\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, we are establishing digital workstations for polarized light microscopy and image analysis. Each course using the new microscopy digital workstations is developing cooperative learning exercises that are inquiry-based and emphasize critical thinking. Groups of students are working with a microscope and video monitor to deliver a live image. These workstations also are equipped with a digital camera to capture still images for subsequent analysis and are being used for in-class presentations. A Luminoscope for cathodoluminescence work is also being included in classroom activities to expose students to an additional technique for examining rocks and mineral textures. This aspect of the project is adapting strategies developed by Patricia Videtich at Grand Valley State University (NSF-9650073).\r\n",
