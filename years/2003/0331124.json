 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnologies have been recognized as a key technological area critical to the economic well-being of the United States in the 21st century, with potentials of unparalleled improvement in our future standard of living.  To realize the potential benefits of nanotechnologies, however, one must develop enabling technologies to scale up the nano-scopic components to micro/meso-scopic products and beyond.  This project assembles a multidisciplinary research team with complementary expertise to investigate integrated processing, manufacturing and modeling issues of a class of very important engineering material for nanotechnologies Carbon nanotube composites.  The goal of this work is to use the atomistic-based continuum models to investigate the properties and manufacturability of carbon nanotube composites.  The proposed research program includes three main thrust areas: i) studying the processing and characterization of nanotube-polymer composites; ii) exploring the applicability of various manufacturing techniques for these composites; and iii) developing multiscale, atomistic-based models for processing, manufacturing, and mechanical properties of nanotube composites.  The  research project is expected to produce physically sound models that can be used to study the manufacturability and properties of nanotube composites, and to address the critical issues related to processing and manufacturing of nanotube composites. \r\n\r\nMany potential benefits may accrue from this research.  At present, there is very limited understanding of the manufacturability of ultra-hard, nano-materials.  The proposed study, through understanding of the mechanisms of material removal and the role of Carbon Nanotubes during the machining process, combined with multi-scale modeling efforts, will provide guidelines for Carbon Nanotubes composite processing to enhance both the mechanical properties and the manufacturability of the composites.  The mechanics analysis will give rise to powerful tools to link nano-structures to the macroscopic behavior of the material.  The results of the proposed research could also be used to model performance of Carbon Nanotubes composites in future applications, such critical load-carrying components in aerospace industry, medical and bio-medical devices.  In addition to the research activities, the proposed program contains a comprehensive educational plan.  The educational plan aims at the broader objective of training and educating graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 school teachers, and the general public on potentials and issues of nanoscale science and engineering and nano-manufacturing.  Specifically, the program highlights efforts to train next generation leaders in nano-manufacturing; to involve middle school and high school teachers in the research through Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program as a vehicle to reach out to K-12 students; to boost participation of members of underrepresented groups by partnering with women and minority student organizations on campus; and to educate the general public about the opportunities and implications of nano-science and engineering by participating in the annual Engineering Open House program.  Furthermore, the proposed educational program is expected to significantly stimulate younger generation's interests in this emerging field, and to improve U.S. industry's future competitiveness in nanotechnology by producing well-trained researchers and engineers.\r\n",
