 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing and delivering a course in Computational Neuroscience originating at Carnegie Mellon University and offered for credit at remote universities.  The course is based on both research performed and workshops taught at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and has a strong computational aspect, with the lectures tied to computational examples. The course utilizes the Access Grid group-to-group communication technology to create a distributed classroom, and utilizes the computational resources of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center for computer-intensive student exercises. The problem addressed by this project is the national need to train students in computational biology in general, and computational neuroscience in particular. It is particularly difficult to meet this need for students in universities in the EPSCoR states. The project's objective is to test whether courses originating in universities affiliated with the National Supercomputing Centers can be disseminated via synchronous interaction with EPSCoR universities. In this particular project the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is collaborating with faculty at the University of Montana, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Edinburgh to provide a distributed course in computational neuroscience. The course addresses geographical diversity and integrates high performance networking and communication, and high performance computing, with education in a manner that would not have been possible until very recently due to limitations in communications technology and accessible computer power.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Education and Human Resources Directorate and by the Division of Experimental and Integrative Activities in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.\r\n",
