 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue population genetic and molecular systematic studies of organisms endemic to deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold-water sulfide/hydrocarbon seeps. Oceanic expeditions over the past 14 years have amassed an extensive collection of ethanol- and cryopreserved specimens from most of the known vent and seep habitats in the world. These specimens will provide a foundation for assessing the evolutionary affinities of newly discovered taxa in biogeographical provinces that presently are poorly understood. Primary objectives are to explore two little known global regions that might provide historical or present-day connections between major biogeographical provinces in the deep-sea: the Easter Microplate region in the eastern Pacific and the Lau/Fiji Basins in the western Pacific. Specimens will be collected with manned or unmanned submersibles and preserved on board the support vessel for subsequent molecular and morphological studies. Molecular analyses (mostly DNA sequencing) will be conducted in a lab at the home institution. Population genetic analyses will focus on assessing genetic diversity and geographical structure, and on estimating modes of dispersal and rates of gene flow within species. Continuing systematic studies will focus on development of robust multi-gene phylogenies for the molluscan and annelid groups that dominate vents. This work will contribute to phylogeographic and systematic perspectives on the dominant species that live in these unusual abyssal communities. \r\n\r\nNumerous undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students will benefit from laboratory and oceanographic experiences associated with this project. New information will be published in the professional literature and made available to the public through web-based resources and presentations.\r\n\r\n",
