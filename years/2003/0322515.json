 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the cells within a multi-cellular organism have equivalent genomes, and distinct cellular identities arise from differences in gene expression.  Thus, a key to deciphering the mechanisms by which individual cell types develop is to identify and characterize the proteins that regulate critical changes in gene expression. \r\n\r\nThe Powell-Coffman laboratory is employing a powerful genetic model system, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to study the regulation and function of a transcriptional complex that regulates neuronal development.  The C. elegans ahr-1 gene is homologous to the vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor.  ahr-1 is expressed in a subset of neurons, and disruption of the ahr-1 gene causes specific neuronal defects.  The near-term research goals of this proposal are to characterize AHR-1 function and regulation in two classes of sensory neurons.  Specific hypotheses regarding the identity of upstream regulators and downstream targets will be tested.  The proposed experiments will provide important insights to AHR-1 signaling.  Additionally, they will further define the genetic circuitry that defines these classes of neurons.\r\n\r\nThe education of undergraduate and graduate researchers is integral to this project.  A central objective is to enable students to become skilled at scientific method and to develop critical thinking skills.  Additionally, this project will provide faculty mentorship and research experience for women and members of ethnic minorities, who are currently underrepresented in science and technological careers.\r\n",
