 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic nuclei are known to exist in a variety of shapes which\r\ninclude spherical, prolate (like a football), oblate (like a doorknob), and \r\noctupole (like a pear).  Although these are different shapes, they\r\nall have one common factor: they are all symmetric about at least one axis. \r\nSomewhat surprisingly, the most difficult nuclear shape to identify is one in\r\nwhich there is no symmetry axis, which would look like a kiwi fruit.  A\r\nnucleus with this asymmetric shape is often said to possess ``triaxial\r\ndeformation'' or have ``triaxiality.''  In fact, only a few nuclei have\r\nestablished cases of triaxial deformation.  However, this shape only occurs in these\r\nnuclei when it is in a highly excited state.  Here, the nucleus is\r\nsignificantly more elongated or more deformed than when in a less excited state. \r\nThis phenomenon is known as ``superdeformation,'' and therefore when the\r\nnucleus is also triaxial it is said to have triaxial superdeformation.  It\r\nwas once thought triaxial superdeformation would only occur in nuclei with\r\nneutron numbers near N = 94, but recently we discovered possible triaxial\r\ndeformation in an isotope of hafnium having N = 102.  In order to confirm this\r\nshape, we must perform another experiment with higher statistics than the\r\nfirst, to search for the presence of wobbling excitations.  These are the\r\nquantum equivalent to an asymmetric top being spun which would display a\r\nwobbling motion.  We will also begin a search for evidence of triaxial \r\nsuperdeformation in the neighboring tantalum nuclei with neutron\r\nnumbers near N = 100.  Therefore, it is our intent to firmly establish this\r\nregion of nuclei as having stable triaxial deformation.\r\n\r\nWe will also participate and possibly lead experiments utilizing\r\nneutron-rich radioactive beams at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Until recently,\r\nthese species of isotopes could not be studied easily as few methods\r\nexisted for exciting the neutron-rich nuclei.  However, Oak Ridge can now\r\nproduce beams of these rare isotopes for further analysis.  Participation in\r\nthese experiments will better prepare the principal investigator to\r\npropose future experiments at this facility and eventually at the Rare Isotope\r\nAccelerator.  In addition, a make-shift radioactive beam can be used at the\r\nFlorida State University laboratory to study select neutron-rich nuclei.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate involvement will be vital in all of these projects. \r\nStudents will learn basic nuclear physics techniques at the Naval Academy,\r\nand then apply this knowledge at the laboratories where this work will be\r\ncompleted.  The opportunity to use world-class facilities will hopefully propel\r\nthese students into scientific careers.\r\n",
