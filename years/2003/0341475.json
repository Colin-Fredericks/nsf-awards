 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER will advance knowledge and understanding of distributed teams by identifying the practices of effective Open Source Software (OSS) development teams. Much of the public discourse about OSS development is based on hype, skepticism or partisan spirit. Only a few careful case studies have been done. In order to better understand how actual OSS developers work, it is necessary to obtain their cooperation to participate in a study. The PI and a student will attend a developers' conference to establish contacts and conduct interviews. In addition, social network analysis tools will be used to better understand the distributed nature of their work practices and relationships. Such research has the potential to increase understanding of distributed work practices. At the same time, it will promote teaching, training and learning by providing graduate and undergraduate students an opportunity to work on this project.",
