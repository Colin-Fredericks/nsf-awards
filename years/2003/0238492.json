 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile code can be defined as executable content that is transferred to a\r\nremote environment and executed there automatically.  Attacks from malicious\r\nmobile code can be detected by analyzing the information associated with the\r\nexecution of code and identifying malicious behavior. This analysis process is\r\ncalled intrusion detection while the process of collecting the necessary\r\ninformation is called auditing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most systems that support code mobility provide no auditing\r\nmechanisms or are able to produce only incomplete information about the\r\nactivity of mobile code.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these problems, a multi-level approach to malicious mobile code\r\ndetection is proposed. The approach relies on the instrumentation of the\r\ndifferent components of the mobile code execution architecture to gather\r\ncomplete information about the actions of the mobile code. The events\r\ncollected at different abstraction levels are used as input to multi-stream\r\nintrusion detection analysis. The intrusion detection process uses both fusion\r\nand correlation techniques to detect attacks and perform proactive response\r\nprocedures that limit the impact of an attack. In particular, the research\r\nfocuses on the containment of the spread of worm applications.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will be used both to retrofit existing systems\r\nand to secure future applications. In particular, in the near future mobile\r\ncode will become a fundamental mechanism for the upgrade and management of\r\nmobile devices, as IP connectivity is brought to the millions of cellular\r\nphones in use today. The use of multi-level intrusion detection will provide\r\ntechniques to protect both the infrastructure and the user terminals against\r\nmalicious mobile code.  \r\n\r\n",
