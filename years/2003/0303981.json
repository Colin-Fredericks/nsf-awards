 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit:\"Electronic nose\"chemical sensor arrays are used to detect trace analytes\r\nin complex mixtures,and are important for environmental,biomedical,process control,and\r\nsecurity-related applications.Scaling chemical sensors to nanometer dimensions will open\r\nunprecedented opportunities for implementation of electronic nose arrays in and-held devices,\r\nremote monitoring,robotics,medical diagnostics,sensor dust,and other novel applications.\r\nTo do this,we must create low cost,low power,massively parallel arrays of chemically diverse\r\nnanosensors and integrate them with on-chip data processing.The proposed project will bring\r\ntogether an interdisciplinary team from three institutions to work on the fundamental problems\r\nconnected with this goal.The project combines the expertise of chemists in nanosensor\r\nsynthesis,physicists in materials and device characterization,electrical engineers in\r\nheterogeneous integration and test circuit design,and computer scientists in the design,\r\nfabrication,and testing of novel low-power circuit architectures.While this project focuses\r\nspecifically on nanosensor arrays,the problems it addresses are generic to the integration of\r\nmany different kinds of functional nanoscale objects into silicon-based circuits.\r\nOur approach builds on an existing knowledge base of chemical sensor array platforms and\r\ndata analysis methods,to which our team brings some unique new materials and techniques.\r\nMallouk and Semancik have developed a method for incorporating chemical sensor \"stripes\"into\r\ntemplate-grown metal nanowires.These nanowires connect the lithographic length scale (micron\r\nnanowire length)with the nanoscale (30-300 nm diameter and stripe length).The synthetic\r\ntechnique allows the chemical nature of the sensory material to be quite diverse.We will focus\r\non three different sensor platforms -chemoresistive metal oxides,intrinsically conducting\r\npolymers,and conductive polymer composites -which should provide excellent orthogonality in\r\nsensor arrays.The physical properties of the sensory materials and of the nanowires will be\r\nstudied using test structures devised by Evoy and Semancik,focusing in particular on the thermal\r\nand temporal signatures of the nanosensor response.The synthesis and physical\r\ncharacterization of the nanosensors will be tightly coupled so that a molecular-level\r\nunderstanding of signal transduction and scaling effects can guide the optimization of the sensors.\r\nMayer and Evoy have developed an electrofluidic alignment technique for placing nanowires in\r\nlithographically defined circuits.This will be a powerful tool for parallel heterogeneous\r\nintegration of the nanosensors into large arrays.Issues of yield,device density,and testing/logic\r\ncircuit integration will be addressed through a combined approach of simulation and experiment,\r\nin collaboration with Irwin and Narayanan.Finally,Irwin,Narayanan,and Mayer will design\r\nand test a CMOS sensor processing fabric that efficiently controls the duty cycle of sensor\r\noperation and processes the array response locally.Feedback between device/circuit testing and\r\nnanosensor synthesis and characterization will tie the whole project together.\r\nBroader impact:The NIRT team will apply its diverse scientific background in education\r\nand outreach activities at the graduate,undergraduate,high school,and K-8 levels.The research\r\nprogram has a strong element of mentoring of women,minorities,undergraduates,and high school\r\nstudents.It will also provide a cross-disciplinary experience for graduate students through\r\nexchange with partner laboratories.In each summer of the program,NIRT faculty and students\r\nwill team with Penn State Action Potential staff to develop a series of 5 th -8 th grade science camps\r\non different current topics.The unique aspect of these camps is that they bring elementary and\r\nmiddle school teachers together with students,so that teachers can use new curricular material in\r\na practical environment.NSF funds will be used to support the participation of teachers from\r\nbeyond our local area,to increase the geographic and minority impact of the outreach program.",
