 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis proposal is for acquisition of a fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy equipment.  The new equipment will offer a significantly better energy\r\nresolution and stability for step-scan capabilities. No FTIR facility currently\r\nexists at the college of engineering.  A number of faculty have formed a collaborative team\r\nfor biomaterials research in collaboration with Mayo Clinic researchers. The FTIR system will be the\r\nnecessary molecular characterization tool for the collaborative research efforts of the PIs.\r\nAcquisition of FTIR capabilities will enhance the educational experience of undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents. PIs also plan to offer a hands-on graduate level course on vibrational spectroscopy for college of\r\nengineering students for which this instrumentation will be used as an important teaching tool. The use of\r\nthe instrument for demonstrative purposes in several courses taught by PIs and as a hands-on learning tool\r\nin Vibrational Spectroscopy, Biomaterials, and Fundamentals of Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials\r\ncourses will be extremely beneficial for students for introducing novel and cutting edge research into the\r\neducational experience of students. PIs are all committed to seeking, promoting and encouraging female\r\nand/or minority students and have several undergraduate students participating in research as part of NSF\r\nresearch experiences for undergraduates program. In addition, the team is actively working to establish a\r\nprogram in Biomedical Engineering at NDSU with full support from central administration. Further, the\r\ninstruments will also be available to industries in the region and those associated with the NDSU\r\ntechnology park for materials characterization. \r\n",
