 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) will undertake a study of conventional industry (such as metallic and plymeric materials) trends, interests and activities in nanomanufacturing technologies, as a preparatory input activitity to the NSF Workshop on Three-Dimensional Nanomanufacturing: Partnering with Industry, planned in conjuction with the NSF Design and Manufacturing Grantees Conference, Birmingham, AL in January 2003. Industry respondents will be polled on their organization's plans for R&D, investments, staffing, production implementation, success stories, and plans for future products incorporating nanotechnology. The survey may be accessed at: http://www.ncms.org/nsfsurvey.htm.\r\n \r\nNCMS is a not-for-profit organization, based in Ann Arbor, MI, and a premier provider of collaborative research, information, knowledge and expertise to the North American manufacturing community. Backed by 150 corporate members, NCMS has spearheaded hundreds of advancements - in advanced materials, electronics, high performance machining, process control, rapid prototyping/manufacturing, enterprise integration, information technology, and environmental conscientiousness - all focused on enhancing the nation's manufacturing competitiveness in the global economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
