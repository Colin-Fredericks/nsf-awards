The advancement of these areas is largely due to the novel application of digital imaging techniques (i.e. synchrotron microtomography, crack tomography) to the study of infrastructure materials, and to the rapid increase in computer processor capacity and availability.  This computational power has facilitated the advancement of a number of computational techniques (i.e. damage mechahnics, micromechanics, stochastic simulation) that were unavailable a few years ago.  Both the experimental and computational techniques have matured to the point where a cohesive research plan would be beneficial to the academic community as the methods continue to develop and become interdependent.  This workshop will provide a forum for the leaders in these research areas to meet and discuss recent advancements as well as to provide a forum to discuss appropriate goals for the further development of this field.\r\n\r\n",
