 "awd_abstract_narration": "De Leenheer\r\n     Recent advances in the life sciences have been aimed at\r\ndeveloping and analyzing mathematical models for complex\r\nbiological systems.  This has been triggered by the need for\r\nknowledge of their long term behavior.  Moreover, a better\r\nunderstanding of these systems might lead to insights in the\r\nunderlying mechanisms, which are usually much more complicated\r\nand less well understood than in the physical sciences.  An\r\nin-depth analysis sometimes reveals unsatisfactory behavior, e.g.\r\nextinction of a certain species or -- at the opposite end of the\r\nspectrum -- persistence of an infectious disease, and require\r\nappropriate modifications.  In this project the investigator uses\r\ncontrol theory in both analysis and possible modification of the\r\nbehavior of biological models.  The main idea is to consider these\r\nmodels from a feedback perspective -- provided this is possible\r\nof course --, which is a central topic of interest in control\r\ntheory.  It is argued that certain biological (sub)systems are\r\nactually feedback systems.  Two examples are studied from this\r\npoint of view.  The first is the chemostat model with crowding\r\neffects, while the second concerns certain classes of\r\npredator-prey systems.  Stability issues are of primary concern in\r\nthis study.  A second part of the work is devoted to control (or\r\nmodification) of the behavior of chemostat models with possibly\r\nmultiple resources.  The novelty of the approach lies in the way\r\nthe control is implemented, by means of feedback control.  The\r\nvery principle of this type of control is that the control action\r\nis based on the state of the system.  The usual strategies\r\nappearing in the literature consider constant controls leading to\r\nbifurcation analysis or control signals that depend only on time\r\n-- but not on the state of the system.\r\n     Many biological systems are under close examination these\r\ndays.  The human genome project, infectious diseases such as AIDS,\r\nthe flu, or even those caused by a bio-terror attack are but few\r\nof the compelling examples.  Usually these systems are very\r\ncomplex and hard to understand, let alone control.  The aim of\r\nthis project is to use the perspective of control theory in\r\ndealing with these problems.  Ideas from control theory have been\r\nvery successful in applications in more traditional areas.\r\nChemical and nuclear plants, airplanes, vehicles and satellites,\r\nrobots and audio-visual equipment are nowadays equipped with\r\ncomputers controlling the smooth operation of the specific\r\napplication.  The question is whether control theory can\r\ncontribute to rapid developments in the biological sciences.  As\r\nan example, consider a biological system in which a number of\r\norganisms compete against each other.  A basic question is whether\r\nor not the species survive.  Depending on the application one\r\nwould like the answer to this question to be yes (for example if\r\nsome of the species are endangered) or no (for instance if one of\r\nthe species is a malignant virus).  Sometimes the answer turns out\r\nto be no where a yes is desired or vice-versa, and then the issue\r\nbecomes whether this can be modified by suitably manipulating the\r\nsystem.  This type of problem is central in control theory.  The\r\nlessons learned in the areas mentioned above should prove\r\nvaluable in a biological setting.\r\n",
