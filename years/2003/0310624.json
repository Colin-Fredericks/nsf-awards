 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  The attraction for many undergraduate students to science is the experimental nature of it; they learn by doing.  In chemistry and related fields, NMR spectroscopy is arguably one of the most well-developed and broadly applicable experimental techniques for structure determination and dynamic measurements.   In recent  years, NMR spectroscopy has had  an enormous impact on chemistry education as high field spectrometers become more available to undergraduate institutions through NSF support.  In  order  to  strengthen  the overall  chemistry  curriculum,  attract  and  retain more  science students, and better prepare those students for  graduate work and employment in the sciences, DePaul University is incorporating hands-on high field FT-NMR spectroscopy throughout its four-year program.   This project is modeled after similar NSF-funded programs  that  have  been  extremely  effective  elsewhere  at  exploiting  the  full  power  of  NMR spectroscopy as a teaching tool (Davis-UE9751056, Ball-DUE9950413, Liotta-DUE0126678).  Students at all levels of the curriculum experience NMR spectroscopy first-hand, through experiments that have been  adapted  from the literature (primarily from J. Chem. Ed.) or developed at DePaul.  In general chemistry, students use proton-decoupled carbon NMR to determine the structure of simple isomeric hydrocarbons and observe the  effect of electronegative atoms on  chemical shift.   In organic chemistry, proton  NMR  and  multidimensional  techniques  are  used  to  determine  the  structure  of  unknowns, and reaction products, especially novel monomers and copolymers.  Research  students and upper level students in physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, intermediate inorganic,  and biochemistry use  NMR spectroscopy for both structure determination  (of  dihydride  and  dihydrogen  organometallic  complexes)  and  to  evaluate dynamic processes (equilibrium, keto-enol tautomerism, hydrogen  bonding,  yeast metabolism).  Through  progressively more sophisticated experiments, students learn to appreciate the full power of NMR spectroscopy  while also developing their problem solving  and  critical  thinking  skills,  and  enhancing  their  overall understanding of chemistry and the relatedness of each subdiscipline.",
