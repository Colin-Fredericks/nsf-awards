 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0312442\r\nRachel Roberts\r\r\n\r\r\nProfessor Roberts will investigate several problems concerning the\r\r\ntopology of 3-manifolds. In particular, she proposes investigating\r\r\na series of questions suggested by her earlier work (joint with\r\r\nJohn Shareshian and Melanie Stein) demonstrating the existence of\r\r\ninfinitely many hyperbolic manifolds containing no Reebless\r\r\nfoliation. She also proposes a study of particular Reebless\r\r\nfoliations and essential laminations as part of her proposed\r\r\napproach to proving the truth of the property P conjecture for\r\r\nknots, which says that no counterexample to the Poincar\\'e\r\r\nConjecture can be generated by Dehn surgery on knots.\r\r\n\r\r\n Three-manifolds are spaces formed by gluing together blocks of\r\r\nthree-dimensional space according to certain prescribed rules.\r\r\nGlobally, the spaces obtained are usually quite complex. These\r\r\nspaces arise naturally in many contexts in the physical and\r\r\nnatural  sciences and model many interesting phenomena. As an\r\r\nexample of this, we note the recent joint research of topologists\r\r\nand cosmologists suggesting a perhaps surprising model for our\r\r\nspatial universe. As another example, the study of 3-manifolds is\r\r\nimportant in the study of the knotting and linking of strings in\r\r\nthree-dimensional space, which in turn is important in the study\r\r\nof the structure of DNA.  A primary goal of the study of\r\r\n3-manifolds is to discover a useful description of all such spaces\r\r\nand to develop useful tools for working with them. In this\r\r\nresearch, Professor Roberts investigates questions related to this\r\r\ngoal.\r\r\n",
