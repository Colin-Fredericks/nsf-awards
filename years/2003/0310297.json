The objectives are to design new primitives suitable for\r\npublication in academic journals, as well as for submission to relevant\r\nstandards bodies. The methods used include (1) the \"reductionist\" approach of\r\nmodern  cryptography, whereby the security of a scheme is formally reduced to\r\nthe presumed intractability of well-studied mathematical problems (e.g.,\r\nfactoring), and (2) algorithmic techniques from number theory and algebra. \r\n\r\nPublic-key cryptography plays an essential role in securing computers and\r\ncommunication networks. The two basic public-key primitives are public-key\r\nencryption and digital signatures. The first primitive allows a sender to\r\nsecretly transmit a message to a receiver, where the sender only needs to know\r\na  public key (known to everyone), while only the receiver  needs to know the \r\ncorresponding secret key. The second primitive allows a signer, using a secret\r\nkey, to generate a digital signature on a message so that the signature can\r\nlater be verified by any party using a corresponding public key.\r\n\r\nAlthough substantial progress has been made in recent years on these problems, \r\nthere is still more work to do, in terms of improving the efficiency of the\r\nschemes, reducing the strength of the intractability assumptions,  improving\r\nthe quality of the security reductions, and in developing practical distributed\r\nversions of these schemes so as to avoid a single point of failure. These are\r\nthe specific tasks taken on by this research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
