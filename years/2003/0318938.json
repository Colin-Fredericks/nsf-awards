 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop chemical strategies for the fabrication of membrane protein microarrays.  Membrane proteins are important to many aspects of biomedical research because a major percentage of drug targets are membrane bound.  Thus, the ability to fabricate membrane protein arrays will greatly aid the drug discovery process.  In principle, the success of a membrane protein array requires two critical ingredients: (1) the membrane must be immobilized on a solid surface with sufficient robustness to survive repeated contacts with liquid environment under physiological conditions ; and (2) protein molecules must be present in the membrane environment with sufficient membrane mobility to ensure their activity.  The fine balance between these two factors requires the understanding and development of necessary surface chemistry.  This Phase I project will demonstrate that such a balance could be achieved by controlling the electrostatic interaction between the supported membrane and the solid surface. The research is centered around this hypothesis and includes two specific aims: (1) to develop robust lipid membrane bilayers supported on a solid surface based on electrostatic interactions , and (2) to immobilize membrane proteins and demonstrate their functions in protein-ligand interactions using a model system: opioid receptors.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of membrane protein microarray technology. The technology is expected to accelerate efforts aimed at drug discovery and development.",
