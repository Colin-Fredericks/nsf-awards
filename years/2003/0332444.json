The idea is to bring together U. S. and Middle Eastern chemists to address research and education challenges specific to the Middle East region.  66 participants of whom 50 are from Middle Eastern countries and 16 from the US will attend the meeting.  The Middle Eastern countries represented include Egypt, Israel, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia and Syria.  Seven Nobel Prize winners will deliver keynote lectures on topics including the chemistry of water in an arid land, preservation of antiquities, natural products chemistry of the desert and public understanding of science.  It is anticipated that the meeting will increase a broader social understanding among the individuals and subsequently their communities.",
