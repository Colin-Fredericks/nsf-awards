 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for FY2003.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training.  These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Role of a bacterial outer membrane protein in symbiotic competence.\"  The relationship between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the squid Euprymna scolopes provides a system for the study of bacterial/animal symbioses.  V. fischeri mutants lacking the outer membrane protein OmpU have defects in host colonization which suggest that OmpU acts as a recognition determinant.  This study examines the role of OmpU in the initiation of symbiotic colonization, survival within the host, and induction of host development.  \r\n",
