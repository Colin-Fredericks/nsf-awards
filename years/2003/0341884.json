It is a leading forum for scientists and engineers all\r\nover the world who are involved in materials research. This project will support graduate student awards and invited speakers' travel expenses for the topical symposium on \"Molecularly Imprinted Materials\". The lead organizer of this symposium is Professor Peter Kofinas of the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Maryland.  Dr. Kofinas has obtained NSF funding in the area of Molecular Imprinting (Grant # CTS0303951) \"Isomeric Sugar Recognition Using Molecularly Imprinted Polymeric Hydrogels\").  He has invited the top international researchers in the area of molecular and nanoscale imprinting to participate in the program. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe availability of materials that can bind selectively to a target molecule is the key to unlocking a host of new technologies. Molecular imprinting is an established technology, which allows the\r\nsynthesis of materials containing highly specific receptors sites having an affinity for a target\r\ncompound. Molecularly imprinted materials can mimic some of the functions of enzymes, through the creation of 3-dimensional cavities of specific size and shape for biorecognition of bioactive compounds. Promising applications for molecular imprinted technologies, which have attracted much attention over the past decade, include tailor-made separation materials, molecular recognition materials for biosensors, catalysts, and antibody mimics for quantitative assay and molecular recognition. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this project will benefit underrepresented minorities women and persons with disabilities who have a harder time coming up with the finances needed to attend this major international conference.\r\n",
