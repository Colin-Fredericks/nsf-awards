 "awd_abstract_narration": "0322051\r\nMiralles-Wilhelm\r\n\r\nThis Biocomplexity in the Environment integrated research and education proposed project focuses on the development of a spatiotemporal quantitative framework to study the interactions between coexisting vegetation species and the hydrologic cycle, and how these interactions aggregate from smaller scales, e.g., temporal: rainfall event; spatial: individual plants, to larger scales, e.g., temporal: seasonal/multiseasonal; spatial: ecosystem scale. Over the past 2-3 years, there has been significant progress on analyzing the temporal dynamics of interacting hydrologic-ecosystem processes. This research intends to advance these efforts by incorporating spatial variability of these processes and interactions, a key to answering the \"where?\" related questions in addition to the \"when?\" related questions. The proposed research methodology is based on a systems-level stochastic modeling and field experimental framework that has been used by the PIs to aggregate physical, chemical and biological processes occurring at several spatial and temporal scales, quantifying biogeochemical stocks and fluxes as well as providing estimates of their uncertainty. Validation of this eco-hydrological model will be accomplished through proposed field experimental tests in the Everglades (Florida) and Cerrado (Brazil) ecosystems. This comparative ecosystem approach offers the benefit of quantifying and differentiating between general and site-specific eco-hydrological interactions.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a joint effort between investigators at the University of Miami (UM, USA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Universidade de Brasilia (UNB, Brazil), and the University of Buenos Aires (IFEVA/UBA, Argentina). The educational plan of the proposed project focuses on preparing a new generation of ecosystem scientists and practitioners who will acquire: (i) strong interdisciplinary science skills applicable to ecosystem analysis, assessment and decision making; (ii) immersion in diversity in terms of treating different ecosystems (dry, average and humid) and in terms of geographical/cultural settings; (iii) exposure to environmental ethics, as the research and education activities proposed herein seek to improve our understanding of the interactions between hydrology and vegetation as a key to sustainable management of ecosystems. \r\n",
