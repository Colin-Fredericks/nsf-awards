 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are developing  open-ended computer simulations of protein laboratory\r\nprocedures for case-based learning in international biology curricula. We are distributing\r\nthese simulations freely via Internet download so that they are available to university and\r\nhigh school students worldwide. Existing protein software applications lack the ability to\r\nproduce realistic, easily understandable output for procedures such as enzyme\r\nimmunoassays, hemagglutination inhibition, immunofluorescence, protein\r\nelectrophoresis, and western blotting. Such procedures are especially useful for the\r\nanalysis of cases involving infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals including\r\nanthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, HIV infection, hantavirus, encephalitis, Lyme\r\ndisease, genital herpes, hepatitis, brucellosis and rinderpest, among many others. They\r\nprovide a vehicle for making topics in molecular biology more interesting and relevant to\r\nstudents, particularly female non-science majors. Protein simulations complement\r\nDNA simulations we have previously developed and freely distributed for the analysis of cases\r\nbased primarily on human genetic diseases. The proposed simulations have wide\r\napplicability because they can be adapted to any protein-based case scenario. Students\r\ncan participate in Internet \"poster sessions\" via an online integrated web editor /\r\nconferencing system we developed with prior NSF support.\r\n\r\nPre-service science teachers are being used as research assistants for assessment, and results\r\nare being widely disseminated via presentations, workshops, and publications including the\r\nBioQUEST Library. The BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium strongly supports this\r\nproposal and is assisting in the evaluation and dissemination of project results.",
