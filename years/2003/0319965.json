 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project on nanoparticle-assisted laser tissue welding will develop a novel approach for targeting heat generation to a wound site allowing deeper, more uniform welds and a reduction in the extent of tissue damage.  Laser tissue welding, the joining of tissues by heat produced from light absorption, has emerged as a commercially and clinically attractive strategy.  However, the success of laser tissue welding has been somewhat limited because of (1) generation of superficial welds with poor mechanical integrity due to low optical penetration; and (2) excessive damage to adjacent tissues.  In a preliminary study, nanoshells were applied to tissue surfaces and stable welds were formed at laser wavelengths and powers where no significant heating would occur in untreated tissue.  Nanoshells are a new class of engineered nanoparticles that can be designed to strongly absorb light in regions where absorption by tissue is minimal and optical penetration is maximal, namely wavelengths in the range of 800-1200 nm.  At these wavelengths, light can deeply penetrate tissue with minimal heating and be preferentially absorbed at the nanoshells on the wound surface allowing highly targeted application of the heat required to close the wound.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project will be in surgical practice for wound closure such as vascular anastamosis, gynecological surgery, thoracic surgery, ocular repair, cartilage repair and liver repair.  The core technology may have additional commercial applications in emergency medicine \r\n",
