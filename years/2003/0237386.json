Over the last several years, the investigator and his\r\ncollaborators (Colin, Etnyre, Giroux, Kazez, Matic) have developed a largely\r\ncut-and-paste theory of tight contact structures.  Taking this program further,\r\nhe plans to conclude the project on finiteness questions for tight contact\r\nstructures (with Colin and Giroux), investigate Legendrian and transverse knots\r\n(with Etnyre), and explore connections with foliation/lamination theory (with\r\nKazez and Matic).  More fundamentally, he seeks to understand the nature of\r\ntightness, and relations with hyperbolic geometry and finite type invariants of\r\n3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis project is a continued study of 3-dimensional spaces.  The 3-dimensional\r\nspaces we study will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)\r\n3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very complicated globally, but a\r\nlocal observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether\r\nit is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere.  In our work, we seek to\r\nbetter understand 3-dimensional spaces by employing a new type of probe, called\r\na contact structure.  Although mathematicians have been cognizant of contact\r\nstructures for decades, a good understanding of such structures has become\r\ngradually possible only over the last twenty years.  Contact structures are\r\nalso intimately connected with 4-dimensional geometry (the geometry of\r\nspace-time), quantum physics, and dynamics (such as fluid dynamics).\r\n",
