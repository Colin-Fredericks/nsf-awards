 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for rhodium-catalyzed allylic substitution and [4+2+2] carbocyclization reactions.  In the former, the issue of diastereoselectivity in  intermolecular allylic alkylation using both cyclic and acyclic ketone enolates will be addressed.  In the latter, diastereoselective and enantioselective metal catalyzed [4+2+2] carbocyclization will be used for the construction of complex octanoid frameworks.  The combination of allylic alkylation with carbocyclization methodology will lead to the development of a novel tandem process that will enable the future synthesis of natural products.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. P. Andrew Evans of the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University.   Professor Evans will focus his research efforts on developing new catalytic methodology for allylic substitution and carbocyclization reactions.  The methodology will allow for the preparation of intermediates related to the synthesis of natural products.  In terms of broader impacts, the project has potential for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctorals will be carried out.  \r\n",
