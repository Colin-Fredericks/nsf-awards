 "awd_abstract_narration": "The risks posed by bioterrorism and the proliferation of biological weapons capabilities have increased concern about how the rapid advances in genetic engineering and biotechnology could enable the production of biological weapons with unique and unpredictable characteristics. A new study by an Ad Hoc Committee of the National Research Council, will examine current trends and future objectives of research in public health, life sciences, and biomedical science that contain applications relevant to developments in biological weapons 5 to 15 years into the future and ways to anticipate, identify and mitigate these dangers. This Committee of the National Research Council will explore issues surrounding the \"dual use\" applications of biotechnology and genetic engineering data. The \"dual\" nature of biotechnology is evident in the scientific literature. For example, an Australian research group attempted to sterilize mice by immunizing them against an important reproductive protein. In order to do so, this protein was inserted into the poxvirus genome to produce the antigen in the mice. A gene for interleukin 4 (IL-4) was also inserted into this poxvirus vector, as IL-4 is known to enhance antibody formation. Although the original intent was simply to sterilize the mice, the researchers found that the engineered poxvirus construct was more virulent. The construct resulted in the death of genetically resistant, vaccine-protected, and wild-type mice. This example illustrates the current potential, through biotechnology, to enhance the potency of disease-causing agents.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop and subsequent report will enhance our understanding of the national security implications of advances in biotechnology and other technological disciplines to generate information that can simultaneously enhance and harm the human condition 5 to 15 years into the future. A diverse community, including the scientific, national security, public policy, risk management and public health communities will benefit from the dialogue generated from the public workshop. The Committee consensus reports generated by this activity will be used to stimulate and inform response capabilities to future threats both domestically and internationally.\r\n",
