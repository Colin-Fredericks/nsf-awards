The combined efforts of the German and US groups will screen a yeast deletion library for mutations that alter proteasomal degradation of two enzymes:  fructose-1,6-biophophatase and ornithine decarboxylase.  Both are substrates of the proteasome, but differ in the initial mechanisms that are used to mark them for degradation.  A detailed understanding of the common and distinct cellular functions that control degradation of these proteasome substrates will contribute to our understanding of a major pathway that controls critical regulatory functions.\r\n\r\nThe project also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.\r\n",
