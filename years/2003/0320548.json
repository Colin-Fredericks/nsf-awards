 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nProposal No.   \t\tCTS-0320548\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  \tJ. Schneider, Carnegie Mellon University\r\n\r\nThis grant is to develop a fluorescence-based instrument for the visualization of flow and adsorption in microfluidic systems. The instrument consists of an inverted epifluorescence microscope, a solid-state laser, a high-speed CCD camera, a low-noise DC power supply, and some smaller equipment. Measurement of adsorption will be accomplished by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF).  Microfluidic devices will be constructed using standard soft lithography methods, allowing for control of microchannel geometry and surface chemistry. Fluid flow will be induced either by electroosmosis or a syringe pump, depending on the application.\r\n\r\nThree research projects, representative of those to be supported by this equipment, are as follows: The first is an assessment of the contribution of lateral diffusion to the kinetics of DNA hybridization to surface-bound probes as means to improve the performance of biosensors. The second is the development of a microscale chromatography system that utilizes DNA-binding surfactants to isolate target DNA from complex mixtures. The third is the development and validation of numerical algorithms for improved computer-aided design of lab-on-a-chip systems.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the instrumentation will be on many fronts. This is perhaps the first microfluidic visualization instrument that includes on-line TIRF, supplying surface adsorption information critical to the above research.  In addition, the many groups on campus involved with microfluidics and MEMS would have this instrument as a shared resource.  We will also perform a series of microfluidics experiments (available as a web-based resource) to serve as examples and problem sets for transport courses. We will also develop hands on projects for high school students participating in the Summer Academy for Minority Students at Carnegie Mellon University.  This would serve as an introduction to an exciting field and familiarize students with state-of-the-art lab equipment.\r\n",
