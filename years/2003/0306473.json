 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cluster-based network servers are a cost-effective platform for\r\nconstructing \r\nlarge-scale network services.  However, service clustering presents\r\nsignificant \r\nchallenges to system designers.  Many components of the clustering\r\nsupport are \r\noften implemented using centralized or hierarchical architectures, in\r\norder to \r\nmeet desired performance, consistency, and policy requirements.  The\r\neffectiveness\r\nof these approaches has been demonstrated under well-controlled\r\nenvironments,\r\nbut customized enhancements are often needed to deal with transient\r\ncomponent \r\nfailures and fluctuating service loads.\r\n\r\nPeer-to-peer systems are distributed systems without any centralized\r\ncontrol\r\nor hierarchical organization, and with functionally equivalent software\r\nrunning\r\nat each node.  The primary goal of this project is to improve the\r\nrobustness of\r\ncluster-based network services using peer-to-peer system design\r\nprinciples.\r\nSpecifically, this effort exploits three main principles of peer-to-peer\r\nsystem\r\ndesign: functionally symmetric architecture, slow-scaling overhead, and\r\nnon-determinism.  This project covers various components in service\r\nclustering\r\nsupport, including service location lookup, membership management,\r\ncluster-wide\r\nresource management, and replication consistency support.\r\n\r\nTechniques investigated in this project can greatly benefit network\r\nservice\r\ndesigners, for whom it can offer significant improvements in system\r\nrobustness.\r\nIn a broader context, this research complements the ongoing efforts of\r\nbuilding\r\nglobal-scale peer-to-peer systems and services.  In addition, this\r\nproject\r\ndirectly benefits systems-area instruction improvement at the PI's\r\ninstitution.\r\n",
