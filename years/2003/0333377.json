 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IGERT program is focused around three interrelated multi-disciplinary themes: pharmaceutical, biosensor, and biomedical applications of membrane science. Membranes are integral to controlled drug release, medical devices, and biomimetics. The intellectual merit of this IGERT program is that it addresses a major challenge identified by the North American Membrane Society to integrate classical membrane science with bio-applications. This IGERT capitalizes on several opportunities at the University of Cincinnati (UC): (1) the Colleges of Engineering, Medicine and Pharmacy are on the same campus; (2) UC is a site of the only NSF Membrane Center; (3) an NSF REU Program in membrane science is established; (4) the State-funded Bio/Start technology incubator is on campus; and (5) an industry-internship program is well-established.\r\n\r\nThe goals include developing an interdisciplinary graduate training program, attracting pharmaceutical and biomedical industry participation, and facilitating a revenue stream to insure self-sustaining operation. The training program involves nine required courses and three courses focused within the pharmaceutical, biosensor, or biomedical track in the traineeship program. A series of required lab rotations is designed to facilitate cross-disciplinary awareness. An international technical/cultural experience is possible with Kyoto Technical University, the Australian National University and the University of Twente.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this IGERT program are that it will provide a forum for interdisciplinary training in a critical emerging research area, stimulate a new research direction in bio-applications for the NSF Membrane Center, create a formalized structure that integrates classical and bio-applications of membranes,  catalyze the growth of the new Biomedical Engineering Department at UC, facilitate effective university/industry interaction, encourage the formation of interdisciplinary research teams, lead to research results that will improve health care and the quality of life, and generate patentable intellectual property and industry funding to sustain this IGERT program.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In this sixth year of the program, awards are being made to institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.\r\n",
