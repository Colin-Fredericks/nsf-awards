The approach is to have two \r\nstages:  first, verify if the partial information is consistent with the \r\ndesired outcome. Second, if the answer is positive, reconstruct the object.  \r\nIf the answer is negative, find an approximation to the desired reconstruction.  \r\nThe group will focus on four major types of problems.  The first type is a \r\ngeneral class of NP-hard containment, covering and packing problems.  Although \r\ncomplete information about the objects may be available, partial information \r\nwill be used due to the hardness of the problems.  In addition to \r\nstrengthening existing algorithms for polygonal shapes, this work will \r\ndesign the first containment and covering algorithms using objects \r\nbounded by spline curves. For the other three problems only partial \r\ninformation about the objects is available.  The second problem is \r\nthe verification of convexity and reconstruction of convex polyhedra \r\nand convex smooth shapes from partial data.   Reconstruction of \r\nconvex polytopes from partial data is a fascinating classical problem \r\ngoing back to Maxwell, Steinitz, and Minkowski. While much work has \r\nbeen done on recognition and reconstruction of convex polyhedra \r\nfrom projections, reconstruction of smooth convex shapes with a \r\ngiven discrete set of parameters is a problem that has not been \r\nadequately addressed. Our work will emphasize reconstruction of \r\nconvex smooth bodies using splines.  The third problem is that \r\nof statistical determination of topological properties of a body, \r\nsuch as the Euler characteristic, from a finite set of sample points.  \r\nThe fourth problem, tightly related to the third one, is the determination \r\nof the topology of a non-convex body from its projections on a \r\nfinite number of planes.  Dissection and subsequent use of valuations, \r\ni.e. finitely additive probability measures, will play an especially \r\nimportant role in the third and fourth problems.  The team of mathematics \r\nand computer science investigators will combine computational geometry \r\ntechniques, mathematical programming approaches, methods of graph theory \r\nand discrete geometry, methods of convexity theory, and work on \r\nmultivariate splines to design verification and reconstruction algorithms. \r\n\r\nIn addition to their significance in the context of pure mathematics and \r\ntheoretical computer science, these problems are important to applications \r\nof computational geometry and geometric software design. For example, \r\nverification of metric and topological properties of geometric software \r\noutputs is important for implementing and testing geometric algorithms.  \r\nContainment algorithms are useful in 2D packing and layout for manufacturing.  \r\nContainment for 3D shapes is applicable to modeling tasks such as molecular \r\ndocking and to medical treatment planning. Covering problems arise in practical \r\nsettings such as military sensor coverage and targeting, telecommunications, \r\nspatial query optimization, and graphics. Work involving splines is applicable \r\nto CAD and design of numerical methods.  Determination of the topology of a \r\nbody from finite samplings, projections, and sections is a hard problem \r\nimportant for computer tomography and pattern recognition.\r\n",
