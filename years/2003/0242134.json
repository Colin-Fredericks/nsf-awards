 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new generation of ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders, RHIC at Brookhaven and LHC at CERN\r\nwill open a window to the Early Universe when it was one microsecond old. In these experiments\r\na new state of matter-the quark gluon plasma- will be formed. This state prevailed when the\r\nUniverse was younger than a microsecond with temperatures larger than 1012 K. This novel state\r\nis also conjectured to exist at the core of the densest stars in the Universe-neutron stars- and to be\r\nthe primary constituent of hypothetical quark stars. The density in these astrophysical objects is\r\nabout 1015gr/cc, these stars are the remnant of the most powerful events in the present Universesupernovae\r\nexplosions. The properties of neutron stars and the existence of quark stars is currently\r\nbeing studied by a host of satellite missions: HST, Rosat, Chandra, XMM-Newton and forthcoming\r\nneutrino telescopes.\r\nAssessing potential observables and experimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma requires\r\nstudying the strong interactions in an unprecedented regime of temperatures and densities. Furthermore,\r\nin ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions the quark gluon plasma is expected to be a transient\r\nstate with an unprecedented short lifetime of the order of 10-22 seconds, undergoing a phase transition\r\nto a phase in which quarks and gluons are con.ned inside hadrons. Thus the challenge is to\r\nextract observational signatures fromthe short-lived and rapidly evolving plasma. The focus and\r\ngoal of this proposal is to implement the methods that we developed during the last several years\r\nto study equilibriumand non-equilibriumexp erimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma and\r\nthe phase transitions in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in compact stars. In particular\r\nwe focus on: i) electromagnetic signatures (photons and lepton pairs), ii) transport phenomena\r\nand properties of .uctuations as potential observables of the phase transitions, iii) astrophysical\r\nprocesses that lead to observational signals of quark matter in strongly magnetized neutron stars\r\nand quark stars: photon and neutrino emissions.\r\nIntellectual challenge: This is a truly interdisciplinary programat the forefront of nuclear\r\nand particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. Many of the methods, in particular transport\r\nphenomena strongly out of equilibrium also overlaps with timely problems in condensed matter\r\nphysics: femtosecond relaxation in semiconductors. Thus we expect that the program will also\r\nhave a broad impact in many areas. The possibility of opening a window to the Early Universe\r\nwith earth-bound accelerators and studying the densest stars, the remnants of the most energetic\r\nevents in the Universe-Supernovae explosions-is clearly one of the most fascinating endeavors.\r\nBroad interest: The appeal of studying the Early Universe and some of the most exotic\r\nobjects in the present Universe goes beyond the scientists working in these areas, and reaches to\r\nthe broad audience. The general public is fascinated about the latest discoveries in cosmology and\r\nparticle physics, and eager to listen and learn more. The symbiosis between cosmology, astrophysics\r\nand nuclear and particle physics lends itself to being an e.ective vehicle to transmit the new and\r\nfascinating discoveries and to highlight the importance of the di.erent areas to unravel the ultimate\r\nmysteries of the Universe.\r\nThe projects described in this proposal are a continuation of the research done under the\r\nprevious Grant: N.S.F. PHY-9988720 (5/31/00-5/31/03) and is estimated for a period of three\r\nyears.",
