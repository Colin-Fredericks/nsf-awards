 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds,\r\nusing  2-dimensional laminations and foliations as the basic tools. The main\r\ngoal is to show how these objects can be used to attack several long-standing\r\nconjectures in low-dimensional topology. In particular, he proposes to use\r\nconstructions of essential laminations, due to the investigator and others,\r\nto classify the exceptional Dehn surgeries on alternating knots. He\r\nplans to use laminations to show that some large classes of 3-manifolds\r\nsatisfy the Virtual Haken Conjecture. He will also continue work aimed at \r\nproviding a better understanding of the structure of sutured manifold\r\ndecompositions, a fundamental technique in building and using taut foliations,\r\nby developing examples of hyperbolic knots with large depth.\r\n\r\nWe live in and move through a 3-dimensional universe, which we perceive\r\nas extending infinitely in all directions. But recent observations hint at the\r\npossibility that space may instead wrap around itself, so that we live in a finite\r\n universe. It is this very idea of a space wrapping around itself that lies at the\r\nheart of geometric topology, whose goal is to understand the global structure \r\nof objects which locally look like ordinary Euclidean space. The investigator \r\nplans to study several questions aimed at uncovering patterns in the global \r\nstructure of 3-dimensional spaces, by using 2-dimensional surfaces to study \r\nthe spaces in which they can be found. The main idea is to use surfaces as a\r\nway of cutting the space into pieces; by studying the resulting pieces, we \r\ncan gain insight into the large-scale structure of the 3-dimensional space.\r\n\r\n",
