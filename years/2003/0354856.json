 "awd_abstract_narration": "This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) for engineering services to the United States Antarctic Program's (USAP) South Pole Station Modernization project (SPSM).  \r\n\r\nThe following tasks are included: \r\n\r\nIn-house and contracted expertise to support OPP and its contractor(s) in their task to reconstruct South Pole Station.  This will include frequent reviews, critiques, technical advice, engineering analyses, and attendance at meetings focused on engineering and construction issues.\r\n \r\nSimilar services have been provided by CRREL and their contractors for many years.  The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional.  It is expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner.  CRREL is a government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor.  CRREL has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict of interest.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for CRREL to continue with the ongoing tasking.  This award is recommended for the amount of $141,300 as estimated by CRREL to be funded from the SPSM MREFC project budget.\r\n",
