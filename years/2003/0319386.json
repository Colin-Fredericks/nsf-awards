 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small business innovative research Phase I project proposes a new method for electro-optic\r\ncontrol of light on planar waveguides. Currently, electro-optic control of light on silica-on-silicon\r\nplanar optical waveguides is by the thermo-optic effect, which is slow, consumes high power and exhibits a small effect. The new method provides unprecedented levels of optical phase delay, requires low power and moderate voltages, and exhibits response times under 10 microseconds. The method can be used to steer beams, tune waveguide gratings and control coupling between channels, thus enabling a new class of integrated electro-optic devices on silicon substrates. The Phase I project will demonstrate a large electro-optic modulation index and demonstrate a waveguide beamsteer with 10 degrees  of steering capability within the waveguide. It will also explore methods of manufacturing integrated optical circuits using this technology. Phase II will design and build an integrated optic such as a waveguide Fourier transform spectrometer, barcode scanner, or CD/DVD pickup with dynamic tracking and focusing.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications of this technology include waveguide spectrometers for chemical sensing, identification of solvents and plastics, and mobile emissions monitoring.  Other commercial applications include barcode scanners, CD/DVD optical pickups, free-space optical communications, beamsteering for angle-multiplex holographic data storage, and optical interconnects for computer backplanes.\r\n",
