 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop novel techniques and methodologies for distributed smart camera networks through an integrated exploration of distributed algorithms, embedded architectures, and software synthesis techniques. We will develop new architectures and tools that are designed to tackle modern video processing algorithms. The algorithms will leverage distributed architectures for efficient implementations. We will investigate a series of complex smart camera algorithms drawn from surveillance and biometrics applications. Specifically, we will be investigating efficient implementations of algorithms for self-calibration of distributed cameras, view-synthesis using image-based visual hulls, and human identification using face and gait.\r\n \r\nNetworks of distributed cameras are an emerging enabling technology for a broad range of important information technology applications, including surveillance, biometrics, and smart conference rooms. By having acces to scenes from multiple directions, such networks have the potential for complete views than single-camera systems. This contributes to increased robustness and generality of algorithms. However, this distributed nature, coupled with the inherent challenges associated with real-time video processing, greatly complicates the devlopment of effective algorithms, architectures and software.\r\nAn integrated research program inclduing video, design tools, and embedded system architecture is required to understand how new generation of\r\nsmart camera hardware can be best utilized.\r\n \r\n",
