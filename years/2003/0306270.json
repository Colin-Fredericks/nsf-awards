Most testing research has focused on generating\r\ntest inputs and test oracles from program specifications, but program specifications are difficult to produce and maintain. Consequently, language and environment designers remain unmotivated to support\r\nspecifications, and opportunities to support testing are lost.\r\n\r\nContracts offer a route around the specification problem. Contracts are a form of lightweight specification that work with the base programming language, i.e., there is no need for the programmer to learn a special logic for writing specifications. Contracts are monitored as the program executes, which means that the programmer is forced to maintain contracts with the code. Since contracts are essentially a generalization of assert statements, experience suggests that programmers will use them.\r\n\r\nThe investigators focus on contracts as a specification language for\r\nautomatic test suite generation. To validate their investigations,\r\nthey will extend the DrScheme programming environment to support unit\r\ntesting at component boundaries. In addition, they will use the new\r\ntesting infrastructure to test DrScheme itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
