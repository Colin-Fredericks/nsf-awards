 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to help ensure an efficient, effective \r\nand equitable distribution of resources in responding to events that \r\ncause disruption in infrastructure systems and to aid in designing \r\ninfrastructure systems that are robust under disruptions, due to \r\nnatural, human-caused or willful acts. The approach is to develop a \r\nclear and unambiguous set of definitions of critical infrastructure \r\ninterdependencies; a mathematical representation of infrastructure \r\nsystems that incorporates interdependencies among and between systems; \r\nalgorithms that can be used to run the model(s) for vulnerability \r\nassessment and emergency response; and a human-computer interface for \r\nuser interaction with the model.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits will be an improved ability to both mitigate \r\nthe impact of and respond to events that have the capability to cause \r\nlarge-scale, potentially catastrophic damage to critical infrastructure \r\nsystems. Critical infrastructure systems provide services that are \r\nessential to both the economy and well-being of nations and their \r\ncitizens. As documented in a recent report to the U.S. Congress, it is \r\nof vital importance that these services not be degraded, whether by \r\nwillful acts such as terrorism or by natural or random events such as \r\nearthquakes. The research will permit different act and event scenarios \r\nto be modeled, and their impact on the service provided by an \r\ninfrastructure system assessed. The result would be infrastructure \r\nsystems that are designed to be more resilient to disruptions, with the \r\nexpected loss of service reduced and the required level of service \r\nrestored more quickly.\r\n",
