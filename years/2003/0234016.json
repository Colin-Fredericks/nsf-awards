 "awd_abstract_narration": "This objective of this exploratory project is to investigate the integration of decision-based design theory with engineering design education pedagogy. The plan is to design the design of the new engineering curriculum. This exploratory project will determine the feasibility of bridging design theory research with engineering practice through the planning, development, and assessment of two junior level courses. This will serve as a testbed for establishing pedagogical metrics for engineering education in design.\r\n\r\nThis project has the potential of significant broader impacts, not only upon evolving the education of engineers in a four year curriculum, but also upon future engineering practice in how industries will make design decisions within the product realization systems.  This exploratory program is based upon the high risk hypothesis that a bridge between research in design theory and educational pedagogy can be demonstrated, with validation and development of metrics for the learning modules developed. The tasks for this Design for \"XXX\" Project, where XXX is learning, are based upon current research in DfX.  \r\n",
