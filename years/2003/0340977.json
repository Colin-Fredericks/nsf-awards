 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adam Heller and George Georgiou, University of Texas at Austin, will develop a biofuel cell that can use an insect's natural energy reserves to power miniature transmitters that can be used to track the insect's location. The biofuel cell will catalyze the oxidation of trehalose and glucose found in the haemolymph using flavoenzymes and redox polymers attached to a micro-anode.  The key components of this research project are (1) molecular biology studies including the engineering, purification and characterization of glucose 3-hydrogenase; (2) design and testing of the anode functionalized with the redox polymer and glucose-3-hydrogenase; and (3) construction and characterization of a miniature biofuel cell.\r\n\r\nUsing biofuel cells to track insects could provide a powerful new research tool for entomology and a method for tracking and controlling agricultural or home-destroying pests. Some insects can be trained to track explosives and low levels of radioactivity, making transmitter-equipped insects a valuable intelligence-gathering tool. This award is funded jointly by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.",
