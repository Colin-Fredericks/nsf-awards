 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NEES Consortium, Inc., will run a workshop in November 2003 to develop an earthquake engineering community-based plan for computational modeling, simulation, and visualization end-user software and hardware needs for the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES).   This workshop addresses a void in the current NEES Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project underway during FY 2000 - FY 2004.   The NEES MREFC scope does not include the extensive software development needed to make available specific NEES-user level applications for computer simulation nor for processing and visualization of numerical data from tests and analyses or video and other non-numerical information.  NEES will open for ten-year operation for research and education starting in FY 2005.  The goal of this workshop is to establish a plan for the Computational Simulation and Visualization Environment for NEES during that ten-year operating period. This workshop will be held at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas and host approximately 40 participants, with experts in structural, geotechnical, and tsunami engineering as well as in high performance and network based computing, including databases.   The workshop will be held via the AccesGrid to enable remote participation.  Topics to be addressed at this workshop include the following:  motivating participation in the NEES collaboratory through high value added software applications, integration of experimental and numerical simulation, how to build upon enabling middleware and simulation resources provided under the NEES MREFC as well as software in the public/government domain, and hardware (e.g., computer platform) requirements.   Information about this workshop, as well as the report from this workshop, will be available at www.nees.org and the second annual meeting of the NEES Consortium, Inc.",
