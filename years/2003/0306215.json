 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herman\r\n     The investigator develops new theoretical results\r\n(uniqueness, existence, and complexity theories) in discrete\r\ntomography), new reconstruction methods (for the case of\r\nabsorption and for label distributions), and applications\r\n(neutron tomography).  To obtain these results, methods of\r\ndiscrete mathematics, probability theory, and computer science\r\nare applied, including modeling and simulation studies by\r\ncomputers.  The new problems that the investigator studies are:\r\n(a) discrete tomography with absorption; (b) estimation of the\r\nparameters of Gibbs priors to be used in binary tomography; (c)\r\ndirect recovery of label distributions from projection data; and\r\n(d) mathematical problems of reconstruction in neutron\r\ntomography.\r\n     Roughly speaking, tomography deals with the problems of\r\nrecognizing an object from a limited number of views of it, and\r\nof discriminating between objects from a limited number of views\r\nof them.  Mathematically, the idea is to reconstruct a\r\nmultidimensional function that describes, having only a few\r\nlower-dimensional samples -- projections -- of the function.\r\nDiscrete tomography deals with a special type of tomographic\r\ninverse problem in which the function to be reconstructed from\r\nits projections is discrete (i.e., has only a few elements in its\r\nrange of values).  In the special case when the function is binary\r\n(only two possible values), prior information can be used to\r\nrecover it from very few (e.g., only 2 or 3) projections.\r\nDiscrete tomography has some fascinating applications, for\r\nexample, in medicine, molecular biology, electron microscopy,\r\nsecurity, and nondestructive testing.  In this project the\r\ninvestigator studies problems in discrete tomography, develops\r\nnew methods to reconstruct functions, and considers applications\r\nin neutron tomography.  Other broad impacts include the\r\ninvolvement of students in the work of the project, an\r\ninternational collaboration with a faculty associate in Hungary\r\nand jointly run research seminar at CUNY, and a workshop on the\r\napplications of discrete tomography.\r\n",
