 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks and computer systems are becoming increasingly attractive targets to large-scale programmed\r\nattacks such as worms and Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS), which can compromise a vast\r\nnumber of vulnerable targets in a few minutes. Critical end-user applications vulnerable to such attacks\r\ninclude e-commerce, e-medicine, command-and-control applications, video surveillance and tracking, and\r\nmany other applications. While there is a growing body of research techniques, prototypes, and commercial\r\nproducts that purport to protect these applications and the network infrastructure on which they rely, there\r\nis little existing scientific methodology by which to objectively evaluate the merits of such claims. Moreover,\r\nthorough testing of a defense system for worms or for attacks on the infrastructure cannot be evaluated\r\nsafely on a live network without affecting its operation.\r\n\r\nTo make rapid advancements in defending against these and future attacks, the state of the art in the\r\nevaluation of network security mechanisms must be improved. This will require the emergence of large-scale\r\nsecurity testbeds coupled with new standards for testing and benchmarking that can make these testbeds\r\ntruly useful. Current shortcomings and impediments to evaluating network security mechanisms include lack\r\nof scientific rigor;lack of relevant and representative network data;inadequate models of defense mechanisms;\r\nand inadequate models of both the network and the transmitted data (benign and attack traffic). The latter\r\nis challenging because of the complexity of interactions among traffic, topology and protocols.\r\n\r\nThe researchers propose to develop thorough, realistic,and scientifically rigorous testing frameworks and methodologies for particular classes of network attacks and defense mechanisms. These testing frameworks will be adapted for different kinds of testbeds, including simulators such as NS, emulation facilities such as Emulab, and both small and large hardware testbeds. They will include attack scenarios; attack simulators;\r\ngenerators for topology and background traffic; data sets derived from live traffic; and tools to monitor and\r\nsummarize test results. These frameworks will allow researchers to experiment with a variety of parameters representing the network environment, attack behaviors, and the configuration of the mechanisms under test.\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing testing frameworks, the researchers propose to validate them by conducting tests on representative network defense mechanisms.  Defense mechanisms of interest include network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS); automated attack traceback mechanisms;t raffic rate-limiting to control DDoS attacks; and mechanisms to detect large-scale worm attacks. Conducting these tests will require incorporating real defense mechanisms into a testbed, and applying and evaluating  frameworks and methodologies. Conducting these tests will also help us to ensure that the testbed framework allows other researchers to easily integrate and test network defense echanisms of their own.\r\n\r\nThe research team includes experts in security, networking, data analysis, software engineering, and operating systems who are committed to developing these challenging integrated testing frameworks.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The development of testing methodologies for network defense mechanisms requires\r\nsignificant advances in our understanding of network attacks and the interactions between attacks and their\r\nenvironment including:deployed defense technology, traffic, topology, protocols, and applications. It will\r\nalso require advances in our understanding of metrics for evaluating defenses.\r\n\r\nEducation: The  research into testing methodologies for network defense mechanisms will involve \r\ngraduate students and provide new curriculum material for universities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: By providing new testing frameworks, the work will accelerate improvements in\r\nnetwork defense mechanisms and facilitate their evaluation and deployment. The researchers will hold yearly workshops to disseminate results and obtain community feedback.",
