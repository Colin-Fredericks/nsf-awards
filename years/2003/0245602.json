 "awd_abstract_narration": "Topology, as a branch of geometry, seeks to classify, characterize and \r\nexplore those abstract spaces known as manifolds. Manifolds are locally \r\nlike ordinary euclidean spaces(the line, the plane, etc.); however, they \r\nare allowed to have global twisting, curving and holes (e.g., circles, \r\nspheres, tori). They arise in many models of physical and biological\r\nphenomena. Manifolds with singularities, or stratified spaces, are even \r\nmore ubiquitous as they appear as solution spaces of algebraic and \r\ndifferential equations and as limits, degenerations and compactifications \r\nof manifolds. Hughes has made a breakthrough in the understanding of \r\ntopologically stratified spaces by establishing a theory of the\r\nneighborhoods of the singularities. This allows one to use geometric \r\ntechniques almost as if the singularities were not present. The current \r\nproject is largely concerned with exploiting this technique to further \r\nthe understanding of manifolds with singularities.  As an example, Hughes \r\nwill investigate the extent of periodicity near the singular sets.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds, \r\nstratified spaces, trees and metric spaces. The investigations are in \r\nthe areas of stratified spaces, trees, ultrametrics and noncommutative \r\ngeometry and the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory.  The main \r\ntools are controlled topology, surgery theory and C*-algebras of groupoids. \r\nSpecific questions concern periodicity in the neighborhood of the singular \r\nset of a manifold stratified space, the classification of stratified \r\nh-cobordisms and stratified pseudoisotopies, and non-locally flat topological \r\nembeddings. In addition, techniques from noncommutative geometry will be \r\napplied to study the geometry of infinite trees and other non-compact spaces \r\nat infinity.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
