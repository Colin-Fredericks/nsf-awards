 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer  (STTR) Phase II project aims to build a prototype of a rapid-deployment, three-dimensional (3-D), seismic reflection system for near-surface exploration. Although the 3-D seismic reflection method enjoys tremendous commercial success in marine applications, 3-D seismic systems for land-based geophysical exploration have been limited because cost-effective and environmentally friendly deployment systems have not been developed.  Such a system would be useful to build models of ground water flow, track pollutants, identify mineral-laden zones, and aid the sitting of large construction projects. \r\n\r\nThe next generation seismic system based on the land streamers concept using gimbal-mounted vertical geophones will be assembled. An industrial, low-impact All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is a critical part of the system both to pull the land streamers and minimize environmental impact.  The primary advantage of such a system is that fewer field personnel would be needed compared to conventional surveys and data can be collected more efficiently. The customer base for this seismic reflection system includes civil and environmental engineers and geophysical contractors.\r\n",
