 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a program called the Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) for academic years 2004-2009. MIMSUP, operated at Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) since 1990, will provide marine education to eight under-represented minority students annually recruited from around the nation. Students will spend two quarters in residence taking a total of 31 credits that may be transferred back to their home institutions. During the first quarter, students take a laboratory/field course in oceanography, a current trends course that introduces them to modern investigative techniques and the potential professional opportunities that will be available to them, a research course in which they plan and execute an independent project under the supervision of a faculty member. They all participate in a program that involves training in and application of outreach education in marine science to K-12 school children. During the second quarter, students will take a scientific research and two additional courses covering various marine science topics. Students receive full tuition, housing, travel costs, and a stipend, as well as support to participate in regional and national meetings. The stipend supports the students' participation in K-12 outreach activities of about 10 hours per week in local schools. Western Washington University provides significant institutional support for this program in faculty salary, laboratory supplies, and access to boat-time for the students.",
