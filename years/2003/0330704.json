 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a summer school, that is a series of lectures and workshops, on the general theme of SOLAS  (Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study). The SOLAS program (sponsored by IGBP/SCOR/CACGP - International Global Biogeochemistry Program/Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research/Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution) is aimed at achieving a quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere, while understanding how this coupled system affects and is affected by climate and environmental change. The SOLAS program attempts to foster interdisciplinary and international collaborations in this area. The 2003 Summer school will provide the opportunity for young researchers interested in these science issues to learn about the various scientific aspects of the field, meet one another and current leaders of the field, and develop the basis for future collaborations. A distinguished and diverse group of scientists has been recruited as lecturers. This project will be supported with contributions from NSF, NASA, NOAA and ONR.",
