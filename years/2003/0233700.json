 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entitled \"CAREER:  Immunochemical Techniques for Investigations on the Occurrence and Fate of Agrochemicals in the Environment\"  is directed by Dr.  Diana Aga from the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The project is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the International Programs Office, which will provide funds in support of Dr. Aga's international collaboration with Dr. Bertold Hock of the Technical University of Munich.  The purpose of this research is to study the presence, disposition and transport of agrochemicals in soil and surface water.  Specifically, new methods will be developed for the detection of a new herbicide (which currently has no detection methods),  metabolites of a known herbicide (which has 8 isomeric forms) and for antibiotic residues used widely in feedstocks.  The investigator will use known analytical techniques such as immunoassay (ELISA), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE).\r\n\r\nThe CAREER program for young investigators focuses on research, as well as, innovative educational activities.  The educational component of this research will involve undergraduate research and enhanced laboratory curricula which directly impacts the research project.  The potential impact of this research on society in a state which has an economy based largely on agriculture is significant.  The research could provide more rapid and lower cost analyses of soil and water samples used to monitor the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
