 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a novel, interdisciplinary framework for multiple layers of smart antenna equipped mobile ad-hoc networks  (MANETs). A smart antenna system uses an antenna array with a digital signal-processing capability to transmit and receive in an adaptive directional manner for reduced interference and higher throughput.  A smart antenna system also has the ability to change its directionality in response to the environment. The main contribution of this project will be in the design and simulation of practical MANET systems making use of smart antennas.   In particular, this research effort will build a new model for MANET system study based upon thorough multi-layer modeling of realistic system operation.   While cross-layer optimizations have been considered across higher-level layers (including the application layer), little research effort has gone into  optimizing  the  physical  layer  for  improved  higher  layer functionality.    Meeting dynamic Quality of Service  (QoS) requirements in MANETs  as  well  as  increasing scalability, security, and energy efficiency are recognized cross-layer MANET design issues that can be enabled by the proposed research.   Numerous theoretical developments in  the  area  of  Multiple-Input  Multiple-Output (MIMO)  systems  provide  an  opportunity  to  characterize  MANETs  in  which  nodes  make  use  of  smart antennas at both ends of the communications link.  Through this project, a relationship will be established between antenna designs, antenna placements, scattering environments, and MIMO channel capacities on MANET links in actual systems. Space-time  coding  techniques  and  beamforming strategies will need to be coupled, for the first time, with dynamic neighbor discovery algorithms to create and maintain ad-hoc links in a dynamic propagation environment.  The user density, mobility, and channel characteristics unique to dense urban environments and hybrid indoor/outdoor environments will be taken into account when designing these MANET links. Finally, this project will develop novel routing algorithms that will consider the unique requirements imposed, and the potential advantages gained, by the use of smart antennas. The goals of this effort  will  include  stable  routes  as  well  as  maximal  sharing  of  routes  amongst  multiple  sources  for increased computational efficiency and non-aligned directional paths for reduced interference.",
