In that workshop, it was explicitly recommended to convene another workshop devoted to Environmental Field Facilities (EFFs). Thus, CLEANER Workshop 2 is in response to that recommendation.   The continuing development of the CLEANER initiative leads to an effort devoted to defining the concept of (EFFs).  The agenda for CLEANER Workshop 2  has been developed and will include:  review the results of CLEANER Workshop 1 \"Large Scale Environmental Challenges: CLEANER as the Engineering Approach\";  Status/Experience for CLEANER; Defining an EFF(with breakout sessions); Modeling; Environmental Cyberinfrastructure;  Sensor Needs, Development, and Networking: Initial Insights, and the Path Forward.  This workshop is an important next step in securing a cross-discipline view of  the evolution of CLEANER.\r\nThis Workshop will be held at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on  October 20-22,  2002.  The workshop will be attended by approximately 50 scientists and engineers from the academic, consultant and governmental communities.  A report summarizing the results of the workshop will be prepared by the steering committee and submitted to the Environmental Engineering Program Director by December, 2002.\r\n",
