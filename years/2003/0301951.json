 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses new dopant-host combinations of transition metal (TM) doped II-VI semi-conductors to extend current solid-state laser wavelength coverage. Materials include TM (Cr, Fe, Co) doped Cd1-xRxTe, with R being either a IIa (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) or IIb (Zn, Hg) ele-ment. The composition of the host will be varied in order to modify crystal-field effects on opti-cal and laser properties of TM ions. The proposed materials will be grown by a Bridgman tech-nique at Hampton University, and collaboration with industrial partners at Brimrose Corporation of America will provide additional samples. All materials will be characterized through tempera-ture dependent transmission spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved emission studies, and laser performance studies. The spectroscopic results will be modeled within the framework of crystal field theory to derive crystal-field parameters, electron-phonon coupling strengths, and emission quenching activation energies. The results of the modeling will be used to derive struc-ture- property relations, which can guide the optimization of selected materials to achieve better laser performance. \r\n\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic/photonic materials having technological relevance. The multi-disciplinary nature of the project enhances the quality of education in several science and engineering disciplines at Hampton University. The research will be incorporated in the training of students seeking degrees in physics, chemis-try, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering. Educational efforts include: (1) increase of students participating in research projects, (2) continuation and extension of an industrial intern-ship program, and (3) outreach activities. This program is expected to increase the skilled work-force in an important field of optoelectronics and lasers with a special emphasis on enhancing the participation of under-represented minorities.  \r\n",
