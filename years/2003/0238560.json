 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: PECASE: Management of Immersive Sensor Data Streams\r\nInstitution: University of Southern California\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and develop a system to enable the acquisition, storage, querying and analysis of immersive sensor data streams, termed immersidata, in the wavelet transformed domain. Immersive sensors are the user interfaces of the future and it is absolutely critical to facilitate the manipulation and analysis of their generated data sets. Management of immersidata is challenging because they are: (1) multi-dimensional, (2) spatio-temporal, (3) continuous data streams, and (4) noisy. In addition, they are produced with a high rate and hence their real-time query processing is a challenging task. The use of wavelets alleviates these challenges collectively. Furthermore, the resulting system enables many other applications dealing with large multidimensional data streams that require approximate and/or progressive query support. This project is benefiting from the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of scientists in the areas of computer vision, graphics, signal processing and human factor studies in the PI's home institution. The career development plan will train the database graduate students in continuous mathematics and linear algebra, and provide them with the opportunity to acquire hands-on experiences in utilizing sophisticated math techniques for sensor data analysis purposes. In addition, undergraduate and underrepresented students will become familiar with modern sensory/immersive interfaces and exercise the concepts of forming mining queries on multidimensional data streams. The main benefits to the society would be through specific application developments, which would enable more natural interaction methods with software systems especially for disabled and elderly users. The project results will be disseminated via Internet (http://infolab.usc.edu) and other channels in order to increase the impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.\r\n\r\n",
