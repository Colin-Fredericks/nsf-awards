 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request for support for research on predicting spin observables in the\r\nphoto- and electro-production of mesons. Our goal continues to be to use the\r\nnew and precise cross-section and spin observable data, from Je.erson Laboratory\r\n(JLAB) and from other GeV electron beam facilities, to determine the fundamental\r\nmechanisms of electromagnetic meson production and the associated\r\ndynamics of excited nucleons, and perhaps the nature of hadrons themselves.\r\nKnowledge of nucleon excited states and their form factors provides important\r\ninformation about the non-perturbative regime of QCD. The photo- and\r\nelectro-production of p, ., kaon, and vector mesons are being measured with\r\nhigh precision using the impressive JLAB large angle spectrometer (CLAS) detector\r\nand the high resolution magnetic spectrometers in Halls A& C.\r\nPolarized targets and beams at JLAB and at other facilities allow a variety\r\nof single and double spin observables to be measured. Our focus is on the\r\nquestions: Can we develop a analysis tool that can be used to extract reliable\r\nisobar information from electromagnetic production experiments? What can\r\none learn from such measurements? Can quark dynamics be incorporated into\r\nthe coupled-channels approach we have developed over the last several years?\r\nDoes evidence exist for the excitation of unusual baryon states and/or those\r\npredicted by quark models?\r\nThe hope is to answer such questions by examining the sensitivity of beam,\r\ntarget, and recoil-particle cross-sections and spin-observables to underlying resonances,\r\nt- and u-channel exchanges, and to threshold e.ects. In earlier publications,\r\nwe deduced general features of spin observables for 0-(p, .,K) and\r\n1-(., ., f) meson production, which are helpful guides in amplitude analyses,\r\nmodel calculations and in planning experiments. We have been combining such\r\ninsights with viable dynamical coupled-channels(CC) calculations, for which collaborations\r\nwith Saclay and Argonne National Laboratory have been established\r\nand hopefully will continue. The codes we have developed provide .exible, dynamical\r\n(o.-shell) methods for including important spin-dependent .nal state\r\ninteractions along with threshold, cusp, and isobar excitation e.ects. Recently,\r\nwe .gured out how to incorporate quark model dynamics. Developing this code\r\nhas been a slow process, but we are now ready to apply this project to recent\r\ndata and to extend the research to a wider range of mesons and to electroproduction.",
