Wayne Gladfelter in the US, and Constantin Vahlas in France lead this collaboration. They will investigate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, including metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  These are widely used in industry to form films of metals, semiconductors and dielectrics. For example, optoelectronic devices such as lasers are produced from trimethylgallium and arsine in an MOCVD process.  Recent attempts to improve CVD processes by designing new precursors have encountered processing problems.  As the size and complexity of the precursor increases, the precursor solidifies at standard temperature and pressure. The investigators propose to use fluidized-bed technology to solve this problem and will design and construct a fluidized-bed solid delivery systems for the chemical vapor deposition of metallic molybdenum and zirconium dioxide films. \r\n\r\nThe French investigator and his team are expert in fluidized-bed technology and have recently used fluidized-bed CVD to coat powders with metals.  This is complemented by the US research group's experience in synthesizing of molecular precursors for CVD of thin films.  They also have completed investigations of the relationship between deposition chemistry and film composition and microstructure. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United States. \r\n",
