 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Teplyakov and his coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware are examining the mechanisms of deposition of metallic films onto silicon and silicon oxide surfaces modified with titanium nitride barrier layers.  Precise control of the chemistry of deposition of aluminum, copper, and titanium nitride barrier layers using photochemical methods in combination with traditional chemical and physical vapor deposition methods is the goal of the research.  In situ infrared spectroscopy is used to monitor the reaction mechanism and structures of the resulting multi-layer interfaces.  A molecular level understanding of the deposition processes is the result of this work.  Student exchange and curriculum development with the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru is an important aspect of the research project. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms and parameters that control the quality of metal films and barrier layers in microelectronic applications is the goal of this research project.  Professor Teplyakov and his coworkers at Delaware are using in situ infrared spectroscopy to probe the structure of multi-layer interfaces on silicon and silicon oxide substrates.  This information is relevant for the development of electronic materials processing protocols in the microelectronics industry. \r\n",
