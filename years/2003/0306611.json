 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to further develop the complexity \r\ntheory of Linear Programming (LP), which continually plays a \r\ncentral role in complexity analysis.  In particular, we analyze the \r\nMarkov Decision Problem (MDP) with n states and m actions \r\nfor each state, a special class of real-number linear programs \r\nwith the Leontief matrix structure.  The research objectives and \r\nactivities include the following: 1) Develop a new class of \r\nalgorithms, \"combinatorial interior-point algorithms\", for \r\nsolving the MDP, with the best achievable complexity result and \r\npractical efficiency; and establish certain complexity lower \r\nbounds for the MDP, which may provide a \"negative result\" on \r\nthe quest for whether or not there is a strongly polynomial time \r\nalgorithm for LP.  2) Both undergraduate and graduate students \r\nwill participate in the project, new course materials on the MDP \r\nwill be produced, and the PI will also give presentations to the \r\nStanford Summer Program for grades K-12 and community \r\ncollege students in the Bay Area. 3) Apply the new fast MDP \r\nalgorithm to research activities in function areas such as Call \r\nAdmission and Routing, Strategic Asset Allocation, Supply-\r\nChain Management, Emissions Reductions, and Semiconductor \r\nWafer Fabrication.\r\n\r\nDue to the relentless research effort in LP algorithms, a linear \r\nprogram can be solved today one million times faster than it was \r\ndone twenty years ago. Businesses, large and small, use linear \r\nprogramming models to optimize communication systems, to \r\nschedule transportation networks, to control inventories, to plan \r\ninvestments, and to maximize productivity.  Furthermore, LP \r\nhas become a popular subject now taught in undergraduate, \r\ngraduate, and MBA curriculums, advancing human knowledge \r\nand promoting scientific understanding. Recently, there has been \r\na renewed and strong interest in the MDP (a special large-scale \r\nLP) due to its wide applications.  With the rising demand in \r\ntelecommunication network resources, effective management is \r\nas important as ever. Call Admission (deciding which calls to \r\naccept/reject) and routing (allocating links in the network to \r\nparticular calls) are examples of decisions that must be made at \r\nany point in time. The objective is to make the \"best\" use of \r\nlimited network resources.  Such sequential decision problems \r\ncan be addressed by a dynamic programming model and the \r\nMDP. Another application: the threat of global warming that \r\nmay result from the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other \r\n\"greenhouse gases\" poses a serious dilemma.  In particular, cuts \r\nin emission levels bear a detrimental short-term impact on \r\neconomic growth.  At the same time, a depleting environment \r\ncan severely hurt the economy - especially the agricultural \r\nsector - in the longer term. To complicate the matter further, \r\nscientific evidence on the relationship between emission levels \r\nand global warming is inconclusive, leading to uncertainty about \r\nthe benefits of various cuts. One systematic approach to \r\nconsidering these conflicting goals involves the formulation of a \r\ndynamic system and MDP model that describes our \r\nunderstanding of economic growth and environmental science, \r\nas is done by Nordhaus.  However, these MDP problems are too \r\ncomplex to be solved by the current MDP solvers.  A major \r\nobjective of the project is to develop new Markov Decision \r\nAlgorithms such that these models would be effectively \r\nanalyzed to satisfaction.  Progress in the area of developing \r\nefficient algorithms for solving large-scale stochastic decision \r\nproblems will be of great significance in improving industrial \r\ncompetitiveness, scientific understanding, and technology \r\nlearning.\r\n",
