 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tResearch and training in bacterial taxonomy will be supported through the Partnerships for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy activity, under the supervision of Prof. Reysenbach at Portland State University and her colleagues in the U.S. and abroad. Training in classical and molecular genome-based approaches will focus on bacteria of the order Aquificales, known from hydrothermal environments around the world, including marine vents and terrestrial hotsprings. These bacteria support their growth through novel oxidative and reductive reactions utilizing minerals, usually in very hot environments, and are hence known as chemolithoautotrophs. The laboratory culturing of these organisms, for detailed metabolic studies, is difficult and time consuming, and Prof. Reysenbach is one of the few experts in the world knowledgeable and successful in this enterprise. Cultures and collections from all over the world have been assembled for her use and that of her students, and will be augmented with additional materials from colleagues exploring marine and hotspring localities in Yellowstone and in Russia, New Zealand, the Azores, and elsewhere. \r\n\tWhole-genome sequencing of bacteria is producing a wealth of DNA sequence and gene data, including members of the Aquificales, and the comparative analysis of these data enables reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships among the genes and the organisms and determination of the peculiar metabolic activities that permit them to live and diversify in extreme environments. Students will learn a full range of technologies for comparative phylogenomics and for modern bacterial systematics, as well as novel culturing procedures. As well, short courses targeted to school teachers and the public under the \"Yellowstone Microbes\" program will contribute to ongoing education in modern microbial taxonomy. \r\n\r\n",
