 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the complexity of problems in logics.\r\nThe focus will be on results that classify the complexity of an\r\ninfinite number of problems.  The first such result dates from 1978,\r\nwhen Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for generalized\r\nsatisfiability problems.  He defined an infinite number of propositional\r\nsatisfiability problems (nowadays usually called Boolean constraint\r\nsatisfaction problems), showed that all these satisfiability problems are\r\neither in P or NP-complete, and gave a simple criterion to determine\r\nwhich of the two cases holds.  In recent years, quite a few dichotomy\r\ntheorems have been shown about problems in logics.  Almost all of\r\nthese problems have the following three properties in common: They\r\nare variations of satisfiability, they are problems in propositional logic,\r\nand they use Schaefer's constraint framework.\r\n\r\nThis project's goal is to  extend the existing research in three\r\ndifferent directions, seeking dichotomy theorems for problems that\r\nare not related to satisfiability, for problems in logics other than\r\npropositional logic, and for frameworks other than Schaefer's\r\nconstraint framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThrough her school's commitment to, as voluntary cost-sharing,\r\nreduce the proposer's teaching load by one course per year,\r\nand through the direct support of her summer months,\r\nthis grant will have the broader impact of helping support\r\nresearch at an undergraduate institution.  This harmonizes\r\nwell with RIT's desire to become a more research-friendly\r\ninstitution.  The travel support will allow the proposer and\r\nher students to attend conferences to develop professionally\r\nvia learning of new advances, and presenting their results to\r\nthe broader theory community.\r\n",
