 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWe propose the acquisition of instrumentation that will allow the experimental evaluation of\r\na number of prototypes coming out of our present research in wireless and mixed-signal circuits.\r\nA number of research areas will benefit from such acquisition. These include high-performance\r\noscillators, ultra-wide band radio circuits, integrated filters for radio and intermediate frequencies,\r\nparametric MOS circuits, nonlinear circuits with linear external behavior, time-encoding circuits,\r\ninterconnect analysis, and on-chip serial links.\r\nWhereas in the past we have relied largely on cooperating industry to open their measurement\r\nfacilities to us for such purposes, present economic difficulties and changes in the modus operandi\r\nof the industry have made this solution increasingly difficult. We thus propose to acquire equip-ment\r\nthat will allow us full independence in testing at frequencies up to 50 GHz. We have identified\r\na number of test setups needed in our work, and have determined the most suitable instruments\r\nfor such setups after extensive consultations with four different equipment manufacturers. The in-struments\r\ninclude a spectrum analyzer, a network analyzer, a real-time sampling and a repetitive\r\nsampling oscilloscope, a noise source, a vector signal generator, a continuous-wave microwave gen-erator,\r\na probe station, and include several options and supporting hardware. A shielded room will\r\nensure low-interference measurements in New York's harsh electromagnetic interference environ-ment.\r\nThe equipment proposed will allow us to have a top-notch measurement facility on-premises,\r\nwith a large impact on both our research and our education programs.",
