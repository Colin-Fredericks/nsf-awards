 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThis  Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) for SCADA and IT systems\r\nworkshop brings together a multi-disciplinary team of control, power system,\r\nand security experts to discuss areas of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and information technologies (IT).  The meeting draws on both academia and industry expertiseto explore new ways to combat the information infrastructure vulnerabilities in industrial and infrastructure control systems.  \r\n\r\nSCADA and IT communities have traditionally had very little\r\ncross-fertilization.  For example, SCADA systems traditionally focused on the\r\nelectronics and hardware solutions to security, whereas IT\r\ninternet-based security has been predominantly a software discipline.\r\nIn recent years, SCADA systems, however, are increasingly using software\r\nimplementations to replace the older hardware systems, making these physical control systems potentially accessible via the Internet.  The insertion of maintenance, monitoring, debugging, and repair hooks into SCADA systems for remote maintenance and diagnostics can  provide the basis for unauthorized access and security breeches. Since IT has been addressing these breeches for some time, \r\nit is expected that those professionals have insights to help SCADA operators.\r\nSimilarly, the SCADA operators have been designing networks that are\r\nrobust to failure for some time.  The workshop will provide a forum for exploring\r\nthe relationship of current practice and known weaknesses to the challenges and opportunities that may exist for SCADA systems in the future. The primary goal of this workshop is to identify both the near-term technology solutions and the longer-term research needed to secure and strengthen the U.S. industrial infrastructure.  \r\n",
