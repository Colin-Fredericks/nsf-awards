The workshop will create an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together researchers from all relevant disciplines; including geologists, geophysicists and geochemists. The agenda will include review presentations, a field trip to Long Valley, and follow-up sessions to develop research plans, including funding strategies and ways to leverage EarthScope data to answer key scientific questions.\r\n\r\nInvitees will include scientists from both academia and government agencies that have been actively carrying out research on the Long Valley Caldera volcanic system or who can contribute perspectives on broader issues such as restless calderas and Basin Range/Sierra Nevada tectonism. Practitioners of all branches of Earth science will be encouraged to attend. A special effort will be made to include women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities. A small number of key foreign speakers will be invited, and 10% of places will be reserved for students. \r\n",
