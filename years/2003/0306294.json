 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for NSF Proposal DMS-0306294, \"Singularity Behavior in\r\nSome Geometric Variational Problems\", Robert Hardt, P.I.\r\n\r\nThis project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus,\r\ntreating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration\r\nfor various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric\r\nstructures subject to geometric or analytical constraints.\r\nSpecified investigations focus on the relation between energy and\r\ntopological obstruction in mappings between manifolds, liquid\r\ncrystal materials, improper slicing of polynomial varieties,\r\ntransport problems, and the regularity of relaxed energy\r\nminimizers.  In various higher dimensional cases, energy\r\nconcentration of limits of smooth mappings may occur along sets\r\nof infinite measure and is related to homotopically nontrivial\r\nmappings of spaces. This concentration behavior corresponding to\r\nany rational homotopy invariant of the target mapping can now be\r\ndescribed.  Singularities in liquid crystal materials will be also\r\nstudied in several contexts.  The theories of improper\r\nintersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry\r\nwill be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis\r\nand partial differential equations.  Combined  transport systems\r\nsuch as occurs in postal routes, the circulatory system, and\r\nplant root systems can be described variationally with recently\r\ndiscovered geometric structures.\r\n\r\nUnderlying many physical phenomena is a least energy principle\r\nwhereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shape are\r\ndistinguished by their property of having less energy or area than\r\ncompeting objects.  The external constraints often lead to\r\nsingularities, which are characterized by rapid changes of\r\nstructure occurring in very small spatial regions.  For example,\r\none observes dislocation faults in solids under stress, domain\r\nwalls in magnetized materials, liquid edges and corners in soap\r\nfilms, and point, curve, and surface defects in various liquid\r\ncrystal materials.  We deal with new mathematical structures and\r\ntheories necessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In\r\nthese problems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the\r\nnumerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the\r\nphenomenological studies from observation and experiment all\r\nbenefit each other and all have a crucial scientific role. The\r\npresent proposed research has many problems motivated by and\r\napplicable to science and engineering. The new geometric\r\nvariational tools are not presently well-known in the broader\r\nscientific community, and communication of these mathematical\r\ntopics and techniques will be very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
