 "awd_abstract_narration": "The identification of ancient continental transform margins has proven difficult\r\nfor a variety of reasons. Transform faults are commonly reactivated subsequent to their\r\nactive transcurrent displacement histories by younger tectonic processes. In addition,\r\npiercing points that permit assessment of offset are commonly equivocal and subject to\r\nmultiple interpretations. However, analysis of sedimentary basins developed adjacent to\r\ntransform faults, particularly faults that transect marginal continental lithosphere,\r\nprovides a powerful tool for evaluation of ancient transform margins. Evaluation of the\r\ntiming of deposition and deformation is especially critical, because the two processes\r\nshould be partly coeval in strike-slip basins. In northern Sonora, the postulated Mesozoic\r\ntype example of a continental transform, the Mojave-Sonora megashear, juxtaposes a\r\ncontinental crustal fragment, the Caborca block, against cratonal North America along\r\nwhat is now a complex structural zone. A narrow, deformed sedimentary basin of Late\r\nJurassic-Early Cretaceous age lies along this structural boundary for a distance of more\r\nthan 300 km. The subsidence history of the basin largely coincided with the posited\r\ndisplacement history of the megashear and so provides a unique opportunity to evaluate\r\nthe megashear hypothesis and understand the processes that constructed the Late\r\nJurassic-Early Cretaceous Cordilleran continental margin.\r\nA two-year field- and laboratory-based study proposed here will determine the\r\ndepositional and structural evolution of the sedimentary basin adjacent to the megashear\r\nand the uplift history of the Caborca block, which forms the present southern edge of the\r\nbasin. The objectives of the research fall into three major categories:\r\n1. Basin origin and its Mesozoic proximity to the Caborca block.\r\nLithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and geochronologic analysis will determine the\r\nlifespan and geometry of the basin, while provenance studies will determine if the\r\nCaborca block was a sediment source for the basin. Fossils in the strata and interbedded\r\nvolcaniclastic rocks make this objective practicable.\r\n2. Deformation kinematics and chronology of the basin. Strata in the basin are\r\nlocally tightly folded, cleaved, and metamorphosed. However, deformation intensity is\r\ngreater in older rocks than in younger ones, a variation which may be either temporal or\r\nrelated to burial depth of strata during deformation. Mesoscale and microscale structural\r\nanalysis will evaluate kinematics and variability of deformation both stratigraphically and\r\ngeographically with respect to the megashear. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology on\r\nmetamorphosed pelites will determine the age of the deformation in the basin.\r\n3. Time of uplift of Caborca block. The age of uplift of the basin margin will be\r\ndetermined from stratigraphic relations and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronology in order to\r\nestablish time of uplift of the outboard block relative to deformation of the basin. The\r\nuplift analysis will also permit evaluation of provenance results.\r\nThis integrated sedimentologic, structural and geochronologic study will evaluate\r\nthe transform processes that are inferred to have created the southwestern Cordilleran\r\nmargin beginning in the Late Jurassic. If the megashear hypothesis remains tenable, this\r\nstudy should serve as a template for other analyses of ancient continental transform\r\nmargins. If the megashear hypothesis is refuted, the study will force re-evaluation of the\r\nMesozoic tectonics of the southwestern Cordilleran margin and the kinematics of\r\nPangean supercontinent break up in Mexico.\r\n",
