 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional magnetic recording paradigms are approaching challenges that will likely require significant shifts in recording technologies.  Magnetodynamics is the most critical aspect we face when designing advanced recording systems.  As the size of the recording bits shrink to allow more data stored per area, the signal levels and thermal stability decrease approaching levels for which no known solution is available.  In addition to the long term thermal stability, writing speeds appear to be reaching fundamental dynamic limits. Successful development of new technologies will be hampered without further understanding of magnetodynamics as applied to recording technologies.\r\n\r\nPatterned film media for signal definition, stability, and tracking is gaining acceptance as a viable recording scheme, especially with the recent advances in imprint lithography.  Switching of media for recording applications, whether continuous, patterned, or particulate, is not fully understood.  This knowledge is critical to the successful design and analysis of future recording paradigms.  Through this proposed research, our complementary team will address this important topic theoretically, experimentally, and through advanced magnetic modeling.  We will investigate high speed dynamic as well as quasi-static switching behavior.\r\n\r\nThis research has as its goals the fundamental understanding of the switching of magnetic nanostructures for use in memory storage devices and the development of a practical manufacturing process to produce these materials at a low cost and in large scale.  While alternate approaches including interference lithography and self ordered media have been considered, nanoimprint lithography has the necessary resolution capacity and the ability to incorporate non-regular, non-rectangular patterns such as those desired for tracking and sectoring.\r\n\r\nThis research will impact the understanding of magnetization dynamics and stability crucial for the realization of practical applications.  Realistic modeling of magnetic structures will enable the design of these materials.  This technology will have wide applicability for many markets.  We expect to impact several areas and break new ground in making magnetic recording media and devices.\r\n\r\nThe interaction and collaboration will provide new resources for the scientific community.  It will exploit both the existing expertise, and contribute to the development of pertinent expertise in these institutions, and it will engender in them an awareness of strategic national needs.  Apart from the direct scientific benefit, the program will be training multidisciplinary experts in an area of national importance currently underrepresented in the curricula and research pursued by traditional students.\r\n\r\n",
