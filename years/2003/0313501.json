A mutant screen for gametophytic mutations using Ds insertion lines will be performed,  resulting in the identification of an estimated 400 gametophytic mutants.  The genes disrupted by these insertions will be identified by sequence and posted on a website at UC Davis (http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sundar/).  Characterization of gene function will be carried out through integrated genetic, cellular and developmental study of the female and male gametophytes in the mutants.  The characterized mutants will be made publicly available through deposition in the ABRC stock center. In addition, we will use expression profiling to identify female gametophyte-specific genes.  Relatively little is known about the genes and functions required for gametophytic development in flowering plants. The aim of the 2010 project to determine the functions of all Arabidopsis genes will require the identification and characterization of gametophytic genes, which play a critical role in plant reproduction. These studies will also yield potential applications towards the control of reproduction in crop plants. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project will provide comprehensive training in plant biology research for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students at both participating institutions.  Efforts will be made to recruit individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in this project.  In the case of undergraduate students, the PIs will work with specific programs at their institutions intended for the purpose of encouraging minority participation  in research.  In addition, participants in the project will be involved in outreach efforts to schools through the attachment of high school students and through workshop modules in middle schools.\r\n",
