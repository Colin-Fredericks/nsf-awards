 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Larry M. Page, Florida Museum of Natural History, to organize and conduct an interdisciplinary workshop that will bring together representatives of professional scientific societies and museums and other research institutions for the purpose of producing a long-term vision for taxonomy and natural history collections.  Important research areas and questions that require taxonomic research and natural history collections will be identified.  In addition, workshop participants will identify educational challenges and opportunities related to taxonomic research and natural history collections, both in terms of educating a new generation of taxonomists and in making taxonomic knowledge accessible to the public and educators.  Acknowledging that conservation biologists and resource managers depend on accurate taxonomies and museum collection records for prioritizing areas for protection and for informed management policies, participants will recommend ways to expedite the process of species discovery and description. \r\n\r\nA preliminary report will be sent electronically to NSF by January 31, 2004, and a printed final report submitted to NSF by May 15, 2004.\r\n",
