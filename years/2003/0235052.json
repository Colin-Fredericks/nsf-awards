 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  Positive feedback has been proposed as a mechanism that results in the\r\nstable persistence of alternative states of an ecosystem.  Such feedback\r\nmay operate through plant-induced alterations in soil microbial\r\ncommunities, which in turn alter plant communities through changes in\r\nnutrient dynamics.  The recent replacement of native understory plant\r\ncommunities in eastern deciduous forests by apparently stable communities\r\nof exotic species provides an excellent model system in which to test the\r\npresence of soil-mediated positive feedbacks. Previous studies of this\r\nsystem have shown that the recent shift in community composition is related\r\nto changes in both nutrient cycling processes and microbial community\r\ncomposition.  I propose greenhouse microcosm and field plot experiments to\r\ntest whether plants drive changes in soil-based ecosystem processes by\r\naltering the soil microbiota, and whether these changes in turn promote the\r\ndominance of the exotics.  The proposed studies will explicitly contrast a\r\nlitter-driven above-ground mechanism with a root-driven below-ground\r\nmechanism.  \r\nBROADER IMPACTS: If the hypothesis of plant-soil positive feedback created by\r\naltered nutrient cycling is supported, it would both demonstrate a\r\nplausible mechanism for the persistence of alternative stable communities\r\nand help explain the establishment of dominance by some exotic plant\r\nspecies.  In addition, this project will train at least 1 graduate student and 3 undergraduates.\r\n",
