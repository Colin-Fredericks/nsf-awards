 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zhou, the principal investigator proposes to develop theory and methods \r\nwhich can be implemented by numerical algorithms for efficiently and stablely \r\nsolving multiple saddle point problems. The PI proposes to\r\n(1) establish local characterizations of Unconstrained or Constrained saddle \r\npoints in Hilbert, Banach spaces for various multiple solution problems;\r\n(2) develop numerical algorithms for finding multiple saddle points; \r\nto carry out numerical tests on various model problems and make codes available \r\nto other researchers;\r\n(3) do convergence and error analysis of the algorithms; develop techniques to \r\nenhance stability, efficiency and convergence rate of the algorithms;\r\n(4) develop tools that can be numerically carried out for investigating \r\ninstability and maneuverability of multiple saddle points;\r\n(5) study important multiple saddle point problems in applications, such as,\r\nan eigen-pair problem in nonlinear optics and the elliptic sine-Gordon equation \r\nin condensed matter physics for multiple solutions and their instabilities \r\nand maneuverabilities.\r\n\r\nStability is one of the main concerns for system design and control. \r\nConventional theory and numerical methods are designed to find stable solutions.\r\nHowever, in many applications, PERFORMANCE or MANEUVERABILITY is more desirable,\r\nespecially in system design and control of EMERGENCY machineries for MISSION \r\nCRITICAL SITUATIONS. On the other hand, many problems in applications possess \r\nmultiple (unstable) solutions with different performance, maneuverabilities \r\n(an ability to shift from one solution to others) and instabilities. An \r\nunstable solution is a transitional solution which exists only in a certain \r\ntime period. An unstable solution may have much higher performance and \r\nmaneuverability than others. Finding multiple solutions enables one to select \r\nthe best solution. However, due to unstable nature, those solutions are very \r\nelusive to numerical computation. There is virtually no theory in the \r\nliterature to devise an efficient and stable numerical algorithm for this \r\npurpose until recently (2001) when the PI and his student developed a New \r\nMethod. With which a numerical algorithm is devised for finding multiple \r\nunstable solutions and has been tested on many multiple solution problems. \r\nPreliminary results are quite promising and show great potential. The projects \r\ndescribed in this proposal are further developments of the preliminary results \r\nin several important directions. The outcome of the projects will greatly \r\nenhance people's understanding on unstable solutions, provide numerical \r\nalgorithms for finding multiple solutions and promote more applications.\r\n",
