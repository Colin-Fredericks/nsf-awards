Skilled professionals in the area of microfabrication are the ultimate result of enhanced student cognitive understanding.  The objective is being accomplished by adapting the teaching methods instituted by Green and Allen in \"Development of an Interdisciplinary Curriculum in Electronic Materials and Devices: Cooking Without Recipes\" at San Jose State University.  The newly developed laboratory modules feature a team-oriented, research-based experience with the students themselves designing, fabricating, and testing a microelectromechanical device.   Because of its multidisciplinary character the project is having a broad impact across several STEM disciplines.",
