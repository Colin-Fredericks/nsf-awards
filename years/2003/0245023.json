 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the properties of ultracold plasmas and Rydberg gases.  Plasma is by far the most common form of matter in the universe, but is usually quite hot, even when created in the laboratory.  The researchers of this project developed a technique that starts with laser-cooled atoms to produce ultracold plasmas, with temperatures as low as a few K.  This work will study the properties of expanding ultracold plasmas. The researchers will investigate how to excite and probe collective excitations of the plasma, such as ion acoustic waves. They will measure the equilibration time for the electrons in the plasma, which is critical in determining the dynamics of the system.  They will adapt methods from plasma physics to confine the plasma, which will allow longer periods of time for investigations, as well as change the dynamics related to the expansion process. On the broader impact, a greater understanding of these systems may have relevance for atomic processes in plasmas, astrophysical processes occurring in the interior of planets and stars, as well as for inertial confinement fusion.",
