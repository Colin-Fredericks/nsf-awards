A major focus will be the\r\nCabling Conjecture, which asserts that Dehn surgery on a\r\nhyperbolic knot in the 3-sphere always yields a prime\r\n3-manifold. This is part of the program to completely describe\r\nall non-hyperbolic Dehn surgeries on hyperbolic knots.  Recently,\r\nJohn Luecke and the principal investigator showed that the\r\nhyperbolic knots with non-integral toroidal Dehn surgeries are\r\nprecisely those described by Eudave-Munoz, and some of the\r\ntechniques developed there may be applicable to the Cabling\r\nConjecture. Another part of the general program that will be\r\naddressed is the conjecture that any Seifert fiber space surgery\r\non a hyperbolic knot must be integral. The project will also\r\nconsider various geometric group theoretic topics that are\r\nrelated to the theory of 3-manifolds, such as surface subgroups\r\nof Coxeter and Artin groups, and Gromov's question as to whether\r\nor not a 1-ended word hyperbolic group always has a surface\r\nsubgroup.  Another question concerning surfaces and 3-manifolds\r\nthat will be investigated is the Simple Loop Conjecture, which\r\nasserts that if a map from a closed orientable surface to a\r\nclosed orientable 3-manifold is not injective on fundamental\r\ngroup, then there is an embedded essential loop in the surface\r\nwhose image is null-homotopic in the 3-manifold.\r\n\r\n(2) The project is part of the general goal to understand the\r\nstructure of 3-dimensional manifolds. These are objects that are\r\nlocally like ordinary 3-dimensional space, but whose global\r\nstructure may be quite complicated.  Since we live in a\r\n3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to\r\ndescribe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial\r\nuniverse. One important aspect of 3-dimensional topology is the\r\ntheory of knots - a knot being a closed loop embedded somehow in\r\nspace. A wide variety of mathematical methods can be applied to\r\nthe study of knots, leading to new information about\r\n3-manifolds. Recently, deep connections between 3-dimensional\r\ntopology and quantum physics were discovered in this way. Knot\r\ntheory is related to the general theory of 3-manifolds through a\r\nconstruction known as Dehn surgery, in which a solid tube around\r\nthe knot is removed and sewn back in differently. We note that a\r\ntheorem about Dehn surgery, the Cyclic Surgery Theorem, has been\r\nused to determine the topological nature of the action of certain\r\nenzymes on strands of DNA.  Many aspects of Dehn surgery are now\r\nquite well understood. One of the main remaining questions, which\r\nis a major focus of the project, is to show that (except in an\r\nobvious degenerate situation) the 3-manifold resulting from a\r\nDehn surgery on a knot never decomposes as a \"sum\" of two simpler\r\nmanifolds. Another important tool in 3-dimensional topology is\r\nthe study of (2-dimensional) surfaces in 3-manifolds, and the\r\nproject will also address various questions in this\r\narea. Finally, the project will enable the principal investigator\r\nto continue his involvement in the education and training of\r\ngraduate students in topology at the University of Texas at\r\nAustin.\r\n",
