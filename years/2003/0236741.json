Advances in instrumentation are a key component of many research advances.  This project involves the purchase of a new instrument to facilitate studies that will contribute to our understanding of deep earth processes, climate change, and earth history.  The new design features of the instrument will allow us to more precisely measure small differences in isotope ratios for elements like Sr, Nd, Os, U, Ca and Fe.  These small isotopic variations provide important clues about earth processes that cannot be obtained by other means.  The new instrument will be used for geochemical investigations in biogeochemistry, mantle geochemistry, basalt petrogenesis, silicic magma systems, granite petrogenesis, crustal growth and structure, geochronology, ocean paleochemistry, and groundwater and deep sea pore fluid geochemistry.  Anticipated studies include U and Th isotopes in volcanic rocks and groundwaters, Sr isotopes in zircon, Fe isotopes, and negative ion studies for elements like Os, Se and B.  The new instrument will replace a 14-year-old multi-collector instrument in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science.  The University of California will contribute about half of the funds for the purchase. Intellectual merit:  The PI has 27 years of experience in isotope geochemical research, has an extensive record of publication, and has trained more than twenty Ph.D. students.  The Institution has a long record of support of facilities, and there is sufficient research funding to ensure the instrumentation will be well used.  Broader Impacts:  The proposed instrumentation constitutes a significant improvement to the research and educational infrastructure at U.C. Berkeley.  In the previous 14 years, 20 graduate students (8 women) 8 postdoctoral fellows (4 women), plus more than 20 visitors, undergraduates and collaborators have pursued research in the facility that will house the new instrument.  The planned research will benefit society by improving our knowledge of natural hazards and global climate change.\r\n***\r\n",
