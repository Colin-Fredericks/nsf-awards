 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models training award affords the student the opportunity to take a year of courses at Columbia University in formal and empirical training.  His dissertation asks the question:  how does the introduction of the news media as a strategic actor affect the political representation process. Further training in game theory will allow him to apply formal logic to a number of understudied questions within political communication and  congressional scholarship.  The training will strengthen the dissertation and will strengthen the research and teaching skills of the student.\r\n\r\nThe award has the broader social value of enhancing understanding about legislator, news media and constituency interaction.  It also strengthens the research and teaching skills of this member of the professorate.\r\n\r\n",
