 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent computational studies have suggested that E. coli metabolic and regulatory networks are small-world, which are often characterized by the presence of highly connected \"hub\" nodes that connect highly intra-connected sub-networks and, therefore, play an important role in shaping overall network behavior. This project describes a combined experimental and computational approach to discover genes whose over-expression has the strongest affect on cell behavior and to determine if these genes display biological network connectivity values that are characteristic of \"small-world\" network architectures. It is proposed to apply and further develop a new and innovative post-genomics methodology, parallel gene-trait mapping that enables new experiment-based investigations of the structure of E. coli biological networks at the whole-genome level. In parallel, it is proposed to perform computational studies that will create and parse E. coli regulatory and metabolic network-graphs to determine individual gene connectivity values. A primary outcome of this work will be the training of several young scientists and students at the interface of the biological and computational sciences. A second outcome will be the further development and application of a novel post-genomics methodology that can be used in a variety of contexts.",
