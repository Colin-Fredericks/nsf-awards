 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Slovene research project between Gregory Crawford of Brown University, Daniele Finotello of Kent State University, and Slobodan Zumer of the University of Ljubljana examines the structure and ordering of nematic liquid crystals confined to templates ranging from nano- to micro-sized dimensions.  Postdoctoral fellows as well as graduate and undergraduate students from each institution will also participate on this international team.  The multidisciplinary research plan involves three complementary areas: 1) nanoscale confinement utilizing prefabricated templates, 2) photo-self diffusion mediated templating, and 3) back-flow mediated templating.  These latter two areas are a new thrust in synthesis and characterization of innovative structures created by photo-self-diffusion using multiple beam holography and the capturing of unusual structures created from back flow with photopolymerization. Several experimental techniques will be applied to understand the underpinning physics of these novel structures, including nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, light scattering, electro-optics, as well as theory and simulation.  Results should improve our fundamental understanding of liquid crystals and their potential applications in emerging nano- and micro-scale technologies using soft condensed materials.\r\n\r\nThis project in nanoscale materials fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. and Slovenian students to the international research community through work at partner institutions and direct involvement in the project's advanced characterization, modeling and fabrication techniques.",
