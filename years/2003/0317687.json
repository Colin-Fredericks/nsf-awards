 "awd_abstract_narration": "The permanent loss of species, called extinction, is occurring on a global scale at a rapidly increasing rate.  Over the long term, only the process of speciation can increase the number of species.  This project will investigate the role played by small, isolated populations in the rapid speciation of Darwin's finches, which provide a model system for evolutionary research.  The investigators will compare birds from many island populations in the Galapagos, using different molecular markers and including recently developed methods of DNA fingerprinting.  These data will provide a rare opportunity to critically evaluate what many scientists believe to be a very common mode of speciation.\r\n\r\n\tNature reserves are designed primarily to protect existing species from extinction, but these designs may also affect future speciation.  This project will provide valuable information about the role of geography in speciation.  Funding for this project will support the training of a post-doctoral researcher, graduate students and undergraduates.  These research opportunities dovetail with existing host institution programs that include course credit for research, support for independent research, and fellowships that target traditionally underrepresented groups.  The general interest in Galapagos organisms will also provide opportunities to educate the public about evolutionary processes.\r\n",
