GC/MS experiments are being adapted from the Journal of Chemical Education and derived from the primary research literature.   A wide range of students (science majors and non-science majors, and first-year students through seniors) are being exposed to GC/MS techniques at varied levels of complexity with an eye towards illustrating the design of experiments that take advantage of automation and providing the students with experience generating and interpreting large data sets.  The GC/MS is also being used to expand the range of possible student-faculty research projects.\r\n \r\n",
