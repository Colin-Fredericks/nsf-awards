 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nPage A\r\nThis proposal describes a novel research program on nonlinear control of multi-body\r\nvehicles operating under the action of gravitational forces and control forces generated\r\nby prismatic actuators. Multi-body vehicles are mechanical systems consisting of a rigid\r\nbase body that can translate and rotate in three dimensions and auxiliary bodies that are\r\nconstrained to move relative to the base body and to one another. The multi-body vehicles\r\nare controlled using prismatic actuator devices, mounted on the base body. These are\r\nlinear electromechanical actuators that move a proof mass along a track fixed to the base\r\nbody. This is a novel actuation technology that has great potential for providing new\r\nmaneuvering capabilities, namely precision translation and global attitude maneuvers, for\r\nmulti-body vehicles. On the other hand, the design and operation of such multi-body\r\nvehicles present many challenges since they are not fully actuated in the sense that there\r\nare fewer control inputs than there are degrees of freedom to be controlled. Key aspects\r\nof the proposed research, from which arise the major research challenges, are: (1) the\r\npresence of controlled mechanical symmetries and their associated integrals of motion and\r\n(2) the objective of achieving arbitrary rest to rest maneuvers for the multi-body\r\nvehicles.\r\nAlthough some nonlinear control problems for multi-body mechanical systems are relatively\r\nsimple, the problems posed in this research can not be adequately handled based on the\r\ncurrent state of knowledge. The proposed research is the culmination of the NSF supported\r\nresearch of the principal investigator over the last fourteen years. It represents an\r\nextension of his previous research on nonlinear control of constrained and underactuated\r\nmechanical systems to new problems that have not previously been amenable to study using\r\ntraditional nonlinear control methods. The expected contributions of the proposed\r\nresearch are: (1) the development of nonlinear control theory for the class of multi-body\r\nvehicles studied, (2) the development of innovative new system design and control\r\nstrategies for multi-body vehicles, and (3) educational impacts through student\r\nparticipation in the research. The research concepts are to be applied to maneuvering\r\nvehicles operating in space or under water, and they are ideally suited for small-scale\r\nintelligent autonomous sensor systems operating in space or under water. The proposed\r\nresearch has the potential to provide new and enhanced maneuvering capabilities for\r\nmulti-body vehicles, thereby contributing to the overall engineering infrastructure in\r\ntransportation, exploration, remote sensing, and surveillance.",
