It focuses on fundamental issues in adult cognition and adult learning for low wage, low education workers in service jobs, where there is a large difference between \"school learning\" and ongoing learning of new skills in the workplace. The organizational partner is a commercial facility that supports life sciences research. \r\nThe broader impact of this research is potentially great importance to better manage rapid cognitive change in support of changing organizational goals, especially among low-wage workers. There is considerable potential for improving the contribution and labor force potential of low-skill support workers, particularly in scientific, engineering and medical areas.\r\n\r\n",
