 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal describes a new more comprehensive approach to the\r\ndesign of feedback controls for a wide variety of systems. The basic \r\nidea is to replace the usual\r\ndifferential equation description of the system being controlled by a \r\ncorresponding\r\nLouiville equation and to formulate an optimization problem that takes \r\ninto account a range of initial\r\nconditions and the way in which the control depends on time and state. \r\nThe mathematical problems that\r\narise do not seem to have been explored up until now and so an important \r\nintellectual challenge to\r\nbe overcome in this research will be to develop methods for solving the \r\ntype of variational problems\r\ninvolving partial differential equations that arise in these problems.  \r\n\r\nThe potential for this work to benefit society rests on two main lines \r\nof thought.  First of all, control\r\nsystems are now found in almost all durable goods, including \r\ndishwashers, heaters,\r\ntoasters, automobiles, etc. and are becoming common in building \r\nmanagement involving lighting, heating and\r\nsecurity. The use of conventional optimal control often defines a \r\ncontrol law that is too expensive to\r\nimplement and so that ad hoc schemes are used that yield a performance \r\nlevel that is not all that it\r\ncould be. The ideas discussed here are directed toward developing a \r\nmethodology for finding less expensive,\r\nhigher performance solutions. Secondly, although biological systems are \r\nreplete with feedback control\r\nmechanisms, conventional control theory has had only limited success in \r\npredicting and explaining the\r\nstructures identified so far. Arguing that living systems, through \r\nevolution, are attempting to optimize a\r\ntrade-off between the performance of the system and its complexity, we \r\nmake the case that better\r\nsuccess will be had in explaining biological phenomena using theories of \r\nthe type proposed here.\r\n\r\nThe proposer has a long history of educating students at both the \r\ngraduate and undergraduate level. For\r\nexample, this spring one of his undergraduate students received one of \r\nonly three ``Fay\" prizes\r\n given to graduating seniors for research  work.  The student designed  \r\nand fabricated  a VLSI chip\r\nimplementing a very sophisticated  motor controller. This is the second \r\nundergraduate student of his in\r\nthe last two years that has received University wide recognition for \r\nundergraduate research.  The funds\r\nrequested are absolutely essential if he is to make these kinds of \r\nopportunities available to tomorrow's\r\nstudents, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.    \r\n\r\n",
