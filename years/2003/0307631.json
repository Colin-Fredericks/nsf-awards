The workshop is targeted at young women researchers in probability and statistics who have received their doctorates in the last five years. A major talk from a senior researchers focuses on how to develop a research career, the pitfalls to be avoided as participants establish their own academic careers, and general advice on how to be as successful as they can in the research academic environment. The talk itself is the springboard for extended discussions among the junior participants and invited senior researchers governing the issues raised. In addition, workshop participants give a brief presentation of their research interests and research environment. The opportunity to meet and interact with each other as well as a few established researchers is invaluable as the participants learn to promote their own research and to decrease their professional isolation. As a result of the workshop, attendees should be more successful in their own researcher careers, and thus, for example, survive the promotion and tenure process so that these women become role models for the students at all levels (undergraduate and graduate) in their own training programs.\r\n",
