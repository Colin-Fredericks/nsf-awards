 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Colorado at Boulder is attracting highly qualified students into careers in K-12 math and science education through strategies that integrate the transformation of undergraduate science and mathematics courses with the recruitment and training of prospective teachers. Undergraduates who have an interest in K-12 mathematics and science teaching are offered a Teaching Fellowship program rich with incentives, including financial support, intensive contact with faculty, opportunities for undergraduate research in science and education, employment as learning assistants as part of an undergraduate course transformation initiative, and K-12 teaching experience. The project pays special attention to recruiting and retaining minority students.   To optimize the learning opportunities for these students, faculty participants in the project are developing and evaluating transformed sections of introductory courses in selected fields of science and mathematics in order to incorporate best practices in inquiry-based and collaborative learning. Project participants develop, employ, and assess information technology tools to enhance inquiry-based and collaborative learning both at the undergraduate and K-12 levels. These tools include web-based software for content delivery and communication among students and faculty, simulations of mathematical, physical, and biological phenomena, and database management tools embedded in the course structure for formative and summative assessment of student learning and attitudes. The Teaching Fellows participate in workshops for inservice teachers, serve as learning assistants in transformed undergraduate courses, help introduce IT-enhanced instructional modules into grade 6 -12 classrooms, and assess the effectiveness of the tools.    Introductory physics, astronomy, calculus, and biology courses are targeted for revision to incorporate student-centered, conceptual learning environments, the use of the learning assistants as leaders of student learning teams, and the use of technology.  The work is being carried out through a close partnership between faculty of the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences, school districts, and Sun Microsystems.  The goals of the project are to transform introductory undergraduate mathematics and science classes, to develop an infrastructure to recruit and support a substantial flow of students who will become leaders in K-12 mathematics and science  education, and to provide a network of support for in-service teachers. The project expects to graduate 25 to 40 secondary mathematics and science teachers per year.  \r\n\r\n",
