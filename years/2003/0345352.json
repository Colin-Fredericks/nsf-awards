 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a multidisciplinary approach to examination of network intrusion. Prior models have relied heavily or exclusively on traffic analysis and detection as the basis for NIDS [Network Intrusion Detection Systems]. The project extends that concept by adding two elements that have not been part of an NDIS previously: combining sociometric analysis and organizational patterns using mathematical techniques based on nonlinear and non-monotonic models. Project outcomes include a draft model, which will have two benefits: an ability to detect intrusions more quickly and to act as guide for development of software, middleware, and hardware to deter or to deny intrusions.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project extends and enhances the knowledge of both intruders and the tools [hardware and software] they use. The knowledge gained will enable researchers in the social sciences, computer and information sciences, and security experts to understand more clearly the impetus for, the techniques used, and the possibilities for deterring or denying network or system intrusions. There is significant social, economic, and institutional benefit to increasing our knowledge in this area.\r\nBroader Impacts: Computer and network security is critical to government, industry, and individuals. The greater the knowledge of intruder activity and techniques, the greater the potential for deterrence or denial of such activities. The economic impact resulting from such intrusions and the economic impact of planning for and attempting to stop such intrusions is direct cost to any institution. Mitigating such drain is clearly a broader impact of this project. This is an NSA funded project.\r\n",
