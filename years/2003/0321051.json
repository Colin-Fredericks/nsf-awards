 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art EPR spectrometer to conduct high quality research in a variety of materials. EPR spectroscopy is an essential experimental technique needed for the research programs of several BSU researchers. The principal investigator and several on-campus BSU researchers will employ the EPR spectrometer in research projects on nanoparticles, magnetic materials, semiconductors, ultra-thin gate oxides, protein structure-function studies, enzymes, and catalysts. EPR spectroscopy will be employed to identify EPR active species, determine the electronic state, site symmetry, local co-ordination and interaction of paramagnetic ions, radicals, defects and species and to investigate micro-magnetic and structural properties. The PI is an expert of EPR spectroscopy, and the co-PIs and several users have significant experience and training on EPR spectroscopy. \r\n\r\nAll the PI.s and other BSU users have several graduate and undergraduate students currently involved in their research programs. The availability of an EPR spectrometer on the campus will facilitate effective training of these student researchers, as well as yield important research results. It will also become part of the research-oriented teaching adopted in the new Materials Science and Engineering program. Women and underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged to participate in the research programs. A mechanism to allow interested researchers on campus, in local industry, and at other universities and research institutions to use the EPR spectrometer will be implemented.  The MRAM research group of Boise-based Micron Technology and biomedical research groups of the VA Medical Center and Mountain States Medical Research Institute (MSMRI) have ongoing research programs in areas related to magnetism and magnetic resonance and have expressed strong interest in collaborating with BSU researchers on studies employing EPR spectroscopy. An EPR spectrometer is not currently available at BSU, nor anywhere in and around Boise. Researchers at several universities in Idaho and the surrounding region, such as the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, Washington State University and the University of Utah have expressed strong interest in using EPR spectroscopy in collaboration with BSU researchers.\r\n\r\n",
