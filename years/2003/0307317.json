 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to organize a Symposium on Supply Chain Management in the Process Industry. The symposium will be held over two days in Fall 2003 on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The symposium is being co-sponsored by the University Minnesota Center for Supply Chain Research and Honeywell Corporation. The symposium will bring together academics with backgrounds in Industrial Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Operations Management, and Operations Research. It will also involve leading companies in the process industry and leading supply chain solution providers. The objective of the workshop is to expose researchers to problems specific to the process industry, survey state of the art in research and practice, identify relevant research problems, and formulate a possible research agenda. A second objective of the symposium is to encourage greater collaboration among academics from different backgrounds and between academics and industry. A third objective is to allow knowledge sharing between various process industries, such as the chemical, food processing, and pharmaceutical industries. The symposium will have a mixed format of plenary speakers, invited and contributed talks, and panel discussions.\r\n\r\nA report based on presentations and panel discussions will be submitted to NSF and posted on the symposium web site. Selected papers from the symposium to are expected to form the basis of an edited book on supply chain in the process industry.",
