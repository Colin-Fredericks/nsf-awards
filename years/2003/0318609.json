 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Empirical Methods in Cognitive Linguistics Workshop brings together a large group of linguists and psychologists from around the world (plus three-dozen selected graduate students).  Thw workshop, organized by Dr. Michael Spivey, demonstrates state-of-art empirical methods in Cognitive Linguistics.  The research progrm of Cognitive Linguistics breaks from tradition with it's claim that language is NOT an encapsulated function of the mind.  Language intertwines with perception, action, and cognition, all of which hsape language acquistion and ordinary discourse.\r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of 10 faculty-led sessions that include instruction in statistical analyses of natural langage corpora and hands-on training in laboratory protocols (e.g. verbal protocol, reaction-time tasks, eye-tracking, neuroimaging).  The purpose is to cross-pollinate the disciplines of Linguistics and Psychology.  The explicit goal of the workshop is to instill shared knowledge research strategies allows for shared intuitions in how to conduct impirical studies of language.  To that end, one session focuses exclusively on the logistics and infrasturcture of international collaborations.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERITS of the workshop include an unprecedented sharing of experimental methods and solutions and a focus on training of graduate students.  In additon to the plenary speaker, Dr. Leonard Talmy, a long list of highly respected cognitive linguists and experimental psychologists will be attending as session-leaders and as particpants.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS of the workshop include structured opportunities to form new international and interdisciplinary collaborations between linguists and psychologists and a unique opportunity for training of graduate students.",
