The workshop, which will host materials researchers and educators from all over the world,  is the second of a series that focuses on an extended outcome, the creation of a Global Nanotechnology Network. The first workshop in the series was held at the 7th ICAM in Cancun, Mexico, in 2001.  \r\n\r\nThe Global Nanotechnology Network, operating at regular intervals in real space and continuously in cyberspace, will enhance global collaboration in nanotechnology research and education.  The proposed workshop will facilitate the development of cooperative activities in materials research between the US and countries in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n",
