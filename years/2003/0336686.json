 "awd_abstract_narration": "fTo enhance academic exchanges and university-industry cooperation in the research of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite materials, the Florida Advanced Center for Composite Technologies (FAC2T) at the Florida A&M University/Florida State University College of Engineering will host a workshop on Design, Modeling, Fabrication and Characterization of Nanotube-Reinforced Composite Materials for Multifunctional Applications. The workshop will be held at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. Approximately 50-60 invited participants from academic institutes, research laboratories, industrial companies and governmental agencies are expected to attend this one and a half day workshop to:\r\n1.  Stimulate and exchange ideas for using nanotubes as reinforcement in making multifunctional composite materials and structures,  2.  Promote, facilitate and develop partnerships in nanocomposite research, 3.  Define research goals, determine business opportunities, identify technical challenges and develop a 5-year technology roadmap, 4.  Identify methods for reducing costs to make the processing affordable for more commercial applications, and 5.  Identify further applications for use of nanocomposites in addition to space and aerospace structural safety, medicine, sensors and energy savings.  \r\n \r\nThis workshop will significantly enhance the field of nanotechnology and manufacturing. Information from the workshop will be disseminated via a website and papers, potentially leading to annual workshops to further advance these developments. These developments promise to lead to optimizing nanotubes and manufacturing processes for producing lightweight, exceptionally strong composites that can be used in a host of applications, including space and aerospace structural safety, medical applications and energy savings.  \r\n",
