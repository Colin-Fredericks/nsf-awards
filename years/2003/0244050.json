Students will gain a basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in altering environmental, human, and ecosystem health; and the research skills needed to analyze and understand environmental issues in the context of engineering and public health. Eight students will participate in the first project year, and twelve students thereafter each year. The site will provide research opportunities to outstanding students from colleges and universities that do not routinely provide research opportunities to undergraduate students. Students will be recruited from engineering, pre-engineering, and science undergraduate programs. In particular UAB will work together with Tuskeegee University, Clark Atlanta University, Alabama A&M University, and Birmingham-Southern College to recruit students. The research in which students will be involved will be in the following general topic areas, based on the on-going research of faculty mentors: (1) Air Pollution and Interactions in the Human Body; (2) Engineering and Public Health in Disaster Management; (3) Environmental Impacts of Coal Combustion Byproducts; and (4) Pollution Prevention.\r\n",
