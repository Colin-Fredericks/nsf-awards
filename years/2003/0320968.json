 "awd_abstract_narration": "0320968\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n There has been a considerable effort in research at Oklahoma State\r\nUniversity (OSU) in recent years in the fields of polymer fatigue, mechanics in the\r\nmanufacturing of continuous thin materials, called webs, high-speed machining of\r\ndifficult-to-machine materials, finishing of advanced ceramics, and fluid-structure\r\ninteractions. It has relied on extensive experimental investigations utilizing advanced\r\ninstrumentation. Technologies developed from these researches have been transferred\r\nto industry and have directly benefited sponsoring and other companies, such as\r\nEastman Kodak, 3M, Imation, Procter & Gamble, ALCOA, Rockwell Automation,\r\nMedtronic, and DuPont; and research findings have been published in leading archival\r\njournals and conferences. To continue research in these fields for the discovery in\r\nscience and engineering and for the development of new technologies transferable to\r\nindustry, a high-speed digital camera system is needed to investigate the high-speed\r\nmechanics accompanied with the research in these areas. The projects outlined in this\r\nproposal require the ability to observe in situ high-speed phenomena occurring in these\r\nfields. Experiments using the camera will be conducted to investigate the dynamic crack\r\ninitiation and propagation at high-speeds in both virgin and fatigue-damaged structural\r\npolymers for the purpose of identifying the onset and the mode of failure; to study high-speed\r\nmechanical slitting processes of plastic and metallic webs; to study the\r\nmechanisms of high-speed machining processes of advanced materials; to study the\r\nmechanisms of material removal in magnetic-field-assisted ceramic polishing processes;\r\nto study the interaction of thin films (solid) and turbulent air (fluid) in web manufacturing\r\nprocesses; to examine blade structural response and aerodynamic damping in\r\nturbomachine compressors; and to study the high-speed winding of webs.\r\nThe availability of high-speed digital camera will greatly enhance the\r\nresearch infrastructure at OSU, as well as develop research infrastructure in Oklahoma,\r\nan EPSCoR state, to enhance research competitiveness of the state; it will also help\r\nsupport productive research that will continuously benefit the U.S. industry, especially\r\nthe web material industry through the Web Handling Research Center, the only center\r\non web handling in the world, that is sponsored by 17 U.S. companies. \r\n\r\n",
