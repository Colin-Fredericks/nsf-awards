 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)  A new course titled \"Environmental Geology Service Learning Research Projects\" is being adapted from the service learning course described by Mogk and King in the Journal of Geoscience Education (1995). Curriculum objectives of the course are addressing the National Science Standards of \"Science as Inquiry\" by involving students in service learning, environmental geology, and group research projects. The service learning projects are being developed in cooperation with resource management staff of Metro Parks, Serving Summit County and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The course structure is simulating a consulting firm with students working collaboratively as research teams on a resource management project. The teams are developing the method of investigating the problem, preparing a proposal and budget, collecting and analyzing the data, preparing a final report, poster and press release. At the culmination of the course, students are presenting the results of their project to the public at an open house. The primary audiences for this course are 2nd and 3rd year geology majors, and middle school through high school pre-service science teachers. The program is being evaluated using a variety of quantitative and qualitative assessments such as pre- and post-writing assignments, student self-reports, the \"Nature of Scientific Knowledge Scale\" standardized instrument, and standard student evaluations (IDEA form). The broader impacts of this project include improving student learning of \"Science as Inquiry\" by integrating service learning into a collaborative research experience in environmental geology. The course is enhancing the education of students planning to pursue careers in Geoscience and Environmental Science, and should enable future teachers to better incorporate inquiry-based methods into their teaching.\r\n",
