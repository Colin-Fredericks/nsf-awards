 "awd_abstract_narration": "The members of Louisiana Tech University's Center for Applied Physics \r\nStudies (CAPS) are deeply involved in the current and future parity \r\nviolation experiments at Jefferson lab. The Group's primary experimental \r\ninvolvements are the study of the  substructure of the proton as members \r\nof the G0 experiment, and testing the basic theory of\r\nmodern physics, the Standard Model, as members of the newly approved \r\nQweak experiment. They are also developing their own scientific program \r\nas spokespersons for the E01-115 experiment which will measure the\r\nparity violating asymmetry in the reaction when the proton is excited \r\ninto its first resonant state, the Delta. The experiment will be \r\nperformed using the G0 apparatus in its backward angle mode, and will \r\nprobe an important component of the proton's structure, a quantity known \r\nas the axial vector transition form factor, inaccessible in other \r\nreactions. This form factor measures the contribution of the proton's \r\nintrinsic  spin to the dynamics of this transition. To facilitate the \r\nbackward angle measurements for both the G0 elastic and N --> Delta \r\nexperiments, Louisiana Tech is working on the design, installation, and \r\ntesting of the Cryostat Exit Detectors (CED's) which also includes\r\ndevelopment of the associated signal processing electronics.  \r\nCommissioning for the G0 forward angle measurements has been completed, \r\nand the next set of measurements is scheduled to be run in October of\r\n2003. The backward angle measurements are expected to start early in 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Group has taken on a crucial role in the Qweak experiment which will \r\nsearch for physics beyond the standard model by measuring the proton's \r\nweak charge. Since the inception of the Qweak experiment,\r\nthe CAPS Group has been working on the design of major components and \r\nattributes of the spectrometer and detector systems. The Group's \r\nresponsibilities for the upcoming experiment will be the design,\r\ntesting, construction, and installation of a component of the forward \r\ntracking system which will play a crucial role in measuring the \r\nkinematics and background of the experiment. These new detectors will be \r\nbased on the innovative technology of Gas Electron Multiplication (GEMs) \r\nwhich have been recently developed at CERN. To continue Louisiana Tech's \r\nprogram of parity violation measurements, the group submitted an Letter \r\nof Intent to the JLab PAC to extend its own program of measurements of \r\nthe the parity violating asymmetry in the N --> Delta transition at \r\nforward angles. This experiment will measure a fundamental coupling \r\nconstant of dynamic theories of the weak interaction of hadrons, and \r\nwill also test symmetry breaking mechanisms which take place at higher \r\nenergies.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of CAPS in modern experiments is not unnoticed in North \r\nLouisiana. It is motivation and opportunity for students at all levels \r\nin this region to participate in state of the art science. It also \r\nprovides an opportunity to involve local high school teachers in \r\nforefront science and, through their involvement, spread modern science \r\nand technology even further into the local student population. This \r\ncomponent of the CAPS program is considered as important as their \r\nscientific contributions.\r\n",
