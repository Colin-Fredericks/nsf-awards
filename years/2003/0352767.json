 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few  years the wireless industry in an endless search for more bandwidth \r\nefficient modulation schemes, spectrum and bandwidth efficiency have become \r\nsynonymous due to the limitations of legacy communication systems. These limitations \r\nhave traditionally bounded the communication system to a specific frequency band with a \r\npre-selected modulation scheme that exhibits the best tradeoffs for the relevant \r\napplication. Emerging technologies like Software Definable Radios (SDRs), Cognitive \r\nRadios (CRs) along with ultra wideband transmissions, smart antennas and ad hoc \r\narchitectures promise unprecedented flexibility of spectrum access. \r\n \r\nIn unison with these technological innovations, a report from the FCC Spectrum Policy \r\nTask Force challenges for the first time the assumption of sparse spectrum resources, by \r\nsuggesting that at any given time and place, less than 10 percent of the available spectrum \r\nis utilized. In order to improve spectrum utilization, the FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force \r\nproposes the concept of dynamic spectrum access (DSA).  \r\n \r\nStevens Institute of Technology proposes to support the National Science Foundation in \r\ndeveloping innovative research projects to radically improve spectrum utilization and \r\nspectrum efficiency  for  wireless networks.  This project proposes to help develop these \r\nconcepts through (1) a Principal Investigator Meeting involving the leading technologists \r\nand researchers contributing to NSF wireless networking programs and  (2) a workshop \r\nfocusing on physical and network technologies for enhanced spectrum efficiency.  \r\n",
