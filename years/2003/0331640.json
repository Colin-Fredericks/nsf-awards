 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing use of computers and networks in business, government,\r\nrecreation, and almost all aspects  of daily life has led to a\r\nproliferation of sensitive data (i.e., data that, if used improperly,\r\ncan  harm data subjects or other relevant parties), and concern about\r\nthe ownership, control, privacy, and accuracy of these data has become\r\na top priority.  Despite significant technical accomplishments \r\nin relevant research fields (e.g., cryptology and security, database\r\nsystems, and data mining),  there is no comprehensive, end-to-end\r\ntechnological infrastructure for handling sensitive data over \r\nthe entire course of their lifetime, nor is there even widespread social\r\nagreement about the rights  and responsibilities of major stakeholders\r\nin our data-intensive, networked world.\r\n\r\nThis project is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, multi-modal\r\nproject that looks comprehensively at sensitive data in a networked\r\nworld.  There are two main academic centers of activity (Yale and\r\nStanford), three smaller-scale academic participants (Stevens\r\nInstitute of Technology, NYU, and the University of New Mexico), and\r\nsubstantial participation by non-academic partners, including\r\ntechnology companies, (IBM, HP, and Microsoft), representatives of\r\nuser communities (Citigroup, NIH, Yale Center for Medical Informatics,\r\nthe Census Bureau, and the Secret Service), and DC-based policy\r\norganizations (The Center for Democracy and Technology and The\r\nElectronic Privacy Information Center).\r\n\r\nA major technical theme of the project is privacy-preserving data\r\nmining, and, more generally, techniques for meeting the potentially\r\nconflicting goals of respecting individual rights and allowing law\r\nenforcement and other legitimate organizations to collect and mine\r\nmassive data sets.  Other technical agenda items include (1)\r\naccessibility and reliability of distributed data (2) operating on\r\nencrypted databases, (3) remote control of data, (4) repelling hostile\r\ndata, and (5) auditability of data-management systems.  Because these\r\ntechnical goals are affected by lack of agreement about the meanings\r\nof basic terms, most notably \"privacy,\" a major goal of the project is\r\nthe development of a conceptual framework for the study of rights,\r\nresponsibilities, and public policies focused on sensitive-data\r\nhandling.  This part of the project incorporates the notion of\r\n\"contextual integrity,\" which considers both the context and the\r\ncontent of data sets in assessing sensitivity.\r\n\r\nProjected outcomes of the project include a next generation of\r\ntechnology for handling sensitive information that is qualitatively\r\nbetter than the current generation's and an effective conceptual\r\nframework for policy making and philosophical inquiry into the rights\r\nand responsibilities of data subjects, data owners, and data users.\r\n\r\n",
