 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Yacoub M. Najjar & Hayder A. Rasheed; Kansas State University \r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposed research is to transplant a Neural Network algorithm within a finite element analysis procedure to take over the function of its heart after a small jumpstart. The Neural Network will adapt to the internal functionality needed to re-produce the overall response of the body or  the  system,  initially  known  from  some  external  health  monitoring  measurements,  through  self-adjusting/learning analysis trials. This will build the memory and intelligence necessary to deal with similar analysis situations pretty much the same way the human mind and body interact and inter-respond  without  an  interpreter.  The  specific  objective  of  this  research  proposal  is  to  develop, formulate, and implement a proof-of-concept for an innovative Neural Network-Finite Element (NN-FE)  self-training  approach.  This  approach  can  be  used  to  accurately  characterize  the  internal mechanical  behavior  of  health  monitored  engineering  systems  such  as  buildings,  bridges,  offshore platforms, airplanes, space shuttles and other structures. Pre-generated finite element-based data-rich results  simulating  monitored  2D  structures  will  be  used  to  develop  and  validate  the  NN-FE technique.  Accordingly,  each  database  containing  load  and  displacement  history  at  some  health monitoring/control  points  of  the  system  could  be  used  to  generate  the  NN-FE  internal  behavior characterization  model.  The  developed  scheme  will  operate  in  two  distinctive-alternating  modes. \r\n\r\nFirst, it will operate in a predictor analysis mode to capture approximate stresses and strains at the integration  points.  Subsequently,  and  based  on  deviations  between  predictions  and  actual displacement values at the health monitoring points, the NN-FE self-adapting algorithm will operate \r\nin  a  training  mode  in  order  to  reduce  these  deviations.  As  the  algorithm  is  repeatedly  applied  in \r\nanalysis  and  training  modes  to  eliminate  such  deviations,  it  develops  self-learning  artificial intelligence and becomes smarter at making more accurate predictions. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed research addresses the important issue of the self-sufficient and reliable internal characterization of the mechanical response of health monitored structural systems. Success of this research will lead to better assessment of current and future structures. Accordingly, this will lead to more economical designs, protect the national investments, and ensure higher safety measures  to  the  public.  More  importantly,  by  integrating  anticipated  future  development  in  non-contact measurements,  this work  is  envisioned  to  pave  the  way  to  a  new  era  of  analysis  in  which computer systems can remotely scan objects for response data and use them to analyze the structural system  by  incorporating  the  self-training  Neural  Networked  finite  element  procedure.  This  is expected  to  impact  all  aspects  of  engineering,  science  and  life  on  the  planet Earth,  including aerospace, manufacturing, civil, mechanical, and chemical engineering fields. Furthermore, it may be extended for  utilization  in  aeronautics  and  astronautics  within  man's  quest  to  conquer  the  outer space.   \r\n \r\nBroader Impact:  The project.s broader impacts include the following aspects: \r\n\r\n1)   Full involvement of a PhD graduate student. Therefore, providing the student with intensive \r\ntraining/research experience to address similar complex engineering systems.   \r\n2)  The  proposed  exploratory  integrated  research  will  most  likely  re-shape  the  interacting \r\ninformation technology-structural engineering mechanics educational curriculum. This will definitely intrigue  the  future  engineering  leaders  to  address  other  issues  in  similar  integrated  and  systematic \r\nway. Moreover,  it will  help mature the  young  graduates  into  scholars with  hands-on experience  to tackle complex health monitored structural engineering systems.  \r\n",
