 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the cross-layer design of wireless systems, at \r\nthe network protocol, data link, and physical link layers. Mobility, \r\nwhich has traditionally been viewed as an impediment, can be utilized to \r\nimprove the use of wireless spectrum. Significant gains in performance \r\ncan be achieved by adding structure to transmitted signals and exploiting \r\nthe different Doppler shifts of nodes in multi-carrier code-division \r\nmultiple-access systems. Feedback among the lower three protocol layers \r\noffers the opportunity to utilize the frequency shifts that result from \r\nthe motion of mobile wireless users, thereby alleviating effects of \r\ninterference and increasing effective utilization. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. \r\nThis project introduces a novel way to exploit motion as an additional \r\nparameter in wireless systems. By utilizing frequency subbands as \r\nin OFDM and adding sufficient structure to transmitted signals for \r\nprocessing, Doppler frequency shifts can be used to reduce the effects of \r\ninterference. Initial work by the investigators suggests the processing \r\nis feasible. The use of motion requires that the physical, data link, \r\nand network layer protocols be designed in an integrated fashion, and \r\nassumes that computing and location-awareness capabilities will continue \r\nto improve. The use of timing relationships between received signals \r\nfor interference excision, which also requires cross-layer information, \r\nis also an increasingly feasible approach. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. \r\nThis project initiates research into utilization of motion as a \r\npossibly beneficial factor in the optimization of wireless spectrum. \r\nThe potential benefits of exploiting motion, instead of compensating for \r\nit, are very significant. This is analogous to the MIMO techniques that \r\nhave gained such prominence in recent years, in that factors that were \r\npreviously believed to be detrimental to performance are transformed \r\ninto positives. Exploiting motion requires a cross-layer approach, as \r\ninformation on movement needs to be passed to lower layers to enhance \r\nprocessing at those layers. This research will help to understand the \r\nbenefits of integrated design across layers. Further, this work will \r\nsupport graduate education into cross-layer techniques through the \r\nstudent positions included in the project plan.",
