 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: RIMS-UCI Collaboration Conference on Arithmetic Applications of Moduli  Degeneration\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis project supports US participants to attend a workshop at UC Irvine, May \r\n7 to May 10, 2003.  The lectures combine algebra and complex analytic \r\ngeometry to give new insights into collections of algebraic relations from \r\nrefined parameter (moduli) spaces. Some lectures introduce a new zoo of cusp \r\ntypes. These generalize cusps attached to modular curves. They extract what \r\ngoverns previously subtle problems and enhance mature topics like Deligne's \r\ntangential base points and Belyi covers.  Tempered fundamental groups, \r\nModular Towers and cusp embeddings of curves in their jacobians appear in \r\nfeatured lectures. Number theorists and algebraic geometers will find results \r\ngoing far beyond those from a previous workshop in Kyoto, October, 2002 at \r\nRIMS Institute. Especially, there are new applications to motivate students \r\nand post-doctorals to learn techniques for classifying algebraic equations \r\nfrom their bad reduction types. The invited speakers, and a capstone volume \r\nto the previous publication series, will attract new Ph.D. students. \r\n\r\nThis project supports US participants to attend a workshop at UC Irvine, May \r\n7 to May 10, 2003. Mathematical objects described by equations can be \r\npainfully complicated, full of peripheral data one would like to eliminate. \r\nSpecial structures on parameter spaces for these objects can help researchers \r\nfilter all but the essentials from these equations. This workshop follows the \r\nmore technical workshop  at RIMS Institute in Kyoto, October, 2002. Our \r\nspeakers will emphasize significant new contributions to this data filtering \r\nprocess based on cusp geometry. A lecture series by Yves Andre and focused \r\nlectures by the other invited speakers will attract new Ph.D. students to the \r\nfield. They will learn new ideas for classifying equations by their bad \r\nreduction types. Applications will be to a wide range of topics, including \r\nstring theory and height measures. A conference proceedings will disseminate \r\nthe results in a capstone to a previous series of related publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
