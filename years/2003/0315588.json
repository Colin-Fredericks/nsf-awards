 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  project  will  develop  soft  magnetic  nanocomposite materials  for applications in  electronic  and  electrical devices operating at high frequency. AC electronic and electrical devices operating at high frequencies require soft magnetic core materials that possess high saturation magnetization, high initial permeability, and low loss. Various metals and alloys e.g.  Fe,  Fe-Si,  Fe-Ni  Permalloys,  Fe-Co  are  used  in  applications. These materials  have  high  saturation magnetization, low coercivity and high permeability but because of low resistivity of these materials, the loss  is  very  high  at  high  frequencies.    Ferrites  on  the  other  hand  have  low  loss  because  of  its  high resistivity but have lower saturation magnetization compared to the soft magnetic metals and alloys.  This project aims \r\nto synthesize a new kind of nanocomposites consisting of some ferromagnetic and ferrite materials.  These novel nanocomposites will be manufactured utilizing an inexpensive and easily scalable process.  These nanocomposite powders will be compacted to near theoretical densities to produce bulk materials with different shapes and sizes.  The synthesis, structure and frequency dependent magnetic properties of these materials will be evaluated in the Phase I research effort.  \r\n\r\nCommercially the principal applications of these nanocomposites are in alternating current machines operating at high frequency  e.g.  transformers,  generators,  motors,  inductor  cores,  magnetic amplifiers,  power  converters and  motor  drivers  for  military  and  commercial  satellites,  aircrafts  and  spacecrafts,  tunable  filters  for cellular handset, loading coils for impedance loading in audio industry, etc.  \r\n\r\n",
