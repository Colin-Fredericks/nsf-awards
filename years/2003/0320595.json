 "awd_abstract_narration": "EIA-0320595\r\nRussell Schwartz\r\nCarnegie Mellon University\r\n\r\nProject Summary: Discrete Event Simulation of Self-Assembly Kinetics \r\n \r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a novel computational tool for simulating generalized self-\r\nassembly systems. Self-assembly systems consist of many small components, or subunits, that \r\nspontaneously arrange themselves into larger structures under appropriate conditions.  Among the \r\nmany medically important self-assembly systems are viral protein shells, or capsids, which form \r\nprotective coats around the genetic material of viruses; amyloids, fibrous agglomerations of \r\nproteins that are implicated in Alzheimer.s disease, Huntington.s disease, and the prion diseases; \r\nand irregular protein aggregates.  For all of these systems, the process of assembly is only \r\npartially understood.  In addition, self-assembly has attracted recent interest as a means of \r\nconstructing man-made devices and materials on the nanometer scale.  Due to the small size, \r\nspeed, and complexity of many self-assembly processes, they have proven difficulty to analyze \r\nexperimentally.  Simulation approaches have therefore emerged as a crucial avenue for gaining \r\ninsight into the self-assembly process.  This project seeks to build on the prior work in the area by \r\ncreating a model of the self-assembly process sufficiently versatile to capture a wide variety of \r\nself-assembly systems, yet fast enough to handle realistic simulation sizes in a reasonable time. \r\n \r\nThe basic methodology will involve combining techniques developed in prior modeling work on \r\nthis problem with a computational method that has not previously been used for self-assembly \r\nsimulation.  The simulator will use a model of self-assembly dynamics based largely on the prior \r\n.local rules dynamics. model, which provided a versatile representation of high-level self-\r\nassembly behavior in terms of low-level subunit interactions.  It will be efficiently implemented \r\nusing a computational data structure called a .discrete event priority queue,. which will allow the \r\nsimulator to step between changes in discrete state (such as subunits binding to one another) \r\nwithout the need for explicit integration over all time steps.  The result will be faster simulation of \r\na highly general self-assembly model than was possible with prior methods.  The simulator will \r\nbe implemented in Java to facilitate ease of development, extensibility, and portability.  \r\nImplementation will be conducted through distinct phases devoted to developing an object model \r\n(which specifies how pieces of computer code interact with one another), coding and testing a \r\nprototype simulator, and finalizing an optimized and well documented release-quality version.  \r\nThe end result will be both a stand-alone simulation tool and a set of computational classes \r\navailable for extension and use in other programs.  This work will require innovation primarily in \r\nmathematical models of self-assembly processes and in algorithms for their efficient simulation \r\nby a discrete event queue methodology.  Further innovation will be needed in the integration of \r\nexisting knowledge from such areas as biophysics, algorithms, software engineering, and user \r\ninterface design to produce a versatile, easy-to-use graphical simulation tool. \r\n \r\nThe project can be expected to yield several benefits.  Its impact will be primarily on the field of \r\nself-assembly, by providing a general tool that can be used by researchers throughout the field for \r\nmodeling known systems across size and time scales, developing computational prototypes of \r\nnovel systems, and experimenting with interventions in both.  It will also provide new methods \r\nand experience to the general field of biophysical simulation through the development of a novel \r\nsimulation methodology, its implementation in a computational simulator, and optimization of \r\nalgorithms for this problem.  The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will enhance its impact \r\nby providing for the computational community new variations on problems to be found in \r\nbiophysical systems and providing for the biophysics community new computational techniques \r\nthat can be brought to bear on other problems.  The work will also have educational value by \r\nproviding interdisciplinary research experience to students, including two undergraduates, and by \r\nproviding a simulator that can be used as both a research and a teaching tool.",
