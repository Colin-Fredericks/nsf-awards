 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project evaluates the proposition that a population of non-thermal O and O+ atoms commonly exists in the upper atmosphere and topside ionosphere. This \"hot oxygen\" population is identified in the literature by scale heights of [O] and [O+] derived from visible and ultraviolet twilight airglow emissions, and by measuring the thermal line width of the O+ 732.0 nanometer spectral feature. The aim of the project is to achieve a direct evaluation of the O+ temperature at mid-latitude by comparing optical and radar measurements. The tasks include:  (1) Derivation of O+ temperature from high spectral resolution 732.0 nm measurements made at the Arecibo Observatory in May, 2003, (2) Acquisition of a new set of 732.0 nm data indexed to simultaneous measurements of O+ temperature using the Arecibo Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) technique, and (3) A review of previous 7320 nm line profile data. Preliminary analysis of the May 2003 data, demanding treatment of a mixed doublet spectral feature, do not indicate a significant population of hot O+ based on the profile widths. However, new astronomical data suggest that the doublet splitting is significantly larger than earlier research has determined, and a new analysis of temperature derived from the mixed doublet is necessary. The study involves an observational campaign in the early fall of 2003 using clustered instrumentation at the Arecibo Observatory to simultaneously measure the Doppler profiles of the OII 732.0 nm emission, the OI 630.0 nm emission, and the HI 656.3 nm emission during twilight periods. Simultaneous ISR measurements of the O+ temperature will be obtained between the zenith and 75 degrees elevation during this experiment. The observations will thus employ three Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI), two photometers, an all sky imager, and the incoherent scatter radar (ISR). The results shall provide four independent measures of temperature:  one from just below the F2 ionospheric peak (from the OI 630.0 nm profiles), two from near the shadow terminator in the topside ionosphere (from the HI 656.3 nm and OII 732.0 nm profiles), and one from the ISR technique. This research broadly impacts upper atmospheric and topside ionospheric composition research by other experimental and analytical techniques. The topside ion composition, derived from radar techniques, currently depends upon the assumption of negligible hot O in the topside. The significance in turn impacts the space weather need for reliable H+ composition in the topside, which are currently best supplied by radar techniques.",
