The increasingly reported existence of earthquake \r\nlightning shows that transient coseismic electric currents of large \r\nintensity are associated with large magnitude earthquakes (M  > 6.0). \r\nSuch currents are likely to follow pseudotachylite veins because \r\ntheir electric conductivity, being melts, is considerably larger than \r\nthat of the unmolten rocks. All previous and preliminary results on \r\nfault-related pseudotachylites show that they have an anomalously \r\nhigh remanent magnetization. Their remanent magnetic properties are \r\nsimilar to those of lightning struck rocks, which suggests that large \r\nelectric pulses were involved in the magnetization.  This project \r\naims at demonstrating that remanence anomalies in pseudotachylites \r\nare generally observed and that coseismic electric currents are \r\nresponsible for it. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis \r\non three young pseudotachylites from seismically active fault zones \r\n(California, Japan and Western Alps) by collecting oriented samples \r\nfor paleomagnetic studies. Samples collected at various points with \r\nrespect to the main fault plane will enable us to test the coseismic \r\ncurrent hypothesis. The geometry and the characteristics of the \r\nmagnetizing field will be compared with the Earth's magnetic field at \r\nthe time of pseudotachylite formation. This will provide an \r\nindependent second test for the coseismic current hypothesis. A \r\nseries of experiments will generate artificial pseudotachylites using \r\nthe friction welding method. The artificial and natural \r\npseudotachylites will be compared to assess the possible causes of \r\nanomalous magnetization in natural specimens. The direct study of \r\ncoseismic currents is made difficult by their transient nature. This \r\nproblem can be circumvented by using the remanent magnetic record of \r\nrocks affected by the electrical  phenomenon.  This research will \r\nopen new directions of investigation on coseismic electric currents \r\nin fault rocks and should contribute to a better understanding of \r\ncoseismic electric phenomena\r\n-- \r\n",
