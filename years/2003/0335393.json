 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design for blast resistance has been so far considered primarily for military structures. Some \r\nof the design target levels include high-thrust, high-penetration, and high-yield missiles with or \r\nwithout nuclear capabilities. While designing to these levels leads to conservative and costly \r\nstructures if applied to the protection of the public infrastructure, recent events around the world \r\nhave  shown  the  vulnerability  of  civilian  infrastructures  to  blasts  of  low-yield  non-nuclear \r\ncapabilities. These events have also confirmed the need to develop construction methods that can \r\nsafely and economically be implemented in standard design practice.  It can also be shown that \r\nblast-resistant structures are designed with a very different philosophy  than seismic-resistant \r\nstructures, and rightfully so, because of the different nature between blast and seismic loads. As \r\nsuch, new design philosophies are necessary that can overcome this contradiction in requirements. \r\n\r\nNew methodologies are currently needed for the design of structures to simultaneously resist \r\nblast and seismic loads because of recent concerns in homeland security and the new zoning of \r\nthe US seismic maps, which have increased seismic demands over a larger area of the US. Under \r\nthis scenario there is a lack of professional education in the aforementioned research areas, and \r\nas such universities around the nation must develop courses that can  provide the necessary \r\nexpertise in blast and seismic protection of structures, and meet future design  and engineering \r\nneeds.  The  professional goals  of  the PI  are  to  develop  research  and educational  initiatives  that \r\ncan provide the PI with the necessary tools to; (1) enhance his understanding for simultaneously \r\ndesigning structures to resist blast and seismic demands, (2) develop collaborative research and \r\neducation programs with other engineering centers and private industry, such as the Maneuver \r\nSupport Center located in Fort Leonard Wood (MANSCEN) and Douglas Taylor Devices, Inc., \r\nand as importantly (3) recruit graduate students that upon graduation can transition to national \r\nlaboratories and engineering firms specializing in the area of homeland security. \r\n\r\nIn the first CAREER proposal submission the PI has proposed a novel design concept for \r\nthe  blast-  and  seismic-resistant  design  of  civil  infrastructures.  However, due  to  the  long-term \r\ncosts and time commitments necessary to develop the overall design concept, the main goals of \r\nthis Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) are three fold: \r\n\r\no To analytically evaluate the novel design concept at the component level before extensive \r\nexperimental and analytical research are carried at the sub-system and global-system level. \r\no To recruit one master graduate student to assist the PI during this exploratory phase. \r\no To introduce the design  concept at conferences that deal with blast and seismic issues that \r\ncan provide the PI with the necessary feedback on this research initiative. \r\n",
