 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF 0324416: \r\nSurface analysis and surface nanoengineering of Nanoelectromechanical Systems at the atomic scale\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to investigate and engineer the surface properties of Nano-electro-mechanical Systems (NEMS) at the atomic scale.  In nanoscale devices, in particular in NEMS, a significant fraction of the atoms are surface or near-surface atoms.  These unusually large surface-to-volume ratios in NEMS can give rise to novel behavior-significantly different from those of bulk solids.  The approach herein will rely on scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques to gain a physical understanding of surface phenomena in NEMS.  NEMS device properties-such as mechanical quality (Q) factor-will then be correlated to the surface properties.  In complementary experiments, NEMS surfaces will be modified using well established techniques-such as annealing and sputtering-to create optimized devices.\r\nEducationally, the results of the proposed research will be disseminated in a graduate course at Boston University that covers aspects of SPM, nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.  Moreover, the project represents a significant opportunity in the training of students in nanotechnology: the graduate students working on aspects of these experiments will not only master cutting edge technologies-such as SPM, nano-fabrication and ultra-fast electronics-but also develop a sound understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in surface science and physics.  \r\n\r\n",
