 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Michael Sadowsky and Lawrence Wacket at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Patrick Hamilton at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and Dr. Karen Nelson at The Institute for Genome Research (Maryland) to obtain the complete DNA sequence of and identify the major genes in the soil bacterium Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1.  Arthrobacter strains are widespread in soil around the globe and contribute to recycling organic matter and breaking down environmental pollutants. Despite their environmental importance, no member of this group has had its total DNA content sequenced. Modern DNA sequencing technologies and computer tools will be used to obtain sequence information and the potential function of all the genes, including those involved in ridding the environment of harmful chemicals. Drs. Sadowsky and Wackett will partner with the Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) in St. Paul, MN, which hosts more than one million visitors annually, to develop exhibits that display the genomic information obtained in this project and its importance for the environment.\r\n\r\nThe availability of complete microbial genome sequences is revolutionizing microbiology, medicine, and environmental sciences. Genome sequencing provides information on how bacterial genes are organized on their chromosome, what genes are present, and how they evolved. Arthrobacter are unique bacteria in that they have relatively complex life cycles, survive in extreme environments, such as the arctic, and are extremely resistant to drying and starvation. These bacteria are capable of degrading a variety of toxic substances in the environment, including pesticides, gasoline additives, explosives, and industrial solvents. The genomic sequence of Arthrobacter aurescens will provide invaluable information concerning this microorganism's fundamentally important biological properties. Given their ability to break down a large number of environmentally relevant compounds, knowledge obtained from the complete genomic sequence will help guide the use of these microbes in the bioremediation of contaminated environments. \r\n",
