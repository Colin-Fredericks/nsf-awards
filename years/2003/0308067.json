The work develops and utilizes a novel dynamically stable rolling machine research platform.  To illuminate many of the issues surrounding the operation of agile machines in human environments, in particular the ability to traverse narrow, cluttered rooms and to function robustly in the presence of people, we are investigating what could be one of the simplest possible dynamically-stable mobile robots: a machine whose body locomotes using only a single spherical wheel. This enables the machine to be tall and narrow, have a high center of mass, respond compliantly to nudges and shoves, and rapidly move in any direction. The machine will have a vestibular system based on an inertial measuring unit and other sensors with an on-board computer to provide closed-loop control of movement and balance. The efficacy of this new type of rolling locomotion will be evaluated in the context of human environments. Insights will be gained toward the development of agile motive platforms that in the future could be combined with the research community's ongoing work in perception, navigation, and cognition, to yield truly capable intelligent mobile robots for use in physical contact with people.  Such robots, if realizable and economically viable, would function as aids to elderly or disabled persons; provide guidance and assistance in public spaces; help with education and entertainment; perform domestic cleaning and housekeeping; or fetch and carry everyday objects.  Many other uses such as entry into hostile environments, rescue, and automated surveillance to safeguard people or property can be envisioned.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
