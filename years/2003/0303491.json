 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration brings together two groups led by D. Ellis at Northwestern University (NU) in the US and A. Malta Rossi at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The investigators carry out theoretical and experimental analyses of surface structure and metal ion uptake of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and related apatite structures, in nanoparticulate and thin film morphologies. Theoretical studies are made for both stoichiometric and defected states, using hybrid classical and quantum methodologies developed at NU for applications to complex materials. Materials are prepared at NU using sputtering and evaporation techniques that permit close control over chemical composition and surface textures. Spectroscopic analyses of textured surfaces and comparison with nanoparticulates prepared by precipitation from solution, are carried out in collaboration with personnel at Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas at Rio de Janeiro and elsewhere in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe problem addressed lies at the interface between Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Materials Science, and Physics. Successful outcomes will have impact on three main areas: (i) a better understanding of heavy metal uptake and retention in human bone and tooth, of particular importance due to lead accumulation in the environment, (ii) possibly improved materials and strategies in treatment of wastewaters and soils, to remove or prevent migration of heavy metal contaminants, (iii) improved understanding of basic chemical processes, needed for development of apatite-based catalysts for environmentally friendly chemical processing.  This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
