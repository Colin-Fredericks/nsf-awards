 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe theory of NP Completeness has shown that several naturally\r\noccurring problems are unlikely to have polynomial time\r\nalgorithms. One approach to overcome this fundamental intractability\r\nfor optimization problems has been to shift the focus from exact\r\nsolutions to obtaining approximate solutions. The study of\r\napproximation algorithms has thus emerged as a rich and exciting field\r\nand recent advances have led to good approximation algorithms for\r\nseveral fundamental optimization problems. Despite these developments,\r\nseveral interesting and difficult open problems remain. A primary\r\nfocus of this career development plan is studying the approximability\r\nof fundamental problems and attempting to close such gaps in our\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe broad research goals of this career development plan are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Developing new tools to devise approximation algorithms \r\nfor problems on directed graphs.\r\n2. Developing new techniques for metric approximations and \r\nembeddings as building blocks for approximation.\r\n3. Investigating a systematic way to obtain and exploit\r\nstrengthened SDPs as well as the use of strengthened SDPs for \r\ngraph partitioning minimization problems and ordering problems.\r\n4. Devise techniques to deal with scheduling problems with\r\nprecedence constraints.\r\n5. Extend the machinery of approximation algorithms to new\r\nsettings such as information theoretic and algebraic problems.\r\n\r\nThe research program will involve students at all levels, from\r\nundergraduate projects on understanding the quality of LP and SDP\r\nrelaxations through computational experiments, to the mathematical\r\nresearch suitable for Ph.D. students. The educational component of\r\nthis project includes the development of courses geared towards\r\ndisseminating new algorithmic ideas outside the theoretical computer\r\nscience community; the techniques developed in the latest research\r\nwill be distilled into new graduate and undergraduate courses.  Course\r\nmaterials developed for such new courses will be made freely available\r\nto enable similar courses to be taught elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",
