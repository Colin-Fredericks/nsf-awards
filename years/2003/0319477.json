 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore liquid-phase analysis systems utilizing novel sample introduction methods coupled with an innovative portable mass spectrometer. Much valuable time and chemical information can be conserved through in-situ analysis at the actual point of sample collection. In light of developing needs in industry as well as current environmental and terrorism threats, the need for rapid, definitive, on-site liquid-phase analysis has become an important analytical challenge. Breakthroughs in instrument design and capabilities are key to providing analytical information in a more timely and efficient manner. Current state of the art techniques for analyzing liquids are slow, expensive, laboratory-based, and require extensive operator expertise to collect and interpret the data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the company's proprietary technology to develop a portable, easy to use, miniature mass spectrometer that will provide a real-time, automated, sensitive, affordable, and reliable method for detecting a wide range of species in liquid-phase samples. \r\n\r\nThe instrument will be deployed in chemical process applications, teaching and academic research laboratories, contaminated environmental sites, and military installations and battlefields, and has the potential to impact society broadly by providing improved monitoring of developing environmental and homeland security threats.\r\n",
