 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and a collaborator from Georgia Institute of Technology propose to work both with a ray tracing method and with a partial coherence method to gain an understanding of the surface roughness effects on the radiative properties of silicon based thin film materials, specifically patterned silicon wafers. Experimental measurements of the reflectivity and transmissivity of silicon wafers will be performed at Georgia Tech using a three-axis measurement method. The facility to accomplish this portion of the proposed research already exists. The results could have technological impact in applications such as rapid thermal processing, laser annealing, flash annealing, or other processes that are strongly dependent on radiative energy deposition. These technologies are critical to the manufacturing of current and next generation of semiconductors and many other thin film materials. \r\nThis research is being supported by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of Chemical and Transport Systems Division.",
