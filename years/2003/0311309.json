 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nBiological Sciences (61) This project is establishing an inquiry-based undergraduate Cell Biology Laboratory at Stonehill College to accompany the required lecture course. The laboratory course is modeled on two previously funded CCLI projects (0088185, 9952672). The theme of inquiry-based learning through team projects is adapted from the first project (0088085), and the unifying theme of heat shock response is our implementation of a similar theme on green fluorescent protein from the second project (9952672). The first of two modules instructs students in fundamental cell and molecular biology techniques, while the second allows the students to demonstrate their competencies with the techniques by working in collaborative research teams to investigate the effects of an experimental condition on the expression of heat shock proteins in CHO cells. Student results are communicated in the form of lab reports written in the style of a scientific article, a poster, and an oral presentation at a mini-symposium open to the College community, and each is peer- and faculty-reviewed. The objectives of the proposed project are (1) to establish a laboratory with an open-ended discovery-based approach to investigate a scientific question; (2) to develop and improve crucial professional skills: hypotheses and protocol development, experimentation using proper controls, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, and formation of conclusions; (3) to foster an atmosphere of cooperative learning; and (4) to develop and improve students' analytical and oral and written communication skills.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: The Cell Biology Laboratory introduces students to the basics of genomics and proteonomics, two highly technical and challenging fields that will revolutionize our understanding of life processes. Therefore, it is essential that undergraduate Biochemistry and Biology majors obtain practical knowledge and hands-on experiences with the research techniques of these fields and their applications.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Stonehill undergraduates who complete the Cell Biology course and lab will demonstrate strengthened research skills. Selected students will serve as mentors, problem-solvers, and role models for academically-gifted, economically-disadvantaged high school students conducting fulltime research at Stonehill as part of the ACS's Project SEED (Summer Educational Experience for the Disadvantaged).\r\n",
