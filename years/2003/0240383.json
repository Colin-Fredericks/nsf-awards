 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses some fundamental issues related to routing in dense networks that are expected to be the key enabler of new facets of computing exemplified by embedded-, ubiquitous-, and pervasive computing. Specifically, a radically new framework for routing in dense networks called Trajectory Based Forwarding is proposed. This novel method is a generalization of source based routing and Cartesian forwarding in that the trajectory is set by the source as a continuous trajectory, but the forwarding decision is based on the relationship to the trajectory rather than the final destination. Trajectory Based Forwarding has a number of features that makes it an ideal candidate as a low level primitive in dense ad-hoc networks. First, it decouples the path name from the path itself. This is the most critical aspect in a dense network, where nodes might move, go into doze mode, or fail, thereby rendering a source based path useless or make route maintenance expensive. Second, the specification of the trajectory is independent of the destination. This makes the Trajectory Based Forwarding usable both as a routing support, when the destination is indicated, as a discovery support primitive, when the destination is not known, or as a flooding replacement. In addition to the simple unicast, trajectory routing and forwarding have significant advantages for many other important network functions such as flooding, discovery, multicast and broadcast, path resilience and even positioning. The objective of this research is to test routing methods using trajectories, to explore ways of specifying trajectories, and to implement many of the networking functions such as discovery, flooding, and network management. A specific domain where Trajectory Based Forwarding can be effectively deployed, used, and evaluated is in monitoring transportation systems or physical infrastructure. It is expected that Trajectory Based Forwarding can radically change the way we think about routing in networks and lead to a new area of research with a rich problem space.",
