 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study would develop new measures of non-cognitive outcome of schooling on motivation, self-efficiency, self-regulation strategies, and beliefs about learning.  The study addresses the concern of the effect of beliefs and strategies on cognitive growth.  These measures could be used in the MSP Projects to assess effects of the various interventions on students.  The study would gather large pools of survey data by working with the Math and Science Partnership projects as well as other sites and would analyze these data with sophisticated statistical models.  The study will be significantly large enough to include a specific examination of underrepresented groups.  The goal of the investigators is to make new tools for assessing student motivation generally available to MSP projects to be used for increasing teachers knowledge about the role of these beliefs, and assist them in helping students.  Also, the tools are intended to assist MSPs evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation.   \r\n \r\n",
