 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds the third annual meeting of the National Postdoc Network to be held at the University of California at Berkeley from March 15 through March 17, 2003.  \r\n\r\nSeveral national reports, among them the CPST Postdocs and Career Prospects Status Report in 1997, AAU Committee on Postdoctoral Education Report (1998), the National Academies' COSEPUP Guide for Postdocs (2000), and the NRC National Needs Report (2000), have clearly elucidated the dire circumstances of many postdoctoral scientists in the U.S. research enterprise.   Many studies have also offered suggestions for policies and programs aimed at improving the postdoctoral experience. However, a number of questions remain unaddressed: Are conditions improving? What are institutions doing to address the issues? How can the best approaches be recognized and implemented at other institutions?\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the Postdoc Network has organized its third national meeting to discuss postdoctoral policies and programs. Invitees include postdocs, principal investigators, mentors, research administrators, and representatives from scientific societies and funding agencies.  Speakers represent a cross section of the postdoc policy stakeholder arena.   \r\n\r\nNational efforts at postdoc policy reform will be the focus of the first day of the meeting. On the second day, the University of California system will serve as a case study for examining ongoing efforts to improve institutional policies affecting postdocs.   Also offered is a two-part workshop on leadership and teambuilding skills. \r\n \r\n",
