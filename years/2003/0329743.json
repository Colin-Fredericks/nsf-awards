 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nDesign of Robust,Networked Control Systems via Convex Optimization\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity\r\nWe are on the threshold of eing able to place sensors everywhere.This has een precipitated in part y the\r\ncontinued rapid advances in sensor technology,which will allow us to place sensors ranging from the nano-\r\nscale to the macro-scale on almost any physical device,at an economically viable cost.This alone,however,\r\nwould e limited in scope without the ability to process the potentially vast amounts of information generated\r\ny these devices,and the ability to network them to ensure that the relevant information is made available\r\nto the appropriate entities.Fortunately,computing and communication technology has een keeping pace\r\nwith sensor technology,and all the ingredients are there for major reakthroughs in the near future in how\r\nwe interface to,and control our environment.This will certainly e hastened y the Sensors and Sensor\r\nNetworks program,which will promote the creation of new sensor concepts and new methods for facilitating\r\nthe transfer of information.\r\nThere are some serious challenges,however,that must e overcome efore these future sensor networks\r\ncan e successfully deployed.One of the major challenges is the ability to make the appropriate decisions\r\nbased on distributed information,across a distributed network.To put this challenge in context,it is well\r\nknown that two comparably simple dynamical systems can exhibit complex ehavior when interconnected.\r\nThis observation,and the associated challenges,have een the driving force ehind much of the research in\r\nfeedback theory and feedback control.In particular,ensuring that feedback systems ehave reliably,in the\r\npresence of uncertainty,has een the main focus of feedback control theory,and continues to gain importance\r\nin dynamical systems theory.This theory,however,has largely een focused on systems with degrees of\r\nfreedom (or system states),inputs,and outputs that can e counted in the tens to the hundreds.What is\r\nrequired for the successful deployment of the em edded sensor networks of the future are design and analysis\r\ntools that can handle systems that are distributed,with potentially millions of states,inputs,and outputs.\r\nThe proposed work is aimed at developing new tools for designing and controlling systems that are\r\ndistributed across a network,with distributed decision making units,with large num ers of components.\r\nThe emphasis will e to develop tools for systems governed y di .erential and di .erence equations,oth\r\nlinear and nonlinear,with large num er of components,and interconnected through networks of limited\r\nconnectivity.The principle theoretical tools employed will consist of convex relaxations and semide .nite\r\nprogramming.The proposed work is focused,and will not e an all-encompassing e .ort.Rather,it is aimed\r\nat solving some fundamental problems in designing and controlling systems across networks,and will thus\r\ne an integral component of the overall e .ort in the Sensors and Sensor Networks program.\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed activity\r\nThe PI has a strong proven track record in this area.Examples include:1)advises approximately thirty\r\nstudents every year,from computer science,electrical engineering,and mechanical engineering,in the design\r\nand construction of complex electro-mechanical and software systems as part of the Systems Engineering\r\nprogram at Cornell (of which he is a co-founder);these systems are used y M.S.and Ph.D.students for\r\ntheir research.2)Has given public lectures and demonstrations at the Smithsonian in Washington,the Tech\r\nMuseum of Innovation in San Jose,NASA SIGMA series (a public forum for science and technology),National\r\nEngineering Week activities at NSF (attended y local area high-school students).3)Gives approximately\r\n.ve to ten demonstrations involving the control of autonomous systems every year at Cornell to local-area\r\nelementary school children and under-represented minorities.4)Has een an invited speaker at two NSF\r\nsponsored workshops,attended y high-school teachers and students,aimed at promoting and disseminating\r\ncontrol related research.5)Has appeared twice on Scienti .c American Frontiers,a television science program\r\non public television hosted y Alan Alda.6)Was the executive producer of a CD-ROM sent to hundreds\r\nof prospective engineering students outlining Systems Engineering e .orts at Cornell University.The PI\r\nwill incorporate the proposed research into these activities aimed at educating the public on systems and\r\nfeedback,and more roadly,on science and engineering.",
