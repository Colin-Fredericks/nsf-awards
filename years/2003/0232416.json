 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility\r\nof developing a technology to optimize accumulation and subsequent removal of a valuable element from integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) systems. IGCC is a highly efficient, low-emissions technology that uses coal and other feed stocks to produce electricity, process heat, and high-value fuels and chemicals. Deposits containing a valuable metalloid accumulate in an IGCC system, requiring significant downtime for\r\ncleaning and loss of revenue. The proposed technology will lead to recovery of a\r\nmetalloid as part of routine operation of IGCC systems. Metalloid capture will be performed using bench-scale laboratory equipment with a simulated gasification environment. Bonding mechanisms will be characterized to determine if spalling of deposits through thermal cycling and soot blowing is a feasible method of recovering deposits on-line.\r\n\r\nThis innovation would substantially increase revenue by providing a marketable product stream and would decrease operating and maintenance costs by improving the efficiency of the system.\r\n",
