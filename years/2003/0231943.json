They will attend to this by hosting a conference around key questions related to the impact, implementation and influence of standards in schools (and the related instruction, instructional materials, assessment, teacher education, and policy issues that follow).  The second intent of the conference is to build and strengthen the possibility for interdisciplinary research in mathematics education.  Consequently, invitees to the conference will represent many and varied disciplines (including but not limited to: mathematics, mathematics education, sociology, measurement, and policy).\r\n\r\n",
