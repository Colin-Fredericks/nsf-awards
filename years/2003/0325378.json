 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research: Driven by the growing worldwide competition for quality, productivity, and safety enhancement, attrition of experienced personnel, and increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, this research project addresses the need for software that can automate and integrate process supervision tasks such as data reconciliation, process and product quality monitoring, fault diagnosis, and control. Research on distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and multi-layered, intelligent, and adaptive multiagent systems (MAS) will be carried out to develop a new framework for real-time supervision of distributed system operations. The stability, scalability, performance, and robustness of this framework will be explored, and test cases will be used to investigate the synergy between microreactor and computer networks to discover ways of enhancing their stability and productivity. Manufacturing process and computer network operations will be the application domains of this monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and control with agent-based system (MADCABS) that automates knowledge extraction from data, analysis, and decision-making. The research will also focus on investigating emergence of behavior patterns in both the physical systems and MADCABS, introducing evolutionary dynamics in analysis, diagnosis and control by rewarding successful strategies over time, and enhancing the stability and robustness of MADCABS by designing it with adaptation capabilities.\r\nMultiple layers of agents will be used, where lower-level agents are performing local well-defined tasks such as data validation and higher-level agents performing more global tasks over wider regions of the supervised system. Agents are capable of acting, communicating with other agents, perceiving their environment, and determining behavior to satisfy their objectives. However, agents have only partial information about their environments and may initiate actions that could conflict with actions of other agents, leading to emergence of undesirable behavior of the supervised system. In this sense, the supervised system is viewed as a self-organized complex system comprised of the operating units of the process and layers of MADCABS agents acting upon them. Complex adaptive systems (CAS) studied often by using artificial life (AL) paradigms. CAS are known to exhibit emergence phenomena in which the global system displays properties and features not inherent to any of its components. Analysis and examination of the long-term behavior of the MADCABS supervised systems will be used to assess the compatibility levels of sets of agent characteristics and their optimal task orientation. \r\nThe project is led by an interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in DAI, MAS, CAS, supervision of computer network and manufacturing process operations, and real-time KBS development. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is combining new modeling theories and software for studying CAS. Collaboration between IIT and ANL will provide a strong partnership with powerful resources to carry out the proposed research, education, and outreach activities. Research results will contribute to advancement of knowledge in CAS, MAS, DAI, and AL. The outcome of the research will provide a new approach for commercial software for supervision of process and computer network operations. Research on behavior and controllability of distributed microreactor networks will result in new approaches to analyze the viability of such systems and ability to manufacture high-value-added specialty chemicals. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: The research results will be used to promote education and training activities in DAI, AL, and complex adaptive system operation and supervision. The methods and tools developed will have an impact on many CAS central to national concerns, such as energy distribution systems, ecosystems, and epidemics. Consequently, research results will be disseminated in the form of software, case studies, and practical training to university and industry researchers, high school teachers, students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and undergraduate students.\r\n",
