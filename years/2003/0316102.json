 "awd_abstract_narration": "0316102\r\nCrews\r\n\r\nMulti-branched tubular organs, including the insect trachea, derive from repeated groups of precursor cells that migrate and fuse together.  This process involves cell movement, recognition, adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and formation of adhesive junctions.  Mediating this process are specialized cells that can mediate discrete events, such as branching and fusion.  The long-term goals of this project are to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie Drosophila tracheal fusion, and understand how transcriptional regulatory proteins mediate this process.  The proposed research involves studying the molecular genetics of the Drosophila dysfusion bHLH-PAS gene, which mediates tracheal fusion events.  The aims of the project involve: (1) generating dysfusion mutants, (2) carrying out genetic and cellular experiments to investigate the precise role of dysfusion in controlling tracheal fusion and transcription, (3) exploring the biochemistry, genetics, and developmental consequences of Dysfusion interactions with other bHLH-PAS proteins, and (4) initial analysis of the roles of dysfusion in other cell types.  Together these approaches will advance understanding of how regulatory proteins work collectively to carry-out complex developmental and cellular events.  Given: (1) the functional similarities between insect tracheal development and (2) the formation of other vertebrate multi-branched tissues, and the high degree of conservation among invertebrate and vertebrate bHLH-PAS proteins, this work has broad significance.\r\n\r\nOne major component of the proposed research is educational.  Funds will be used to support training of postdoctoral fellows, graduates students, and undergraduates.  Strong emphasis is placed on undergraduate training.  The projects are designed to provide a multidisciplinary learning experience for each student, and each project involves training in genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology.  One applied aspect of this work concerns the application of this research to the agricultural industry regarding the generation of more efficacious agents for pest control.\r\n",
