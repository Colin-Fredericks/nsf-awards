 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Writing for Assessment and Learning in the Natural and Mathematical Sciences (WALS) project adapts the Calibrated Peer Review (CPR), developed and widely disseminated in Chemistry. The project creates and implements writing assignments for students in Biology, Mathematics and Physics. The assignments assess student understanding, enhances student learning, and promotes faculty inquiry into how students learn. \r\n\r\nThe WALS project involves carefully crafted writing assignments that promote and assess student conceptual learning and faculty-guided peer review that promote both critical thinking and student self-assessment. Through the workshops and writing activities, faculty participants increase their own understanding of how and what students understand. Synthesizing multiple classroom research projects provides significant insight into the nature of student learning in the science and mathematics. The faculty participants engage in activities lead by a team that represents expertise in the prescribed content areas, faculty development, the CPR protocol, writing assignments development, and technology-mediated instruction.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the WALS project are realized through the collaboration between faculty and students from the Texas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation partner institutions. Of these, three are Hispanic serving, one a historically black university, and another 90% female. Diversity issues relating to the implementation of CPR are investigated. The project impacts approximately 5000 students taking the affected courses over the project term several of which are taken by future science and mathematics teachers. The reach of the project therefore extends to the students of these pre-service teachers.\r\n",
