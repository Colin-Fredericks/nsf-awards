 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award of Haiman DMS-0301072\r\n\r\nProfessor Haiman works on problems in combinatorics related to\r\nalgebra, geometry and representation theory.  Using new discoveries on\r\nthe geometry of Hilbert schemes, he has recently proved the positivity\r\nconjecture for Macdonald polynomials and established a formula in\r\nterms of these polynomials for the character of a \"doubled\" version of\r\nthe classical spaces of harmonics for symmetric groups.  Evidence\r\nsuggests that these results fit into a larger framework in which\r\nNakajima's quiver varieties play the role of the Hilbert scheme.  In\r\nhis continuing research, Haiman hopes to establish the validity of\r\nthis larger framework and further develop the connections between\r\ncombinatorics, Macdonald polynomials and Hilbert schemes.  He also\r\nplans to work on unsolved problems connected with q-analogs of\r\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients introduced by Shimozono and Weyman\r\nand the q-Schur functions of Lascoux, Lapointe and Morse.  Finally, in\r\ncollaboration with Grojnowski, he will return to a study he initiated\r\nsome years ago of Hecke algebra characters and their connection with\r\ncombinatorial properties of immanants.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics is the mathematical study of things that can be\r\ndescribed, counted and manipulated in simple and explicit terms:\r\nthings like trees, Young diagrams, or strings of symbols, that we can\r\nwrite on paper or encode in a computer.  In my view, what makes\r\ncombinatorics interesting is that deeply abstract mathematical\r\nconcepts--such as geometric spaces in many dimensions, or algebras of\r\nsymmetries--tend to have an underlying combinatorial structure.  My\r\ncurrent work connects the geometric properties of special spaces such\r\nas Hilbert schemes and quiver varieties with the combinatorial\r\nproperties of Young diagrams and symmetric polynomials.  By\r\nunderstanding the connection, we can deal with these abstract spaces\r\non a concrete level and get important new insights about both the\r\ngeometry of the spaces and the rules governing the combinatorics\r\nassociated with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
