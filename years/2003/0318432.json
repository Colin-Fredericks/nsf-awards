 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many physical phenomena in science and engineering are modeled by partial differential equations with solutions that exhibit localized non-uniformities. Such applications include boundary layers and shock waves in fluids and reaction fronts in combustion. Applications such as thin film coating, composite media and nano-scale materials require mathematical models capable of capturing behavior at several different scales. The traditional approach with user-designed meshes/methods is no longer acceptable in terms of cost and understanding of process behavior. The problems are too complex and users can be fooled. In some situations, the problems cannot be solved when using over-designed meshes. Adaptive methods and the accompanying data structures have become necessary for resolving different scales present in such applications. Over the last 20 years adaptive methods have matured to a point where they are used in many industrial applications. However, much is still to be done to obtain higher resolutions and more efficient adaptive methods. The investigator proposes to organize a conference with themes in (1) efficient adaptive refinement strategies; (2) data structures for parallel and adaptive computations; iii) a posteriori error estimation methods; (3) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods; (4) grid and mesh generation; and (5) multiscale techniques.\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together leading researchers working in this critical area of scientific computing to discuss new advances and challenges. It will also introduce young researchers to the area of adaptive methods for solving partial differential equations. The conference organizers have invited 14 plenary speakers to address those important issues in scientific computing and applications. It is expected that there will be around 60 participants in the conference. The conference organizer plans to publish the conference proceedings in the IMACS Journal on Applied Numerical Mathematics published by Elsevier-North-Holland. This is one of the leading numerical analysis journals that concentrates on the innovative solutions of partial differential equations.\r\n",
