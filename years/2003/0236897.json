 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introduction of exotic pathogens and pests to forest ecosystems represents a\r\npowerful agent of ecological change that may selectively remove dominant tree species and\r\nsimultaneously stimulate widespread human disturbance in the form of pre-emptive and salvage\r\nlogging. Due to the increasing global movement of organisms and materials, the selective\r\ndecline and elimination of tree species is an increasingly important ecosystem disturbance that\r\nwarrants intensive study at stand to regional scales.\r\nThe recent unimpeded infestation of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) across the\r\nnortheastern U.S. provides an unusual opportunity and critical imperative to examine the\r\necological consequences of the removal of a keystone tree species, eastern hemlock, on forest\r\ncomposition, structure, and function. HWA is generating widespread mortality and initiating\r\nintensive logging of hemlock from North Carolina to Massachusetts and threatens to produce a\r\nrange-wide decline or elimination of this ecologically, culturally, and economically important\r\nspecies. Specifically, mortality of hemlock stands with sparse understories may lead to\r\na lengthy period of forest ecosystem reorganization resulting in new, distinct forest types and\r\nmajor changes in ecosystem function including disruption of decomposition, nitrogen cycling and\r\nnitrate leaching.\r\nBroader impacts from this study include: 1) incorporation of new ecological findings into\r\nscientific publications, presentations, and public outreach; 2) informing the public and land\r\nmanagers by distributing findings to the HWA working group and other web-based products; 3)\r\nintegration of data into existing collaborative efforts with regional experts and professionals; and\r\n4) strong educational training in research design, field techniques, and data and laboratory\r\nanalyses for students in the graduate and Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU)\r\nprograms at the Harvard Forest.\r\n",
