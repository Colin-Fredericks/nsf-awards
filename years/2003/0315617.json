 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus is adapted to communal life on surfaces. When grown on a surface or in a viscous layer, the organism induces a large gene system and differentiates to a swarmer cell. Differentiation allows movement over and colonization of surfaces. The long-term focus of this work is to elucidate the regulatory networks than enable bacteria to develop as multicellular communities on surfaces. This type of colonization, known as biofilm formation, results in heightened resistance to environmental insult as well as increased degradative capabilities. Thus, microbial interactions with surfaces have significant implications with respect to environmental issues such as biofouling. V. parahaemolyticus is an excellent model organism for studying surface adaptation by bacteria. This project will investigate how bacteria sense, integrate and respond to multiple signals in their environment. With respect to broader impact, a gene discovery plan is proposed that will integrate teaching and research by allowing undergraduate students to directly participate in the research process.",
