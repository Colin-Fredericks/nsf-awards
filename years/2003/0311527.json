 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  In order to support growing student interest in environmental analysis and to improve environmental chemistry education and undergraduate research, we are modifying several courses to include analytical tools important in environmental assessment. We have identified Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Ion Chromatography (IC) as the targeted methods. These instruments enable implementation of experiments in Environmental Chemistry, Soil Science, and Lab Methods II courses involving sampling, identification, and quantification of specific pollutants. We also are introducing a laboratory experience to study photochemical smog through use of a NO-NO2-NOX analyzer. Similar experiments in NO complexes and ozone chemistry are adapted from the University of Alaska and Universitat Bayreuth in Germany. Many chemistry students performing required undergraduate research projects are involved in projects doing long-term monitoring of local ecosystems with students from multiple disciplines. Enhancing separation capabilities to include GC/MS and IC is expanding environmental research opportunities for students and faculty. Availability of a NO-NO2-NOX detector is allowing students to be involved in smog research, collaborating with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.",
