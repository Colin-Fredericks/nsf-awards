We pursue the following goals:\r\n1. construction of p-adic automorphic L-functions of general\r\nlinear groups;\r\n2. proof of non-vanishing modulo a given prime  p  of such  L-values;\r\n3. determination of divisibility by  p  of the  L-functions;\r\n4. possible proof of the anticyclotomic main conjectures\r\nin an non-abelian setting.\r\nIn addition to these main projects, the investigator will study\r\njointly with his graduate students, the zeta function of Shimura varieties\r\ntwisted by non-soluble mod p Galois representations \r\nand Hilbert's twelfth problem over general totally real fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nA systematic study of elliptic modular forms whose coefficients\r\nare (p-adic) analytic functions was started\r\nby the principal investigator and has been developed \r\ninto a deformation theory of automorphic forms on larger \r\nclassical groups. The elliptic theory has found numerous \r\nprofound applications. For example, it was used as an \r\nessential ingredient of a proof of Iwasawa's conjecture by Wiles,\r\nof the proof of longstanding Fermat's last theorem and the Shimura-Taniyama\r\nconjecture by Wiles and R. Taylor and of a proof of the\r\nArtin conjecture of many non-soluble two dimensional Artin representations\r\nby R. Taylor and his collaborators.  The principal investigator\r\nwill pursue such applications in a more general framework\r\nof automorphic forms on classical groups.  \r\nThis would results new cases of non-abelian class number formulas\r\n(that is, a proof of some main conjectures of automorphic Iwasawa theory)\r\nwhich connect purely arithmetically defined invariants to purely analytically\r\ndefined values of zeta functions (thus opening a way of computing\r\nsuch numbers by analytic means).\r\n",
