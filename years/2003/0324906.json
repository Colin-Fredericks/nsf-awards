 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents a combination of ambitious\r\nresearch and educational objectives, described below.\r\n\r\nThe research we propose is on the fundamental problems of\r\ncomputational complexity theory, with special focus on the cross\r\ninteractions between them. In particular, we will concentrate on\r\nthe following three areas.\r\n\r\nThe power of randomness in computation. This includes\r\npseudorandomness, derandomization of probabilistic algorithms,\r\nexplicit constructions of random-like objects such as expanders and\r\nextractors, and their applications in data structures,\r\nalgorithms, networks, codes and more.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of proofs and search for proofs. \r\nThis includes understanding the power\r\nand limitations of natural logical, algebraic and combinatorial proof\r\nsystems. It also includes relating these to understanding natural\r\nsearch heuristics for optimization problems, to automated theorem\r\nproving, and to the limitations of\r\nnatural attacks on the P vs. NP problem.\r\n\r\nThe power and limitations of various computational models.\r\nThis includes Boolean and arithmetic circuits, quantum computations,\r\nbranching programs and (classical and quantum) communication complexity.\r\n\r\nThe educational agenda of the IAS in general, and of the Theoretical\r\nComputer Science program in the School of Mathematics in particular,\r\nis turning the\r\nbrightest fresh PhDs of today into scientific leaders of tomorrow.\r\nThis is facilitated by\r\nan extensive program of permanent, long and short term presence of top\r\nleaders in the field at the school, together with several\r\nextensive and diverse seminar\r\nseries, in a highly interactive environment with no duties except\r\npursuing research.\r\n\r\nWe note that our program at the IAS (partly with NSF support) \r\nhas already a proven track record of excellence in both objectives.\r\n",
