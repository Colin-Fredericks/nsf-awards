 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological and biomedical sciences are undergoing a major revolution\r\nas new experimental approaches, such as high-throughput DNA\r\nsequencing, DNA microarray, whole genome location, and\r\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) techniques, are yielding\r\nunprecedented amounts of genetic data. The exploration of this\r\ninformation is critically dependent upon the development of\r\nadvanced computational methods for data analysis. Since the recent\r\ncompletion of the Human Genome Project, the focus of Computational\r\nBiology (or Bioinformatics) has shifted to topics that are more\r\ndirectly related to biological functions, i.e. computational problems\r\nthat arise in functional genomics and proteomics.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI will study some new algorithmic problems\r\nthat aim at addressing three important questions in\r\ncomputational biology: (i) how to infer haplotype configurations from\r\ngenotype data based on the Mendelian law of inheritance for a given\r\npedigree, (ii) how to resolve missing values in cluster\r\nanalysis for oligonucleotide fingerprinting, and (iii) how to\r\nassign NMR peaks to individual amino acids. The first question is\r\nfundamental to the fine-mapping of genetic diseases\r\nusing markers such as microsatellites and SNPs.\r\nQuestion (ii) arises in the analysis of discretized oligonucleotide\r\nfingerprints from DNA array experiments and has important applications\r\nin the classification of microbial communities. Question (iii)\r\nrepresents a crucial step in NMR-based protein structure determination.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above algorithmic problems are relatively new in the\r\nliterature (in fact, some of them were recently introduced by the PI \r\nin collaboration with experimentalists), they have strong ties to\r\nwell-known combinatorial optimization problems such as bipartite matching,\r\ninterval scheduling, graph clique partition (or coloring), and set cover.\r\nTherefore, their solutions could also be of interest to the general\r\nalgorithms and combinatorial optimization communities.\r\n\r\n",
