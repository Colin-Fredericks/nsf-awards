 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is from the NYU group and requests funding for two distinct projects: a search for a rare symmetry violating process that has the prospect of discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model and a study of astronomical gamma rays and cosmic rays of 100 GeV to 10 TeV.\r\n\r\nRecognizing an opportunity to address new physics, a strong collaboration (MECO) representing 20 institutions, has formed and is proposing funding for the project entitled \"Rare Symmetry Violating Processes\" (RSVP). RSVP represents an opportunity to empower the university community to make discoveries of extraordinary importance. The current scope of RSVP includes 130 scientists, about 60% from the United States, and the others from Canada, Switzerland, Italy, Japan, and Russia, along with an expected 100 graduate students and post-docs.\r\n\r\nObservation of Muon to Electron COnversion by MECO would be the first evidence for a process that violates muon and electron type lepton number and that cannot be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics, extended to include massive neutrinos. It would be direct evidence for previously unknown physics processes involving new forces. This experiment is proposed to achieve a sensitivity 10,000 times that of current experiments.\r\n\r\nThe second component of the request is work on the MILAGRO gamma ray observatory to study the highest energy gamma rays and cosmic rays at energies where the fluxes are sensitive to some of the most energetic processes occurring in the universe. MILAGRO is a large water Cherenkov counter and is the first detector capable of continuously monitoring the full overhead sky at these energies.\r\n",
