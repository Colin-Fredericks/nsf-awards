 "awd_abstract_narration": "General statistical knowledge and hence undergraduate statistics courses play an important role in the growing emphasis on ensuring a basic level of quantitative literacy in the nation's post secondary school graduates. The data-driven economic and political landscape of the 21st century places enormous demands on an individual's ability to manipulate, organize and compare numbers and express quantitative ideas fluently, among other things. Knowledgeable citizens should possess the quantitative skills necessary to make informed decisions based on data in a variety of forms. In addition, they will be required to analyze evidence, to  question assumptions and to recognize sources of error that may lead to a misunderstanding of the problems and issues at hand. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of  \"Stem and Tendril: Vertically Integrated Statistics Laboratory\" is that it aims to assist in the teaching of statistics and applied mathematics at multiple levels. The objective is to develop, implement and assess a collection of computer-based learning modules that are vertically integrated across the undergraduate and master's level statistics curriculum. The collection of lab materials consists of 15-20 distinct projects are developed to provide faculty teaching statistics at a number of levels with a set of inquiry-based, student-centered alternatives to augment traditional lecture instruction. The goal is to create application-oriented computer laboratories employing relevant and topical data sets, which address basic themes of the statistics curriculum.\r\n\r\n The broader impact of \" Stem and Tendril: Vertically Integrated Statistics Laboratory\" is realized through the development these modules that can be explored from multiple levels allowing students to revisit approaches from different perspectives as they move through the curriculum. The modular nature of the material will allow students with different backgrounds and training to have different yet rewarding, learning experiences. In addition, these materials address needs of quantitative literacy, computer fluency and written expression as appropriate for mathematics.\r\n",
