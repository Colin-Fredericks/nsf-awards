 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: NSF Proposal, DMS-0302812 (Petters)\r\n\r\nThis proposal presents a two part research program that\r\ncreates a synergistic interaction between mathematics and astrophysics.\r\nProgram 1 aims at developing a mathematical theory to determine the\r\nprobability distributions of Gaussian curvatures\r\nat critical points of random time-delay functions.  This research program\r\nopens up new mathematical directions that bridge singularity theory with\r\nprobability theory (e.g., zeros of random polynomials and\r\nlimit theorems in  Rayleigh-Levy statistics). In addition, Program 1 has\r\ndirect applications to understanding the nature of dark matter in galactic\r\nhalos via the flux ratio anomalies in the lensing signatures of galaxies.   \r\nProgram 2 seeks to extend the classification of light curves and image\r\ncentroids of sources near caustics in thin-screen, weak-field microlensing\r\nto the strong gravitational field of a Kerr spacetime.  This involves \r\nstudying the global topology, geometry, and singular theoretic structure of\r\nlight caustic surfaces in a spacetime.  Program 2 points to new mathematical\r\nissues relating the geometry of light caustic surfaces to topological\r\ninvariants of the matter singularities of gravitational lenses.  This program\r\nmay also yield tests of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, especially as\r\nit pertains to the massive black hole believed to lie in the nucleus of our\r\ngalaxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark matter in galactic halos and the black hole in\r\nthe center of our galaxy are two central and pressing topics in astrophysics.\r\nThese issues are directly impacted by the powerful mathematical methods of\r\ngeometric analysis because gravitational lensing  is simultaneously a unique\r\ntool for probing the nature of dark matter distributions and black holes, and \r\na theory that is built on geometric, analytical, and probabilistic concepts.\r\nThe dark matter study requires developing a mathematical theory that allows\r\none to differentiate generic dark matter lensing signatures from features that\r\nare specific to the particular choice simple lens model used for dark matter.\r\n  The first part of the proposal deals with formulating such a mathematical\r\ntheory.  This work would open up new mathematical directions that bridge the\r\ngeometric aspects of singularity theory with several areas in probability\r\ntheory (Rayleigh-Levy statistics, zeros of random polynomials, etc.).   The\r\nsecond part of the proposal focuses on one of the fundamental predictions of\r\nEinstein's General Theory of Relativity, namely,the existence of black holes.\r\n Though a black hole cannot be seen directly, its extremely strong\r\ngravitational field warps the spacetime about the black hole causing light\r\nrays that managed to get through the region to be bent with impressively large\r\nangles (e.g., rays can loop around a black hole numerous times before arriving\r\nat the observer).  The probing of such extremes of gravity would be a critical\r\ntest of our understanding of the nature of space and time.   The proposal\r\nexplores mathematically the lensing signatures of the strong gravitational\r\nfield due to the massive black hole generally believed to be at the center of\r\nour galaxy.  This should draw upon techniques from differential geometry and\r\nsingularity theory, and create synergies between these mathematical\r\ntopics and the physics of black holes.\r\n",
