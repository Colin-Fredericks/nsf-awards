 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is intended to develop a new type of NOx sensor for use on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other small aerial platforms.  Many of these vehicles are quite small, and therefore have very limited space and weight allowances for instrument payloads - in fact, most traditional instruments used for real-time measurement of trace gas species of interest are simply too large and consume too much power to be used on UAVs.  This project is to develop a new instrument for the measurement of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) based on a novel technique that lends itself to miniaturization.  The instrument will be very small and light to allow it to be used in very small UAVs as well as on sounding balloons.  Phase I research will demonstrate operation of a proof-of-concept instrument.\r\n\r\nA variety of medical applications are foreseen, particularly in relation to asthma diagnosis and treatment. The instrument will also find extensive use in satellite calibration and validation.  Ultimately, the NOx instrument will lead to two public benefits: improved air quality (and resulting health benefits), and improved treatment methods and diagnostic measures for asthma.  An important direct medical application will be in the diagnosis and treatment of people suffering from asthma.",
