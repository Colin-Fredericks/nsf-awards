 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0305818\r\nRonald Fintushel\r\n\r\nOne of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the \r\nclassification of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. New \r\nconstructions have confused the issue of\r\nclassification, but also have invigorated the theory and reinforced \r\nits richness and diversity.  Still further examples are needed to \r\nidentify a suitable classification scheme, and the proposer intends \r\nto work on such constructions. The ultimate goal of the proposer is \r\nto develop enough techniques for new constructions of smooth and \r\nsymplectic 4-manifolds that a general picture for classification will \r\nbegin to emerge.\r\nThe broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship \r\nbetween mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for \r\ngraduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career \r\ndevelopment of postdoctoral fellows. The proposer will study \r\ngeography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to \r\nimpact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. \r\nAnother basic goal of this proposal is the development of problems \r\nwhich are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. \r\nThis proposal presents problems which will be suitable thesis \r\nproblems for the proposer's future students. It also discusses \r\ncomputational problems which the proposer plans to give to advanced \r\nundergraduate students. The proposer will also support graduate and \r\nundergraduate students during summers and encourage their \r\nparticipation in conferences. Problems posed in this proposal will \r\nalso be useful for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State.\r\n\r\nThe theory of 4-dimensional manifolds is important for both \r\nmathematical and physical reasons. In mathematics, topology of 4 \r\ndimensions lies at a crossroad, where one can try to apply \r\nwell-developed techniques of low-dimensional (3 and fewer dimensions) \r\ntopology, and also one might hope to utilize powerful techniques of \r\nhigh dimensional topology, such as surgery theory. In many ways, the \r\nmost interesting techniques come from neither of these approaches, \r\nbut rather from analogies with complex surface theory and input from \r\nhigh energy physics, where for obvious reasons 4-dimensional theory \r\nis central. This proposal, takes this latter view.\r\nIts key techniques revolve around the Seiberg-Witten equations \r\narising in quantum field theory.\r\n--",
