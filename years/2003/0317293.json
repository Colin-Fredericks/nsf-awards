 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Morton A. Heller, with the support of the National Science Foundation, will study the perception of raised-line pictures that can be touched by people who are visually impaired.  This research aims to determine how to produce pictures that best convey spatial information through the sense of touch.  It will also lead to knowledge about whether some viewpoints in tangible pictures are not useful for people who were born without sight.  In addition, the research will tell us whether there are important differences in touch perception in sighted and blind persons, and provide information about how to educate people to use touch to cope with those differences.\r\n\r\nResearch on pictures for blind people will have a broad impact on their education in the sciences.  Lack of information about how to produce good illustrations hampers the education of persons who are blind.  Many content areas in science are dependent upon graphics and pictures, including biology, physics, mathematics, geography, geology, and chemistry.  The study of pictures that can be understood through the sense of touch will advance access to science and mathematics for individuals who are visually impaired.\r\n",
