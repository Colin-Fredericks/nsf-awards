A major component of the workshop will be a discussion of existing research findings and programs related to workforce issues. The workshop seeks to identify topics for research on the STEM workforce that have the potential to inform collaborations that address integrative approaches in program design. A significant contribution will be in the identification of critical research gaps on the workforce. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project's broader impact will be realized through the establishment of a national research agenda that will eventually result in a rich and diverse technical workforce strengthened by broader participation of US citizens. The workshop is expected to identify and propose strategies and funding mechanisms that will propel more U.S. citizens and underrepresented group members (women, persons with disabilities, African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanic Americans) not only into the STEM workforce, but also into leadership positions, thus contributing to achieving the broader goal of strengthening scientific, technical and economic capabilities. This will enable the US economy to continue to lead the world in innovation and to increase opportunities for all US citizens to participate in economic prosperity. \r\n\r\nAttendees will include a diverse group of workforce leaders from the research community, educational institutions, and a variety of employment sectors described in the body of the proposal. Workshop outcomes are expected to include a summary report that contains a set of recommendations to establish strategic research areas and education funding priorities for the Workforce of the 21st Century program announcement. In addition, the report will include recommendations for evaluation methodologies and criteria as well as suggest metrics to measure the success of future programs. Findings from the report will be disseminated through a workshop website as well as through presentations at international scientific conferences and meetings as well as at national workforce policy summits. \r\n\r\n",
