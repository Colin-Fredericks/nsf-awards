 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. J. W. K. Harris, Mr. David R. Braun will conduct his doctoral research on the ecology of stone artifacts in the time period known as the terminal Pliocene (~2 Ma). He will initiate excavations at new localities in the world famous Koobi Fora region known for its wealth of early human fossils and artifacts. These excavations will provide a comparison with one of the most exciting new finds in early human archaeology: Kanjera South. The site of Kanjera south has several thousand well-preserved bones and artifacts. With possible evidence of animal butchery and long distance transport of artifacts this site is on par with the Olduvai localities of Tanzania in its potential to elucidate early human behavior. Mr. Braun will compare interpretations of early human behaviors at these sites, as viewed through the window of lithic (stone tool) analysis. Lithics are a behavioral trace of the interface between early humans and their environments. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions at Koobi Fora paint a picture of a lake- and river-dominated ecosystem, with areas of swampy woodlands. Meanwhile, Kanjera is reconstructed as an open savannah grassland. A focus of Mr. Braun's analysis will be to compare the behaviors of early humans in the variable environments of the terminal Pliocene.\r\n\r\nMr. Braun's analysis of these artifacts will incorporate various new techniques to understand the importance of stone tools to these proto-humans. To determine the distances that early humans traveled to collect stones to make artifacts geochemical techniques (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Flourescence) will be used to link artifacts to rock outcrops. This analysis is the result of an important collaboration between American researchers and the Institute of Nuclear Science at the University of Nairobi. Furthermore, his analysis will incorporate digital imaging of stone artifacts. These techniques have not previously been employed on materials of such antiquity. Preliminary results from digital imaging analysis suggest evolution in early human ranging patterns and landscape use.\r\nCrucial to an understanding of early human behavior is investigating the need and use of stone tools. Mr. Braun's analysis will approach stone artifacts using experimentally derived models to test theories of optimality in early human stone tool use. By applying an evolutionary ecological framework to the study of artifact assemblages in varying environments it is possible to further our understanding of the heterogeneity of early human behavior. The support of this project will provide vital new insights into the evolution of human behavior and further the career of a student committed to the study of African archaeology. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
