 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems addressed in this project are in the area of  Topology.\r\nThe main theme is to study the fundamental and important properties of the gauge-theoretic/symplectic Floer homology, using invariants and methods from \r\n3-manifold topology and symplectic topology. The investigator studied the \r\nsemi-infinity of the instanton (gauge theoretic) Floer homology and the intrinsic \r\ndependence of the monopole(Seiberg-Witten-Floer) homology of (homology)\r\nthree-spheres. The major part of the project is to study the interactive relation \r\nbetween the symplectic Floer homology and the classical  3-manifolds, and the\r\nrelation between the Floer cohomology and the semi-infinite cohomology, and the Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory intertwining the instanton and monopole results. The \r\nother part of this project is to study intrinsic properties for the invariants of larger\r\nclasses of three-spheres.It is a fundamental aim to investigate the change of the new\r\ninvariants under certain topological operations. The project will integrate the \r\ninteractions among the instanton theory, the monopole theory, the symplectic Floer\r\ntheory and the semi-infinite cohomology of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.\r\n\r\nA three-dimensional manifold is a space where a nearsighted person sees a standard three-dimensional space everywhere.(Homology) three-spheres are those three-manifolds \r\nthat one cannot tell from the standard three-sphere by using the usual topological tools. A symplectic manifold is an even-dimensional space with a special(symplectic) structure. For \r\ninstance, the phase space of a mechanical system is a symplectic space. Such a symplectic \r\nstructure is rich in mathematics and physics, and is canonical from any nearby region. This \r\nshows the subtlety and the complexity of the world we live in. Any local information is no \r\nlonger useful, the global behavior and the global (topological) invariants are the pivot. The \r\nrefined invariants studied in this project are intended to distinguish manifolds from the \r\naspects of mathematical physics, and to intertwine various quantum field theories from the \r\naspect of mathematics. Thus it is extremely valuable to investigate the relation between the symplectic Floer cohomology and the semi-infinite cohomology, as well as the interactive link between the instanton homology and the monopole homology. This project addresses some \r\nof the most fundamental problems in this subject.\r\n",
