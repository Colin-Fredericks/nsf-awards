 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a laser treatment to crystallize amorphous quasicrystalline (QC) coatings on thermally sensitive engineering substrates.  Application of these materials has been limited by the high temperature-annealing requirement, which restricts their deposition of super alloys and ceramic materials only.  In the program, it is proposed to develop laser treatment of amorphous sputter-deposited QC coatings to provide localized thermal energy to the coated region only.  This will enable the amorphous-to-crystalline conversion, while not degrading the load-carrying capability of the underlying substrate materials (Aluminum, Titanium, and bearing steel allows).  The spectral reflectance of a-QC sputtered coatings will be measured to select the appropriate laser (and wavelength) for processing, laser glazing trials will be conducted, and then the microstructure and mechanical/tribological properties of the crystallized QC films will be characterized.  Results will be briefed to major diesel engine manufacturers.\r\n\r\nQuasicrystalline materials offer a unique combination of material properties; low friction, high hardness, and low thermal conductivity, which makes them ideal coatings for non-galling tools for aluminum forming, engine drive-train components, and aluminum engine block cylinder surfaces.",
