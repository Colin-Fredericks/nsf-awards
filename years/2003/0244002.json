The Conference is organized by Engineering Conferences International (ECI).  ECI is the successor of the United Engineering Foundation, which was established in 1962 to provide an opportunity for the exploration of problems and issues of concern to engineering from many disciplines. The organization recently changed its name and moved to be housed at Polytechnic University.   \r\n\r\nThe conference is chaired by Eleanor Baum, Dean of Engineering at The Cooper Union, and is co-chaired by Carl McHargue of the University of Tennessee.  The steering committee is exceptional including, Phil Weilerstein of the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), Joel Moses (MIT), Howard Flagg (Founder, Pair Gain) and Tina Seelig (Stanford University Technology Ventures Program). \r\n\r\nThe goal of the conference is to develop a set of recommendations for engineering faculty, to identify exemplary curriculum and model programs, and to increase interaction between business and academia on these topics.  \r\n\r\n",
