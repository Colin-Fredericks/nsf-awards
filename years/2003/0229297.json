The programs will consider the significant areas of on-going research, present the scientists who are conducting the research,  portray research as an on-going endeavor and discuss the social impact and ethical implications of major areas of research.   Each program will include segments such as the following:\r\n\r\nResearch news update - (5 to 7 mins.)\r\nFeature stories about on-going research - 3  (8 to 12 min. each)\r\nIn-studio discussions following many of the feature stories - ethical, policy and social implications\r\nPoint/Counterpoint - 2 commentators presenting social, ethical, political and economic aspects of research\r\n\"Then and Now\" segments showing changing nature of scientific research\r\nIn-studio demonstrations\r\nInterstitial moments -- Showcases of interesting and surprising aspects of research\r\nClose -- update stories from previous programs, read viewers' input or answer viewers' questions, preview upcoming story.\r\n\r\nIn addition, WGBH will produce three one-hour \"Year in Review\" programs that report what major research has occurred over the past year and puts it in a context that will help viewers understand the role of current research in all aspects of life.\r\n\r\nOther major components of the project include on-going collaborations with other Public Understanding of Research Projects, an interactive web site, communication training for scientists to help them explain their work to the public, \"Science Cafes\" with on-going public programs about cutting-edge research in informal settings, a resource guide for teachers, \"Leading Edge\" articles in magazines targeted to teens, a \"Leading Edge\" science contest for students conducted through PBS stations and a station resource kit with information about how to establish local collaborations with researchers, science museums, schools and others. \r\n\r\n",
