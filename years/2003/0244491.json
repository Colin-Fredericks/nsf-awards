 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project among Duke University, the University of California at Los Angeles, and North Carolina State University involves research into an array of interrelated problems in the fluid dynamics of thin viscous films.  It combines analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to fundamental issues concerning surfactant spreading, patterned surfaces, vibrational forcing, Marangoni flows, flows on curved surfaces, and spin-coating flows.  Methods include the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, asymptotics, and experiments.  Connections will be made with applications such as the role of surfactants in lung physiology, and the emerging field of microfluidics.  The weekly Focused Research Group meeting, a central organizing feature of the project, combines research and education by promoting discussion and interaction across disciplines, and among faculty, students, and post-docs.  \r\n\r\nThe central theme of this project is the study of how surface tension forces govern the motion of micro-scale fluids in many different settings.  Progress in this basic research on thin liquid films will lead to new theoretical understanding of the physics of fluid flow on a microscopic scale, which is crucial to the emerging technology of microfluidic devices.  These \"labs on a chip\" are transforming biotechnology in much the same way that microelectronics has transformed the computing industry.  Contributions from this project will help to identify fluid flows and surface properties relevant to specific devices, as well as establishing the theoretical underpinnings for future research in this area.  In addition to microfluidics, research will also be undertaken in the modeling of surfactant transport in the liquid lining of the lung.  In developing new theory for this important physiological application, the research group will focus on how the surfactant changes surface tension, giving rise to a force that mobilizes the fluid coating of the lung walls.  Development of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations in this project will involve ongoing interactions with scientists and engineers directly connected with the applications. \r\n",
