Mathematical developments in emerging medical imaging modalities like electrical impedance tomography and optical tomography will also be surveyed. The aim of the workshop is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians, physicists and physicians.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be jointly sponsored by the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) and NSF. Another aim of the workshop is to foster international collaboration between US and Canadian mathematicians and scientists. The invited speakers are mathematicians working on applications of inverse problems to medical imaging and scientists and physicians dealing directly with the applications. The grant will allow junior researchers and members of underrepresented groups in Mathematics to participate in this workshop and learn about new mathematical developments in medical imaging.\r\n\r\n",
