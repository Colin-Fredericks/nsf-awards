 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the effect of carbon nanotubes on the photoconductivity of electroactive polymer matrix composites and on their performance and sensing efficiency. Several formulations of additives/polymer(s), including functionalized carbon nanotube systems, have potential to interact selectively, sensitively, and reversibly with trace analytes in the electroactive matrix.  Nanotube-polymer sensing probes based on conductivity changes or mechanical force fluctuations exerted by the surrounding media, will be developed and tested for their sensitivity, reversibility, fast response to different analytes, and chemical and environmental stability. Superior formulations will be tested and compared to existing commercial sensing materials. \r\n \r\nCommercially, conventional metal oxide and polymer based sensors are usually impractical at ambient temperature due to low sensitivity. The combination of advanced conformal coating processes and advanced formulations of  nanotube/polymers has the potential to alleviate the sensitivity and response to inorganic, organic, and biological analytes.  These  low  cost ultra-light weight nanotube-polymer composite films with improved  structural, stability and electrical properties will be important  for  portable sensor applications.\r\n",
