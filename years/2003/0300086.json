 "awd_abstract_narration": "0300086\r\nWeikle\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to investigate and develop a new approach for the non-invasive measurement and characterization of integrated microwave and millimeter-wave circuit modules.  This work, in particular, aims to address present-day difficulties and challenges associated with measuring and characterizing high-frequency subsystems that are integrated with other components on a single circuit board or chip. The ultimate goal of this program is the development of a non-contacting network analyzer for the direct, in-situ measurement of scattering parameters of integrated or on-chip microwave and millimeter-wave subsystems.\r\n\r\nThe research activities to be undertaken during this project will include the refinement and application of device and IC processing technologies to the development of fully-integrated network analyzer sampling circuits, the establishment of calibration standards and procedures for non-contacting measurement schemes, and the investigation, design, and demonstration of non-contacting reflectometers for s-parameter measurements. These activities will directly address and impact the merit review criteria set forth by the National Science Foundation:\r\n\r\n(1)The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential to significantly expand\r\nand improve the measurement and diagnostic capabilities currently employed\r\nfor high-frequency integrated circuits. This will not only benefit the microwave\r\nmeasurements community but will significantly impact all fields that rely on\r\nmillimeter and submillimeter-wave instrumentation.\r\n\r\n(2)The broad impact of this proposed work will be felt by researchers working on\r\nhigh-frequency integrated systems as well as students, researchers, and faculty\r\nat the University of Virginia and other institutions. The instrumentation de-\r\nveloped through this program will enhance and complement the capabilities of\r\nthe PI's research and teaching laboratories while the close involvement and partici-\r\npation of graduate and undergraduate students will be crucial to supporting the\r\neducational mission of the university and provide an avenue for incorporating\r\nthis work into the existing curriculum. In addition, through current collabora-\r\ntive work with other institutions, the technical achievements developed from this\r\nprogram will be shared and disseminated directly to the communities that rely\r\non millimeter and submillimeter-wave systems.\r\n\r\nThe program will culminate with the demonstration of a fully-integrated non-contacting\r\ns-parameter measurement system operating in the millimeter-wave range and scalable to frequencies reaching into the submillimeter spectrum\r\n",
