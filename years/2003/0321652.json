Through the collaboration, the researchers will synthesize novel expanded porphyrins capable of binding two metal centers in a well-defined and predictable orientation.  The results will contribute to the field by offering a new method for producing expanded porphyrins with unique coordination and photophysical properties and numerous potential applications.  The expected mutual scientific and educational benefits of the collaboration are considerable.  The project brings together two groups with vast experience in pyrrolic/porphyrins (US group) and pyrazole-based chemistry (German group) to develop new pyrrole/pyrazole hybrid systems that might offer unique perspectives in heterocyclic and coordination chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe project also advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, thereby contributing to the development of a globally engaged work force.  The scientific aspects of the collaborative work will be highly valuable for the broad education of the PhD students on both sides of the Atlantic and will strengthen the research efforts of both groups.\r\n",
