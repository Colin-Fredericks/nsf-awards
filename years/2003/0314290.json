The networks of connections between proteins in genomes have to be built by a combination of experimental studies, knowledge-based methods, sequence analysis and structural approaches that are both fast and insensitive to inaccuracies.  The Advisory Committee is committed to attending the conference, which will be on the order of 100 participants.  The PI is committed to involving junior researchers and under-represented groups as speakers and participants in this conference.",
