The\r\nfirst of these centers on complex tori in the nearly-Kaehler\r\n6-sphere.  Isotropic surfaces in the 6-sphere have been\r\nclassified by Bryant and include all rational examples.  I\r\npropose to find an algebro-geometric description of the\r\nnon-isotropic complex tori.  This description will involve an\r\nalgebraic curve called the spectral curve, and hence give rise to\r\na natural invariant of the torus, namely the genus of its\r\nspectral curve.  The existence of tori for each value of this\r\ninvariant will then be investigated and the characterization used\r\nto produce examples.  Cones over these tori are associative in\r\nthe imaginary octonions, which provides additional geometrical\r\nmotivation for their study.  The second project concerns the\r\nenergy of minimal tori in the 3-sphere.  Ferus, Leschke, Pedit\r\nand Pinkall have an estimate for the energy in terms of the\r\nspectral genus, which provides exciting progress toward the proof\r\nof the Willmore and Lawson conjectures, but fails to say anything\r\nabout these conjectures when the spectral genus is low.  It is\r\nprecisely the low-genus cases upon which we shall focus, using\r\nspectral curve techniques.  The final project concerns the\r\npossible singularities of special Lagrangian 3-folds, a topic of\r\nconsiderable current interest due to its role in mirror symmetry.\r\nSpecifically, cones over tori will be studied and the question of\r\nwhether the links may be real-algebraic will be addressed.\r\n\r\nEnergy is a fundamental quantity; physical systems seek to\r\nminimize energy or at least to find (possibly unstable) critical\r\npoints of it.  One typically studies critical points of energy,\r\nfor example minimal submanifolds, which appear in all of the\r\nabove proposed projects.  These have a long and distinguished\r\nhistory in both mathematics and physics, and remain subject to\r\nmuch attention.  Absolute energy minimizers are rare and\r\ndifficult to locate.  However one source of them is calibrated\r\nsubmanifolds, of which both associative and special Lagrangian\r\nsubmanifolds are examples.  Special Lagrangian submanifolds have\r\nother interesting applications to physics.  In super-symmetric\r\nstring theory, the universe is modeled as a ten-dimensional\r\nobject, consisting locally of the familiar four-dimensional\r\nspace-time, and a six-dimensional space (a Calabi-Yau manifold)\r\nthat is compact, and hence sufficiently 'small' that one does not\r\nobserve it in everyday life.  A popular approach to deepening our\r\nunderstanding of these Calabi-Yau manifolds is to study their\r\nspecial Lagrangian submanifolds.\r\n\r\n",
