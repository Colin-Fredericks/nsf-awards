The investigators will study new anti-corrosion formulation of polymer together with extracts from herbs indigenous to the Middle East area and/or green algae available in seawater.  Surface treatment of steel structures will be examined. The performance evaluation of the polymer coatings containing the natural extracts will be done by means of laboratory accelerated tests such as ac impedance and salt spray fog test, as well as by means of field studies through immersion of samples in the Alexandria Harbor of Egypt.  This work is based on a previous successful collaboration between Tuskegee University and Alexandria University in which an anti-corrosion coating was developed using compounds extracted from algae. The results of that collaboration are currently being disseminated through workshops in Egypt attended by the end-users. \r\n\r\nScope:   Organic polymers with anti-corrosion additives are used as coating materials to enhance the corrosion protection of steel structures such as civil engineering constructions, buried pipelines and marine structures. These coatings can be used in complex shaped sections such as bends, valves and tee sections.  The project will benefit from the complementary skills of the two PIs, and from the currently well-established links between their universities.  The U.S. PI has experience in the field having developed a varnish containing algae that has proved effective in marine environments.  The results from this project will be disseminated by the two scientists to end-users.  The involvement of younger faculty in the proposed project will enhance the potential for future international collaborations.  The project will introduce students to modern techniques of electrochemical evaluation of corrosion rates and mechanisms, and to the types of naturally occurring organic means for inhibiting corrosion of steel.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
