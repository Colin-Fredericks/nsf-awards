 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stephen Weber of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study selective extraction of natural products and impurities from liquid mixtures using fluorinated materials.  Fluorocarbon liquids display 'selective' solvating properties and teflon membranes are robust. Novel systems possessing both advantages will be developed.  The work targets the development of fluorous extraction media containing specific receptors coated onto porous alumina as substrate. The logic is that a given artificial receptor for the analyte will have a much better chance to induce a good extraction selectivity if the surrounding is a poor solvent for that analyte.  This project entails the basic work of developing methods for the creation of stable, fluid fluorous media, synthesizing and screening a library of potential receptor molecules, and preparing novel modified electrode surfaces for sensing and extraction.  \r\n\r\nThis impact of this work lies in materials chemistry, chemical synthesis, separation, recognition, and sensor development.  Selective extraction is one of the most efficient methods for analyte enrichment and for elimination of interferences in practical analysis. Selective extraction in a dimensionally-stable, non-volatile media (e.g., membranes, and modified surfaces) is often the key element in chemical sensors and sensing systems. If selective extraction can be scaled up, it may gain industrial significance in environmentally friendly recovery of natural substances and simple removal of impurities.\r\n",
