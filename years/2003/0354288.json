Brock\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM FOR HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS\r\n\r\nThe PI, Jeffrey Brock, will synthesize diverse techniques in the\r\ndeformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to address classification\r\nproblem for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Brock will undertake joint work\r\nwith K. Bromberg that employs the theory of hyperbolic cone-manifolds\r\nto show that each tame hyperbolic 3-manifold M is approximated by\r\ngeometrically finite 3-manifolds.  This conjecture, known as the\r\nDensity Conjecture has recently been solved by Brock and Bromberg in\r\ncertain cases.  Brock will also work toward completing joint work\r\nwith R. Canary and Y. Minsky to prove Thurston's ending lamination\r\nconjecture, which predicts that a tame hyperbolic 3-manifold is\r\ndetermined by its topology and its end invariants: combinatorial\r\ninvariants attached to the ``ends'' of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  In\r\nnew joint work with Bromberg, R. Evans, and J. Souto, Brock will study\r\nthe question of whether each algebraic limit of a sequence of\r\ngeometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds is itself topologically\r\ntame.  This joint project has implications for a conjecture of Ahlfors\r\nthat the limit set of a finitely generated Kleinian group has either\r\nmeasure zero or full measure in the Riemann sphere.  \r\n\r\nClassifying mathematical objects plays much the same scientific role\r\nas classifying biological, chemical, or physical phenomena in the\r\ndevelopment of these fields.  For example, with the human genome\r\n\"cracked,\" scientists may now isolate specific genetic causes or\r\npredispositions to diseases, greatly furthering the ability of science\r\nto address these problems.  In the proposed research, Brock will\r\nendeavor to solve the classification problem for a \"generic\" class of\r\n3-dimensional spaces, the \"hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\"  These\r\nnon-Euclidean spaces have geometry locally like our own Euclidean\r\nspace, but their large scale geometry is expanding exponentially:\r\nfor example, light rays (a metaphor for geodesics) emanating from a\r\npoint-source diverge exponentially rather than linearly.  William\r\nP. Thurston's revolutionary and pioneering work in the 1970's and\r\n1980's showed that almost all 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, and went on\r\nto raise as many questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds as it\r\nanswered.  From his contributions, a compelling conjectural picture of\r\nthe right classification of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has emerged as a\r\nlasting problem for researchers in the field of geometry and topology.\r\nRecent work of the PI and his collaborators has put the solution of\r\nthis problem within reach; the PI will make use his NSF support to\r\nfacilitate ongoing collaborations to solve this fundamental problem,\r\nthereby making a \"database\" of hyperbolic 3-manifolds available for\r\nwider use by other mathematicians and physicists alike.\r\n\r\n",
