This azimuthal brightness asymmetry is generally ascribed to gravitational wakes -- clumps of ring particles attempting to accrete under their mutual gravitation, but frustrated in the attempt by Saturn.s strong tidal influence. \r\n \r\nDr. Richard French, at Wellesley College, will compare  measurements  of the asymmetry  from  a  rich  set  of  hundreds  of Hubble Space  Telescope  images  and  multiple  radar  images  of  the  rings  from  Arecibo  Observatory,  with  the predictions of dynamical models of gravitational wakes. The N-body simulations of the detailed structure of  the  rings,  and  the  resulting  gravitational  wakes,  show  a  very  strong  dependence  on  the  detailed properties of the rings, such as the distribution of particle sizes, the surface mass density, and the elasticity of interparticle collisions. The strength of the resulting asymmetry also varies greatly across the rings, for reasons that are not yet completely understood. This work will quantify the newly-discovered azimuthal \r\nasymmetry in the inner B ring, for example. \r\n \r\nThis project  will  be  of  general  interest  to  planetary  scientists  because  it  combines  two complementary, superb quality data sets (a decade of HST observations and several years of Arecibo radar results)  with  a  realistic  physical  description  of  the  rings.  The  research  will  address  fundamental characteristics  of  ring  dynamics,  such  as  gravitational  instabilities,  as  well  as  properties  of  the  ring particles  themselves. The  observations  and  analysis  will  provide  a  firm  foundation  for  Cassini mission investigation  of  the  rings. The  HST  and  Arecibo  data  will  not  be  supplanted  by  Cassini  observations, because they have been taken under different viewing geometries and they sample very different parts of the scattering phase function of the particles.  \r\n \r\nThe investigator will relate the research to the educational life of Wellesley College, an undergraduate women's college with a history of success in educating women in science. This will be accomplished by supervising  honors  thesis  students  and  undergraduate  summer  students,  and  by  incorporating  detailed examples of their research in both introductory and advanced courses. Dr. French will continue a successful outreach  program  by  leading  several-day  seminars  to  about  25  K-12  teachers  each  year  on  the relationship between modern planetary science and terrestrial concerns such as global climate change and the  consequences  of  giant  impacts,  and  he  will  share  the  ongoing  research  under  this project  with teachers and the general public at a non-technical level. This award is made under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions program at NSF.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
