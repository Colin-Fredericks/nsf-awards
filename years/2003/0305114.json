His objectives are \r\nto gain both better understanding and simplifications of complexity, which \r\ninclude complexity reduction for the protein folding problem, effect of \r\nsolutes on the enhancement of strength of alloys, and mechanism of singularity \r\nformation in air, water, and liquid crystals. The methods include hard, soft, \r\nand asymptotic analysis, numerical computation, and techniques of mathematical \r\nmodeling. The mathematical issues proposed to study are all fundamental for \r\nthe understanding of the respective subject areas. For instance, the search \r\nfor a measurement of distance between three points in the protein folding \r\nproblem is to reduce drastically the huge number of local minima of the energy \r\npotential and thus bring the complexity to a comprehensible level. The issues \r\nproposed in the phase-field model of alloys is to provide the quantitative as \r\nwell as qualitative foundation for manipulating the effect of solutes in \r\nstrengthening the alloys. The theoretical issue regarding the limit from \r\nSchrodinger-Poisson to Vlasov-Poisson equations is a consistency issue of \r\ngreat importance in the overall understanding of matter and mathematical \r\nmodeling. The investigation of these mathematical issues will\r\n(1) yield new understanding regarding alloys, liquid, gases, plasmas, \r\nliquid crystals, and bio-materials, which are critical for the advancement \r\nof many engineering sciences such as protein-engineering, drug designing, \r\nsolid solution hardening, aerospace engineering, robot designing, energy \r\nefficient devices, etc.; (2) provide advanced training for graduate students \r\nor postdoctoral researchers; (3) enhance collaboration and cross training \r\nof faculties between mathematics, material research, physics, biochemistry, \r\nmolecular biology, and other life sciences, thereby establish a foundation \r\nfor training students in this broad area while promoting research. \r\n\r\nYuxi Zheng proposes to study some applied mathematical problems in fluid \r\ndynamics (which includes the motion of air and water), modeling of alloys, \r\nplasma physics, protein folding in molecular biology, and liquid crystal \r\nphysics in material science. Scientists and engineers have used mathematical \r\nequations, called partial differential equations, to model motions or \r\nevolution. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the materials and the \r\ncomplexity of life show up in the form of singularities and instabilities \r\nin the solutions of the equations or in the complexity of the equations \r\nthemselves. In the protein folding problem, the equations themselves need \r\nto be mathematically simplified for a computer to do real time numerical \r\nsimulation. In all the other cases, where the equations are quite simple, \r\nit is these singularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate \r\nnumerical computations of the solutions. Yuxi Zheng plans to use the state \r\nof the art analytical tools to study the structures of the singular solutions. \r\nIn the case of a compressible gas such as air, for example, Yuxi Zheng plans \r\nto isolate typical singularities (hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) \r\nand investigate their individual structures. The result of the investigation \r\nwill be a clear understanding of the worst possible solutions, or drastic \r\nreduction of complexity, and thereby quantify our knowledge of the physics \r\nand offer guidance in high-performance numerical computations of general \r\nsolutions. The success here will influence scientific areas such as \r\nalloys, liquid, gases, plasmas, liquid crystals, and bio-materials, and \r\nprovide critical knowledge for the advancement of many engineering sciences \r\nsuch as protein-engineering, drug designing, solid solution hardening, \r\naerospace engineering, robot designing, energy efficient devices, etc. \r\nIn addition, the success here will provide advanced training for graduate \r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers and enhance collaboration and cross \r\ntraining of faculties between mathematics, material research, physics, \r\nbiochemistry, molecular biology, and other life sciences, thereby establish a \r\nfoundation for training students in this broad area while promoting research.\r\n",
