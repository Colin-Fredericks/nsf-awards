 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) project provides technical information, engineer-\r\ning assistance, training, and equipment to research institutions and networking organizations in \r\ndeveloping areas. The  primary goal is to make it easier for US scientists and engineers, and those \r\nin developing areas, to collaborate via the Internet. In FY04 the project will transition this year to other programs and continue to develop network infrastructure in the less-connected parts of the \r\nworld continuing its tradition of high leveraging through these ongoing partnerships and alliances.  \r\nThe NSRC.s activities develop and enhance network infrastructure for collaborative research, education, and international partnerships, while promoting teaching and training via the transfer of technology.\r\n\r\nThe work provides significant benefits for US scientists and the international research community by \r\nfacilitating better access for researchers in developing countries who participate in the global \r\nresearch enterprise. Regarding intellectual merit, NSRC.s work advances knowledge and under-\r\nstanding within the fields of networking and telecommunications through a clearly focused strat-\r\negy: working on the specific problems of engineers and technologists in the research and \r\neducational environments of poorer, less developed countries. The improved communications \r\nresulting from these efforts are then available to scientists and engineers, on both ends of the \r\nspectrum, enabling the application of a wide variety of ideas, information, talent, and resources to \r\na given research question. \r\n \r\nThe NSRC.s main focus areas are: \r\n\r\nHelping develop and deploy Internet infrastructure in overseas R&E networks \r\nAssisting US scientists with international collaboration and research partnerships\r\nProviding technical information and resources to network operators \r\nProviding direct network engineering and planning assistance  \r\nHelping organize regional training workshops and centers  \r\nCoordinating donations and shipments of networking books and equipment  \r\nDeveloping Internet exchange points \r\nHelping build and deploy wireless network infrastructure  \r\nHosting network engineering interns  \r\nAdvising on the establishment of help desk and user support services  \r\nMaintaining a historical archive of Internet connectivity  \r\n \r\nThe NSRC and University of Oregon team brings considerable operational experience in design-\r\ning networks and deploying Internet technology in places with minimal infrastructure and limited \r\nresources. Colleagues from the extensive international contacts and relationships that we have \r\nestablished over the past fifteen years are willing to contribute their time and expertise to NSRC \r\ninitiatives and activities, putting special emphasis on scientific institutions when we request their \r\nhelp on behalf of NSF and US scientists. Having assisted many of the initial network efforts in \r\ndeveloping economies, the NSRC is transitioning to assisting those networks with issues of scal-\r\nability, enrichment of services and applications for end users, and national and regional coopera-\r\ntion. The substantial in-kind support we have received from  industry, equipment vendors, and \r\nbook publishers, in part because of NSF.s imprimatur, has significantly multiplied the return of \r\nNSF.s investment in the NSRC project. By building on past successes and current working rela-\r\nTionships this project will formalize strategic alliances with  partners in industry and academia that support the NSRC.s activities.",
