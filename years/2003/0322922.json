 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposes to develop a process to fabricate nanoscale hemispherical cavity arrays on silicon (Si) substrates by laser-assisted imprinting of self-assembled nanospheres. The technical area of the proposed project is to develop laser-based nanomanufacturing technologies by combining topdown processing and bottom-up synthesis approaches to nanofabrication, to achieve the best technology and economy efficiency. The research objective of this project is to develop a new laser-imprinting process using self-assembled nanoparticles. The methods to be used to achieve the research objective include: (1) self assembly of silica nanoparticles to form a monolayer, (2) embedding the nanoparticles into a Si surface during laser irradiation, (3) removing the nanoparticles to form hemispherical cavity arrays, (4) patterning the self-assembled nanoparticles deposited on a quartz plate using a tightly-focused laser beam, and (5) fabrication of pre-designed array patterns by imprinting the patterned nanoparticles into Si substrates. There are four primary expected outcomes from the proposed research. (1) We will further the understanding of laser-interaction with quartz/nanoparticle/Si structures. (2) We will be able to fabricate nanoscale hemispherical cavity arrays. (3) We will develop a novel process by combining the advantages of self-assembly, nanoimprinting and laser direct writing. (4) The research results will be integrated into development of a new course on nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe process to be developed has potential applications to fabricate 1D and 2D photonic bandgap crystals. The hemispherical arrays can also be used as templates to fabricate 3D photonic bandgap structures. Engineered photonic crystal materials have unique applications in infrared image control (thermal stealth), target identification, signal recognition, optical communications, and sensors. The project activities will be integrated into development of a new course, Introduction to Nanotechnology, for fall semester of 2003. One graduate student will be trained in this project. In addition, we will recruit two undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in this project. Our goal is to engage a diverse group of students as a way of encouraging underrepresented groups to continue on for postgraduate study. We will develop an animation kit  describing basic principles involved in this project. The PI will send the animation kit to K-12 schools. We will widely disseminate research results at conferences. The PI has accepted an invitation to deliver an invited talk in Materials Research Society Spring Meeting (April 2004, San Francisco). The PI will also interact with industry partners  during the Photonic West 2004 Exhibition (January 2004, San Jose) and ICALEO 2003 (October 2003, Florida). \r\n",
