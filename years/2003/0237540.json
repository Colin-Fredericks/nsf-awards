 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power is becoming increasingly as important, if not more important than \r\nperformance in many digital systems ranging from PCs and servers to \r\nInternet routers and embedded systems-on-a-chip. While there has been \r\nsubstantial research exploring the power efficiency of the processing \r\nand memory elements of digital systems, research investigating the power\r\nconsumption of communication elements has been lagging. As a wide range \r\nof digital systems becomes increasingly interconnected, it is now\r\nboth timely and critical to explore power-aware interconnection networks.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we outline our plans to research, develop and build \r\nself-regulating power-aware interconnection networks that trade off \r\npower and performance automatically while meeting design constraints. In \r\nthese networks, power-aware router and link mechanisms export knobs by \r\nwhich network power and performance can be adjusted. Policies then \r\ncontrol these knobs to deliver network power-performance that meet \r\ndesign goals. Self-regulating power-aware networks alleviate designers \r\nfrom the daunting task of reconciling two highly divergent goals -\r\nhigh performance, and low power.\r\n\r\nIn highlighting and demonstrating the importance of power awareness in \r\nnetworks, our proposed research advances a deeper understanding of \r\nnetworks from a fresh perspective, with a potential for high-impact \r\ncontributions in research. In addition, we see our research leading to \r\npower efficiency being an integral part of networking curriculum.\r\n\r\n",
