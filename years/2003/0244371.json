 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research:\r\n\r\nPolymer-nanoinorganic hybrids are new paper-coating materials that could potentially improve the coating smoothness, gloss, printing quality, and scratch properties of coated papers.  The basic idea is to combine the properties of an inorganic nanoparticle with those of the polymer system in an advantageous way, e.g., merging the thermal stability, the mechanical strength, or light scattering power of the inorganic nanoparticle with the elasticity and the ability of the polymer to form films.\r\n\r\nMost polymer-nanoinorganic hybrids are available only in bulk form and there are few water-based nanohybrid suspensions available.  Water-based suspensions are desirable for environmental reasons as well as being required for most paper-coating and some painting applications.  The focus of this research is to develop both fundamental understanding of the synthesis of water-based and polymer encapsulated nanohybrid suspensions, and the technological development of using the methodology for paper coating.  Both emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization techniques will be tested for polymer encapsulated nanohybrid synthesis.  Within these suspension particles, the nanoclay is exfoliated by the polymer matrix.  The fundamental understanding of the nanoparticle encapsulation, exfoliation, and the physical properties of the final nanohybrids can also be used to guide other encapsulation reactions such as ink, toner, etc.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nThe PI has an educational plan to establish a program that is capable of providing outreach activities to local communities and colleges in the Atlanta area.  In addition, developing this environmentally benign technology could be of great benefit to the pulp and paper industry.\r\n",
