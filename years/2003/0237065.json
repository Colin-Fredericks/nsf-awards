 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii has proposed a plan for Research \r\nInfrastructure Improvement (RII) with the overarching theme of \r\n\"Biodiversity in an Integrated Environment\".  The project involves the \r\ncollaboration of the University of Hawaii campuses at Manoa and Hilo. \r\nThe effort will be directed at three research thrust areas that are \r\nconsistent with the state's commitment to a research agenda that \r\ntargets responsible stewardship of its island ecosystems:  evolutionary \r\ngenetics, ecosystems, and information technology for environmental \r\nresearch.  The research agenda will focus on Hawaii's native and \r\nintroduced invasive species and consider the impact of human activities \r\non ecosystem functionality and biological diversity.   Hawaii \r\ninvestigators will use new molecular and technical approaches to study \r\ntimely and substantive environmental research questions.  A partnership \r\nwith Kamehameha Schools will enable researchers, educators and students \r\naccess to land of tremendous diversity for enriched research and \r\neducational experiences.  An Environmental Information Technology \r\nResearch Network will be established to store and retrieve spacial \r\ndata that can be used to model ecosystem processes throughout the \r\nHawaiian Islands and serve as a central clearinghouse for biological \r\nresource datasets.\r\n\r\nHawaii's RII effort will strengthen and increase interactions and \r\ncollaborations among researchers within the state as well as with US \r\nmainland researchers and integrate research in biodiversity with \r\neducational and outreach activities.  K-12 students and teachers will \r\ninteract with university researchers in field work designed to increase \r\nmath and science interest and learning in Hawaii's youth, particularly \r\nNative Hawaiian students.  Infrastructure support will also include \r\nfunding of faculty and student travel, start-up funding for new \r\nfaculty, \"seed funding' to promote competitive collaborations among \r\ninvestigators and support for research experiences of community college \r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n",
