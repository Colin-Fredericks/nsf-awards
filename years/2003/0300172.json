 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nSpeh/Barbasch\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the study of automorphic forms,\r\nrepresentations of reductive groups and their applications. \r\nDan Barbasch, together with various coworkers, is proposing to\r\ncontinue investigations of the unitary dual of real and p-adic\r\ngroups. In particular he will study necessary conditions for\r\nunitarity. He will also continue the study of unipotent\r\nrepresentations, in particular their associated cycles. Joint with \r\nvarious coworkers he will study occurences of representations in the\r\ndual reductive pairs correspondence, and for p-adic groups he will\r\nstudy the Bernstein center. Birgit Speh, together with\r\nvarious coworkers, will continue the study of cohomology of locally symmetric\r\nspaces. In particular she will study representation theoretic\r\ndescriptions of modular symbols. She will also work on proving \r\nuniform convergence of terms in the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. \r\nIt is expected that the results of this proposal \r\nwill contribute significantly to the understanding of the geometry and \r\ntopology of locally symmetric spaces. Graduate and undergraduate students \r\nas well as postdoctoral faculty are expected to be involved in studying \r\nproblems generated by this research.\r\n  \r\nMany problems in number theory and mathematical physics are concerned\r\nwith functions that are solutions to differential equations which have\r\ncertain symmetry properties. These properties are expressed in\r\nmathematics as saying that the solutions form a unitary representation\r\nof a reductive group. A major part of this proposal is concerned with the\r\ndetermination of the building blocks which are called\r\nunitary irreducible representations. The aforementioned functions\r\nrelevant to number theory are called automorphic functions and have\r\nexpansions in terms of  unitary irreducible representations. These\r\nexpansions can be thought of as generalizations of classical Fourier\r\nseries.  The problem of convergence of these expansions is important\r\nfor applications to number theory, and forms an important  component\r\nof this proposal. \r\n",
