 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the 14th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, which will be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison on June 20-24, 2003. The aim is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among researchers of the international Arabidopsis community. The conference will include sessions on genetics, genomics, metabolism, metabolic regulation, cell biology, inductive processes, genetic mechanisms, evolution, pattern formation, cell fate, reproduction, and responses to the biotic and aboitic environment. An important component of the conference is the presentation of current research by approximately 42 speakers. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty will present the majority of these talks. This will ensure presentation of the latest results, promote education of students and postdoctoral fellows and provide important career development for the selected speakers. This project will primarily support attendance of young scientists and of researchers from minority-serving institutions.",
