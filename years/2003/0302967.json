This project will develop and enhance geoscience education and research capabilities at two participating minority serving institutions, enabling them to collaborate with a major research university to expand opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to participate in geoscience education and research through geoscience course study, structured undergraduate research training, and academic and professional support activities. NCSU has existing bachelors, masters and doctoral programs in geosciences, while neither NC A&T nor RCC has geoscience degree programs. The objective of this program is to provide an opportunity for the minority student populations at NC A&T and RCC to become geoscientists by adding introductory level courses at RCC and by adding a geophysics concentration to the physics program at NC A&T, and by enhancing research infrastructure and undergraduate research training in geosciences at NC A&T and RCC.  The program will emphasize undergraduate research, will include geoscience curriculum enhancement and comprehensive support activities to maximize retention and graduation, and has assessment elements to evaluate each program element. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
