 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to plan different strategies that enable a\r\ncompetency-based individualized education in such a diverse engineering school.\r\n\r\nWhile education is significantly different than industrial production of goods and services, we\r\nbelieve that there exist several concepts one can borrow, modify and implement to education\r\nsystems to answer today's increasing demands. At the very least, one such concept is mass\r\ncustomization of goods and services, which translates into a competency-based\r\nindividualized education system. This concept aims to provide a set of measurable\r\noutcomes (namely, skills, knowledge base and competency of graduates) by characterizing and\r\nIndividualizing each student's learning process and potential.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we envision the development of a competency-based learning system that would\r\nreflect a unified academia-industry perspective, provide for the immediate needs of the industry\r\nand facilitate scholarly development of future engineers and researchers. In this project, we\r\npropose to develop a plan to implement a systems approach and the manufacturing strategy of\r\nmass customization to the education process. More specifically, we propose to develop a\r\nfundamental framework for curriculum design, which allows for individualized education while\r\nstill optimizing the capacity of the teaching assets we have for each academic year.\r\n\r\nThe findings from the project will be published in various journals on education\r\nresearch. We also intend to work with local industry to extend our findings and insights to the\r\nmass customization of their education and training systems. \r\n",
