 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US Universities Council on Geotechnical Engineering Research (USUCGER) is an organization of US Geotechnical Engineering professors. A three-day workshop will be held, which will include presentations on research and teaching objectives, and geotechnical faculty and student professional development. The purposes are to encourage exchange of research ideas, procedures and sources of research funding, collaboration amongst faculty and graduate students, and improvement of geotechnical teaching. \r\n\r\nGraduate students, and faculty from predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) are invited. \r\n \r\nThe meeting will include:\r\n\tshort presentations by all USUCGER institutions on their research projects\r\n\ta focus on expanding research \r\na) with /at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions \r\nb) with new and prospective faculty\r\n\tsenior PhD student attendance and participation\r\n\ttwo keynote speaker sessions on research ideas and funding\r\n\tbreakout sessions (two on day one; nine on day two), Each was followed by joint sessions where the breakout ideas are presented and discussed.\r\n\r\nResearch benefits will come from the rich faculty synergism that generates new ideas, faculty experiences in research and an improved collaboration with PUIs. \r\n\r\nEducational benefits of the meeting will come from graduate students meeting with other students and faculty, educational issues being shared and discussed, and an enhanced camaraderie and sharing of teaching experiences. Some new directions in engineering education will be highlighted. \r\n",
