 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal proposal requests continued NSF funding of a research program currently sup-\r\nported by the grant NSF-PHY-0070368. The major proposed topics lie in the area of \\quark{\r\nnuclear physics,\" to study the quark sub{structure of strongly interacting particles. Particular\r\nattention is on approximate symmetries of QCD, particularly favor and charge symmetry.\r\nSymmetry violation provides a \\mirror\" to identify and quantify non-perturbative physics.\r\nThis research should shed light on the detailed properties of the fundamental constituents of\r\nmatter, with emphasis on the validity of favor and charge symmetry, the spin dependence\r\nof parton distributions, and nuclear modification of parton properties. One product of this\r\ngrant would be a comprehensive review of charge symmetry at both low and high energies,\r\nemphasizing our current understanding of the role of the up-down quark mass difference in\r\ngenerating charge symmetry violation over a wide variety of energies and physical processes.\r\nModels developed by the PI will be employed to investigate recent neutrino results, which are\r\nsuggested to show physics beyond the Standard Model. The structure of baryon resonances\r\nwill be investigated through a relativistic code developed explicitly to study these systems.\r\nNew features of these calculations should allow a more realistic description of the structure of\r\nresonances in the .25N system. It is also proposed to study binding and scattering of particles\r\nin constrained 2-D systems, relevant to quantum wires and photonic crystals. Prior research in\r\nthis area culminated in a monograph published by Springer-Verlag. Continuing studies involve\r\ncollaboration with an experimental colleague combining theoretical studies of novel geometries\r\nwith experiments on these systems.\r\nIn all proposed areas, there is close linkage between theory and experiment. Some recent\r\npredictions by the PI are being studied at facilities such as LEP, HERA and the Tevatron.\r\nThe baryon resonance work proposed here is relevant to data taken at the CLAS detector\r\nat Jefferson Lab. The PI is involved in studies for a possible new facility, an Electron-Ion\r\nCollider (EIC), which was favorably assessed in the recent NSAC Long-Range Plan for nuclear\r\nphysics. The PI is a co-author on recent EIC planning efforts that include a Web site and CD-\r\nROM containing a Whitepaper on EIC physics. The PI is Director of the Indiana University\r\nNuclear Theory Center (NTC). Currently the NTC has four postdocs and visitors, three of\r\nwhom are women. In several instances, women working at NTC have received joint support\r\nfrom two or more sources, combining federal, university or foreign contributions. The PI has\r\nset up international collaborations between the NTC and physics institutes in Australia, Japan\r\nand Germany. The PI has mentored 9 undergraduate researchers in summer REU programs\r\nduring the past 8 years. They have given talks on their research at subsequent workshops\r\nand professional meetings, and have collaborated on publications with the PI. The research\r\nproposed here will provide training and mentoring for both postdoctoral research associates,\r\nand undergraduate physics majors.",
