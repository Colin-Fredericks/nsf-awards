 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mutualistic association between sepiolid squids (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) and their luminous bacterial symbionts (Genus Vibrio) provides a versatile model system to study population biology and speciation among animal-bacterial partnerships.  Although the squid light organs are open to the seawater, only two Vibrio species stay inside the organ, indicating adaptation and evolution of specificity.  Using state-of-the-art techniques involving fluorescent microscopy, molecular biology, and gene expression, this project will examine whether environmental processes or the squid hosts determine the architecture of these interactions.  Central to this study will be determining how different the squid-Vibrio pairs are among geographically isolated populations.  A key element of this proposal is the several international and collaborative efforts that have been established by the Nishiguchi laboratory for this work.\r\n\r\n\tResults from this proposal will be shared (through publications, meetings, web sites, courses) with both the research and public communities.  This study will provide unique research opportunities for students, building on programs for under-represented minorities at New Mexico State University. NMSU is the only Carnegie I research institution ranked by the National Science Foundation as one that serves significant numbers of two ethnic minority student populations, Hispanics and Native Americans.  This research will lead to a better understanding of speciation and evolution of bacterial-animal relationships and provide information about the transmission of bacteria in the environment. \r\n",
