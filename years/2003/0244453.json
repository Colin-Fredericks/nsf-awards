 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan State University proposes a three-year grant supporting the research\r\nof a faculty group in nuclear theory, Professors B. A. Brown and V. Zelevinsky,\r\ntogether with M. Horoi (Central Michigan University). The research proposed\r\nencompasses a broad range of topics in nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics\r\nimportant for the ongoing program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron\r\nLaboratory. The main components are structural properties of nuclei, including\r\nthose far from stability, and their manifestation in nuclear reactions and astrophysical\r\nphenomena. The rich experience of the group and the support from MSU\r\nand NSCL provides the .rm basis for a diverse and topical research program.\r\nThe proposed research is in the mainstream of modern nuclear physics that is\r\ndirected to answering principal questions what are the limits of stability of nuclei,\r\nhow did the chemical evolution of the Universe proceed, what are the\r\nways of self-organization in interacting many-body systems - how does order coexist\r\nwith chaos and complexity.   Concrete directions of the proposed research\r\nlogically follow from the previous experience of the group. Suggested main topics\r\nare (i) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description\r\nof nuclear structure and nuclear reactions, especially for the nuclei far from\r\nstability; (ii) detailed consideration of speci.c nuclear phenomena and nuclear\r\nprocesses that shed light on the new features encountered with the advances into\r\nvirgin territory of unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural\r\nand dynamical aspects of nuclear processes of astrophysical interest; (iv) studies\r\nof many-body quantum chaos and its coexistence with collective and regular\r\nfeatures in nuclear structure and reactions.\r\nThe suggested program is expected to have appreciable impact on the development\r\nin the .eld of nuclear theory and nuclear astrophysics. It will also in.uence\r\nthe direction of the experimental e.orts. In a broader context, successful progress\r\nin the program is important for our understanding of the basic constituents of\r\nmatter and nucleosynthesis in the Universe. The studies of many-body properties,\r\nchaos and collectivity in nuclear structure, have a strong interdisciplinary\r\naspect since the nucleus is an exemplary case of a self-sustaining .nite Fermisystem\r\nwith strong interactions. Historically, many ideas .rst formulated in the\r\ncontext of nuclear theory fertilized other branches of physics. The proposed research\r\nis expected to help studies in physics of Bose- and Fermi-condensates,\r\ncomplex molecules, solid state microdevices and quantum computing. The proposal\r\nhas a considerable educational component being part of the highly ranked\r\nnuclear physics program at NSCL/MSU.",
