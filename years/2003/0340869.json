 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics(SIAM) will present the Eleventh Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing. This series of conferences has played a key role in promoting parallel scientific computing and parallel numerical algorithms. The conference is distinguished by its emphasis on the information technology aspects of scientific computing on parallel machines and provides a forum for communication among the scientific computing, information technology, and computational science and engineering communities.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of this grant will support small travel grants to student and junior researchers. The grant will also support travel grants and small monetary awards to winners in a student paper competition and a poster competition. All award decisions will be made by the conference organizing committee (the PI is a Co-chair). SIAM will advertise and coordinate these activities and if this proposal is funded, NSF support will be clearly acknowledged at the conference and its web-site and related publications.\r\n\r\n",
