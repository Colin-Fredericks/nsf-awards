The biosensor would use electrochemical detection to measure rDNA in the environment without target amplification by the polymerase chair reaction (PCR). Gene-based remote sensing requires the development of easy-to-use, fast, inexpensive, miniaturized analytical devices. Electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization is uniquely qualified to meet size, cost, and power requirements of field systems. This Phase I development will focus on two critical components of biosensor technology development - remote DNA extraction and direct detection of DNA without using PCR amplification. Meeting these two challenges are critical first steps toward developing the next generation of remote sensing technology. Species-specific data generation in conjunction with synoptic measurements of relevant environmental variables could significantly contribute to the understanding of a variety of processes related to plankton dynamics, initiation of algal blooms, and the spread of coral disease. Biosensors to monitor toxic organisms could provide early warnings of the need to close fisheries or beaches.\r\n***\r\n",
