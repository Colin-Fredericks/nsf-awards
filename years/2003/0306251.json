 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy-efficiency is vital for pervasive computing.  Small, mobile\r\ncomputers such as handhelds are battery powered.  They must carefully\r\nmanage their limited energy supply in order to run demanding\r\napplications for long periods of time.  Pervasive computers are also\r\nincreasingly well-connected to the Internet by wireless networks.\r\nHowever, connectivity is costly: communication is a large and growing\r\nportion of their power budgets.  Current data access mechanisms\r\nexacerbate the problem---they substantially increase the energy cost\r\nof communication because they are optimized for performance, not\r\nenergy-efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates how to build energy-efficient distributed\r\nfile systems for pervasive computing.  The first step is building\r\nmeasurement infrastructure that precisely captures the communication,\r\nstorage, and computation costs of data access.  The next step is\r\ncharacterizing the energy usage of existing distributed file systems\r\nand identifying characteristics that increase energy-efficiency.  The\r\nfinal step is building a new, energy-efficient file system that\r\nenables pervasive computers to maintain connectivity without\r\ncompromising battery lifetime.  This research thus allows pervasive\r\ncomputing devices to be incorporated into everyday activities.  For\r\nexample, all-day battery life is essential for projects that deeply\r\nintegrate handheld computers into classroom activity.\r\n",
