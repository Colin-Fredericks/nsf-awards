 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women in Cognitive Science (WICS) is an organization created by the Co-PIs of this proposal in 2001 and is affiliated with the Psychonomic Society. The goal of WICS is to enhance the success of women scientists who are pursuing careers in cognitive science, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.  The proposal describes a program which aims to sustain and extend WICS. The planned activities have the following objectives:\r\n* to organize its structure more formally,\r\n* to sustain its presence,  \r\n* to engage the participation of other senior women cognitive scientists in its leadership,\r\n* to plan events to take place around the yearly meeting of the Psychonomic Society,\r\n* to create a set of ongoing programs that will promote the advancement of all women in the field,\r\n* to ensure the recognition and representation of senior women,  and \r\n* to address the needs of younger women facing the challenges of negotiating the initial stages of beginning a career. \r\n\r\nThe program proposed addresses both of NSF.s impact criteria.  It encourages the participation of young scientists in professional meetings, promotes the mentoring and professional development of women and minorities, and aims to increase the visibility of senior women cognitive scientists who have been historically underrepresented in positions of leadership. \r\n",
