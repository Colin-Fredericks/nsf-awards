 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0300639\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Anand Pillay\r\n\r\nThe proposal covers problems in several areas of model theory (a\r\nbranch of mathematical logic) and its applications. On the pure\r\nside are problems involving definability and fine structure in\r\nmodels of simple theories, which will be approached using the\r\ntheory of elementary pairs of models. Also questions on the\r\nstructure of the Lascar group, a certain Galois group attached to\r\nany first order theory, raise new conjectural relationships\r\nbetween first order logic and descriptive set theory. The applied\r\nside of the proposal deals mainly with jet-space methods in\r\ndifferential fields, the Galois theory of differential equations\r\nin positive characteristic, and the model theory of Kahler\r\nmanifolds. Among the common themes on the applied side is the\r\nmanner in which model theory predicts that the further a\r\ndefinable set is from algebraic geometry, the more rigid is its\r\nstructure, and the mathematical implications of this behaviour in\r\nthe concrete situations under investigation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is in a certain branch of mathematical logic called\r\nmodel theory. Modern mathematical logic developed in the\r\ntwentieth century. Although the present proposal does not touch\r\ndirectly on computability questions, it is worth remarking that\r\nmathematical logicians such as Turing provided the first rigorous\r\nnotions of computability and played a role in the development of\r\nactual computers. Model theory, on the other hand, is concerned\r\nwith a detailed study of the language in which mathematicians\r\nexpress themselves and define mathematical\r\nobjects. Model-theorists such as Robinson and Tarski showed how\r\nsuch preoccupations can have wide-ranging implications for\r\nmathematics itself, and so indirectly for science as a whole. The\r\ndevelopment of nonstandard analysis provides an example. The past\r\nfifteen years have seen striking advances in applications of\r\nmodel theory to areas of mathematics such as number theory and\r\ngeometry. The proposer plans, among other things, to extend these\r\nadvances, using new methods he has recently developed.\r\n",
