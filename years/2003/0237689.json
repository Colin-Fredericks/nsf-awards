 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grants have been awarded to Drs. J. Priscu (Montana State University), M. Madigan (Southern Illinois University), B. Lanoil (University of California - Riverside) and S.Giovannoni (Oregon State University) to study prokaryotic organisms within the permanently ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica with the objectives of identifying and characterizing novel organisms and elucidating those aspects of their genome and metabolism that are critical to understanding their role in biogeochemical cycles. The study will use molecular tools in concert with conventional and high throughput culturing techniques to define representative prokaryotic groups responsible for the contemporary geochemical gradients that exist in these lakes. The McMurdo Dry Valleys form the driest and coldest ecosystem known on Earth and has, until relatively recently, been thought to harbor little life. A primary reason for establishing a Microbial Observatory for these lakes is to understand not just how the environment controls the diversity of organisms, but also how diversity itself controls the functioning of ecosystems.  The McMurdo Dry Valley lake systems lend themselves to answering this question in a unique way. Given the isolation, the lack of higher life forms, and the evolutionary history of these lakes, they offer a unique experimental arena to search for novel microorganisms and study the interplay of microbial diversity and ecosystem function. \r\n\r\nResults from this study will be significant to the growing bodies of literature in biodiversity, biotechnology, geobiology, polar ecology, and astrobiology. The investigators will work with existing and proposed new programs to archive the phylogenetic and physiological data collected during the study so that all interested can access it easily through the Internet. Strong linkages will be made with the highly visible education, outreach and human diversity programs supported by the NSF Office of Polar Programs and the McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research station, yielding a project that will have a broad impact on society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
