 "awd_abstract_narration": "Math and Science Partnerhips (MSPs) are designed to connect institutions that are very different from one another.  The leadership challenge in these projects is immense. This is a one-year design grant to support the development of a program of research to focus on leadership as a distributed practice in MSPs.  The goal will be to design a research program that focuses on a) distributed leadership practices that enable knowledge creation and innovation in MSPs and b) provide empirical evidence about how distributed leadership changes the practices of school districts, higher education institutions and community organizations committed to improving mathematics and science learning.  In addition, the project will identify existing tools and instruments that can be used to study distributed leadership, design a framework for developing new tools, and begin a preliminary testing of those tools with a select group of urban schools.  The focus during the design work will be on high schools as they interact with the other institutions.",
