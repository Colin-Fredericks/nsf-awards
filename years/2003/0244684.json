 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the use of single-mode lasers and Doppler tuning to excite select velocity components of a single atomic beam to study orientation, alignment, and velocity effects on the associative ionization of electronically excited atoms at very low collision energies. These table-top experiment represent an approach for investigating associative ionization at low collision energies with the goal of bridging the gap between collisions observed in room temperature vapors and collisions observed in the ultra-cold environment encountered in optical traps. External cavity diode lasers will be employed to excite select narrow velocity components of an effusive potassium beam's thermal velocity distribution. Beyond aiding the understanding of collisional processes that occur in cold trap environments, the broader impact of this project includes enhancing the research and teaching infrastructure of Lafayette College, training student physicists destined for graduate school and employment in industry, and providing undergraduates with practical hands-on laboratory experience.",
