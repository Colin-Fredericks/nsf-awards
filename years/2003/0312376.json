 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose a network solution called Dynamically Reconfigurable Ethernet/Ethernet-over-SONET (DREEoS) to enable end-to-end connectivity through high-speed optical circuits. The primary application that is consider in this project is large data transfers between businesses (B2B), and between businesses and consumers (B2C). DREEoS is proposed as an add-on service to the primary Internet access service. This can be achieved by equipping end hosts with second (high-speed) Ethernet cards and connecting these cards to ports on an enterprise Multi-Service Provisioning Platform (MSPP). Wide-area SONET circuits are\r\nestablished dynamically between enterprise MSPPs and Ethernet signals from the end hosts to the enterprise MSPPs are mapped to these wide-area circuits. An end host with access to DREEoS service has to determine whether it is worthwhile attempting a DREEoS circuit or not.  Through analysis, it showed that an end host should first attempt setting up a DREEoS circuit if (i) file sizes are large (ii) file sizes are small but round-trip times (RTT) are large and (iii) file sizes and RTT are small, then for files larger than some crossover file size. The crossover file size and crossover RTT depend upon the probability of packet loss on the TCP/IP path, link rates, RTT, and call blocking probability on the optical circuit-switched path. The availability of the fallback TCP/IP path allows DREEoS service to be introduced gradually into optical networks. At low loads, the network can be operated at high call blocking probabilities to achieve high\r\nutilization. As loads increase, the network can be engineered to retain high utilization while simultaneously offering low call blocking probabilities. In this project, the PIs plan to implement various software\r\nmodules, such as application software to trigger circuit setup, Optical Connectivity Service (OCS) to allow an end host initiating a transfer to determine whether its correspondent host can even be reached via a\r\nDREEoS circuit, transport protocol software to allow for high-speed transfers, and integrate these modules to demonstrate high-speed file transfers across the university campuses of the PIs.\r\n\r\nThis work represents a significant advance in our current understanding of the potential of circuit-switched networks. By using hardware-accelerated signaling engines the network can support calls with short holding times. This means applications can exploit the delay benefits of circuit-switched networks, critical for interactive applications, without compromising utilization. This work will reopen our thinking on circuit-switched networks enabling new research. For example, the PIs are considering replacing the call blocking mode used in this proposal with a call queueing/scheduling mode. This will remove\r\nthe impact of propagation delay by allowing for staggered configuration of switches, a feature that is important for very small call holding times. This work has a clear application in Science and Engineering, where distant collaborations require massive file transfers in short durations.\r\n\r\nOur educational and diversity goals will be met through the involvement of students, including minorities and women, from both engineering and management schools. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will help prepare our students better for future industrial jobs.\r\n\r\nThe expected major contributions of the proposed research include (i) the dissemination of our software modules, which will be useful to other research teams working on similar optical network concepts, (ii)\r\ndemonstrations of the viability of this service model for commercial deployment through our economic and market analysis, and (iii) research papers enhancing the role of optical circuit- switched networks.\r\n",
