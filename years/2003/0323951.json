 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Allan Hancock College Technology Scholarship Project provides financial assistance to academically talented, financially disadvantaged students in order to achieve an associate degree in computer science, electronics, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics and to either eventually transfer to a four year university in one of the CSEMS disciplines or to enter the high-tech workforce. The project targets graduating seniors from the seven local feeder high schools. Outreach and recruitment efforts are proactive in encouraging students to apply who are members of one or more groups that have been historically underrepresented in the computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) disciplines (ethnic minority, women, disabled) and/or who are first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThe three primary goals of the project are to\r\n1.  Increase the quantity and quality of local high school students entering existing computer science, electronics, engineering, engineering technology and mathematics programs at the college.\r\n2.  Increase retention and success of students who are enrolled in associate degree programs in computer science, electronics, engineering, engineering technology and mathematics programs.\r\n3.  Strengthen partnerships with local universities and high technology industry.\r\n\r\nThe three objectives of the project during each of the four years of the grant are to\r\n1.  Provide 15 two-year scholarships for academically talented, financially disadvantaged local high school graduating CSEMS students so that they may achieve an associate degree in a CSEMS discipline;\r\n2.  Provide academic support to scholarship recipients that will enable at least 70% to maintain or exceed a 2.5 grade point average and persist until the associate degree has been earned.\r\n3.  Provide transfer or job placement assistance to 100% of the scholarship recipients who earn the associate degree.\r\n\r\nAn ten-member committee of AHC faculty and program directors administer the project. The project is linked to an established Allan Hancock College student support infrastructure. The administrative plan includes monitoring the selection of scholarship recipients and the student support process, and evaluation of the success of the project.\r\n",
