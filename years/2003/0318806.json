 "awd_abstract_narration": "De Pablo, Juan J.\r\nU of Wisconsin - Madison\r\n\r\n\"The North American Lectures in Thermodynamics, Interfacial Science and Materials Design\"\r\n\r\nA program of lectures will continue at universities and research institutions whose goal has been that of disseminating recent advances in the area of molecular thermodynamics \r\nand complex-fluid behavior, and that of fostering collaborations and exchanges between the US and  Mexico.  The speakers represent a broad spectrum of current research activities and new directions being pursued at US institutions. While in Mexico, the speakers are hosted by scientists and engineers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Metropolitan University (UAM), the Polytechnic Institute (IPN), and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP). The net result of this project will continue to be an increased level of interaction and collaboration between US scientists and engineers, their Mexican counterparts, and Mexican students. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nIn spite of the close proximity between the US and Mexico, scientific exchanges between these two countries has been very limited, particularly in the field of chemical and materials engineering. The proposed lecture series is designed to make Mexican schools of chemical engineering and related research institutes a common destination for the North American chemical engineering \"lecture circuit\".  Large numbers of students in Mexico will be routinely exposed to state-of-the-art chemical engineering developments and outstanding US lecturers. Mexican researchers will have an opportunity to meet many of the scientists whose work they read about and whose texts they lecture from.  Industry affiliated engineers will be exposed to advanced technology. This continued exchange of information will undoubtedly result in close collaborations between Mexico and the US, research partnerships with academic institutions, and commercial partnerships with Mexican industries.  It will also result in a greater willingness of Mexican scientists to exchange knowledge and students with their US counterparts. This program marks the beginning of what could become a research and cultural partnership comparable to that adopted with great success by European countries within the framework of the European Union.\r\n\r\nENG/CTS Interfacial, Transport and Thermodynamics Program and MPS/DMR Office of Special Programs jointly support this project.\r\n",
