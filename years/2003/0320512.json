 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a wafer-scale process for the reliable fabrication of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) based probe tips for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).    This project will make use of a novel technique for controlling the placement, number and dimensions of vertical carbon nanotubes, growing them directly onto silicon cantilevers for use as AFM probe tips.  The process is based on catalyst deposition and lift-off, followed by use of electric field enhanced chemical vapor deposition growth chamber.  Challenges to be overcome in this project include integration of the deposition and growth processes with the harsh environment necessary for cantilever micro-fabrication, and achieving uniformity of CNT dimensions and  characteristics at wafer scale.  Successful development of this process would enable the batch fabrication of carbon nanotube probe tips (up to 192/wafer) with controlled length, diameter, vertical orientation and crystalline morphology.   \r\n \r\nCNTs make nearly ideal tips for many AFM applications, given their durability, high aspect ratio, and resolution achieved.  The initial commercial application developed will be a CNT-based AFM probe for tapping mode microscopes.  This process can also be extended to specific demanding applications such as high-aspect ratio/deep trench metrology, and thermal, conductive and magnetic imaging.    \r\n",
