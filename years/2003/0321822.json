 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on Condensed Matter Physics to be held at Connecticut College, New London, CT, June 22-27.  The Conference title is \"Soft Corrals for Electrons and Atoms\".  \"Corral\" is used to denote the 'corralling' or confinement of electrons in molecules for specific purposes.  This can lead to new physical phenomena, quantum effects and so forth.  The term \"soft\" emphasizes that the corrals are mostly composed of \"soft matter\", such as polymers, organic molecules, etc., in contrast to hard matter such as semiconductors, metals, etc.  The unusual terminology is an attempt to summarize an important new interdisciplinary research area, which exploits spontaneous self-assembly of molecules into structures with interesting electronic properties, or which can be used as scaffolds to construct such materials.  The self-assembly depends on the presence of many weak bonds to determine a molecular shape, as in a protein.  In special cases, even proteins can be used as corrals.  However a new strategy for shaping electron waves comes from the simpler world of smaller molecules that exhibit self-organization.  For example, depending on their concentration, soap molecule can combine to form a vast range of structures, sometimes plate like, slippery, or soapy, sometimes golf-ball shaped, leading to turbidity, etc.  The important point is that these structures lie in the nanometer range, where quantum and electronic effects are possible.  In the past the focus of research on self-assembled corrals has been on their molecular structure.  In this conference the emphasis is on the electronic, and other functional aspects of the corrals.  The NSF will provide support for approximately 14 attendees, graduate students, post-docs, and younger faculty.",
