 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe  anaerobic  oxidation  of  methane  is  a  microbially-mediated  process  by  which  the \r\nreduction of sulfate is coupled to the oxidation of methane.  This process is prevalent on a \r\nglobal scale and is estimated to consume between 12 and 50% the net modern \r\natmospheric methane flux (70 to 300 Tg per  year).  The microbes responsible for this \r\nprocess are important as methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and their \r\nmetabolism  prevents  large  quantities  of  methane  in  the  Earth  from  reaching  the \r\natmosphere.  Despite the importance of this process, the responsible organisms have \r\nnever been cultured in the laboratory.  Recent studies conducted in our lab indicate that \r\nsustained growth of these organisms is possible  in the laboratory  given the appropriate \r\nconditions, especially elevated pressures of methane (50 to 150  atmospheres).   We \r\ntherefore propose to  continue growth of these  enrichment  cultures, to  characterize the \r\nmicrobial community composition and physiology of the enrichments, and to isolate the \r\nmethane oxidizers.  Specifically, we propose to:  \r\n \r\n1)  Characterize changes in microbial community structure as well as in methane and \r\nsulfate metabolism during growth of successive enrichment cultures, \r\n \r\n2) Characterize growth of the CH4-oxidizing archaea in the enrichment cultures \r\nincluding species-specific analyses of growth rates, carbon conversion efficiencies, \r\ngrowth morphologies, and the impact of methane partial pressure,   \r\n \r\n3)  Quantify isotope fractionation factors (for  13C  and  2H) associated with methane \r\noxidation and lipid biosynthesis, and \r\n \r\n4)  Isolate the responsible organisms using modified roll tubes at elevated (100 \r\natmosphere) methane levels. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nIn addition to the studies proposed above, this work will also lead to development of new \r\nmethods for culturing strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea at low temperatures with \r\nhigh gas pressures.  These methods promise to enhance infrastructure for microbiological \r\nresearch. \r\n \r\nThe proposed studies  also promise to  enhance our understanding of anaerobic methane \r\noxidation and to lay a foundation for future studies.  The ability to grow the responsible \r\norganisms in the laboratory will allow for a variety of biochemical, genetic, physiological \r\nand molecular studies of this environmentally important process.  Key questions that may \r\nbe addressed in future studies include: 1) how is the stable methane molecule activated in \r\nthe  absence  of  oxygen?,  2)  can  this  chemistry  be  applied  to  methane  cracking  in  an \r\nindustrial setting?, 3) what is the evolutionary history of anaerobic methane oxidation and \r\nhow does it relate to the evolution of Earth.s climate system?, and 4) is the physiology of \r\nthe isolate consistent with environmental observations of anaerobic methane oxidation?  \r\nUnderstanding the physiology of these organisms and isolating them in the laboratory are \r\nthe first steps in answering these and other important questions.",
