 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue University, in collaboration with Indiana University is funded by a two-year Cooperative Agreement from the Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure in the amount of $1,467,769 to integrate the resources available at Purdue University and Indiana University with the Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF).  Funding is provided to establish a 20 gigabit/second connection from Purdue University and Indiana University through Indianapolis to the Chicago Hub of the ETF.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the funding provided through this Terascale Extension Award, Purdue University and Indiana University will be contributing a significant fraction of their resources to the ETF user community including: 1) a heterogeneous group of systems delivering 1.67 teraflops on an ongoing basis with the capability to offer up to 6.26 teraflops for very demanding well-justified applications; 2) a baseline storage capacity offered as part of ETF would include 129 terabytes with peak demand contributions exceeding 400 terabytes;  3) access to a variety of visualization resources including a CAVE, an Immersadesk, Display Walls, etc. are also offered; 4) specialized instrumentation facilities including the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory, and the Service Crystallography at Advanced Photon Sources (SCrAPS); and 5) access to a number of large scientific data sets in the life sciences, earth system simulations, vegetation and soils research, multispectral remote sensing imaging, geological GIS data, economic and social scientific data, and anthropological data. \r\n\r\nInvestigators at both Purdue University and Indiana University will also contribute significantly to the broader goals of the Extensible Terascale Facility.  They have a significant concentration of expertise in areas of grid computing, middleware, and portal development.  Both universities, through their IP-Grid participation, also have extensive outreach activities fostering the training and education of a diverse technological workforce extending from K-12 programs through undergraduate and graduate programs.\r\n",
