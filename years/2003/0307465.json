 "awd_abstract_narration": "MacNeil Lehrer Productions is adding a significant science presence to the nightly \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" program by creating a Science Unit as part of their production staff.  Each year for three years, the unit will produce at least 12 long-form documentary reports (8 to 12 minutes each), shorter (4 to 5 minute) videotape background reports to set up studio interviews, and brief (2 minute) news summary reports when appropriate.   The NewsHour science production team also would collaborate with the NOVA team at WGBH through such means as production of a NewsHour companion report related to a planned NOVA documentary and use of a NOVA segment as a lead-in to a policy discussion on the NewsHour.  Selection of story topics, information about developments in different fields of science, and validation of science content would be guided by a core advisory group that includes:\r\n\r\n      Stephen Sass, Cornell University (Material Science, Nanotechnology)\r\n      Ken Miller, Brown University (BioScience)\r\n      Larry Smarr, Director of the California Institute of telecommunications and Information Technology             (Infotechnology) \r\n      Maria Ghirardi, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Energy)\r\n      John Logsdon, George Washington University (Space)\r\n\r\nThe project will be supported by \"The Online NewsHour.\"  This web site will notify viewers via email of upcoming segments; provide public forums with scientists, researchers, ethicists and policy makers; and allow viewers to obtain transcripts of the broadcasts.  The forums, conducted after the broadcast, include one or more of the principals who appeared in the program responding to questions and/or issues raised by viewers.  Formative evaluation will be conducted by Rockman Et Al and summative evaluation will be conducted by the Goodman Research Group, Inc.\r\n",
