 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for two workshops on \"Management and Models for Cyberinfrastructure.\" The report, Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through Cyberinfrastructure, provides a broad vision of the future of science and engineering research. The path forward that this report envisions - extensive cyberinfrastructure to enable all levels of science & engineering research and education, geographic and institution independence, cross-disciplinary sharing of data and insights, and technical depth in all dimensions - truly has the potential to revolutionize all fields of research and education. In addition to the sound advice offered in the report on the organizational issues that NSF may face in implementing the report's recommendations, there is also a need to examine the various models that might be relevant to the management and oversight of such large-scale, ubiquitous, comprehensive digital environments, which include distributed resources, federated facilities, people, data, information and tools. Input and lessons learned are needed from key stakeholders and other principals experienced in the management and oversight of such complex enterprises. The central objective of these workshops is to articulate the array of organizational models for large-scale, federated, distributed scientific organizations that NSF can consider employing for cyberinfrastructure. The benefits, detriments and possible innovations of each model should be analyzed from several points of view including 1) governance issues, 2) oversight potential, 3) operational effectiveness, 4) economic efficiency, and 5) knowledge production potential. In addition, several town hall meetings will be held to insure that all stakeholders are included.",
