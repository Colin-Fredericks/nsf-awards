The core component of this course is a studio-based learning environment, with opportunities for experience, observation, conceptualization and experimentation. The basic philosophy is that one of the essential skills necessary for life long learning is the ability to self-learn which can be initiated through a self-learning experience. The experiential learning model of Kolb provides the framework for building this learning base based course that teaches students how to learn. The course consists of a virtual tour of full-scale structures, discussion and thought questions, use of animated schematics, and analysis of real world data from full-scale structures.\r\n",
