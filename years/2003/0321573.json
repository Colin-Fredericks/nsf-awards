 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will deliver a low-cost, multi-channel digitizer that can revolutionize applications of fluorescence sensing with its ability to accurately capture over 10,000 complete fluorescence decay curves (waveforms) per second per channel. This novel low-cost digitizer exploits a unique 'flash capture' approach to analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion to achieve an exceptional combination of speed (>1GS/s), resolution (10 bits), and low power.  Fluorescence sensing measurement underlies an immense array of cutting-edge applications because it provides a sensitive and versatile probe into nano-scale behavior and properties. The project will develop a full-featured instrument-grade engineering prototype of the digitizer and integrate it into a portable demonstration instrument to showcase capabilities such as distinguishing biological or chemical agents by their spectral and temporal signatures.\r\n \r\nThis custom digitizer will match the capabilities of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to deliver accurate, cost effective, and complete data  collection. The digitizer will be the first low-cost compact digitizer suitable for the specific front-end LIF analysis of biological agents. Among the weapons of mass destruction that threaten people around the world, biological agents are  perceived to be the main hazard facing us today. The system's ability to capture more information, faster and more accurately will reduce the high occurrence of false alarms suffered by today's systems, resulting in a more reliable system with the potential to save lives. When integrated with biomedical instrumentation, the digitizer will have scientific and educational  benefits through the use at academic institutions for research and discovery. \r\n",
