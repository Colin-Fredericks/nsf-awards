 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptography is a powerful security tool that has not reached its \r\nfull potential in applications. \r\nThis project investigates approaches to making cryptography easier to \r\nuse at multiple levels: easier for the protocol designer, for the software \r\napplications, and the policy maker. The project is naturally divided \r\ninto three areas, roughly corresponding to the above list:\r\n - The study of formal verification methods for protocol design. These\r\nmethods will help the designer to make sure that protocols meet the \r\nrobust security standards accepted by the cryptographic and complexity \r\ntheory communities.  \r\n - The design of versatile cryptographic primitives whose performance \r\ncan be tuned to the needs of specific applications. This includes the \r\nanalysis of cryptographic primitives with respect to modern efficiency \r\nand security measures, e.g., history independence, incrementality, \r\nforward security, and combined uses of the above.\r\n - The analysis of the security and privacy desires of individual users\r\nand policy makers, and the study of innovative solutions to their problems. \r\nFor example, the project explores the design of identification cards that \r\nprovide secure identification without violating the privacy of the users.\r\n\r\nBroad impact: Security is vital to ensure public confidence in the information \r\ninfrastructure, and cryptography is a potent tool for computer security.\r\nYet, cryptography is currently under-utilized and frequently misused.\r\nBy making cryptographic tools easier to use and understand, the project \r\naims to facilitate increased and better informed use of cryptography. \r\nThe project also aims to contribute to the national debate on appropriate \r\nuses of information technology, and, in particular, explore ways to \r\nprotect individual privacy without damaging national security. Finally, the \r\nproject will contribute to the education of cryptographic specialists \r\nwho can communicate clearly with non-specialists, such as implementers and \r\nlegal experts.\r\n",
