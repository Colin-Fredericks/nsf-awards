 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project increases the availability of materials and resources for pre-service and in-service professional development to better prepare teachers for serving students with and without disabilities within a standards-based mathematics curriculum.  Building on the lesson study approach and utilizing the case method, this project develops five modules of professional development materials.  Each module consists of at least two three-hour multimedia case studies of teaching events involving students with disabilities in mathematics classrooms as well as activities that guide users in their interaction with the case materials.  Each module focuses on one of the five NCTM content standards (number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, data analysis and probability), integrates one or more of the five process standards (problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections and representation) and highlights key issues that need to be addressed in broadening the preparation of teachers of students with a variety of disabilities.  By focusing on individual differences, this project will highlight aspects of teaching standards-based mathematics curriculum for all students. \r\n\r\nThis project will have an impact on participating teacher educators and teachers, helping them to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes to more effectively support students with varying needs and strengths.  The publication and dissemination of the professional development materials will benefit teachers and teacher educators nationwide.  As a result of improved classroom practices this project hopes to impact a larger number of students, including students with disabilities, so that they will achieve standards-based learning outcomes in mathematics.  This project will also make important contributions to the knowledge base about how to effectively prepare teachers to support students with different abilities and disabilities in a standards-based curriculum.\r\n",
