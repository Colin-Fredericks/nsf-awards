 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cabrillo College's  Watsonville Digital Bridge Academy is providing information technology training and ancillary services to students aged 17 to 25 who do not view themselves as candidates for college or who are under-prepared for community college level study: minority, reentry and other at-risk students.  In a partnership between community agencies, national corporations with nearby major facilities and the college, the Academy offers a carefully sequenced bridge program that incorporates academic, work experience and wrap-around support services. The intent is to seamlessly transit students into Cabrillo College's 18-24 month IT technician career programs, support their completion of training, and track their progress into IT jobs or further higher education. The program aids young adults in developing a strengthened sense of self,  an awareness of their intellectual abilities, and  a strong sense of responsibility for their futures.  It does this with an immersion style foundation course using proven training models from corporate settings.  In addition to accelerated basic skills remediation, academic challenges and work experience, services such as childcare, financial aid, legal advice, housing, transportation, and counseling are available.  This project is model for community colleges to create a well-trained workforce in any technical area by engaging existing local resources.",
