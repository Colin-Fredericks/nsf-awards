 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sara Wadia-Fascetti is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at Northeastern University, and has served as a mentor to undergraduate and graduate female and male engineering students since 1994.  She developed the e-mentoring program to give students a mechanism for communication with their mentors and mentees between meetings.  The program links female pre-college students, college students, and professionals in discussion groups with two to five additional women.  Professional women are recruited from the college of Engineering alumni as well as local companies.\r\n\r\nDr. Wadia-Fascetti has also created a program, Connections, that offers weekly after-school activities for Boston girls, including a computer clubhouse for middle- and high-school girls to work alongside college women, an \"introduction to college\" series for female high-school students so they learn how the higher education system works, and a number of other programs for college women.\r\n",
