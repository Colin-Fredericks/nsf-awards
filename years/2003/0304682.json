 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific Impact:\r\nThis NIRT proposal focuses on an exciting new materials system: self-assembled epitaxial silicide nanowires (NWs). These structures have many potential applications, including: low-resistance interconnects; non-linear circuit elements; nano-electrodes for an \"on-chip molecular switch\"; and chemical sensors. The scientific objectives are to: understand and control the self-assembly process; control the placement of NWs at desired locations; identify novel transport properties specific to NWs; attach/grow molecules at the junctions between NWs. Complementary experimental tools to be used include: scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), transmission electron microscopy (UHV-TEM) and surface X-ray diffraction. Experimental work will be closely coupled with first-principles calculations to help understand the electronic, transport and material properties of the NWs.\r\nAchieving these goals would constitute a fundamental advance in silicon nano-fabrication and circuit functionality. The project involves exploratory interdisciplinary work that combines clean-room fabrication methods with UHV-based crystal growth and surface chemistry on nanoscale patterned structures. Demonstration of self-assembling metallic nano-electrodes and interconnects would comprise a fundamental enabling technology for a variety of research applications with silicon-based nanoscale devices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\tAn important goal of this project is the integration of research, education, and industrial outlook. Collaboration with an industrial partner, IBM, will assure that the research program reflects contemporary issues in silicon nano-technology, and, at the same time, allow high-risk, long term exploratory projects originating at the university. Graduate students will learn interdisciplinary teamwork at the boundary between the host departments of physics, electrical engineering and materials science. Some will be directly involved in collaborations with Motorola, IBM and Brookhaven National Lab, and they will gain the experience of working in industrial setting. Undergraduates will participate through REU or individual sponsors. Structural characterization on the nanoscale has a strongly visual component that lends itself to public outreach. This will be coordinated through a research experience for teachers (RET) program, a mobile \"Patterns in Nature\" van, and a web-based visualization program, with self-guided modules.\r\n",
