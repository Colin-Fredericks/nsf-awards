 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the field of catalysis in part due to its important role in the economically and ecologically sound production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Research in the field of catalysis is typically divided into two areas, namely homogenous and heterogeneous.  While the former offers the unique advantage of well-defined catalytic sites that can systematically be optimized, the latter is of great industrial importance due to the inherent retention of the catalysts, which facilitates product separation.  In recent years, functional polymers carrying catalytically active sites have emerged that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.  In particular, polymeric macromolecules with a highly branched, globular architectures, such as dendrimers, have shown promise for application as true nanoscale \"molecular reactors\" to affect specific chemical tranformations withing a well-controlled environment.                                                                                                                  A research program utilizing dendritic and other highly branched polymer architectures for the design of new catalyst systems is proposed.  In each instance, a reactive functionality with catalytic activity is placed at the core or the interior of a globular dendritic structure so that the unique properties offered by dendritic encapsulation may be fully realized.  Dendritic encapsulation, can afford several advantages such as: (i) reactive species essential for catalysis are isolated from each other preventing mutal deactivation; (ii) the reactivity of the catalytic site can be tuned, either directly at the catalytic site, or via its surrounding microenvironment; (iii) the catalyst solubility can be altered by peripheral modification; (iv) the microenviroment of the catalytic site my provide not only enhanced activity but also additional functions such as transport of substrate and product; (v) the potential for positive cooperative interactions between multiple catalytically active subunits.  Such properties, resulting from dendritic encapsulation, are frequently found in natural enzymatic systems and are employed to high efficacy, but they generally cannot be incorporated simultaneouly in classical artificial homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts.                                The knowldege to be gelaned from the proposed investigations will have two-fold importance, both to further increase our understanding of the fundamental principles regarding catalysis with a specialized and somewhat unusual class of synthetic polymers and to uncover leads for development of superior, fully synthetic, catalysts that rival naturally occurring enzymes.  This impact of this research will be felt not only on the production of chemical and pharmaceutical products but also in our environment as better, more effective, ecologically friendly, and recyclable catalysts will be discovered.  In one possible implementation, a series of dendrimer catalysts may be used to carry out multistep tranformations in a single medium in much the same way as several enzymes carry out complex tranformations in succession within the same overall environment.",
