 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compilation of a new lithotectonic map of the Appalachian Orogen, sponsored largely through NSF-EAR, is nearly complete. The new map incorporates more than 20 years of new data and ideas that were generated mainly in response to the publication of the original Tectonic Lithofacies map of the orogen in 1978. The original map has had a lasting impact on the tectonics community, both from the standpoints of regional conceptualization and application. The new map has similar, if not greater, promise; not only will the new map give a significant facelift to the dated original, it will also incorporate modern technological advances in geographic information systems (GIS). Thus, the new map adds an entirely new dimension to the Appalachians and will surpass the capabilities of the original map by allowing for i. construction of new theme maps, ii. Addition of new databases, and iii. ease in updating the lithotectonic base. A substantial portion of the production costs of the map is being shouldered by a collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada; however, they cannot support the entire financial burden of map production. Herein, we request funds mainly for printing of the hard copies of the new map.",
