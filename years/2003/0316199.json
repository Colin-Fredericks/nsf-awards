 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the development of new chiral methods for epoxide production.  Oxodipoxomolybdenum trialkyl\\(aryl)\\phosphine oxide complexes will be used to oxidize alkene and indole substrates. Both biphasic and homogeneous solvent systems will be employed and a number of chiral phosphine oxide ligands will be synthesized and tested for the ability to promote catalytic, chiral oxidation when used in concert with oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide and bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide.\r\n\r\nWith this Minority Career Advancement Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Leslie S. Jimenez in the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.  Professor Jimenez will focus her work on developing methodology for the preparation of epoxides, three-member rings containing two carbons and one oxygen.  The project provides an excellent venue for the training of both undergraduates and graduate students and the results of the research could have impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  \r\n",
