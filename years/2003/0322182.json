This workshop will take the participants through the proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing their proposals. This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and research justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget, format and narrative requirements. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be a one day  event, facilitated by experienced individuals.  The workshop is open to all potential PIs.  PIs who have not had previous experience writing a proposal and PIs from institutions underrepresented in the advanced networking environment are particularly encouraged to attend.  \r\n",
