 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the chemistry and reaction conditions necessary to synthesize the conducting polymer polythiophene with a high degree of end-group control and in a cost-effective manner.  An understanding of this chemistry is vital for the commercialization of novel single-molecule integrated conductive plastics with useful mechanical properties.  The project is designed to investigate the synthesis of these materials, determine the reaction equilibrium between two regioisomers of the thiophene monomer which directly affect the ability of the resulting polymer to conduct electricity, determine the end-group capping of the polythiophenes by other reagents in the system, and determine the typical end-group composition of polymers synthesized by the method under investigation.  The results of the project will lead directly toward a phase II project which will be focused on using the knowledge gained in this study to engineer novel block copolymers of polythiophene with other types of plastics. \r\n \r\nThese new materials will revolutionize the conductive plastics industry by providing low-cost conductive materials in large quantities for electronic, conductive, anti-static/ESD and anti-corrosive applications.  In primary and secondary market research, demand is seen for this type of material for broad technological applications such as coatings, thermoplastics, rubbers, and fibers in a variety of industries, such as electronics, automotive, shipping, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. \r\n\r\n",
