 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mangel\r\n     The study of disease using mathematical models has a long\r\nand rich history.  Much interesting and new mathematics has been\r\nmotivated by disease, because the problems are inherently\r\nnonlinear and multidimensional.  On the other hand, the emergence\r\nof new diseases, the re-emergence of older diseases, and the\r\npotential of bioterrorism require that the mathematics be not\r\nonly interesting and new, but applied and applicable.  In most\r\ncases of disease outbreak or emergence, learning about the\r\nparameters of the disease will occur as it progresses.  Thus, the\r\nquestions sit at the intersection of the biology of disease,\r\nmodeling, and analysis of data.  In this project, the PI\r\nnvestigator seeks to apply the process of ecological detection,\r\nin which different models compete as explanations of process and\r\nthe data arbitrate the outcome of this competittion, to emerging\r\nor re-emerging disease.  The mathematical theory of disease leads\r\nto fundamental characterizations such as the basic reproductive\r\nrate of the disease, the critical number of susceptibles for\r\ninfectives to initially spread, and the number of infectives in\r\nthe population at the time that the first infection/death is\r\ndiscovered.  These in turn depend on fundamental population\r\nparameters, and those are the focus of the proposed work.  Methods\r\nare developed so that, as a disease progresses, one can learn\r\nabout the transmission coefficient of the disease, the\r\ndistribution of susceptibles, the level of aggregation in\r\nencounters between susceptibles and infecteds, and the level of\r\ndetail needed in the models, for purposes of both understanding\r\nand prediction.  These methods are based on analysis of\r\nappropriate differential equations, computer simulation,\r\nstochastic dynamic programming and Bayesian statistical updating.\r\nFurthermore, real populations exist in networks, rather than as\r\nrandomly mixing individuals, about which two kinds of questions\r\ncan be asked.  First, given a specific model for the transmission\r\nof disease, what kind of network is created and what are the\r\nproperties of that network?  Second, given a network of social\r\ninteractions, what can be said about the dynamics of the disease\r\non this network?  Both sets of questions are investigated.\r\n     The proposed work provides new conceptual and operational\r\ntools in dealing with emerging and re-emerging diseases such as\r\nHIV/AIDS, epidemic behavior of hepatitis C, the outbreak of\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease and BSE in the UK, the potential of\r\nsmallpox as a bioterrorist agent, and malaria.  The project also\r\nprovides training to the next generation of applied\r\nmathematicians and mathematical biologists, who -- more than any\r\ngeneration before them -- are keen to solve practical problems in\r\nthe real world.  It thus represents science in the national\r\ninterest at two different levels.\r\n\r\n",
