This research will initiate our comprehensive efforts to establish the importance of riboswitches to metabolic control in Bacillus subtilis, which is a model organism for gram positive bacteria. Specifically, the scope of riboswitch-based genetic control networks that maintain metabolic stasis is being determined. Furthermore, whether riboswitches are indispensable regulatory components is being determined.  It is possible that riboswitches are the most fundamental of genetic control elements in certain bacteria, which, if true, would prove that structured RNA molecules have the capability to control information access in sophisticated genetic networks. \r\nIt is expected that the basic understanding of riboswitch regulatory networks will establish a foundation upon which several important issues may be addressed. It is hypothesized that riboswitches are an ancient form of genetic control, and this speculation can be supported if riboswitches are deeply involved in fundamental and indispensable metabolic regulation. This potential for complex molecular sensing/switching could be harnessed through engineering novel switches for biosensor and molecular computing applications. Most significantly, riboswitches could make excellent targets for novel antibiotic development, wherein metabolite analogs could be used to selectively down-regulate the metabolism of pathogenic or\r\n",
