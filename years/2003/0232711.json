 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will test the viability of a desktop computer-based basin simulator that is networked to distribute database management, simulation, and visualization. The basin simulator has been in development since the mid-1980's and presently exists as a research tool.  The focus of this project is to bring recent developments in operating systems, programming languages, desktop computers, and client/server database management systems into the program to make it accessible to  industry and academia.  The software will be a computationally intensive, networked program.  Off-the-shelf technology and hardware will allow the cost of the program development and maintenance to be competitive in the market.\r\n\r\nSuccess of this project will further advance geological sciences to include more fundamental physical and chemical concepts, and to promote multi-disciplinary industry and academic collaborations for developing even more advanced basin simulators.\r\n",
