New Mexico EPSCoR is providing an opportunity for researchers, faculty, and students from EPSCoR jurisdictions to establish collaborations with the labs in state-of-the-art science and technology. The conference, to be held in early June, focuses on the following questions:  What are the laboratory, university, and national needs for research, talent, and strategic collaborations?  How does one meet those needs by increasing the diversity and quality of university/lab/state collaborations?  What are the successful methods of developing and maintaining university/lab collaborations?  A formal evaluation of the conference will provide both immediate feedback and a follow-up phase to explore the nature of lab contacts and any linkages to the work of the conference.",
