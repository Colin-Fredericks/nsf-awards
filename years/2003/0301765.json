 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2003.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training.  These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"The molecular and behavioral program in the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, a eukaryotic microbe.\"  Centric diatoms are an important group of planktonic photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms that alternate between a diploid asexually reproducing phase and an obligate sexual phase. Despite the importance of the sexual phase in many aspects of centric diatom biology and ecology, very little is known about the regulation of the sexual phase or where and how it occurs in nature.  This study targets specific genes identified in the annotated diatom genome and uses quantitative RT-PCR to look at how the expression of these marker genes correlates with physiological changes -- such as changes in buoyancy and the onset of sperm motility -- during induction into and progression through the sexual phase.\r\n",
