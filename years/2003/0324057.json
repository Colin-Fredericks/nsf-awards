 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brevard Community College (BCC) in Brevard County, Florida, is providing 112 NSF- scholarships over four years in the fields of Aerospace Technology, Drafting and Design Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology, Manufacturing Technology, Networking Services Technology, Computer Programming and Analysis, Internet Services Technology - E-commerce Infrastructure, Computer Engineering Technology and Mathematics.  The project goal of increasing the number of academically talented and financially needy students graduating in CSEMS fields is being met through increasing the graduation rates for scholarship students receiving A.S. and A.A. degrees and increasing the numbers who transfer to four-year institutions.  BCC provides academic and personal support to scholarship recipients through formalized mentoring and advising; transfer assistance and career counseling; internship opportunities supported in part through the Brevard Manufacturing and Technology Association; recruitment and crisis intervention through Brevard County chapters of the United Way and the NAACP; and a CSEMS Cohort Seminar Series.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in expanding the trained technical workforce in the Brevard County, FL region. The broader impacts are in its efforts to diversify graduating cohorts through its partnering efforts.",
