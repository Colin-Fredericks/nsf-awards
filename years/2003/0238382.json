 "awd_abstract_narration": "Layering has long been a basic architectural principal in communication \r\nnetworks. Recently, however, there has been much interest in exploring \r\nvarious techniques that allow for a stronger coupling across traditional \r\nlayer boundaries, in particular between the physical layer and higher \r\nnetwork layers in wireless networks. At the physical layer, the fundamental \r\nperformance trade-offs as given by information theory are, in many cases, \r\nwell understood. When higher layer objectives, such as delay, enter the \r\npicture, there is much less fundamental understanding.\r\n\r\nThis research is addressing several key problems in cross-layer resource \r\nallocation in wireless networks. In these problems, physical layer \"radio \r\nresources\" are dynamically allocated over time and between users in order \r\nto satisfy both network layer and physical layer performance requirements. \r\nIdeas from information theory and communication theory are used for \r\nmodeling the physical communication channels. Queueing theoretic models are \r\nused for incorporating network-level quality of service issues.  The \r\nemphasis of this effort is to improve understanding of the basic \r\narchitectural trade-offs and fundamental performance limitations in these \r\nsettings. \r\n",
