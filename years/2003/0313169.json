 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations of Computational Optimization in Brachytherapy Cancer\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nThis project brings together researchers in computational optimization \r\nand medicine to address the fundamental problem of treatment planning for \r\nbrachytherapy treatment of cancer. The project involves four avenues of \r\ninvestigation: 1) Design of realistic and practical mathematical models \r\nbased on mixed integer programming (MIP) technology to describe the \r\nphysical planning of brachytherapy, which involves the determination of an\r\n``optimal'' configuration of radioactive sources to be implanted in/near \r\nthe tumor. 2) Theoretical investigation of the underlying polyhedral \r\nstructure of the MIP models via the construction of conflict hypergraphs. \r\nAssociated polyhedral implications will be exploited to develop and \r\nimplement separation algorithms to assist in the solution process.   \r\n3)  Develop new computational tools aimed at solving the difficult \r\ndense MIP instances from this class of problems, as well as from other \r\napplications. Computational approaches include matrix reduction\r\ntechniques, penalty branching strategies, aggregate branching which \r\nfocuses on reduced-cost and multiple branches with sets of variables instead \r\nof variable dichotomy, and generation of strong cutting planes from \r\nhypergraphic structures. 4) Integration of the mathematical models and \r\ncomputational engine into an expert planning system for use in the \r\noperating room.\r\n\r\nThe success of the research will lead to important theoretical results \r\nrelated to integer programming through the hypergrahic constructs; \r\nit will lead to computational advances for solving dense MIP instances, \r\na characteristic rather different from most industrial applications, \r\nbut arising commonly in medical diagnosis and treatment planning problems; \r\nand it will improve the ability to treat patients in the best possible\r\nway. Furthermore, the resulting treatment planning system will serve as a \r\nresearch tool to push the frontier of understanding for brachytherapy \r\ntreatment, opening up the possibility of conducting clinical\r\ninvestigations which require unbiased plans to be produced within a \r\nshort time frame.\r\n\r\nEducational outreach involves developing teaching materials related\r\nto the project for undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and \r\nin the medical domain. It also involves training of 2 Ph.D. students in\r\nthis multidisciplinary research involving optimization, algorithmic design \r\nand cancer treatment.  The Ph.D. research will focus on theoretical and \r\ncomputational optimization, and in particular, on issues related to the \r\nproject herein. Undergraduates and minorities will be involved in the \r\nresearch experience through undergraduate courses and regular premed and \r\nminority student mentoring. Part of the research project will also be \r\ndisseminated in the lectures on information and biotechnology in the \r\ncourse ``Cancer Biology and Biotechnology'', developed recently by a group \r\nof interdisciplinary faculty researchers at Georgia Tech with a focus on \r\nmulti-faceted approaches for advancing cancer technology. Mention of this \r\nnew educational effort highlighting applications of engineering technology \r\nin medical/oncological research will be included in possible panel\r\ndiscussions and in the recruitment of high school students.",
