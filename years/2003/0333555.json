 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project teams up North Carolina State University and the American Association of Physics Teachers in the creation of a digital library serving the physics education research (PER) community as well as teachers wanting to use innovative, research-based instructional methods. The goal of this Collections project is to provide a virtual clearinghouse where researchers and teachers can easily find the very latest work in physics education along with the best of what has been learned from previous research.   \r\n \r\nThe efforts of this project include a) creation of a website archiving much of the existing PER literature; b) establishing a free electronic journal to facilitate the sharing of new findings in PER; c) collecting an annotated bibliography/database of PER articles from a variety of existing sources; d) providing detailed descriptions of PER-based curricula, along with links to the developers' sites; and e) assembling additional materials of use to the PER and teaching communities, including conference proceedings, syllabi from relevant courses, spreadsheets and web-based tools for statistical analysis, reviews of qualitative analysis equipment and software, links to existing discussion lists of researchers and teachers (PhysLrnr, Phys-L, plus archives), along with connections to a world-wide collection of research groups and individuals.  The centerpiece of this effort is the creation of an electronic journal to support peer-reviewed electronic publication of PER research.  A successful electronic journal will have enormous impact on the community, providing a much-needed avenue for scholarly research output that will be available freely to anyone with Internet access.  A business plan is in place to sustain the effort after the conclusion of NSF support and the project has been endorsed by the editors of the American Journal of Physics (currently the main publication for researchers in the field).  The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) is providing significant co-funding of this project in recognition of the importance of physics education research to the mission of MPS.\r\n",
