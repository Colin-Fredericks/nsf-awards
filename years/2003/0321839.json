Chen\r\nUniversity of Rochester\r\n\r\n\"Workshop on Fundamental Research Needs In Photonic Materials Synthesis and Processing at the Interface, to be held in Rochester, NY on April 28 - 30, 2003.\"\r\n\r\nA Workshop on Fundamental Research Needs in Photonic Materials Synthesis and Processing at the Interface is to be held at the University of Rochester, 28-30 April 2003. Three materials classes will be featured: polymers, molecular materials, and nano-materials. Leading experts from Europe, Japan, and the United States will gather to provide an overview of selected fields of specialization. Fertile ground for future research and development will be identified by three break-out sessions following the invited talks. Approximately, 21 participants will be invited.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: A wide spectrum of high-technology industries, such as communication, sensing, information display and storage, and health care, will benefit from long-term fundamental research in photonic materials synthesis and processing.  Also, interdisciplinary collaborative research would be emphasized. This will be the first workshop on photonic materials from the chemical engineering perspective with an aim to cultivating collaborative research opportunities with allied fields such as chemistry, physics, materials science, and electrical engineering and computer science.\r\n",
