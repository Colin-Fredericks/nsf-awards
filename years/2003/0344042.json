 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years the agility of radio systems, in all their aspects, has significantly\r\nincreased.  In today's world antennas are controllable; there are several options for\r\ncompression, encryption, and error control; spread-spectrum (among other techniques) is\r\navailable to reduce the radio frequency power spectral density; there are elaborate multi-dimensional modulation techniques; and there is interference reduction using multiple\r\nuser detection and other techniques. New radio architectures that exploit many of these\r\ntechniques are proposed It is clear that to achieve maximum utilization of radio\r\ncapabilities, innovative networks will be involved.\r\n\r\nThe University of Kansas proposes to continue to support the National Science\r\nFoundation in developing a comprehensive research program in innovative and advanced\r\nwireless networking systems. This project proposes to extend our initial work in eliciting\r\nresearch problems through the NSF/FCC Workshop on the Future of Spectrum:\r\nTechnologies and Policies to (1) a workshop addressing the issues of radio technology\r\nand network protocols and (2) a Principal Investigator Meeting involving the leading\r\nresearchers contributing to NSF wireless networking programs.\r\n",
