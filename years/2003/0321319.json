Instruments supported here include (1) a portable, battery-powered conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument with a water sampling carousel and bottles, plus ancillary PAR (photosynthetic available radiation), fluorometer, dissolved oxygen and transmissometer sensors and (2) a multiple opening-closing net system for sampling individual layers of the water column  The instruments will be used in a variety of projects, mostly in Glacier Bay, Alaska, to study planktonic communities and their relationships to physical, chemical and biological properties in the coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Alaska.  They will enable research projects involving young faculty and students at this predominantly-undergraduate campus, and they will be used to attract students, especially members of underrepresented groups, into marine science careers via field courses and the campus' Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.  The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. \r\n***\r\n",
