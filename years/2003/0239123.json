 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop new annulation reactions for use in the asymmetric construction of complex molecules of pharmaceutical interest.  The central theme of the approach is the use of Pd(IV) in conjunction with optically active phosphine ligands.  The resulting enantiomerically enriched palladacycles will be functionalized to produce synthetically useful intermediates.  The focus of the educational effort will be the development of lecture and laboratory courses in organometallic chemistry.  Dr. Malinakova will introduce techniques for the manipulation of air-sensitive materials into the undergraduate laboratory in a research-like environment.  \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Helena H. Malinakova.  Professor Malinakova will focus her work on the use of palladium in order to produce new carbon-carbon bonds.  The new methods being developed will permit the conversion of inexpensive starting materials into valuable pharmaceutical intermediates in the laboratory, and are expected to have an impact on the way in which pharmaceutical companies manufacture drugs.  The educational activities of the award will include the introduction of some of these methods into the undergraduate laboratory.  \r\n",
