 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant for departmental reform at Wright State University focuses on developing a National Model for Engineering Mathematics Education.  The project seeks to re-define the way engineering mathematics is taught, with the goal of increasing student retention, motivation and success in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution strategy starts with the development of a freshman-level engineering\r\nmathematics course (EGR 101). Taught by engineering faculty, the course will include lecture, laboratory and recitation components. Using an application-oriented, hands-on approach, the proposed course will address only the salient math topics actually used in a variety of core engineering courses. These include the traditional physics, engineering mechanics, electric circuits and computer programming sequences. While the above core courses are traditionally reserved for the sophomore and junior years, this project will move them earlier in the curriculum, with EGR 101 as the only math pre-requisite. It is finally proposed to develop a new Engineering Calculus sequence to be taught by the math department later in the curriculum, in concert with college and ABET requirements.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed pedagogical research lies in its novel approach to\r\nengineering mathematics education, to be implemented by an interdisciplinary team of award-winning educators. In particular, a hands-on, application-oriented approach is generally lacking in engineering mathematics education. Moreover, by removing traditional math pre-requisite requirements and moving core-engineering courses earlier in the program, the approach will entail a significant restructuring of the engineering curriculum. The result will shift the traditional emphasis on math pre-requisite requirements to an emphasis on engineering motivation for math, with a \"just-in-time\" structuring of the new math sequence. The proposed research team includes award-winning teachers and innovators in curriculum development representing each of the four College of Engineering & Computer Science departments, as well as the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe hands-on laboratory component of EGR 101 will provide an opportunity to infuse modern scientific tools and research methods into the undergraduate curriculum at the freshman level. More importantly, the proposed restructuring of the engineering curriculum will allow student\r\nexposure to engineering research activities prior to the completion of the traditional math sequence. This will provide students with an opportunity to get \"hooked\" on the excitement of research and discovery in engineering, regardless of whether they have successfully advanced through the traditional mathematics sequence. Low retention is of particular concern for members of traditionally underrepresented groups. As such, the introduction of EGR 101 and the restructuring of the engineering curriculum will have the greatest effect on retention rates for women, minorities, and other traditionally high-risk students.\r\n",
