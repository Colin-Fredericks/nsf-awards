 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0308040\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Almut Burchard\r\n\r\nTwo sets of problems are proposed, one related with elastic\r\ncurves, and the other with rearrangement inequalities.  The first\r\nset of problems concerns the dynamics of an elastic curve moving\r\nin three-dimensional space, under forces determined by its\r\ncurvature and subject to the constraint that it is inextensible.\r\nThe main question is whether solutions starting from sufficiently\r\nsmooth initial data exist for all time, or whether they may\r\nbecome singular in finite time.  For the long-time evolution of\r\nan infinite curve, solitary waves are expected to play an\r\nimportant role.  The boundary value problem for the tension will\r\nbe studied in detail, with the goal of obtaining sharp bounds for\r\nthe tension in terms of the position and velocity of the curve.\r\nIn the second set of problems, the PI proposes to settle a\r\nconjectured quantitative version of the classical rearrangement\r\ninequality for the Coulomb energy. Furthermore, the cases of\r\nequality in the Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger inequality for multiple\r\nintegrals will be investigated.  In addition, the PI participates\r\nin two interdisciplinary collaborations, on Statistical Network\r\nCalculus and its applications to data traffic (with colleagues\r\nfrom Computer Science and Systems Engineering), and on the\r\nclustering of proteins on membranes within polarized cells (with\r\ncolleagues from Biology).\r\n\r\nThe elastic curve equations described above provide a simple\r\nexample of a class of nonlinear wave equations with geometric\r\nforces and geometric constraints. The analytic difficulties\r\nencountered in this problem, and the techniques used to overcome\r\nthem, are expected to be relevant for more complex mechanical\r\nsystems with geometric forces.  While the work is geometrically\r\nmotivated, the dynamics of elastic wires are clearly relevant to\r\nstructural questions in Mechanical Engineering.  The basic\r\nwell-posedness questions addressed here could have implications\r\nfor the convergence of numerical solution schemes.  Rearrangement\r\ninequalities are among the few geometric tools for minimizing\r\nnonlinear, non-convex functionals.  The proposed work strives to\r\nsharpen those tools and extend their applicability.  Implications\r\ninclude the stability of symmetric galaxy configurations and\r\nother dynamical stability problems.  A notable contribution of\r\nthe applied collaborations is that they expose researchers in\r\nBiology and Engineering to the everyday use of simple, but\r\nrigorous Mathematics.  The Network Calculus results center on\r\nquestions of admission control and service guarantees in large\r\ndata networks.  The biological work has implication for the\r\nmechanics of protein sorting, which is crucial to the function of\r\nthe cell at a basic level.\r\n",
