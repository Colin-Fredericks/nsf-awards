They will investigate the genetics and chemical ecology of social insects, in particular, Reticulitermes  termites.  This species plays an important role in decomposition of cellulose in natural ecosystems.  They are serious structural pests throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including France and the United States.  The investigators address two important aspects:  colony social organization and taxonomy.  They will use molecular genetic markers and analytical chemical techniques to investigate colonies and population of R. santonensis, a subterranean termite found in France.  Comparisons to R. flavipes and general utility of chemical characters will also be studied.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration the technique of molecular marker genotyping using microsatellite loci.  This is complemented by the French investigator's research on chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons and soldier defensive secretions in social insects.  The collaboration will advance understanding of how colonies and populations of these social insects are organized and the extent to which differences in biochemical signatures among colonies reflect genetic variation.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US investigator, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student.  The CNRS will support visits to US of the French participants. \r\n",
