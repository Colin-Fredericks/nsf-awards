 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support that enables graduate students\r\nandpostdoctoral fellows to participate in the Seventeenth\r\nInternational Conference of Few-Body Problems in Physics.  The\r\nconference is sanctioned by the International Union of Pure and\r\nApplied Physicists (IUPAP).  It is the most highly attended meeting\r\nof experts in the area of few-body physics, averaging about 250\r\nphysicists in the last three meetings. Theintellectual scope of the\r\nconference covers topics on quantum few-body problems at all\r\ndistance scales, ranging from subnucleonic to molecular systems. \r\nTraditionally, this conference has served as a catalyst in the\r\nformation of international collaborations that have addressed some\r\nof the most challenging problems in the field.  Giving young\r\nscholars the opportunity to engage in these exchanges is a\r\nsignificant investment in the future of the field.  An important\r\noutcome of the conference is the setting of short-term goals for the\r\nfield.  The proceeding of the conference will be published in the\r\nNuclear Physics A journal and will be available to the broader\r\nresearch community.\r\n",
