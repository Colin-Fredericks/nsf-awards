 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a super broadband, 1.27~1.61 micron, Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE)  light source for spectral test instrumentation.  This innovation has significant market potential. Spectral measurement is necessary for all components used in the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical communication systems, in particular, for next-generation WDM networking systems using the newest optical fiber: zero-water-peak fiber, which eliminated the water absorption peak at 1.4 micron  and extended the low-loss transmission window to 1.27~1.61 micron continuously for the first time. This innovation would offer a solution for the need of a super broadband gain medium that traditional gain media such as fiber lasers and diode lasers cannot offer.  This innovation has significant intellectual merit. A disruptive technology would be used in this project. The device module would be composed of a specialty crystal fiber with designed single-mode confinement structure, directly pumped by diode laser. The overall package would be compact with its output power coupled into a standard single-mode fiber at a target of 100 mW. The novel transition and linkage between conventional bulk-crystal optics and contemporary fiber optics would inspire many publications and patents. \r\n\r\nThis project would strengthen the U. S. technology leadership in WDM and would have a multiplier effect to the overall optical-telecommunications industry. Moreover, this innovation would establish a technology platform for a series of super broadband amplification products, which would be among the key components enabling the next-generation optical communications using super broadband zero-water-peak fiber. \r\n\r\n",
