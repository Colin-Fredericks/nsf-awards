During development, this technique will flag\r\ninconsistencies as soon as they arise, helping the developer to\r\nlocalize the error by eliminating the continued execution (and the\r\nassociated inconsistency propagation) that obscures the source of the\r\nerror. After deployment, the technique will alert users to\r\ninconsistencies as soon as they arise, eliminating the problem of\r\nincorrect actions taken because of reliance on incorrect output from a\r\nprogram operating with inconsistent values or data structures. Key\r\nresearch issues include the design and efficient implementation of the\r\nspecification and model construction languages and the evaluation of\r\nhow well this approach works for two purposes: 1) in the context of an\r\nexisting system, to check key data structure consistency properties,\r\nto promote design extraction, and to ensure that the design remains up\r\nto date as the software is maintained, and 2) in the context of new\r\ndevelopment, to promote design development, support error\r\nlocalization, and facilitate debugging.  The potential benefits of\r\nthis research include reduced software development effort, more reliable\r\nsoftware, and safer software. The research will be performed using\r\nthe CTAS software system in the NASA testbed and the TSAFE software\r\nsystem currently under design at NASA.\r\n",
