 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support an international conference dedicated to the phenomenon of spontaneous coherence in excitonic systems.  This topic has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a subject of fundamental interest in solid-state optics, semiconductor nanostructures, and condensed matter theory.  The four-day conference, entitled the First International Conference on Spontaneous Coherence in Excitonic Systems (ICSCE), will be held at the Seven Springs Mountain Resort in Champion, Pennsylvania, from May 25-28, 2004.  This conference will allow experts in this field to network across several subfields of physics, optical science, and engineering.  Support from the NSF will provide an opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to participate by attending lectures, presenting posters, and discussing their research with some of the leading international experts in the field.",
