 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Sensor proposal focuses on transparent fused-silica microspheres, which support\r\nwhispering-gallery modes (WGMs)- light trapped by total internal reflection and orbiting just\r\nbeneath the surface. These modes, excited by optical tunneling from an adjacent tapered fiber,\r\nhave an evanescent component outside the surface and a very sharp frequency resonance (high\r\nQ). The mode amplitude and resonant frequency can be very sensitive to changes in the\r\nmicroresonator's environment, and thus enable sensing of, for example: strain, acceleration,\r\nthermal effects, trace gases, chemicals, and modifications of the surface.\r\nThis project will: further develop and advance previously-demonstrated methods of\r\nWGM evanescent-wave sensing of trace gases in the atmosphere and chemicals in solution;\r\nextend earlier applications of WGM microsensors, in measuring thermal and absorptive\r\nproperties, to the characterization of transparent thin films; pursue novel techniques that enable\r\nthe multiplication of sensitivity enhancements, by combining effects such as modal interference\r\nwith WGM microsensing; and apply to WGM microresonators methods of surface preparation\r\nthat have proved useful in fiber sensors for gases, chemicals, and biological agents. In\r\naccomplishing these objectives, all aspects of the project will benefit from: improving control\r\nand coupling techniques, utilizing various redundant measurements to characterize WGMs,\r\nstudying the effects of changing system configurations, and expanding the numerical modeling\r\nof the microsensors. Specific parts of the project will involve: implementing wavelength-modulation\r\nspectroscopy with the WGM locked to resonance with a frequency-scanning laser,\r\nand ruggedizing the sensor by attaching the coupler(s); measuring the thermal accommodation\r\ncoefficient and optical absorption coefficient of a thin film coating the microresonator; using\r\ncavity ringdown of the scattered light, and applying controlled multimode-taper coupling to the\r\nWGMs of the microresonator, to amplify its absorption-detection sensitivity; and combining\r\nsurface-enhanced Raman scattering with WGMs by coating the microresonator with a thin film\r\ncontaining gold nanoparticles, as well as using the techniques of surface coating with xerogels or\r\nantibodies for biosensing.\r\nIntellectual Merit: Even a supposedly well-understood system can exhibit novel\r\nbehavior under extreme conditions, or when interacting with another system. The exquisitely\r\nhigh Q of a WGM provides extreme conditions here, and interactions between WGMs and\r\nsurface or coupling effects give a multiplication of sensitivity-enhancement factors.\r\nBroader Impacts: The graduate students involved will be learning fundamental physics\r\nas well as becoming grounded in real-world applications; they will also be directly involved in\r\ndissemination of results through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal\r\npublications. This work will benefit the University's multidisciplinary Photonics degree\r\nprograms and its interdepartmental Center for Sensors and Sensor Technologies. The sensing\r\ntechniques to be developed here have many potential benefits to society, as has already been\r\nrecognized by the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology, NASA's\r\nMarshall Space Flight Center, and Nomadics, Inc., through their support of and collaboration on\r\nrelated work.",
