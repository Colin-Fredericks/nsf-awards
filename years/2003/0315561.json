 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the development and acquisition of instrumentation for research and education in mechanics on the nano-scale at Northwestern University. A major challenge in materials science and engineering is the design and characterization of novel functional materials through atomic and molecular level control. New materials with superior electro-mechanical properties, e.g., ultra-nano-scale crystalline diamond, are ideal candidates for the design of micro and nano-scale electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). These so-called nanostructured materials possess the potential to radically impact major emerging technologies such as nanoelectronics, bio-chips, and lightweight materials. In fact, world market volumes for nanostructured materials are expected to reach billions of dollars by the year 2005. Nonetheless, several main challenges along the path to new commercially viable products still exist, including: synthesis, processing and handling, characterization at the atomic level, and economics. In this project we will develop unique experimental tools that are needed for the electro-mechanical characterization of nanocrystalline materials, carbon nanotubes and nanowires. The device will be used within a transmission electron microscope, an ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, and in conjunction with atomic force microscopy. We fully expect these experiments to identify novel inelastic deformation and electronic conduction mechanisms, which can be used advantageously in the development of novel NEMS. \r\n\r\nThe instrumentation to be developed and acquired will be employed primarily by graduate students, who will contribute to both research and educational components. Since nano-scale mechanical experiments are becoming central to materials engineering education, we will transition main developments of this research to the classroom. Simplified versions of the experimental procedures and developed models will be offered as lab modules in dual level (undergraduate/graduate) classes and new labs will be developed for a new graduate course. Dissemination of teaching and research activities through classes via the Internet, presentations at national and international conferences and workshops, and publication of manuscripts in educational and scientific journals will be pursued\r\n",
