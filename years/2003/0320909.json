 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a collaboration between university and private industry, the P.I. and his team will develop a new compact instrument using quantum cascade lasers capable of measuring carbon monoxide and methane with sufficient robustness, sensitivity, accuracy, response and reliability so as to be suitable for use on research aircraft.  After manufacture and testing with his industry partners the P.I. will deploy the instrument alongside an existing research-grade carbon dioxide instrument to generate a comprehensive airborne package targeting trace gases important to the global carbon cycle.  Such atmospheric data is of unique use to quantify natural and anthropogenic emissions as well as gaining a more informed understanding of some basic yet critical global biogeochemical cycles.  Broader impacts of this project include tools developed that target important and critical research needs within the carbon cycle and climate change communities.  This work may in future lead to a commercially viable instrument that would be available to a broad community.  Support is included for postdoctoral researcher(s) and a graduate student, which will contribute positively to education and professional development of young scientists at a major university.",
