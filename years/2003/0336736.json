A multidisciplinary tissue engineering approach is to be followed using principles from chemical, mechanical, and materials engineering as well as cell and molecular biology. The development of constructs of this sort is expected to have clinical applications in grafting of non-unions, surgical arthrodeses, cranio-facial defects, and prosthetic implants and/or implant coatings.\r\n\r\nThis research project builds on the knowledge produced during a series of research projects directed by the Principal Investigator dating from 1990. This new project seeks to design, develop and optimize three-dimensional matrices for use in bone repair. The first aim is to explore the development of new polymer-ceramic constructs fabricated by direct synthesis and incorporation of amorphous calcium phosphate into microspheres used to form the matrix, as well as optimize physicochemical parameters surrounding these new composite microspheres. In the second aim, the delivery of growth factors will also be studied further, building on the previous work by incorporating proteins and factors into the matrix that may enhance cellular endothelialization and bone growth. Finally, in the third aim, extensive in vivo studies will be performed utilizing the constructs designed from aims 1 and 2, paying careful attention to the mechanical strength of the healing defect and the short- and long-term histology and histomorphometry of the defect site.\r\n\r\nFrom a basic science standpoint, studies under this work have provided and will continue to provide a better understanding of polymer and ceramic chemistry as it relates to cellular response, matrix fabrication, and ultimate matrix performance (both in vitro and in vivo).  \r\n\r\nIn addition to furthering our basic science knowledge, the development of matrices for bone tissue engineering may lead to graft materials for healing bony defects, and thus provide direct benefits to society. As one of only a handful of underrepresented minority principal investigators in bioengineering in America, the Principal Investigator is committed to encouraging the academic growth of younger minority undergraduate and graduate students currently so underrepresented in science.",
