 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on recognizing anomalous system call patterns via finite state machines.  Networked information systems play critical roles in essential infrastructures such as power generation and distribution, transportation, commerce, and national security.  The continuing spate of security incidents from the CERT Coordination Center (the CERT/CC was originally the Computer Emergency Response Team)  demonstrates that existing approaches for securing systems against cyber attacks are not effective.  These approaches are focused almost exclusively on previously exploited vulnerabilities, and offer no protection against attacks that may exploit countless (as-yet-undiscovered) vulnerabilities that continue to exist on the target systems.  Whereas current threats are largely attributed to unskilled hackers (script kiddies), the future holds the threat of rapid escalation of cyber-warfare, cyber-terrorism and cyber-crime.  Attackers in these cases are highly skilled, organized and well funded, and can develop new kinds of attacks very quickly.  Thus there is an urgent need for developing approaches that can protect against unknown attacks launched by highly skilled attackers.  In previous research conducted at SUNY, Stony Brook, the key personnel have developed a new approach for securing systems against unknown attacks. Immunet Security's approach is based on a new algorithm for learning program behaviors using finite-state automata models and detecting attacks as deviations from this model. The approach has been show to be very effective in detecting known as well as unknown attacks and produces significantly fewer false alarms than previous approaches.  This proposal seeks to develop the approach into a commercial intrusion detection system (IDS).  \r\n\r\nThe market for commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is large, running into billions of dollars, and is growing fast.  Given the market for IDS and the heightened national interest in security, this technology offers the possibility of more sensitive detection than currently exists.\r\n",
