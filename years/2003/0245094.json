 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Montana Partnership for Comprehensive Equity  (UM PACE) is an alliance of central administrators, deans, department heads/chairs and faculty has been formed to bring about lasting change in the following:  Institutional policy, the number of tenure-line women on the faculty, the empowerment of  faculty,  and  the creation of  a statewide network of women scientists.  \r\n\r\nEach of these goals will be reached through a coordinated series of activities.  The efficacy of these activities will provide a national level model for change in universities located in small, rural communities. \r\n \r\nPolicy change will result from three major initiatives:  \r\n*  The PI of this proposal will be appointed as Special Assistant to the Provost for Comprehensive Equity.  Provost Lois Muir will oversee and support this project.  \r\n*  A campus-wide policy committee of representatives from all components of our alliance, with legal advice, will tackle hard issues such as spousal hires and adjustments in the tenure clock to develop a consistent and clear policy.  \r\n*  Each science department will undertake a self-evaluation with the assistance of the UM PACE staff.  This evaluation will provide detailed information to be used in development of department-level diversity enhancement plans.  \r\n\r\nThese two committees will also serve an all-important training function as faculty members learn experientially, and through materials provided by the staff, about the place of women in science at UM and nationally. \r\nUM PACE will create three new tenure-line faculty positions to increase the number of tenure-line women scientists at UM.  These positions will be filled opportunistically at the request of departments and deans for new expansion hires that increase the number of women scientists on the UM campus.  In addition, there will be a partnership with expansion programs now in place at UM.  UM PACE will work proactively with recruitment issues through training of faculty and preparation of .best practices. guidelines for recruiting both junior and senior \r\nwomen.  UM PACE will provide information and networking for the partners/spouses of all candidates interviewed for science positions.  Accommodation of spouses is a central issue for UM which is located in a small, rural community.    Increasing the total number of women faculty in the sciences also requires retention.  Faculty will be empowered through a carefully developed mentoring component for women scientists.  A keystone, annual, three-day workshop will cement the gains made through on-campus activities.  Leadership training will be emphasized.  Retention will also be enhanced through training of deans, department heads, and key faculty. \r\n \r\nUM PACE will create a statewide network of women scientists through outreach to Montana.s seven tribal colleges (nearly 1/4 of the nation.s total).  Through visits to tribal colleges, visits of tribal college faculty to UM, involvement in the summer workshop, and internet communication, faculty from these institutions will become involved.  The place of women scientists at UM parallels the place of women at the national level.  The higher education system in Montana is directly comparable to that of 14 other rural states.  In addition, UM can also be compared to public institutions of moderate size located outside of urban centers in more populous states.  Universities in small communities have unique problems in recruiting and retaining diverse faculty. UM PACE will provide a national level model for change in such universities.  \r\n",
