 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ives, Milewski\r\n     The two investigators train a long-term (2-year)\r\ncollaborative group of 4 undergraduates working on a suite of\r\nproblems in mathematical biology.  One of the investigators is a\r\nbiologist, and the other is an applied mathematician, yet both\r\nhave collaborated with researchers from the other discipline.\r\nThe investigators work collaboratively with 4 undergraduates and\r\naddress aspects of at least three problems at the interface of\r\nbiology and mathematics: (1) Why do periodical cicadas have long,\r\nprime-numbered periods?  (2) Why do pineapples, pinecones (and\r\nmany other plants) display patterns with Fibonnaci sequences?\r\nand (3) How does the functioning of ecosystems change as they\r\ncollapse via species extinctions?  These three questions are an\r\nexciting starting point for the collaborative group, and they are\r\nselected to both keep the interest of the students and take life\r\nthrough the collaborative process.\r\n     Although some areas of biology (ecology in particular) have\r\nluminous histories of partnership with mathematics, the current\r\nexplosion of theoretical and technological advances in both\r\nfields has upped the ante for interdisciplinary work.  To work at\r\nthe interface between biology and mathematics, more scientists\r\nneed to be trained in both fields, and trained in how to connect\r\nthe fields.  Recognizing that a single person cannot span the gap\r\nbetween fields effectively, future scientists must also be\r\ntrained to work collaboratively.  Using collaborative learning\r\ngroups for undergraduates fosters interdisciplinary thinking for\r\nthe participating undergraduates and the investigators.  It also\r\nserves as a model for training undergraduates to do research at\r\nthe interface between disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
