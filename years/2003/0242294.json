 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would develop a module in economics for high school students.  The module would be structured as 12 investigations on national economic performance, linked to various sets of economic education standards.  Starting with well publicized economic indicators, such as the Gross Domestic Product or the Consumer Price Index, the module will investigate the meaning of these indicators, then get students to ask questions about the economy which may (or may not) be answered by an examination of these statistics. Materials will be developed to work best with an interactive instructional mode, as students play roles or engage in simulations about the behavior of the economy. \r\n\r\nThe project will be \"teacher-driven:\"  the writing team will consist of three classroom teachers, three economics educators on the university level and an experienced curriculum writer.  The materials will be pilot tested, revised, then field tested and published.\r\n",
