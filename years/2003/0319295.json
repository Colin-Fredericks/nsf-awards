 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing a novel, needleless drug injection system for widespread vaccination applications. The key element in the technology will be a novel high pressure pumping device. This device will enable high pressure flows to be precisely and easily controlled by the user in order to control injection drug amount. This is a capability currently lacking in existing low cost needleless injector technology. The Phase I project will show that the high pressure pumping device actually works. The follow on Phase II effort will focus on building a prototype system that will integrate the pump with the control electronics and injection nozzle for subsequent testing. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of drug delivery. The proposed needleless injection device is expected to be reused thousands of times with a single low voltage battery source and will be invaluable for widespread vaccination use in the field for domestic as well as foreign markets. The unique ability to precisely meter injection volume will enable the device to be easily adjusted in the field to deliver a dosage appropriate for the associated weight, age, or physical condition of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
