 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the directed design of metal-halide framework solids and on  investigating the reaction mechanisms of solid-state reactions.  The mechanistic studies employ a variety of in situ diffraction, spectroscopic, thermal, microscopic and barometric techniques to provide an unprecedented atomistic picture of how templated networks form and how small molecules react with crystalline solids.  These fundamental studies will have broad academic and industrial impact in the areas of catalysis, separations, and crystal growth.  This research is specifically tailored for the effective training of a new generation of scientists in the design of advanced materials.  Students will gain balanced disciplinary expertise and interdisciplinary experience including collaborations with university and national laboratory scientists and hands on experience with national synchrotron and/or neutron source user facilities.\r\n%%%\r\nThe ability to design and tailor materials for specific technologies is advanced by working to  understand  mechanisms of crystal formation and mechanisms by which crystals react with small molecules.  Advances in understanding the mechanism of crystal growth will directly impact the design and fabrication of optical and electronic devices, the fundamental components of information technology.  Understanding the mechanisms by which small molecules react with crystalline solids will advance our ability to design catalysts, membranes for gas separations, and batteries, to critically address national energy needs.  This proposed research is specifically tailored for the effective training of a new generation of scientists in the design of advanced materials.  Students will gain balanced disciplinary expertise and interdisciplinary experience including collaborations with university and national Laboratory scientists and hands on experience with national synchrotron and/or neutron source user facilities.\r\n***",
