 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe proposed research advances the novel design paradigm that polymeric\r\ncomposites can be locally micro-tailored to meet design objectives.  A liquid polymer having randomly suspended micro- or nano-sized inclusions can be cured in the presence of applied electric field to produce solid composite with aligned microstructure.  Locally structured inclusions enable one to (a) reduce stress concentrations at discontinuities, (b) control hygrothermal and residual stresses, and (c) provide self-sensing and smart material capabilities.  The major research objective of this three-year project is to substantiate feasibility of the novel design approach by modifying composite microstructure to reduce stress gradients at discontinuities. A tensile plate perforated with a single hole or multiple holes is chosen as the study example.  Individual research activities include evaluation of process requirements, material testing and predictive modeling for design optimization.  This research will be integrated with the educational missions of University of Wisconsin, Madison which target student and community-at-large. The results will be utilized in various educational and outreach activities and coordinated with the UW-Madison Polymer Engineering and the NSF I/UCRC Centers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
