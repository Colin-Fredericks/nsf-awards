The conference, which has been held twice previously, brings together researchers focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to electronic, magnetic and photonic devices and systems. The requested support will be used to provide travel stipends for students presenting talks at the conference. In addition, support will be provided for undergraduate students involved in nanotechnology programs through summer research experiences and other extracurricular projects. The broader impact of the proposed program includes involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in a technical conference run by a major professional society. In addition to technical exposure, this experience will provide the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers involved in this field.",
