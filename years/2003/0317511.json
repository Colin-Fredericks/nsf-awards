 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chorin and Tokman\r\n     The investigators develop numerical methods that will be\r\neffective in long-time simulations of the multi-scale phenomena\r\nevident in plasma dynamics, particularly in modeling magnetic\r\nreconnection.  They also use the methods in studies of plasma\r\ndynamics in the solar corona and in laboratory experiments.  They\r\nmake available a software implementation of the methods.  The\r\nmethods combine projection techniques with schemes of exponential\r\npropagation type for time-stepping.\r\n     The dynamical behavior seen in astrophysical and laboratory\r\nplasmas is complicated, and to understand it requires computer\r\nsimulations.  But the phenomena of interest span a wide range of\r\nlength and time scales.  Consequently, to compute accurately the\r\nsolutions of the equations that describe these phenomena,\r\nconventional numerical methods require small steps in time over\r\nvery long time periods.  Similarly, accurate spatial resolution of\r\nthe solutions requires fine spatial meshes.  Together, these\r\nfactors require solving very large systems of equations at each\r\ntime step, for a great many time steps.  Such calculations are\r\nexpensive.  The investigators develop and analysze numerical\r\nmethods that promise to reduce the computational costs, and apply\r\nthem to study plasma physics problems.  They make the methods\r\navailable in software.  This widens the potential impact of the\r\nwork, because problems with multiple scales arise in a variety of\r\nscience and engineering applications.\r\n\r\n",
