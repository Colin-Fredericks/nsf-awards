 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)  With involvement of the entire physics department, this project seeks to: (a) improve learning for all students who take algebra- and calculus-based introductory physics courses, 40% of whom are women; (b) contribute to the research base on the learning and teaching of physics through identification of the intellectual and affective states of students before, during, and after instruction; (c) immerse advanced undergraduate students in STEM disciplines and graduate students in the preservice teacher preparation program in a technology-rich, research-driven instructional environment as peer instructors and researchers; (d) provide professional development to the project faculty and advanced students; and (e) expose all faculty in STEM disciplines and Science Education to the results of this project. \r\n\r\nThe primary vehicle for achieving the broad impact sought is the implementation and adaptation of selected units from exemplary instructional materials that have been developed on the basis of physics education research: University of Washington's Tutorials in Introductory Physics, University of Maryland's Activity-based Physics tutorials, and RealTime Physics. The implementation and refinement of Interactive Examples delivered via Tycho, the University of Illinois web-based homework system, assist students to sharpen their quantitative problem solving. Students in one section of the first two quarters of the calculus sequence also participate. \r\n\r\nOngoing research by faculty and students guide every component of this systemic project. Results are disseminated locally and nationally.\r\n",
