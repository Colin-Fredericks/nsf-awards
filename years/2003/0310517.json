 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular nanomagnets and nanoparticles represent the ultimate limit of miniaturization of magnetic memory units. They have also been proposed as candidates for qubits - elements of quantum computers. This project is advancing the knowledge of magnetism at the nanoscale by answering fundamental questions of quantum physics of small magnets and questions about applications of nanomagnets for the information technology of the future. Decoherence of spin states of nanomagnets interacting with a solid matrix is being investigated. The approach is being explored that maps the spin-tunneling problem with dissipation onto the problem of particle localization. Theory of resonant spin tunneling via Landau-Zener effect is being extended to a system of interacting molecular magnets. Spontaneous emission of the electromagnetic radiation by high-spin molecules is being studied and the possibility of superradiance by the ensemble of nanomagnets is being investigated. Theory of resonant spin tunneling due to the spin-lattice coupling, hyperfine and dipolar interactions is being developed for such nanomagnets as Mn12, [Mn4]2 dimer, Fe8 crystals of LiHoxY1-xF, and others. Cooperation with U.S. and foreign theorists and experimentalists working in the field of nanomagnetism is being developed. The knowledge of traditional and modern magnetism is being transferred to graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
