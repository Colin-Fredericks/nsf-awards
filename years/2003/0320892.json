 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n A closed-loop hydraulic loading and electronic data acquisition system will be acquired. The system will provide\r\nthe  the capability to conduct load-controlled or displacement-controlled tests on structural\r\nmaterials and structural members under static, cyclic, or dynamic loading conditions. The data\r\nacquisition system will be used in conjunction with the hydraulic loading system and will allow\r\nfor the simultaneous monitoring of eighty channels of data (strain, load, displacement, etc.). The\r\nequipment requested represents a significant upgrade from the testing systems currently used by\r\nthe PIs. The current loading system is limited to static testing, and load can be applied but not\r\ncontrolled via the manual open-loop system. Current data acquisition equipment is limited in\r\nscanning speed and precision, and cannot accommodate dynamic testing.\r\n\r\nThe College of Engineering is implementing a seven year strategic plan, and\r\nStructural Engineering is categorized as a thrust area on which emphasis will be placed with\r\nrespect to support and development of infrastructure. In conjunction with this plan, a new 9500\r\nsquare foot experimental laboratory for research and teaching in structural engineering is\r\nscheduled to open on campus in 2004. The testing system requested in this proposal was\r\ndesigned with this in mind, as the equipment will be usable in both the existing laboratory and the\r\nnew facility. The systems designed are also easily upgradeable to accommodate long-term needs.\r\n\r\n Through a variety of mechanismsl, undergraduates will have the opportunity to use the requested equipment to conduct\r\nresearch. Underrepresented groups will benefit as a result of the continued commitment  the College of Engineering toward providing opportunities for these groups in engineering education.\r\n",
