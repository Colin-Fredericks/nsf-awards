 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grantmakers for Education (GFE) connects the work of the broadest cross-section of philanthropists working in education today and helps foundations and donors improve their effectiveness. The mission of the organization is to strengthen the capacity of philanthropy to improve educational outcomes for all students, which it accomplishes by providing opportunities for foundation leaders to work together, study issues together, and reflect on their work. One of the key projects of GFE is an annual conference, which convenes 300 grantmakers each year. In 2003, the GFE conference explores issues of impact and effectiveness by examining what education grantmaking has accomplished and how grants can better leverage change in education (from the early grades through higher education). Day long workshops (and complementary sessions and site visits) examine strategies for sustainability, strategies for influencing policy, and strategies for engaging in successful replication including, prominently, efforts to impact math and science education \r\n\r\nThis project supports writing, printing, and distributing a conference proceedings publication. Education grantmaking is a significant tool for improving the education system of the nation, especially in mathematics and science, and the conference (and a report on its proceedings) seeks to make education grantmaking more effective and have greater impact.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Through case studies and discussions with leaders in the fields of education and philanthropy, conference sessions identify ways foundation leaders can better change education policies, sustain successful programs over time, replicate models and thereby impact student achievement better.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: By publishing and disseminating a report on the conference themes and findings, GFE influences the grantmaking practices of not only those attending the conference, but also of the broader field of education philanthropy.\r\n",
