This project is to support about 45 U.S. researchers to participate in the 2003 ICRA that will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, May 12-17, 2003.  The primary objective is to help U.S. researchers participate in this key international conference, who could not otherwise attend the Conference. U.S. researchers will maintain a highly competitive position in research by presenting research results, discussion, and exchange information with researchers from all over the world. This project strongly supports minority group researchers and students who would need financial support for their participation in the 2003 ICRA.\r\n\r\n",
