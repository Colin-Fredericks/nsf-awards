 "awd_abstract_narration": "ITR: Reliable Distributed Programming with Speculations\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nIt has been well established that the United States needs better\r\nprogramming technology to assure the safety and reliability of the\r\nnation's software infrastructure.  The National Research Council, the\r\nPresident's commission on critical infrastructure protection, and the\r\nPITAC report reach similar conclusions: that the nation depends on\r\nfragile software, and technologies for building reliable software are\r\ninadequate.  To address these problems, this research develops a new\r\nprogramming model, called speculations, for ensuring software\r\nreliability.\r\n\r\nA speculation is a computation that depends on an assumption that may\r\nbe difficult or impossible to verify prior to evaluating the\r\ncomputation.  If the assumption is later found to be false, the\r\ncomputation is rolled back.  Speculations are especially useful in\r\ndistributed systems, where failures are inevitable: the network may\r\nfail, processors may fail, and the code itself may have errors.  In\r\nthis new approach, speculations are used to wrap potentially unsafe\r\ncomputations.  If a fault occurs, the program is restored to a\r\nwell-known program state where the fault can be easily resolved.\r\n\r\nThe research develops the theory and design automation tools for\r\nspeculations in three parts: first, the programming language theory is\r\nexpanded to provide a basis for speculation; second, the theory is\r\nused to implement compiler and operating system extensions that\r\nautomate the support for speculations; and third, speculations are\r\nused to develop new distributed communication protocols and\r\nalgorithms.  Speculations conform to a widely-understood design model\r\nbased on transactions, easing deployment as a general-purpose\r\nprogramming tool.  The results of the research are open source and\r\nfreely available.",
