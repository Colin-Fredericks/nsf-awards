 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to increase the number of Native Americans and Latinos in the areas of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. This project is not only helping to relieve the financial burden students face, but it is also helping to address and remove specific barriers to their academic success. The program is offering services for the students and their families and professional activities that include mentorship, internships, and specific preparations for graduate study. This program is providing a total of 25 scholarships are awarded to students majoring in mathematics, computer science, and pre-engineering. The students' eligibility criteria are determined as a composite of their academic potential, their financial need, and their desire to complete the degree program. Students apply to the program following their successful completion of one semester of college level coursework with a GPA of 3.0 or greater. The specific project goals of the project are as follows:\r\n1. To provide the resources for undergraduate students and their families to promote the students' academic success in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering.\r\n2. To increase the representation of Native Americans and Latinos in the workforce and in graduate schools in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering.\r\n3. To evaluate the merits of this program and disseminate the results locally, regionally, and nationally.\r\n\r\nHeritage College serves a high percentage of Native American and Latino students.",
