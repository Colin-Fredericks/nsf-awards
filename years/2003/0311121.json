 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless networks of sensors will be widely deployed in the future because they\r\ngreatly extend our ability to monitor and control the physical environment from\r\nremote locations. One of the most important communication primitives that has\r\nto be provided by sensor networks is information gathering: information from\r\nthe sensors has to be forwarded to a single point for evaluation. Since sensors\r\nwill exist with the ratio of thousands of nodes per user, it is impossible to\r\npay attention to any individual node. Hence, it is important to use\r\ncommunication methods in sensor networks that are extremely simple - to allow a\r\nverification of their correct implementation - and self-reconfiguring - to\r\nallow automatic adjustments to changes in the sensor network or sensing tasks.\r\nFurthermore, since sensors are simple devices with limited processing power,\r\nstorage capacity, and energy, it is important to develop routing strategies\r\nthat can support information gathering as efficiently as possible. Whereas many\r\nheuristics have already been suggested for resource-efficient information\r\ngathering in sensor networks, almost no rigorous theoretical work has been\r\nperformed in this area yet. Therefore, the goal of this project is to explore\r\nfundamental concepts for self-reconfigurable and resource-efficient information\r\ngathering in wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThis project concentrates on networks of static sensors (i.e. sensors do not\r\nmove around, which is commonly the case). However, the observer may move\r\naround. Also, connections between sensors may be available or unavailable\r\ndepending on the underlying medium access control protocol or temporary\r\nproblems such as obstacles. In addition, sensors may fail permanently due to\r\nenergy problems. To ensure that the network protocols developed in the project\r\nwill work under any circumstances, models are used in which the injections of\r\npackets, the status of the edges, and the movements of the observer are assumed\r\nto be under adversarial control. The challenge is to find distributed online\r\nprotocols for this case - i.e. protocols performing online decisions that can\r\nbe executed locally at every sensor  - that have a near-optimal throughput\r\nusing a near-minimum amount of energy and storage. Simple protocols with these\r\nproperties have recently been developed and analyzed by the PI for specific\r\ncases (such as specific topologies of sensors and a static observer), and the\r\nresearch goal of the project is to establish analytical and experimental\r\nresults for much more general cases.\r\n\r\nA broad impact of the project is ensured by disseminating the research results\r\nvia lecture notes, conference and journal publications, presentations, and\r\npublications on the Web. Furthermore, sensor networks is a highly\r\ninterdisciplinary field. It involves people from many different areas:\r\nintegrated circuits, signal processing, operating systems, and theoretical\r\ncomputer science. The project will stimulate interactions of the PI with people\r\nfrom these fields, which may lead to exciting interdisciplinary projects in the\r\nfuture. Finally, since no standards have been set yet for communication in\r\nsensor networks, a potential consequence of the project with high social\r\nbenefit will be to provide valuable contributions to future standards.\r\n",
