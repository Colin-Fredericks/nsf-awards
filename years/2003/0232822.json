 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process technology for composite ordered films based on liquid crystal (LC) materials that will have a significant impact on the performance of LC optical devices, both passive and active.  These devices include ultrafast optical signal processing and high-density optical storage, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nThe process technology is simple in concept.  A blend of cross-linkable liquid crystals and non-reactive liquid  crystals  is  formulated,  and  then  prepared  into  a  film  using  usual  techniques.   The  non-reactive components are  then removed  from  the film  to  create  a  nano-structured,  mesogenic \"mold\" that retains some of the LC-like ordering.  If desired, additional components can be added into the mold, creating a device with tailored mechanical, chemical, and optical properties.  The technology can thus be used to overcome  inherent  shortcomings  of  LC materials  and  improve  the  performance,  durability,  and applicability of many LC optical devices.   In  the proposed  program,  the  goal  is  to  fabricate  low-cost,  high-efficiency,  reflective  broadband  UV polarizing  films.  This technology makes it possible to realize such films even though all  currently available LC materials exhibit substantial absorption over the UV spectral range. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis process technology for composite ordered films will have immediate commercial applications in a wide range of optical devices, both active and passive, as it will dramatically improve performance.  The improvements  may  include  better  temperature  resistance,  wider  wavelength  range,  reduced  chemical sensitivity,  or  any  combinations  of  these.  The  first  application  to  be  produced  with  this  process,  UV polarizing films, has a wide range of uses: chiral drug development, optical components, liquid crystal displays,  and  even  skin  protection.    Anticipated  revenues  for  UV  polarizing  films  could  reach  $4.5 million in its first year alone.   \r\n \r\n",
