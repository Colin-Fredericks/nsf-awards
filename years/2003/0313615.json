 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Vernon D. Parker at Utah State University will continue work carried out over the past five years that employed non-steady-state kinetic methods to show that a number of reactions long believed to take place by simple single-step second-order mechanisms are actually more complex and proceed via kinetically significant reaction intermediates. The non-steady-state kinetic method developed in the previous grant period is based upon the observation that the bimolecular reactions examined thus far all take place by the reversible consecutive second-order mechanism involving kinetically significant reaction intermediates. New mechanistic probes developed will be used to examine SN2, elimination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, group transfer, and Diels-Alder reactions. The research suggested is expected to greatly increase the understanding of bimolecular organic reaction mechanisms.  Results are also expected to correct misconceptions based upon the belief that all of these reactions proceed from reactant to product via a single transition state.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Vernon D. Parker at Utah State University who will challenge the accepted belief that the bimolecular reactions that are the backbone of Physical Organic Chemistry follow simple single-step mechanisms with single transition states on the reaction coordinate between reactants and products. The cutting-edge research will train undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students who will take part in state-of-the-art research on projects of general interest. Professor Parker will publish the results of this work in high quality journals as well as present seminars on the results, and publish review articles to bring the results into context. Collaborative projects with US researchers and researchers from abroad will be developed.\r\n",
