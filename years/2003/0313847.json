 "awd_abstract_narration": "0313847\r\nPerry\r\nThis proposal is to evaluate the use of tropical storm precipitation,\r\nespecially that from  hurricanes, as a natural tracer of groundwater\r\nmovement. Precipitation from tropical storms is known to have a special\r\noxygen and deuterium isotope composition that distinguishes it from\r\nnormal precipitation. Because tropical storms also produce many times as\r\nmuch rain as normal storms, they are capable of adding a large batch or\r\nslug of water to an aquifer during a single event. The objective of this\r\nstudy is to determine whether that slug of isotopically labeled water\r\ncan be traced by stable isotope measurements as it moves through an\r\naquifer. This research could establish a powerful new technique to study\r\ngroundwater in tropical areas where hurricanes are frequent. \r\n\tIt is difficult to plan and set up an experiment suitable for\r\nmonitoring a hurricane, and it would be expensive to establish a large\r\nnetwork of monitoring stations purely on the chance that a tropical\r\nstorm might occur somewhere within that network. That is what adds an\r\nelement of urgency to this proposal. Hurricane Isadore recently passed\r\nover the northern Yucatan Peninsula, an area where the PI has previously\r\nobtained background data on the isotopic composition of the local\r\ngroundwater. Northern Yucatan is especially well suited for a trial of\r\nthis monitoring technique: its karst aquifer is extremely permeable,\r\ninsuring rapid groundwater movement; it has almost no soil that might\r\nimpede rapid movement of the hurricane precipitation into the aquifer;\r\nand the aquifer is relatively uncomplicated. Thus, it will be relatively\r\neasy to monitor changes in the composition of water in this aquifer as\r\nthe hurricane precipitation moves through. \r\n\tSamples of groundwater will be collected in three sampling trips\r\nover a period of one year. These will be obtained from municipal wells,\r\ncovered karst sinkholes, and piezometers (where available). Students\r\nwill be involved in collecting the samples and analyzing the data.\r\nIsotopic analyses will be performed in the stable isotope laboratory of\r\nthe Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. \r\n\tIntellectual merit of this project will be a better\r\nunderstanding of the behavior of groundwater, a precious resource, and\r\nthe development of a new, non-polluting technique for charting its\r\nmovement.\r\n\tThe broader impacts of this activity will include: 1)\r\ndevelopment of information on groundwater movement that can lead to\r\nbetter management and protection of groundwater in the very sensitive\r\nYucatan aquifer (essential for human health, agricultural productivity,\r\nindustrial development, and tourism), 2) establishment of closer\r\ncollaboration between Mexican scientists and scientists in the United\r\nStates, accomplished by close collaboration in this research, and 3)\r\neducation of students in the procedures used to collect meaningful\r\nsamples of groundwater and to evaluate the analytical results of this\r\nstudy.\r\n",
