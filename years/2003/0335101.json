The research is organized in the following areas, (1) On the theoretical side, we will implement fully vectorial 3D Maxwell solvers coupled to the relevant material equations. The latter will include rigorously computed active/passive material models and will help in a predictive way in the design of the components; (2) on the experimental side, we we will employ the extensive nanophotonic and fiber fabrication capabilities that currently exist at UA and Stanford to make photonic band gap structures and test them. Er-doped photonic crystal fibers will be fabricated and used in developing active devices, such as lasers. The large gain per unit length of these devices will allow fabrication of arrays of such lasers on a chip. Wavelength conversion arrays, needed for optical networking, will also be another subnject of investigation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research will be not only be in enhancing the broadband communication access but also in integration of research into our education and educational outreach activities and diversity programs. The faberication of chip scale optical components will bring novel devices to the market and to the hands of the customer. The research also help in educating a skilled work force in the nationally sensitive communication area. We will also start an outreach program with the native Americans and specially the Navajo Nation by developing educational opportunities for high school and community college teachers from this Nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
