 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines solar energy technology diffusion in rural Sri Lanka,\r\none of the fastest-growing solar energy markets in the World. Solar\r\nphotovoltaic systems produce electricity without emitting the pollutants and\r\nclimate-changing gases associated with electricity production by more\r\npervasive fossil fuels, and are beginning to find a niche in rural areas in\r\ndeveloping countries that do not have access to grid electricity. This\r\nresearch will discover the social, infrastructural, market-related, spatial\r\nand environmental factors that best explain why solar home systems (SHS) are\r\nbeing adopted quickly in some parts of the country, and more slowly in\r\nothers. It is essential that we understand what factors most influence\r\nacceptance and adoption of sustainable energy technologies in different\r\ngeographic contexts, in order to create more effective policies that better\r\nmeet all peoples' need for efficient, reliable and environmentally-sound\r\nenergy services.\r\n\r\nThis project will also discover the factors that affect how different\r\nindividuals: come to know about SHS; develop opinions of SHS; decide to\r\nadopt SHS; implement the decision to adopt SHS; re-evaluate their decision\r\nafter adopting SHS; and are differently impacted-upon by adopting SHS or by\r\nthe SHS adoption process within their community. Factors that will be\r\ninvestigated to explain variation in SHS adoption behavior and in the\r\nimpacts of SHS adoption among different people include: characteristics of\r\ntheir personal social networks; the level of trust in their relationships\r\nand in their community; the behavioral norms and the strength of sanctions\r\non behavior within their social network and in their community; their wealth\r\nclass; their ethnicity; their gender; their occupation (or livelihood);\r\ntheir access to outside information; availability of the technology; and\r\ntheir access to low-interest loans that facilitate SHS purchase.\r\nUnderstanding the diverse adoption behaviors and experiences of the SHS\r\nadoption process among different types of people in a community will draw\r\npolicy-makers attention to the fact that the diffusion of this innovation\r\naffects different people's lives in different ways. Energy service delivery\r\nprograms and policies must therefore be crafted in light of detailed\r\ninformation at the personal level to ensure that all members of a community,\r\nespecially those most disadvantaged, have access to and benefit from\r\nessential energy services. This NSF-funded research not only will produce\r\nknowledge that helps forward the interests of American companies active in\r\nSri Lanka and other growing solar energy markets, but more importantly, it\r\nhelps fulfill our responsibility to create opportunities that improve\r\npeople's lives in a post-conflict state.",
