 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to California State University San Bernardino under the direction of Dr. Anthony Metcalf. This grant enables the acquisition of an automated DNA sequencing system for scientific research and education at a predominantly undergraduate, Hispanic serving university (HIS/PUI).  The initial and primary uses of the instrumentation will facilitate the integration of education and research into population and evolutionary biology. The equipment lowers costs, greatly increases research efficiency, stimulates new research projects and collaborations, and allows the completion of projects that require DNA sequence or genotype analysis. The region served by this institution is equal or larger than nine of the States in the U.S. Yet, this critical technological aspect of research and training had not been previously met.\r\n\r\nWith this instrument, the full arc of research and training in DNA sequencing, and genotyping will be available to faculty, staff, and most important, undergraduate and Master level student researchers. Current research and student training that immediately benefit from the award focus on regional geographic patterns of molecular genetic variation across a suite of taxa. These projects include conservation applications with a genetic analysis of a recent range expansion of the federally endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat, and the conservation genetics of a local restricted plant, the endangered Lane Mountain milk vetch. Three other student research projects that immediately benefit from the award focus on the relationships between habitat structure and gene flow across different taxa. These projects are:1) the role of watershed in affecting genetic differentiation  in the California treefrog; 2) the isolating effects of recent uplift on geographically isolated populations of the zebra tailed lizard; and 3) the population genetics of the pygmy nuthatch, a sedentary bird that inhabits yellow pine forests on disjunct mountain tops in southern California. Another set of student projects examines the population structure of southern California populations of the mosquito Culex quinquefaciatus in relation to insecticide resistance, using hypervariable regions of the genome.\r\n\r\nA broader impact of this project is that automated DNA sequencing and genotype instrumentation will greatly enhance current research efforts into the nature of genetic variation in inland southern California taxa. This region has a very high level of endemism, and coupled with explosive human population growth, and the alteration of habitat, results in a concentration of threatened and endangered species in a limited geographic area. This primary research focus at this HIS/PUI institution will have broad application to the regional habitat planning and conservation efforts currently taking place. The research projects will allow the CSUSB faculty and community users to more fully integrate research and education. And, most importantly, it will allow the students to fully experience research-from the inception of a question, through the experimental and technical work, to the presentation and publication of their projects.\r\n",
