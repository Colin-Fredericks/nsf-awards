The phenomena of mass transfer and separations are the main focus of the workshop approaches. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this workshop to be held in Beijing, China, in the of Spring 2004, is to have an exchange of scientific information and a dialogue between the American and Chinese university faculty members on recent advances mainly in the area of pollution prevention at the source. One objective is also to inculcate a close collaboration between the faculty members of these two countries for a sustained interaction and relationship, even after the workshop is over, towards finding a solution to the global pollution dilemma. This joint workshop will provide a platform to achieve these objectives of information exchange and faculty collaboration that may have a focus on this critical problem of worldwide pollution.  \r\n\r\nThe following basic research concepts have been identified:\r\n\r\n1)\tChemical separation and mass transport fundamentals to provide updated and detailed understanding or novel ways/tools to understand/describe chemical separation and mass transport; \r\n2)\tChemical separation process intensification and innovation to highlight the advances in micro scale separation process and those process operated in external field e.g., electrical field, supercritical CO2 technology, etc. \r\n3)\tGreen process for pollution prevention to address those efforts that may be effective to cope with energy based pollution, industry based pollution and to pollution prevention in material selection. \r\n \r\nThe above concepts cover a very wide area of chemical engineering. The topics for this workshop will be confined to the following areas. The subject of discussions as far as possible, but not limited to, should be in the areas of mass transport, interfacial, thermodynamics, and separations phenomena--related to the general over arching themes.\r\n\r\nA report of the proceedings will be submitted to NSF and a more detailed hard copy will be available to the public.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
