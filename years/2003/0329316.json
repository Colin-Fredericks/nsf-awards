Michael, et al.\r\nClemson University\r\n\r\n\"NTE: Phase I (Exploratory): Molecularly Imprinted Conducting Polymer Scaffolds for Sensing and Measurement\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this exploratory research project is to develop and test a novel method of creating molecularly imprinted polymer layers that are interlaced with conducting polymers for sensing and signaling.  The PI's will evaluate the ability of these layers to bind and signal, though changes in electroactivity, the presence of pyrethroids.  This class of hazardous insecticide has been selected because of its growing use in urban environments against mosquitoes that carry diseases such as West Nile Virus and because a common structural feature in pyrethroids offers the potential to develop a general (rather than specific) sensor. \r\n \r\nThe molecularly imprinted conducting polymer scaffolds will be created using 3-vinylthiophene. This material allows the growth, via surface confined atom transfer radical polymerization (SC ATRP), the layer in the presence of the template pyrethroid; following layer growth, electrochemical polymerization will be used to couple the thiophene groups throughout the layer.  The advantages of this two-step process are distinct:  SC ATRP permits controlled growth of the layer, and subsequent electrochemical polymerization crosslinks the scaffold and integrates the conducting polymer throughout the network, thereby providing \"on-board\" sensing and signaling capabilities. The PI's will use standard spectroscopic techniques to investigate the effect of processing on the layer and a variety of electrochemical techniques to assess the response of the scaffolds to the presence of the target pyrethroids.  The PI's will compare the performance of imprinted and non-imprinted materials to evaluate the specificity of the imprinted scaffolds to the target pyrethroids. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThis work will provide a training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers in areas such as environmental engineering, materials engineering, and nanotechnology. These themes are consistent with employment trends for chemical engineers. Through existing programs at Clemson, opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to participate in this research, which will help ensure that these research activities foster an interdisciplinary training ground. \r\n  \r\nSensors based on the new scaffolds that will be developed could be used for passive monitoring of pyrethroids in urban areas. Because pyrethroids affect the endocrine and nervous systems, such sensors would allow better monitoring of dispersed dosages and improve the ability of officials to protect citizens.  If these novel molecularly-imprinted conducting polymer scaffolds prove to be robust for templating and detecting target molecules, the approach is likely to spur new initiatives to produce sensors with \"on-board\" signaling capabilities that can be integrated in broader sensor arrays, and expand the applications for electronic noses (impedimetric sensors).\r\n\r\n",
