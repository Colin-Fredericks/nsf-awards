 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed to the development of a single-wafer spin processing module for high-speed ozone-water-based  resist and  residue  removal  in  semiconductor  device manufacturing.  A new ozone-water process which is unique in promising practical throughputs in single-wafer processing configurations has been developed.  Experimental and analytical work has shown there is an opportunity to significantly increase the etch rate and etch uniformity of this process with improvements in the design of the spin processing module.   Four goals are established for this Phase I: (1) Measure the radial dependence of the etch rate as a  function  of  key  process  parameters  using  a  standard  commercial  spin  processing  module;  (2)  Develop  a computational fluid dynamic model of the module;  (3)  Validate the model  by comparing the measured etch rate to that predicted by the model; and,  (4) Use the model to make a preliminary evaluation of promising new  spin processor designs. \r\n\r\nSingle-substrate  wet  processing  has  applications  in  wafer  processing,  magnetic  disc  manufacturing,  optical  disc manufacturing,  and  flat  panel  display manufacturing.    The  market  for  wafer  wet  processing  equipment  alone  is projected to reach 3.1 billion dollars by 2005.  The single-wafer wet processing segment is growing and is expected to be between 300 million to 450 million dollars by 2005. \r\n",
