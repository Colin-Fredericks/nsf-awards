Escobar\r\n\r\nProfessor Escobar plans to continue his research in linear and\r\nnon-linear partial differential equations and its applications to\r\nRiemmannian Geometry. He will continue his study of solutions to\r\nYamabe equations on compact Riemannian manifolds.  These are\r\nsemilinear elliptic equations and in the case that the manifold\r\nhas a boundary they satisfy a non-linear boundary condition.\r\nApplications of the existence theory for these equations are\r\nproposed to solve other problems in differential geometry and\r\nrelativity. He also proposes to study Hamilton's Ricci flow on\r\ntwo and three dimensional manifols with boundary.  In the two\r\ndimensional case this is a scalar non-linear evolution equation\r\nsatisfying a non-linear boundary condition, while in the three\r\ndimensional case is a system of nonlinear equations with\r\nnonlinear boundary conditions.  He will continue the study of the\r\nrelation between the geometry of the manifold and the eigenvalues\r\nfor the Steklov problem, which is the study of harmonic functions\r\nwhose normal derivative is proportional to the function.\r\n\r\nThe geometric objects that will be studied are the so-called\r\nRiemannian manifolds.  These are spaces endowed with analytical\r\nstructures, like the metric which provide us with a way to\r\nmeasure lengths and angles.  It is natural to study deformations\r\nof these structures to realize what properties in the space\r\nremain stable under such perturbations.  The description of all\r\nthese deformations is usually governed by differential equations.\r\nThe curvature tensor of a Riemmannian manifold ( a measure for\r\nthe \"non-euclideanness\" of a Riemannian space) usually makes such\r\nequations non-linear, although as in physics, most of them are of\r\nvariational nature.  From the earliest days, conformal changes of\r\nmetric ( multiplication of the metric by a positive function)\r\nhave played an importntant role in surface theory.  The equations\r\nproposed appear in the problem of conformal deformation of a\r\nRiemannian metric and in relativity. The Steklov problem appears\r\nin mathematical physics, conformal geometry, spinor geometry,\r\nminimal surfaces, partial differential equations and harmonic\r\nanalysis.  Geometry as well as topology involves the study of\r\nproperties of the space.  But whereas geometry focuses on\r\nproperties of space that involves size, shape and measurement,\r\ntopology concerns itself with the less tangible properties of\r\nrelative position and connectedness. In recent years Hamilton's\r\nRicci flow has become a fundamental tool in the study of geometry\r\nand toplogy of manifolds.\r\n",
