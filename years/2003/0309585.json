 "awd_abstract_narration": "A global numerical model of the Earth's ring current will be enhanced with a number of improvements. A more realistic magnetic field model will be incorporated by using the magnetic field configuration models developed by Tsyganenko. The electric field model developed by Weimer will allow a more realistic electric field model that depends on solar wind conditions will be added.  In addition, the kinetic model of Jordanova et al. will be extended to include electrons and relativistic energies. Radial diffusion of particles will be included in the model as well. Ring current and radiation belt dynamics will be simulated during representative magnetic storms. These results will be used to reveal systematic behavior that will foster the development of a predictive model.  The spatial regions of intense ion and electron precipitation will be obtained and the rates of particle loss due to resonant interaction with plasma waves will be assessed. Comparisons with available satellite data will be made to test the model results. The project will contribute to the goals of the National Space Weather Program and also has relevance to the NASA Living with a Star program. The project will also provide support for a graduate student.",
