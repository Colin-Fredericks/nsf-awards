 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new polymer-based materials with tailored properties is often attempted through the mixing of currently existing materials.  Successful mixing has often been challenging to accomplish and to aid in the mixing an additive is commonly introduced in an attempt to compatibilize the blends.  As the effects of different additives are better understood, the knowledge can be applied to industrial systems with the aim of improving the processing and performance of polymer-based materials.  The research plan of this Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) proposal investigates ternary equilibrium thermodynamic properties and how copolymer additive can influence phase evolution and consequently polymer blend compatibilities.  The research will take place in a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) providing research experiences for undergraduate students.  This works builds on previous results, which demonstrate that copolymer additives can be used to tailor equilibrium and kinetic properties of blends in a number of ways.  The structure and monomer composition of the copolymers in this study will complement previous work.  The specific experimental ternary system is a blend of polybutadiene, polystyrene, and copolymers of butadiene and styrene.  These systems will be studied experimentally using cloud point measurements, temperature jump wide-angle light scattering, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and dynamic light scattering techniques.  Lastly, Monte Carol computer simulation techniques will be employed to model the experiemental polymer systems both in equilibrium settings and kinetic situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The proposal includes components that support the NSF criteria of broader impacts.  Undergraduate reseach students will be tutored in conducting publishable research where these experiences can be carried with them into future pursuits whether those are in academic research, health related fields, industry, or education.  The research experience is also an important part of the student's undergraduate education where our chemistry department integrates reseach into the curriculum.  The principal investigator also is incorporating research-rich activities into the physical chemistry curriculum through kinetic studies of current synthetic techniques like atom transfer radical polymerization and using static and dynamic light scattering to study macromolecular systems.  Activities will also be pursued which bring underrepresented high school students from a local Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program into our labs for a workshop.  The undergraduate research students will mentor the high school students on polymer science through experimental learning activities.  The undergraduate participation in this workshop is in accord with our university's interest in service activities for students.",
