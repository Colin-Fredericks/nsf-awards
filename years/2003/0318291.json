 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued progress in materials science and engineering has become increasingly dependent upon global collaborative efforts that pool resources and reduce costs through a Materials World Network operating in real and virtual space. This project supports the design and development of a prototype International Virtual Institute (IVI) as a test bed for the virtual services envisioned for a Materials World Network. The project develops a cyber-infrastructure that will enhance the use of physical infrastructures in real space.  The proposed IVI prototype includes, in the first phase, a Global Research Gallery and an Evaluation Center. The Global Research Gallery will allow researchers and students to: 1. View pre-publication results on current research; 2. Discuss research findings without attending a conference; 3. Compare research results from different labs at one location; find the latest research techniques and identify tools for cutting edge measurements; 4. Develop potential collaborators with complementary research strengths and resources; 5. View previously inaccessible research activities from top-rated institutions; 6. Present their research work at minimal cost; and 7. Create global topical networks. 8. Schedule special GRG exhibits to meet their specific research and networking needs. The Evaluation Center will be used to assess the usefulness of our cyber infrastructure. User feedback will be collected to evaluate the following: 1. Global use of the IVI as a resource for research and collaboration; 2. Willingness of users to participate in the further development of the IVI network; and 3. General level of support from academia, industry, government, foundations, etc. More specifically, a multiple-focus approach will be adopted to evaluate benefits to the community.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project can potentially enrich the research and education environment of students, teachers and their colleagues. In particular, the IVI prototype can deliver the most impact in the following\r\nareas: 1. It can enhance the utilization and the sharing of global infrastructures for research and\r\neducation; 2. The IVI infrastructure is designed to facilitate the rapid and broad dissemination of\r\nscientific and technological findings and understanding; 3. Provides a unique opportunity to enhance\r\nteaching, training and learning among students and teachers from different parts of the world; 4. It is a\r\nuniquely useful platform for encouraging global scientific and cultural exchanges among students; and\r\n5. The IVI is designed to be a \"level playing field\" for all who wish to participate. The IVI serves\r\nunder-represented groups in this country, in other developed countries, and in developing countries\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
