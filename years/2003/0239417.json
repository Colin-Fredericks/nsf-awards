 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to develop and apply more physically\r\naccurate potential energy functions for polymeric macromolecules than are\r\npresently available, in particular functions that, in addition to the\r\nusual prediction of structures and energies, give spectroscopically\r\naccurate reproduction of vibrational frequencies (which is not achieved by\r\ncurrent standard functions). This is accomplished by the spectroscopically\r\ndetermined force field (SDFF) methodology previously developed in this\r\nlaboratory. Under this proposal, current SDFFs will be extended to include\r\npolarization, which is very important in describing properties of polar\r\ngroups such as amides. A new protocol for determining parameters in the\r\nenergy function assures the avoidance of correlations and indeterminacy\r\nin these quantities. The newly developed formalism for molecular dynamics\r\nin internal coordinates (ICMD) will be implemented on macromolecular\r\nsystems. The hydrocarbon SDFF will be applied to the analysis and\r\nresolution of questions concerning structural transitions and the origin\r\nof spectral bands in trans-1,4-polybutadiene and band splittings in cis-\r\n1,4-polybutadiene. The SDFF to be developed for the amide group will be\r\nused to calculate the normal modes of nylons 6 and 66 to provide deeper\r\ninsights into the analysis of vibrational and inelastic neutron scattering\r\nspectra of these polymers. The new ICMD formalism will be applied to\r\ncalculations on crystalline polyethylene, with the particular goals of\r\ncorrecting published spectral intensity inaccuracies and of comparing\r\nspectral predictions from normal mode analysis with those from the Fourier\r\ntransformation of the time-autocorrelation function of the dipole moment.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to its intellectual contributions, this research program will\r\nhave broader impacts. New research results will be incorporated into\r\nadvanced courses, and graduate students and postdocs will develop and\r\nreport a more sophisticated understanding of an important area of\r\nscience. The previous emphasis on involvement of women in the research\r\nprogram will continue. Advanced computer programs for analysis of\r\nproperties of polymers will be made available to the scientific\r\ncommunity. The more acurate theoretical understanding of properties will\r\nlead to advances in commercial polymer technology and the amide group\r\naspect of the work have will an important impact in the study of \r\nbiological systems.  \r\n",
