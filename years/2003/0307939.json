 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Oregon, Eugene, is producing \"Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold,\" a three-hour television documentary series about the field of low-temperature physics, the field in which one-third of all physicists are working today.  The series explores key concepts, significant individuals and events in the field's turbulent history, and the enormous impact that the mastery of cold has had on society through technologies such as air-conditioning, refrigeration and liquefied gases.  The film, based in large part on Tom Shachtman's book of the same name, will document how four centuries of research into lower temperatures has produced stunning scientific insights and applications that have revolutionized the world we live in.   Planned outreach includes public programs, museum activities, and an interactive web site.  \r\n\r\nThe PI's for the project are Russell Donnelly of the University of Oregon, Richard Hudson of Twin Cites Public Television, and Meredith Burch of Meridian/Windfall Productions, Inc.  Other key staff members include Thomas Shachtman, author of the book upon which the series is based; David Dugan, Co-Producer/Director of Windfall Films; David Heil of David Heil and Associates; Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research; and Irene Goodman, of Goodman Research Group.\r\n",
