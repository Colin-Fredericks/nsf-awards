Several recent\r\nstudies, of which this is a continuation, have demonstrated the substantial\r\nimprovement in earthquake locations by applying a recently developed\r\ndouble-difference (DD) earthquake relocation algorithm to thousands of shallow\r\nearthquakes recorded at local distances. This project focuses on \r\nadapting the DD method to relocate, on a massive scale (several tens of thousands of \r\nevents) and over large distances (thousands of km), earthquakes recorded at regional and\r\nteleseismic distances. The investigators will test and evaluate the \r\nperformance of the new tools using globally recorded events for which ground truth is known, and\r\ncompare the results with results derived from commonly used location \r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nThey will also apply the DD method to the 'groomed' ISC bulletin to \r\nrelocate large numbers of earthquakes in subduction zones with the aim to image the internal\r\nstructure of seismicity associated with descending slabs. The focus will\r\ninitially be on the Andean subduction zone with the aim to define in detail the\r\nmorphology of the slab and its correlation with patterns of microseismicity and\r\nthe rupture areas of damaging earthquakes. they will also relocate other areas\r\nwith dense seismicity to search for characteristic seismicity patterns in time\r\nand space which may provide new insights into the occurrence and physics of\r\nWadati Benioff earthquakes.",
