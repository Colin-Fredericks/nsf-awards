 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of a series of macrocycles that consist of urea groups linked by rigid spacers.  The hydrogen bonding interactions between the cyclic urea monomers drives their self-assembly into tubular structures that contain sizeable homogeneous tubular channels.  A number of analytical, biochemical and physical chemistry methods will be used to evaluate the success of these assembled nanotubes.  Materials with tubular channels are sought for applications as sensors, templates for directed reactions, and in ion and small molecule transport systems.  \r\n\r\nWith this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Linda Shimizu of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, where she is a Research Assistant Professor.  Dr. Shimizu will focus her research on tubular assemblies, which have recently been shown to have antibacterial properties.  Undergraduate and graduate students trained in this program will receive a broad multidisciplinary background that will empower them to pursue a wide range of scientific careers.  This award also supports the enhancement and continuation of the chemistry outreach program that fosters interactions between K-12 students and teachers and skilled scientific researchers.\r\n\r\n",
