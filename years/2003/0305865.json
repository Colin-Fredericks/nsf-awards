Anderson will carry out research on  general \r\nrelativity, Einstein metrics, and  the geometrization of 3-manifolds.\r\nLeBrun will work on the Riemannian geometry of low-dimensional \r\nmanifolds,\r\nwith a focus on curvature and topology in  dimensions 3 and 4, and\r\non Zoll metrics in dimension 2. Sawon will study compact hyper-Kaehler\r\nmanifolds and quaternion-Kaehler manifolds from the point of view of\r\nRozansky-Witten invariants, knot invariants,  and topological quantum \r\nfield theories.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the broader impact  of this research program will \r\nbe significant.\r\nMany of the problems under study are of great interest\r\nto  theoretical physicists working in  general relativity, \r\nsupergravity,  and\r\nstring theory; moreover, members of the group are actively developing\r\nlinks with physicists working in these areas through\r\nparticipation in conferences, seminars and collaborative projects.\r\nThe project will also directly contribute to the training of a\r\nnew generation of mathematical researchers, as\r\nmembers of the research group are  actively engaged in the  supervision\r\nof many graduate students,  including women and minorities.\r\n",
