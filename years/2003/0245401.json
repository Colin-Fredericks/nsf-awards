Hofmann\r\n\r\nUniversity of Missouri\r\n\r\nDMS 245401\r\n\r\n \r\n>\r\n      In this project, I shall consider problems in harmonic analysis \r\narising in geometric analysis and geometric measure theory, and in   \r\nthe theory of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations\r\nand operators.   These questions are interesting because of their\r\napplicability to real world phenomena (see below), but also because \r\nof the deep connections among them.  The main directions of the \r\nproposed research include the following:\r\n \r\n1. To develop and apply ``T1/Tb\" (i.e., Carleson measure) \r\ncriteria for the solvability of boundary problems for \r\ndivergence form elliptic equations and systems.\r\n \r\n2. To treat various problems in the theory of uniformly \r\nrectifiable sets, in the applications of this theory to \r\nelliptic and parabolic PDE, and in the theory of \r\nquasiconformal mappings.\r\n \r\n3. To obtain sharp average decay estimates for Fourier transforms, and \r\nto apply these to concrete problems including lattice point problems and\r\nthe Falconer distance problem.\r\n \r\n    As mentioned above, I propose to work on problems in the area \r\nof harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, \r\ngeometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic and parabolic\r\npartial differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in \r\nharmonic analysis one investigates properties of\r\nfunctions and ``operators\" (i.e., mappings which transform one function\r\ninto another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces,\r\nwhich are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The\r\nname itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound\r\ninto its various frequency components, or ``harmonics\".\r\ngeometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between\r\ngeometric properties of sets, and their ``measures\" (the latter are\r\ngeneralizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial\r\ndifferential equations of elliptic and of parabolic type describe a \r\nwide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, \r\ncertain fluid flows and elastic deformations, and various diffusion\r\nprocesses\r\nsuch as the conduction of heat, the flow of ground water, certain\r\nphenomena arising in the mathematical theory of population biology, and the \r\npricing of options in financial markets.  In the last decade the interplay \r\nbetween these different subfields of mathematics has turned out to be a\r\nfertile ground \r\nfor investigation, with much exciting work remaining to be done.\r\n",
