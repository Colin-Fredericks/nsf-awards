 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Geometric Tools for Algorithms\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a set of general algorithmic tools\r\nbased on geometry and randomness. Four specific approaches will be\r\ninvestigated -- geometric random walks, convex relaxations, random\r\nprojection and spectral projection. There are basic problems that can be\r\nsolved by each technique (i.e., yielding efficient algorithms). These\r\ninclude convex optimization, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems\r\nand learning mixtures of distributions. The solutions to these problems\r\nlead to several questions about the applicability and efficiency of these\r\ntechniques (e.g. What functions can be sampled efficiently by the random\r\nwalk approach? How quickly can the volume be computed? Is there a\r\nrelaxation refinement method that improves the integrality gap? What are\r\nthe limits of the spectral method?). The PI plans to address these\r\nquestions and use the answers to tackle basic open problems in algorithms.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nGeometric insights and approaches play an increasingly central role in the\r\ndiscovery of polynomial-time algorithms for fundamental problems. At a\r\ntime when the field of algorithms is growing rapidly, such tools will be\r\ncrucial in crystallizing a theory of algorithms that will deepen our\r\nunderstanding as well as advance the field by aiding in the solution of\r\nkey open problems.\r\n\r\nBroad impact:\r\nThe problems this proposal sets out to explore are of a basic nature, and\r\noriginate from a variety of areas, including combinatorial optimization,\r\nmachine learning, information retrieval, and Euclidean geometry. Progress\r\non these problems, in addition to its potential practical impact, is sure\r\nto unravel combinatorial/geometric structure, and is likely to yield new\r\nanalysis tools. The research results will form the basis of an\r\nundergraduate course on combinatorial optimization as well as two graduate\r\ncourses; course notes for all of these will be available online.\r\n",
