 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the feasibility of the development of a low cost infrared sensor for the monitoring and detection of ethylene oxide (ETO).  ETO is widely used in the chemical industry as a feedstock chemical, and is most commonly used as a sterilant gas in hospitals and related facilities.  ETO is very toxic to humans (the OSHA TWA-TLV is 1 ppm), and is also a suspected carcinogen.  Currently, the two most frequently used methods for monitoring ETO in the workplace are electrochemical gas sensors and gas chromatography (GC), both of which have several drawbacks and neither adequately meet the current federal regulations.  In this research, a low cost monitoring and detection sensor based on infrared spectroscopy will be developed. \r\n\r\nThe investigators fully expect the commercial version of the sensor will not only benefit the medical industry, but will also have potential benefits in the safety, industrial, and chemical industries where gas detection and monitoring are critical for worker safety.",
