 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curriculum Enhancement to Introduce\r\nProduct Development with Bio-Inspired Concepts\r\nHugh Bruck, Satyandra Gupta, Edward Magrab, and Elisabeth Smela\r\n\r\nMechanical Engineering Department\r\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, Maryland\r\n\r\nBio-inspired products and devices take their inspiration from nature. Current mechanical engineering curricula do not cover design concepts or manufacturing techniques needed to develop such products and devices. We propose to enhance the mechanical engineering undergraduate curriculum by integrating recent advances in the design, analysis, and manufacturing of bio-inspired products and devices through the following objectives:\r\n1. Insert a new sequence of instructional materials on bio-inspired concepts into the mechanical\r\nengineering curriculum.\r\n2. Develop a new senior elective entitled Product Development Using Bio-inspired Concepts.\r\n3. Revise two senior electives in micro-electromechanical systems area to include more complete\r\ntreatments of special manufacturing processes that can be used to realize bio-inspired products.\r\n4. Assess the projects of the undergraduate mechanical engineering students in their capstone design\r\ncourse to evaluate their retention and utilization of the new material.\r\n5. Conduct one workshop to transfer the new materials and establish a feedback mechanism for\r\nenhancing the curriculum.\r\n6. Disseminate the materials developed for the new modules and the course notes for the new senior\r\nelective through a dedicated web site.\r\n7. Present a summary of our experiences at two conferences.\r\n\r\nThe result of the proposed curriculum enhancement will be a new generation of mechanical engineers who can develop products and conduct research for a wide variety of applications utilizing bio-inspired concepts. The proposed project will (1) integrate emerging manufacturing technologies and new design analyses based on biological principles into the Mechanical Engineering curriculum, (2) utilize multi-media technology for disseminating course content, and (3) train graduate students and faculty participating in its implementation in an emerging technology and thereby contribute to faculty development.\r\n",
