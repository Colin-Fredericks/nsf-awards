 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professors Darren Hamilton at Mount Holyoke College will continue a research program that is built exclusively around the synthetic and physical chemistry of mellitic triimides, a new class of electron acceptors developed in the PI's laboratory and published for the first time in 2001. A significant program of study is planned based the observation that these new triimides may be classed, structurally and functionally, with the diimides of benzene, naphthalene, and perylene. These structures have received a great deal of attention, principally due to their strongly electron accepting nature. They have played key roles in the development of numerous areas of investigation in supramolecular chemistry, involving areas such as topology and molecular scale machinery, electronic materials, mimics of redox active biological co-factors, DNA intercolators, and sensors. The overarching aim of the program of study proposed is to fully introduce the new triimide building block to this diverse arena by demonstrating viable access to the core, and characterizing emergent properties in its derivatives and the molecular assemblies that may result. Research projects based on the triimide platform will provide stimulating and varied laboratory experiences for undergraduates that will involve synthesis, spectroscopy, and materials characterization. The work will give participants an important glimpse of an expanding contemporary area of research inquiry, and will contribute to the strong tradition of preparation that characterizes chemistry at Mount Holyoke College.\r\n.\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Darren Hamilton at Mount Holyoke College who plans to broadly impact two key elements of research-based scholarship in an undergraduate college. First, to enliven the experimental sequence taken by all students by including modules that both demonstrate important concepts and provide materials of use to the larger research program. Second, to attempt to identify and encourage students early in their college careers who have not previously considered the possibility of involvement in research, or who have been reluctant to step forward. Using this mechanism of exposure, female undergraduates will be encouraged to consider the question of their involvement with a research program, through participation in a summer program, or through supervised independent study. As of a decade ago, one in four women chemists in the US graduated from Mount Holyoke College, and the college remains one of the most productive sources of women PhD chemists.\r\n",
