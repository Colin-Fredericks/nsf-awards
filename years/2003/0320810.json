 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a) synthesis of polyketides; b) development of a new materials strategy for photoresponsive polymers; c) studies on hydrogen activation and parahydrogen induced polarization; d) return electron transfer processes in photoinduced electron transfer reactions; e) unsaturated, reactive complexes of iron, cobalt and nickel for insights into catalytic mechanisms; f) C-X bond cleavage studies; and g) development of new methods of asymmetric synthesis for use in the construction of complex multifunctional organic molecules.  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and materials science. \r\n",
