 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative process for incorporation of nanometer-scale inclusions into  superconducting Niobium Titanium (NbTi)  alloy  wires.    These  inclusions  will  serve  as  magnetic  flux pinning sites, resulting in improved critical current density (Jc) performance as compared to that which can be obtained by conventional processing methods.  The innovation will consist in the use of mixtures of nanometer-scale NbTi powder and nanometer-scale metal oxide powder or nickel powder.  The use of nanometer-scale powders will greatly reduce the amount of wire deformation required for optimum inclusion  (pin) size and spacing as compared with other powder metallurgical and rod-based processes.  This will be beneficial for wire piece-length and processing costs.  At the same time, the process will  have  the  benefit  that  pin  volume  may  be  easily  adjusted  for  maximum  Jc performance.  By  contrast, the volume of pinning sites that may be realized by conventional thermomechanical processing techniques for NbTi conductors is limited by precipitation kinetics, resulting in an upper limit to Jc performance. \r\n     Commercially, an improved NbTi conductor will find application in superconducting magnets used for high energy physics accelerators, Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging (MRI) systems, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) devices.  Increased critical  current  density  performance  will  translate  directly  into  cost  savings  and  greater design flexibility for the MRI and NMR industries.  This will be of particular interest to the MRI industry (an industry rapidly approaching $3 billion dollars in sales), where it is difficult to maintain an advantage in an increasingly competitive international market. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
