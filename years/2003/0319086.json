 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the utility of a continuously operating sensor for detection of nerve agent contamination in aqueous solutions.  Single-use surface-sensing technology will be adapted to an on-line, real-time sensor format for detection of trace amounts of nerve agent contamination.  The unit will be small, self-contained, inexpensive, and compatible with other sensor constructs.  The sensing mechanism will be based on using two enzyme reactions in dynamic equilibrium with each other.  The equilibrium is disrupted when one of the enzymes (cholinesterase) is inhibited, resulting in a dramatic pH change.  This pH change can be measured electronically or visualized by color indicators.  The sensor is expected to outperform any conventional technology for nerve agent detection in its simplicity of use, interference resistance, broad-based compatibility with surfaces, liquids, and gases, and low cost.  \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland defense.  Early warning and continuous monitoring devices are of urgent need in the event of a chemical warfare attack.",
