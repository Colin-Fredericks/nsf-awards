 "awd_abstract_narration": "0301900\r\nAyazi\r\n\r\nThis proposal is aimed at the integration of a high aspect-ratio, sub-100nm vertical airgap\r\nMEMS/NEMS technology with a 1um gate-length CMOS process, and the application of the\r\nresulting high aspect ratio CMOS-MEMS process to high-performance RF-sensory microsystems,\r\nas well as mixed-signal circuits. The implementation of the following two testbeds is proposed as\r\ntechnology demonstrators:\r\n\r\n1. The high-performance sensor system testbed: Implementation of a novel CMOS-integrated\r\ninertial-grade (sub-ug resolution) acceleration/vibration sensor system with direct digital output.\r\nThis single-chip sensor system will have 3-4 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to\r\nthe current state of the art integrated microsystem. It consists of a nano-precision lateral\r\naccelerometer and a high-performance mixed-signal interface circuit which utilizes 200um tall\r\nvertical poly-poly capacitors, yielding 2 orders of magnitude reduction in the die area.\r\n\r\n2. The wireless RF components testbed: Implementation of MEMS-based high-Q on-chip\r\nfrequency references \"over a wide frequency range extending into GHz\" integrated with CMOS\r\nelectronics (MEMS-based VCO).\r\n\r\nOver the past few decades, CMOS and CMOS-like processes have substantially grown in the\r\nnumber and thickness of the deposited layers on the surface of the Si substrate (the so-called\r\nback-end processes). However, the front-end processes have not grown proportionally and\r\nremained limited to the steps necessary to create the transistors. The out of silicon thickness of\r\nCMOS has grown to be almost an order of magnitude larger than the inside silicon thickness of it.\r\nThe development of the integrated MEMS processes has followed the same model with\r\nintegration of surface micromachined structures. The question is: can the front-end of the CMOS\r\nprocess be modified to bring new life to integrated MEMS by enhancing the performance and\r\nproviding higher levels of functionality?\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to modify the front-end of the CMOS\r\nprocess using the deep reactive ion etching and refill technique to make use of the third\r\ndimension into the silicon and embed functionality (both electrical and mechanical) inside the\r\nCMOS-grade silicon substrate. The proposed process will allow the scaling of micromechanical\r\nstructures into the nanometer domain through its unique ability to create sub-100nm vertical gaps\r\nand sub-micron silicon features. High aspect ratio poly and single crystal silicon structures (with\r\nhigh quality factors) separated by nanometer in size gaps will be integrated with CMOS circuits.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact resulting from the proposed activity is the ability to bring about significantly higher levels of performance and integration to the integrated MEMS and mixed-signal circuits. Higher performance levels and the ability to communicate wireless on a single silicon chip can open up the door to new opportunities and applications. Imagine having a tiny MEMS-CMOS silicon chip that can not only monitor very small changes in the environment, but also can transmit the monitored data real time in digital form to a receiver base, or communicate with a network of wireless sensory nodes. Such wireless sensory nodes can find numerous applications in various forms of environmental monitoring and energy-efficient systems.\r\n",
