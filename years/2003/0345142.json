The funding will be used for travel and registration expenses especially for graduate students, post-doctoral research associates and new faculty to assist them to participate in this meeting. The intellectual merit of this meeting is to bring together an international group of material scientists, chemists, and chemical engineers. The speakers for the meeting will include many of those working in the \"cutting edge\" of this field. The program will be directed to new and/or modified membrane materials that provide nanoscale separation abilities and expanded temperature and chemical environment operating conditions. The meeting topics will span the gamut from fundamentals through important applications. The session topics have been chosen to attract researchers with a wide range of interests that relate to nanoporous membrane materials. The broader impact of this meeting is two-fold.  The dissemination of knowledge in this rapidly expanding field to researchers with a wide range of interests should provide intellectual stimulation for new and promising research thrusts. Also, the interactions between researchers should facilitate collaborative interdisciplinary efforts that will move the field in novel directions. \r\n",
