 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete location theory is concerned with combinatorial optimization\r\nproblems in which spatial considerations play a prominent role.  For\r\nexample, one basic discrete location problem asks for a specified\r\nnumber of points in a given metric space to be marked so that the sum,\r\nover all points, of the distance to the nearest marked point is\r\nminimized.  Peer-to-peer computing is an emerging discipline concerned\r\nwith the seamless interconnection of dynamic collections of nodes for\r\nthe purpose of sharing computational resources such as bandwidth,\r\nstorage, and CPU.  A good first-order model of peer-to-peer networks\r\nassumes that the nodes reside in a metric space, and that the cost of\r\ncommunication between a pair of nodes is given by the corresponding\r\ndistance in the underlying metric space.  Because the internode\r\ndistances in peer-to-peer networks tend to vary significantly, spatial\r\nconsiderations play a prominent role in peer-to-peer computing.  This\r\nproject addresses a number of basic questions in discrete location\r\ntheory, emphasizing questions that arise in applications to\r\npeer-to-peer computing.\r\n\r\nDiscrete location theory is not a new subject, having been studied\r\nwithin the operations research community for decades.  Many of the\r\nbasic problems in this area are NP-hard, so practitioners have\r\ngenerally resorted to heuristics in order to search for optimal or\r\nnear-optimal solutions.  Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the\r\nsolutions returned by these heuristics can be arbitrarily far from\r\noptimal.  In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in\r\nthe design and analysis of provably good approximation algorithms for\r\nNP-hard optimization problems.  This research has shed considerable\r\nlight on the approximability of a number of basic discrete location\r\nproblems, for example, establishing that the optimal solution to the\r\nfacility location problem can be approximated to within a factor of\r\n1.52 in polynomial time, but that achieving a factor of 1.463 would\r\nviolate a standard hardness assumption.  Given such theoretical\r\nadvances, it is natural to ask whether these provably good\r\napproximation algorithms are preferable to existing heuristics in\r\npractice. For the most part this is not the case, since the running\r\ntimes of these approximation algorithms, while polynomial, tend to be\r\nconsiderably higher than those of existing heuristics.  For the\r\ndiscrete location problems addressed in this project, the primary\r\nobjective of this project is to develop constant-factor approximation\r\nalgorithms that are comparable to (or improve upon) existing\r\nheuristics in terms of running time and ease of implementation.\r\n\r\nPeer-to-peer computing is a young field with obvious potential, but\r\nsignificant technical challenges remain to be addressed before this\r\npotential can be realized.  More scalable than client-server,\r\npeer-to-peer enables a wide-range of large-scale applications that\r\ncannot be supported by existing server farms. Furthermore,\r\npeer-to-peer computing holds the promise of delivering\r\nsupercomputer-like performance to the average user.  But before such\r\nlofty goals can be achieved, existing peer-to-peer systems need to be\r\nsignificantly refined and extended in order to comprehensively address\r\nissues related to locality, concurrency, fault tolerance,\r\nself-stabilization, heterogeneity, cost sharing, and security.  This\r\nproject investigates novel approaches to the design of practical and\r\nprovably efficient peer-to-peer infrastructure, emphasizing\r\nlocality-related concerns.",
