 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada in Reno will upgrade an X-ray diffractometer with an area detector for small molecule crystallography. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) investigations of metal-metal interactions in large cage complexes known as metallocryptands, probing metallophilic interactions between simple trigonally coordinated platinum and palladium phosphine complexes and heavy metal ions; b) development of ligands for aqueous or biphasic organometallic catalysis; c) synthesis and characterization of benzoid nanostructures focused on ribbon and helical structures; d) directed synthesis of short nanotubes and perfluorinated carbon based materials including fullerenes; e) investigations of hydrogen bonding in oligopyrrole species; f) studies in metal promoted syntheses; g) development of catalysts for the addition of nucleophiles to terminal alkynes; h) construction of metal templates for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral phosphiranes and phosphirenes; and i) the investigation of structure-order-property relationships in lyotropic chromonic mesogens. \r\nThe x -ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including materials chemistry and the preparation of more efficient catalysts. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Nevada in Reno will have a unique and important opportunity to participate in a chemical research technique that many will depend upon in their future jobs.  \r\n",
