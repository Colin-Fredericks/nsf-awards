 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) renewal proposal, the PI\r\nproposes to undertake two new projects, i.e., (1) development and application of a\r\ntransport theory with Bose-Einstein statistics for ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions\r\nat Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and (2) investigations of nov-\r\nel properties of dense neutron-rich matter with energetic radioactive beams. The large\r\nnumber of pions produced and thus the high value of pion phase-space density reached\r\nin heavy-ion collisions at RHIC requires a proper inclusion of the Bose-Einstein s-\r\ntatistics (multi-boson symmetrization) in the reaction dynamics. The Bose-Einstein\r\nstatistics is currently neglected in essentially all dynamical models for RHIC. The\r\nfocus of the PI's work on the first project is to include the Bose-Einstein statistics\r\nin both the hadronization and the subsequent dynamical evolution of hadrons, most\r\nimportantly pions, within a multi-phase transport model. The transport theory with\r\nBose-Einstein statistics will be a useful tool for predicting reliably and interpreting\r\ncritically nuclear collision data at RHIC, especially the single-particle spectra, multi-\r\nparticle correlation functions and the collective ow of pions. It might also beuseful\r\nfor solving the Hanbury Brown/Twiss (HBT) puzzle found in experiments at RHIC.\r\nThe ultimate goals of the second project are to determine accurately the isospin\r\ndependence of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and to investigate novel properties\r\nof dense neutron-rich matter that was not in reach in terrestrial laboratories before.\r\nThese are important issues identified in the most recent U.S. long-range plan (LRP)\r\nfor nuclear physics and foundamental properties that govern many aspects of neutron\r\nstars. To extract crucial information about the isospin-dependence of the nuclear\r\nEOS, the PI proposes to investigate several experimental observables in nuclear reac-\r\ntions induced by energetic neutron-rich nuclei at existing radioactive beam facilities\r\nand the future Rare Isotope Accelerator, identified as the top priority for new con-\r\nstruction in the U.S. LRP for nuclear physics. Moreover, several novel properties\r\nof dense neutron-rich matter will be explored. These include the isospin separation\r\ninstability, the unique \r\n0\r\n",
