 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the development of a novel software tool for integrated model-based control design for Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) systems. The use of advanced model-based feedback control has become essential to meeting the increasingly stringent specifications for semiconductor processing. Phase I activity will be a feasibility study consisting of development of techniques for model order reduction and for speeding up Monte Carlo ray tracing calculations, specification of the software architecture, and closed-loop simulation of a generic RTP chamber using the proposed framework. In Phase II, the software prototype will be fully implemented. \r\n\r\nThe final result of this focused effort will be a software package that will be used by semiconductor process engineers and design engineers at semiconductor equipment companies that manufacture RTP systems.  Subsequently, the RTP the capabilities of this tool will be extended to encompass other processes for the semiconductor and advanced materials industry such as CVD, etch, CMP, etc. The total market size exceeds $10 billion.\r\n",
