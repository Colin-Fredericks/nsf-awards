 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nThe PI's propose to produce a series of (U-The)/He apatite and zircon thermochronologic profiles in the southernmost Sierra Nevada region as a test of the very rapid tectonic denudation of the Sierran batholithic rocks by low-angle detachment faulting in latest Cretaceous-early Paleogene time. This phase of denudation exposed an oblique crustal section through the southernmost Sierra Nevada batholith to a paleodepth of ~35 km. Apatite He studies in the greater Sierra Nevada region to the north have revealed the persistence of a high standing orogenic plateau with long wavelength-high relief fluvial dominated topography during the same time interval. In marked contrast the deepest level exposures of the batholith to the south had subsided to marine conditions by early Eocene time in conjunction with tectonic denudation. These profound along strike variations in the paleogeomorphology of the Sierran magmatic arc can be linked to the tectonic removal of the sub-batholithic mantle lithosphere beneath the southernmost Sierra-northern Mojave Desert region by a shallow flat-slab segment of the subducting\r\noceanic plate, and the related tectonic underplating of Franciscan trench-affinity\r\nmetamorphic assemblages. The PI's have identified an array of known and apparent high-\r\nlevel batholithic detachment sheets along the southernmost Sierra and northern Mojave\r\nDesert region that appear to represent part of the upper crustal rocks that were displaced\r\nby the detachment system. They have also identified modern topographic anomalies and\r\nanomalous structural-textural overprints in the basement rocks of the southern Sierra\r\nregion which correspond to the onset of steep gradients in batholith emplacement\r\nbarometry and its implicit depth of denudation. They interpret these areas to represent the\r\nremnants of footwall complexes proximal to the breakaway zones where the northernmost detachment sheets calved off the edge of the orogenic plateau. Vertical\r\napatite and zircon thermochronologic profiles are proposed across these zones as a test of\r\nvery rapid cooling and tectonic denudation. These profiles will be extended southward\r\nalong constant elevation profiles to the deepest exposed levels of the batholith in order to\r\nfurther test for regional rapid cooling, and to test for a possible southward migration in\r\nprogressively deeper levels of denudation with time. The broader goals are to relate the\r\npaleogeomorphic evolution of the southern Sierra region to lithosphere-scale tectonics\r\nand dynamics, and to relate these findings to the globally important problem of the\r\nupward migration and surface exposure of deep crystalline basement rock as related to\r\nuplift, erosion, tectonic denudation, and the evolution of lower crust and upper mantle.\r\nThe proposed research program runs for a period of three years and includes a vigorous\r\nprogram of sample collecting, mineral separation, geochemical analysis, and the\r\nsynthesis of the new data with existing geological and geochemical data sets. The project\r\nwill entail partial efforts of the joint PI's and their technical staff, and constitute a major\r\ncomponent of a Caltech Ph.D. Dissertation.\r\n",
