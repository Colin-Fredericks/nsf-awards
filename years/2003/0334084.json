 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of the proposed Workshop:\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to enhance the cooperation among\r\nvarious control groups and high school teachers of mathematics and science\r\nthroughout the United States and the world, to give attention to control and\r\nsystems ideas and technology, and to increase the general awareness of the\r\nimportance of control and systems technology and its cross-disciplinary\r\nnature among high school teachers and students.\r\nControl and Systems Science occurs in many different disciplines and\r\nits applications occur in a wide variety of technologies. It involves a variety\r\nof tasks, such as, modeling, identification, simulation, planning, decision\r\nmaking, and optimization.\r\nSome application areas of control and systems include transportation,\r\nmanufacturing, communications, processing industries, and financial\r\nmarkets. The basic control systems science influences and impacts a diverse\r\nrange of study, such as, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and\r\nmedicine.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed Workshop:\r\nThe need of modern industry for well-trained systems scientists is\r\ngrowing and changing, due to the marketplace pressures and the advances in\r\ntechnology. Future generations of our students will have to be broadly\r\neducated to cope with cross-disciplinary applications and rapidly changing\r\ntechnology. The backgrounds of our students are changing too. They are\r\nbetter prepared to work with modern computing technologies. Thus the time\r\nis ripe for major renovations in mathematics and science education in high\r\nschool. It is important to develop a cross-disciplinary set of examples,\r\ndemonstrations and laboratory exercises that illustrate systems and control\r\nacross the entire spectrum of mathematics and science. We will share with\r\nhigh school teachers our successful control stories, existing tools and\r\nexperiments. There is much to be gained by the sharing of educational\r\nexperiences and practices.",
