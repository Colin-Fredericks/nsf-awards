The tentative proposed workshop dates are Friday and Saturday October 17-18, 2003.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers and innovators from both academia and industry in order to discuss the open problems and future directions of information theory and computer science. More specifically, the goals of this workshop are to:\r\n\r\nProvide a contextual basis for understanding the interplay between information theory and algorithmic aspects of computer science;\r\n\r\nAssess the potential impact of computer science and information theory on emerging areas and technology such as bio-informatics and multimedia informatics, and vice versa;\r\n\r\nIdentify and characterize the major research issues associated with the design, development, and deployment of information systems and algorithms behind them;\r\n\r\nDevelop a conceptual framework for future cross-cutting research activities;\r\n\r\nPresent recommendations to NSF on how to promote research excellence in the interplay between IT and CS.\r\n",
