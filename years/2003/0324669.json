 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe research is aimed at developing a novel cost-effective method for the production of\r\nhigh performance thin-sheet fabric-reinforced cement composites. Thin elements (about 10 mm thickness)\r\nrepresent a major category of cement-based composites and may be used as wall panels, exterior siding,\r\ntiles, roofing members, and pressure pipes. For such elements addition of reinforcement is essential in\r\norder to improve the tensile and flexural performance. The proposed fabric-cement systems have the\r\npotential to be used as structural load bearing members, thus competing with other board type materials\r\nsuch as wood, synthetics, or metals.\r\n The challenge in developing an industrial production method to produce\r\nthin sheet cement elements with fabrics is not only technological, but also scientific, as it is demonstrated\r\nthat the production method can have substantial impact on the properties of the final product. To\r\npractically use fabric-cement composites, an industrial cost-effective production process such as the\r\npultrusion process is proposed here. The main scientific goals of this research are: 1) development of the\r\npultrusion processing for fabric reinforced cement composites, 2) development of cement mixtures with\r\nappropriate rheology for the process, and optimal mechanical performance, and 3) optimization of fabric\r\nmaterials and structure for various new and retrofit type products, and 4) development of theoretical\r\napproaches to help the designers with implementation, commercialization, and use of these materials.\r\nThe intellectual and\r\neducational components of this work will involve the interaction of two senior personnel with several\r\nstudents in a project that is addressed at an international level. The potential for developing new durable,\r\nstrong, environmentally friendly, and economical, construction materials is a global challenge as we look\r\nat the diminishing energy and scarce natural resources. The promising combination of fabric\r\nreinforcement in cement composite products and the pultrusion process is expected to lead to an effective\r\nnovel technique to produce a new class of high performance fabric-cement composite materials. Such\r\nbreakthrough may open the way for a multitude of new products and applications. It will also address an\r\neconomical means of retrofitting existing reinforced concrete structures and masonry walls. The short\r\nterm objectives include the development of economical materials and processes to manufacture them. The\r\nlong term objective of this project is to present to the engineering community an alternative building\r\nmaterial fit for the 21st century.\r\n\r\n",
