Current methods for detection of biological warfare agents use sensors that detect binding of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identification requires prior knowledge of the DNA of interest. Unfortunately, these techniques may  not be capable of detecting those biological warfare agents that have been genetically altered.  In addition, the search for life on other planets would greatly benefit from the development of a device that is capable of detecting the presence of DNA without relying on the use of biochemical reagents.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations at the University of Virginia have demonstrated that DNA has\r\nnumerous resonant modes in the millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequency range (30-3000 GHz). These resonant modes have been investigated using Fourier transform spectroscopy and it has been discovered that the position and strengths of these vibrational modes are sensitive to the specific structure of the DNA. Thus, it is possible through the tabulation of the frequency response of relevant DNA sequences to detect and identify DNA by spectroscopic measurements in the millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequency range.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this CAREER proposal is to investigate the possibility of integrating the interferometer of a millimeter-wave Fourier-transform spectrometer on a single chip. This will be made possible through the application of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices to the development of a true-time delay phase shifter. Specifically, a multibit distributed MEMS transmission line phase shifter will be developed from 100-200 GHz and integrated with a set of Lange couplers to form the integrated interferometer. This chip will be assembled with a broadband frequency source and a detector that are being developed by other researchers at the University of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe University of Virginia chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) has an active community outreach program called the \"Garret Square Program.\" This program seeks to positively impact the community by having students share of themselves and their knowledge with the children of Garret Square, a public housing development in downtown Charlottesville. Through this program, the students hope to instill self-worth, academic excellence, and a sense of community by serving as role models. The outreach focus of this CAREER proposal is to develop an interactive multimedia demonstration that can be used by the NSBE in the Garret Square Program. The demonstration will cover the search for life on other planets and the use of MEMS systems such as the integrated Fourier-transform\r\nspectrometer.\r\n\r\n",
