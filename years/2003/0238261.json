 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge Domain Visualizations (KDVs) are a special kind of Information Visualizations (IVs) that exploit powerful human vision and spatial cognition to help humans mentally organize and electronically access and manage large, complex information spaces. Unlike scientific visualizations, KDVs are created from data that have no spatial reference, such as publications, patents, or grants.\r\nThe research component of this project comprises the setup of an advanced, open architecture, computing infrastructure for KDV education and research as well as the development and comprehensive evaluation of algorithms for incremental and scalable data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and spatial layout. Cartographic principles are employed to facilitate the use of skills traditionally associated with geographic maps for the exploration of KDVs. \r\nThe education plan includes the development of an Information Visualization Data and Software Repository that together with associated Learning Modules provides public access to and training for existing and newly developed IV and KDV software. The value of KDVs for educational purposes, e.g., to equip students with a \"big picture\" or global view of teaching material, is explored.\r\nThe project will make KDVs available as a new information access and management tool that has the potential to dramatically improve the communication of scientific results for students, researchers, agencies, R&D managers, industry, data providers, and society; (2) create an advanced computing infrastructure for IV/KDV researchers to contribute, run, and compare new and existing algorithms on diverse data sets; and (3) improve IV/KDV teaching, training and learning by means of an online IV/KDV repository, associated learning modules, as well as a textbook. \r\n\r\nWeb page: http://vw.indiana.edu/kdv\r\n\r\n",
