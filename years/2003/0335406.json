 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nineteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles will be held at Bolton's\r\nLanding, Lake George, New York, October 19-22, 2003. For over 30 years SOSP has been the\r\nleading forum for innovative research in operating systems. Like its predecessors, SOSP\r\n2003 will bring together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the\r\nlatest results. In addition to such traditional topics as the performance, functionality,\r\nand security of kernels, file systems, and networks, this year's conference will place\r\nincreasing attention on such emerging topics as ubiquitous and mobile computing, sensor\r\nnetworks, overlay and peer-to-peer communications, and power management. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy papers will be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems for possible\r\njournal publication. There will also be poster and work-in-progress sessions for the\r\npresentation of promising preliminary work.\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support the attendance of 20 US-based graduate students.\r\nParticipation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate\r\nschool experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and\r\nto be exposed to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal will make\r\npossible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.",
