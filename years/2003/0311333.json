 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large communication networks, such as the Web or the Internet, give rise to \r\na number of challenging algorithmic questions. Our increased dependence on\r\nnetworks means that reliability and availability of the communication\r\ninfrastructure is becoming more critical than ever. This project will consider\r\nsome of the algorithmic question raised by such networks. The goal of\r\nthe project is to develop algorithms with provable performance guarantees.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on two closely related issues. Over the last 20 years or \r\nso, many powerful techniques have been developed for approximation algorithms. \r\nThis project focuses on developing new algorithmic techniques, and aims to \r\ndevelop new techniques for approximation algorithms, and obtain large improvements \r\nin the achievable solution quality for a number of important problems, \r\nwhere the previous techniques failed.\r\n\r\nA second goal of the project is to develop algorithmic techniques for the \r\ndistributed, and selfish environment of large networks, like the Internet. \r\nIn such settings the traditional approach of algorithm design is not \r\nappropriate: there is no single entity that has the information or the power \r\nto run such an algorithm. While centralized algorithms cannot be used directly \r\nin such selfish environments, there are very strong ties with certain \r\nalgorithmic techniques and some of the central questions in algorithmic game \r\ntheory. This project considers two of these issues, cost-sharing and the\r\nprice of anarchy. The project will develop new methods for designing\r\ncost-sharing algorithms, and understanding what environments lead to\r\nlow price of anarchy. The cost-sharing problem is closely related to the \r\nprimal dual method of approximation algorithms. Evaluating the price of \r\nanarchy is closely related to approximation algorithms based on local search.\r\n\r\n",
