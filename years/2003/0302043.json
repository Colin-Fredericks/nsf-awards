It turns out that,\r\nin many situations, it is possible to describe a canonical way\r\nof reducing the equations modulo p. When A/K\r\nis an abelian variety, this canonical reduction is called the N\\'eron model\r\nof A/K. This reduction is the object of study in \r\nLorenzini's first three research projects in this proposal. \r\nFor instance, attached to any Neron model\r\nis a finite group called the group of components. When the reduction is purely\r\nadditive, it is conjectured that  there are only \r\nfinitely many possibilities for this group once the dimension g is fixed.\r\nLorenzini's proposed research will\r\nshed  more light on this conjecture and on other special\r\nphenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small prime p\r\nis not `good.'\r\n\r\nFor centuries, human beings have been fascinated with \r\nsolving Diophantine equations, named after the Greek \r\nmathematician Diophantus who lived\r\nin the third century AD. The field of Diophantine equations\r\nhas taken added significance in the modern world as \r\nit finds applications in a variety of areas, including \r\nencryption. Since the time of the Greeks, mathematicians have developed\r\nsophisticated tools to aid in solving equations. This investigator \r\nhas developed some such tools, and is currently working on \r\nfurther contributions to this field.\r\n",
