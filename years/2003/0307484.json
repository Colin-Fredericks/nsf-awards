These projects are the problem of existence of periodic\r\norbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems and the study of\r\ntopological properties of certain Poisson manifolds. The first\r\nproblem Viktor Ginzburg addresses in this proposal is the\r\ninvestigation of the size of the set of regular energy values on\r\nwhich a Hamiltonian system does not have periodic orbits. By the\r\nalmost existence theorem, this set must be of zero measure and\r\nfrom counterexamples to the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture it is\r\nknown that this set may be non-empty. Thus the question is to\r\nbridge the gap between these two results.  Another series of\r\nproblems discussed in the proposal concerns the existence of\r\nperiodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems of a special nature,\r\nincluding those describing the motion of a charge in a (strong)\r\nmagnetic field or, more generally, the existence of periodic\r\norbits near Morse-Bott non-degenerate symplectic extrema. These\r\nproblems are closely related to the investigation of the\r\n(relative) Hofer-Zehnder capacity function and the Floer homology\r\nof certain Hamiltonians. The objective of the proposed research\r\nin the area of Poisson topology is to study connections between\r\nthe geometry of Poisson structures and topology of underlying\r\nmanifolds.\r\n\r\nHamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical\r\nprocesses in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For\r\nexample, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some\r\nelectro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are,\r\ntreated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical\r\nsubjects in the theory of dynamical systems is the study of\r\nperiodic orbits (i.e. cyclic motions). Periodic motion is the\r\nsimplest and most common type of motion after equilibrium.  It is\r\nbelieved that a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have\r\nperiodic orbits and systems without such orbits have only been\r\nrecently discovered. Yet, in all but simplest problems, finding\r\nperiodic orbits requires the use of advanced and powerful\r\nmathematical methods.  The investigation of periodic orbits lies\r\nat the very core of the modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical\r\nsystems. One of the main themes of the proposal is determining\r\nhow large the collection of periodic/aperiodic energy values can\r\nbe and showing that systems of a particular type carry periodic\r\norbits of all energies. This class of systems includes those\r\ndescribing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the\r\nproposed research has potential applications to physics and\r\nmathematical aspects of mechanics.  The last part of the proposal\r\nconcerns the investigation of connections between geometrical and\r\ntopological properties of a certain class of spaces arising in\r\nthe study of systems with symmetries and in quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
