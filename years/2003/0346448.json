 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this SGER project is to develop a smart textile prototype that can detect small amounts (ppm to ppb level) of toxic chemicals within seconds.  In this smart textile, chemical detection sensor components will be integrated into textiles, such that the fabric will serve as the platform for the sensors to detect toxic chemicals.  This smart textile will be subsequently integrated into the protective clothing matrix to sense the environment as well as to determine the integrity of protective clothing depending on the location of the smart textile.\r\n\r\nThis multi-disciplinary research applies a well studied sensing concept, spectral shifts of porphyrins in the presence of specific chemicals, to a new area and develops a creative concept to integrate sensor components into textiles.  The original and exploratory aspects of this research include the study of chemical detection capability of colorants when dyed onto cotton fabric and after laundry and exposure to perspiration and sunlight, and the exploration of the methods to embed spectral measurement components into fabric.  This research will provide a model to integrate sensor or other smart components into textiles and enable smart textile development for a wide range of applications.  \r\nThe team has collective expertise in sensor technology, protective clothing, and textile chemistry and dyeing.  Further, the team's prior experience in conducting large-scale research projects with varied collaborators provides risk mitigation for completing a quality project and the potential to seek further funding after successful completion of this SGER project.  \r\n\r\nThis research will be conducted by faculty at Oklahoma State University, an EPSCoR institution.  Students in the departments of physics, and design, housing and merchandising (DHM) will participate in this multi-disciplinary research.  Because the majority of DHM students are female and non-science majors, participation in this project may enhance this underrepresented groups' scientific and technological understanding.  Early alert and protection against toxic chemical can be provided by this smart textile for first responders, military personnel, and other specialized groups.  This SGER project will contribute to national security in the event of a chemical attack by terrorists.  This research is relevant to MPS' Materials Research discipline.\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community.  The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.\r\n",
