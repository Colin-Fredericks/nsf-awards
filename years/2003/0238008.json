 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nayakkankuppam\r\n     This project, which lies at the interface of optimization\r\ntheory, numerical analysis and parallel scientific computing,\r\nfocuses on the design, analysis and implementation of novel\r\nalgorithms for large-scale semidefinite programming.  A growing\r\nnumber of applications (for example, structural design,\r\ncommunication networks, combinatorial optimization, quantum\r\nchemistry, VLSI design) give rise to very large-scale problems\r\nwell beyond the capabilities of the interior-point algorithms\r\ncurrently in use.  The investigator studies (a) quasi-Newton\r\ntechniques in first and second order subgradient bundle methods,\r\nand (b) parallel variable distribution in interior-point and\r\nsubgradient bundle methods.  The goals of the project are\r\nthree-fold: (i) to develop convergence theories for these new\r\nclasses of algorithms, (ii) to develop fast, reliable and\r\nparallel software implementations, and (iii) to apply these\r\nalgorithms and codes to specific problems in quantum chemistry\r\nand numerical linear algebra.  The educational plan, integrated\r\nwith the research goals of the project, includes (i) the\r\ndevelopment of new graduate curricula in parallel computing,\r\nnumerical optimization and convex programming designed to train\r\ngraduate students to participate in, and contribute to, the\r\nresearch program; (ii) a revision of undergraduate curricula in\r\nlinear and nonlinear programming to include significant modeling\r\nand computational components.\r\n     Due to the wide-ranging applicability of semidefinite\r\nprogramming, the tools and techniques developed in this project\r\ncan directly benefit society by providing improved,\r\ncost-effective solutions to a variety of engineering design\r\nproblems.  The specific problems targeted in numerical linear\r\nalgebra are relevant to aerospace applications, while the\r\nproblems in quantum chemistry are of a fundamental nature with\r\npotential technological impact in, for example, semiconductor\r\ndesign, magnetic storage media, rational drug design, etc.  The\r\noutreach activities of the project promote synergistic\r\ncollaborations with a national lab and industry.  The educational\r\nplan enriches special UMBC programs targeted at educating\r\nminorities and historically underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n",
