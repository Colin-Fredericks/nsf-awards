 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11)  The Optical Astronomy Lab offers experiments in classical and modern astronomy.  The specific educational goals are to develop understanding of various physical principles, statistics, and experimental uncertainty. More broadly, the goal is to involve students in the exploratory process of experimental and observational science, with the concomitant development of quantitative reasoning and deep thinking about specific problems. \r\n\r\nThe lab emphasizes inquiry-based learning and peer instruction, and anecdotal evidence tells us that this Lab has been very successful, particularly in (1) empowering women to pursue career paths in science and technology and (2) providing all students with the versatility to embark on a broad range of career paths. \r\n\r\nThis project makes significant improvements in the course and, additionally, transmits these to the broader community. Objectives include: 1) Benefit from the excitement and motivation afforded by increasing the emphasis on modern astronomy; 2) Include spectroscopy, which is currently absent from the course; 3) Utilize modern educational literature to implement improved instructional techniques; and 4) Include formal evaluation to replace anecdotal evidence.\r\n\r\nThese objectives are being accomplished in two ways. First, the project is adapting certain aspects of the Harvard University Astronomy-191 labs. Several ex-Harvard Berkeley graduate students are participating in this process as the first Graduate Student Instructors. Second, astronomy faculty are collaborating with Berkeley education professionals, both to design even better instructional techniques and to design and use proper evaluation instruments.\r\n",
