 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) This project is increasing statistical literacy among undergraduate biology majors by adapting and integrating an applied statistics course developed for chemistry students by Lena Zetterqvist and funded by the Swedish Council for the Renewal of Undergraduate Education. This model combines the best practices in statistics education with a focus on discipline-specific applications. Students enroll in the statistics course concurrently with the first core course in cellular biology. Data are collected in the laboratory and analyzed in the statistics course. Results are interpreted, discussed and presented in both courses. Student motivation and interest in learning is increased by demonstrating the relevance of statistics to biology. By using applications that are meaningful, the students' anxiety with quantitative methods is reduced. After completion of the course, students are able to 1) use more statistical methods in their upper level courses; 2) gain more understanding from published research studies; and 3) meet the demands of the work environment, graduate and/or medical school. IBASE curricular materials are disseminated through presentations, publications and a course website.",
