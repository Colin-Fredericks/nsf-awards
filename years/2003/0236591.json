 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to use peptide architecture to incorporate bifunctional catalysis into small molecules.  Combinatorial synthesis will be used in conjunction with a high-throughput fluorescence-based screen and a subsequent chiral GC assay to optimize the reactivity of beta-turn peptides.  These small enzyme mimics have been shown to function as catalysts, and will be used to achieve kinetic resolution of simple alcohols, enantioselective ketene additions, enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation with various nucleophiles, and enantioselective conjugate addition of azides and thiols to achiral enamides.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Scott. J. Miller of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor Miller will focus his research on the development of catalysts that mimic enzymes found in nature for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals.  The educational activities of the award will include the training of graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in a multidisciplinary environment.  \r\n\r\n",
