The USNC represents the United States in the International Council for Science (ICSU) -- an international union.   This support is designed support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the international union in response to expanding needs in international science and technology through the efforts of volunteer members. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this USNC are to:  1)  Assure that membership privileges and obligations to the international union are fulfilled and that the U.S. community is appropriately and fully represented in international congresses;  2)  Serve as neutral fora where representatives of multiple U.S. societies and government agencies can meet to discuss trends in their disciplines;  3)  Work with other USNCs in the network to foster interdisciplinary projects;  4)  Serve as conduits of communication between the ICSU family and the professional societies and between ICSU and individual scientists; and 5)  Serve as incubators of ideas that are then brought to the attention of professional societies, NRC disciplinary boards or commissions, and others.\r\n\r\nThis specific proposal provides funds for two years for the support staff from the National Academy of Sciences, primarily to allow for the regular meetings of the volunteer members of the USNC , and in support of USNC activities related to the international activities of the IUHPS and ICSU.  \r\n",
