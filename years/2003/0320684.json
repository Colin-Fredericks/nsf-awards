The AMRG is currently active in a wide range of materials research and educational projects across the College of Engineering.  Additional support is provided for a graduate student and partial faculty summer support to ensure that the instrument is properly utilized to the greatest extent possible. Current research projects that benefit from this equipment include studies of advanced polyimide nanocomposites, cellular and foam materials, correlations between elastic and conductive properties of materials undergoing accumulated damage, and hydroxyapatite-based biomaterials.  In addition, in the polyimide nanocomposite program, this instrumentation will see use in a theoretical and experimental study of the viscoelastic behavior of  these novel materials.  In the biomaterials program the instrumentation will be applied to the design of hydroxyapatie-based materials for surgical implants. \r\n\r\nThis instrumentation supports the education of hundreds of minority engineering and science students and is a critical component of the developing materials education program at NMSU.  In conjunction with other facilities (including thermal analysis, ultrasonic characterization, SEM and TEM), the AMRG is developing a new course in Advanced Materials Characterization that will be a required portion of an interdisciplinary Minor in Materials offered to engineering and science undergraduates. This laboratory course will enhance existing theoretical courses in Advanced Composite Materials, Mechanics of Failure, Polymer Science, and Semiconductor Manufacturing. Additionally, the instrumentation will be utilized in a variety of undergraduate courses, in capstone design courses, and in outreach programs conducted to attract middle- and high-school students to engineering and science at NMSU.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
