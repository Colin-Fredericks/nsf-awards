 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPlanning Grant for the Enhancement of Science, Technology, Engineering,  \r\nand Mathematics at Dine' College \r\nProject Summary \r\n \r\n  Dine' College seeks a TCUP planning grant to evaluate its science, technology, engineering \r\nand mathematics (STEM) curriculum with the objectives of: (a) improving as needed upon existing \r\nstrengths in the health, biological and physical sciences together with mathematics; (b) expanding \r\nour capabilities in engineering and computer science, and (c) working with the College's Center for \r\nDine' Teacher Education and articulating universities to develop an effective discipline-based \r\nSTEM Education curriculum.  That study will then be used as the basis of an action plan for \r\ndeveloping a full implementation grant--to be submitted the following year--leading to an improved \r\nand expanded STEM program, ranging from a revised curriculum to improved classroom and \r\nlaboratory infrastructure, added faculty, and an upgraded working relationship with Reservation \r\nemployers and regional universities.  The planning period will be for 12 months and will include \r\nfour phases. \r\n\r\n* Phase 1 (August 15-November 15, 2003):  An overall assessment of the present STEM \r\nprogram within the College infrastructure. It will include the aggregate impact on students \r\nof course offerings in STEM; of STEM faculty; and of such physical resources as laboratory \r\nand classroom space, laboratory equipment, and computer resources. \r\n* Phase II (November 16-February 14, 2004): A course by course evaluation of the STEM \r\ncurriculum, including content, student preparedness and achievement, student demand, and \r\nteaching effectiveness. \r\n* Phase III (February 15-May 15, 2004):  Development of an institutional plan leading to the \r\npreparation of a full implementation grant to facilitate growth and improvement.  \r\n* Phase IV (May 16-August 15, 2004):  A preliminary analysis of Phases I, II and III, leading \r\nto the development of a plan for evaluating progress during the implementation period.  \r\n\r\nThis planning process and the implementation to follow will have the intellectual merit of \r\nadvancing STEM literacy within a significantly underserved population, Native American students. \r\nTheir broader impacts will be derived from the development of a model academic STEM program \r\nthat other Tribal Colleges will be able to use as a template in developing their own programs.",
