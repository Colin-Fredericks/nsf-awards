 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of special values of L-functions is a major, active area of\r\nresearch within the general fields of number theory and arithmetic\r\nalgebraic geometry.  Stark's Main Conjecture provides a link between\r\nspecial values of Artin L-functions and the arithmetic of the associated\r\nGalois extensions. In recent years, Rubin and Popescu have formulated\r\nrefined, integral versions of Stark's Main Conjecture in the case of\r\nabelian L-functions of arbitrary order of vanishing at the origin. Also,\r\nBurns and Flach, by reworking earlier conjectures of Bloch-Kato and\r\nFontaine-Perrin Riou, have formulated the Equivariant Tamagawa Number\r\nConjecture for certain classes of motivic L-functions. If restricted to\r\nthe case of Artin L-functions, the Burns-Flach conjecture can also be\r\nviewed as a refined, integral version of Stark's Main Conjecture.   The\r\nPrincipal Investigator focuses on providing evidence for, studying the\r\nfunctorial behavior of, and finding links between the Conjectures of\r\nRubin, Popescu, and Burns-Flach. He also works on developing\r\nGross-type p-adic refinements of these statements, as well as building\r\nbridges between these statements and the Theory of Euler Systems,\r\nEquivariant Iwasawa Theory, and the Conjectures of Brumer, Leopoldt, and\r\nChinburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe L-functions are mathematical objects of analytic (continuous) nature,\r\nencoding an enormous amount of extremely interesting and useful\r\ninformation of arithmetic (discrete) nature.  The main goal of this\r\nproject is to continue a program initiated by Stark, Rubin, the principal\r\ninvestigator, and Burns-Flach, and develop general recipes (conjectures)\r\naimed at retrieving the arithmetic data encoded in a special type of\r\nL-functions (the Artin L-functions), and follow these recipes (in other\r\nwords prove these conjectures) in several important special cases. In\r\nparallel, the Principal Investigator is developing links between these\r\nconjectures and other, already developed theories, dealing with objects of\r\narithmetic (discrete) nature, such as the theory of Euler Systems and\r\nEquivariant Iwasawa Theory. Aside from its importance for the central\r\nareas of pure mathematics called number theory and arithmetic algebraic\r\ngeometry, this research could have far reaching practical applications to\r\nthe development of new data encryption algorithms.\r\n",
