 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is the development and study of novel, inherently conductive\r\npolymer thin films that will be used for selective sensing of inorganic anions with emphasis on\r\nphosphate- and phosphonate-related species. The detection and quantitative measurement of levels of\r\nphosphate and phosphonate anions is an important requirement for drug testing and pharmacological\r\n(pharmacokinetic) studies as well as environmental monitoring. The sensing of these anions, found in\r\nfertilizers and pharmaceuticals, is aimed at aqueous environment and low concentrations (< 10 -6 mol/l).\r\nSensor materials capable of reacting to the presence of analyte by change of optical\r\n(color/emission) and electrical properties in a simultaneous regime will be developed. The combination of\r\ntwo independent modes of signal transduction will improve the selectivity and reliability of the sensing\r\nprocess. This will be accomplished by preparing novel polythiophene-based polymer materials with\r\nanion-selective receptors integrated into the pi-conjugated backbone of the polymer. The critical\r\nknowledge amassed during the PI's previous studies will be used to prepare monomers bearing suitable\r\nreceptors and electropolymerizable thiophene derivatives. These sensor monomers will be\r\nelectrochemically polymerized on the surface of transparent electrodes. Such transparent electrodes\r\ncoated with anion sensor material will be used to fabricate spectroelectrochemical cells, which will allow\r\nfor investigation of anion binding using two modes of signal transduction: changes in optical and\r\nelectrical properties. The two-mode signal transduction is expected to increase the accuracy of the whole\r\nsensing process, enhance specificity and make these materials capable of anion sensing in multi-anion\r\nenvironments. Reliable anion sensing in multi-anion environments will be achieved by using individually\r\naddressable transparent microelectrodes with multiple deposited materials bearing different receptors.\r\nAlternatively, similar effect may be achieved by copolymerization of two or more sensor monomers\r\nbearing different receptor units. These sensor-coated electrodes will be used to build sensor devices and\r\nwill be tested in multi-analyte environments.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is diverse. Polymer materials capable of sensing\r\nof anionic substrates in polar/aqueous solutions at low concentrations are rare. Efforts toward\r\nimplementing successful molecular sensors into polymer materials, which may allow the development of\r\nrobust/stable materials with improved performance, are therefore desirable. Particularly important in this\r\nregard is the idea of improved reliability and accuracy of the sensing process by simultaneous\r\nimplementation of two independent modes of signal transduction. This may allow for reliable sensing of\r\nanionic substrates that are otherwise difficult to sense. The approach of detecting the anion by change of\r\ntwo variables in a simultaneous regime may allow for sensing of multiple anionic analytes. This is\r\nparticularly important because, despite the great need, materials and devices that would provide both high\r\nselectivity and allow for multi-analyte sensing have not been successfully prepared so far.\r\nIn terms of the broader impacts, this PI would like to emphasize that the proposed research will\r\nserve for the advancement of general knowledge by investigating novel sensor materials. The proposed\r\nmulti-anion sensors would be highly useful in a wide variety of applications, mostly medical and\r\nenvironmental, for example to allow for a precise monitoring of drug metabolization thus stimulate a\r\ndevelopment of novel drug-metabolization assays. The development and investigation of such novel,\r\nconductive polymers with dual mode of signal transduction for sensing anionic multi-analytes represents\r\na venture into an emerging and far reaching area of research and technology. This PI's team will also take\r\nactive part in an interdisciplinary discussion focused on various aspects of anion sensing through\r\npublication and active participation in scientific meetings. Last but not least, the broader community will\r\nbenefit through the advancement of education thus contributing to professional training of qualified\r\nworkforce.",
