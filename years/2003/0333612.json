 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) seeks funding for an Abilene/Internet2 to better handle the demands of image analysis and processing. A recent National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) grant allowed the institution to upgrade the computer network in the main research building.  The wide area network now presents a bottleneck for collaboration with other institutions.  The connection, itself, will also support collaborative projects in the following areas: \r\n\r\n      3-dimensional Morphometric Analysis of Mammalian Neurons: A collaboration between MSSM, investigators from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  (NYU), New York University School of Medicine, SUNY at Stony Brook, and the University of New South Wales, Australia.  Researchers at MSSM study the structure-function relationship of neurons in the brain, employing advanced 3D microscopic imaging techniques as well as 3D image processing, rendering, analysis and modeling. CNIC investigators are using confocal and multi-photon microscopes to image  (in 3D) entire pyramidal neurons in the cortex at the highest resolution possible. This creates approximately 20-gigabyte data sets for a single neuron.  After the data is collected, it is exported to computers, where image stitching, volume rendering, deconvolution and 3D-image analysis is done.   This award will greatly facilitate the capabilities of off-site collaborators to access these large datasets as well as manipulate and analyze the data using unique software developed by CNIC investigators and hosted at MSSM. \r\n     Neural Mechanisms of Vestibular Function: MSSM researchers and collaborators at Washington University, the University of Utah and NASA-Ames are studying vestibular functions. Electrophysiological and microscopic studies are being performed to determine the basis for regional variations in afferent response dynamics across the vestibular sensory epithelium. 600 Mbytes to 1.2-gigabyte data sets are created using a multi-photo laser.  The ability to manipulate the data in 3D via access to volume rendering and 3D image analysis software hosted on MSSM computers will provide invaluable information to off-site collaborators. Furthermore, due to the length of time required to compile the data for any one experiment, it will be greatly beneficial for collaborators to review the data as it is collected (in real time) on the multi-photon microscope.  This will avoid any delay in feedback and permit the off-site collaborators to modify experimental conditions.\r\n",
