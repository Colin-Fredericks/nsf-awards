Bonner\r\n\r\nNorfolk State University (NSU) will continue to build the research competitiveness of the physical sciences faculty and national recognition in the area of photonic materials through the CREST Center for Photonic Materials Research (CPMR).  This renewal award will strengthen competitive activity in the areas of photonics, spintronics, and nanotechnology.  Research efforts will focus on integrated micro- and nano-structured materials with organic/inorganic and dielectric/metal phases, and their unique nonlinear optical, photovoltaic, and spin-related properties. These efforts build upon NSU's established research strengths in the design, synthesis, processing, and characterization of inorganic and organic optical and magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nResearch subprojects include: (1) study and engineering of basic physical and spectroscopic properties of random lasers and nano-composite photonic materials; (2) novel nano-structured organic materials for opto-electronics; and (3) study of electron-nuclear spin dynamics in high-spin systems for new spintronic and photonic applications.  \r\n\r\nEducational goals of the Center are to increase the number of underrepresented minority students trained in the field of photonics and nanotechnology and to prepare them for positions of leadership in emerging areas of science and technology. NSU will build upon the strengths of the existing MS Program in Materials Science to develop a MS program in Optical Engineering and Electronics Engineering and to initiate a Ph.D. Program in Materials Science and Engineering.\r\n",
