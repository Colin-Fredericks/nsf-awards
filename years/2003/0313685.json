 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a series of workshops to be held during 2003 and early\r\n2004, culminating in an \" Invention Assembly\" to be held in Washington D.C. in 2004.  The workshops and the Assembly will comprise gatherings of inventors and intellectual leaders in fields including education, history, economics psychology, engineering, social and physical sciences including cognitive science, law and medicine, plus other invited guests. The proposed workshops and Assembly have two basic goals. They aim, through a scholarly, interdisciplinary approach to:\r\n\r\n1) shed new light on invention, and on the special kind of creativity involved in\r\ninventing, and in doing so to place special emphasis on implications for education\r\nof young people.\r\n2) develop specific findings and recommendations of value to policy makers in their\r\nefforts to encourage inventiveness in young people, and to enhance the climate for\r\ninvention and the value of inventions to society.\r\n",
