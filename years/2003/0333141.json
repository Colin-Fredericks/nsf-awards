MAY-NEWMAN\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tSAN DIEGO STATEUNIVERSITY \r\n\r\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF THE AORTA DURING LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSISTANCE\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to improve the design of Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and their integration into the human body by providing detailed information on the 3-D blood flow through the native heart and aorta when using these devices.  The intellectual merits of this research program are to gain a fundamental understanding of the interaction of flow through the heart and nonpulsatile LVADs, establish the effect of surgical configuration and aortic anastomosis angle on flow abnormalities.  The proposed approach represents a new paradigm regarding the study of LVADs, through application of a systematic analysis based on fluid mechanics to investigate the interaction of these devices with the human body.  The findings of these studies will lead to further questions about the optimal strategies to improve continuous flow LVADs as permanent devices.  The broader impacts of this research program are to improve the performance and efficacy of LVADs for patients, identify optimal surgical methods for LVAD implantation, suggest strategies for LVAD control during recovery that optimize outcome, add to the information health care providers need in caring for LVAD patients and decrease the cost of treating congestive heart failure patients. The results of this research will be most useful to surgeons, to modify implantation techniques; to engineers, for improvements in LVAD design and control strategies; and to physicians treating patients suffering from congestive heart failure. \r\n\r\n",
