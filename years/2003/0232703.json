 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves developing an ion-assisted plasma-enhanced deposition process for producing solid-state proton-conducting hydrated metal oxygen cluster-based materials to serve as electrolytes in electrochromic (EC) devices.  Recent developments in infrared and THz sensors, superconducting electronics and EC thermal control systems require rugged solid-state electrolytes for low temperature high speed operation.  Hydrated metal oxygen clusters deposited from solutions can extend the performance of existing EC systems but are not compatible with solid state vapor phase deposition processes.  Eclipse suggests developing a modified duoplasmatron system to deposit thin-films of metal clusters serving as ion conductors in EC devices.  The objectives include fabrication of a microplasma cluster deposition system, selection of metal oxide precursors, deposition and characterization of thin film electrolytes, fabrication and performance evaluation of EC devices.  The proposal innovation is the use of enhanced microplasma deposition to prepare ionic conductors with controlled microstructures for use in EC  systems.  This effort will result in improved control of the microstructure of intercalation materials afforded by the proposed plasma deposition technique leading to advances in batteries, catalysts and nano-structured materials for electronics, optics, and low temperature applications.\r\n \r\nSuccessful completion of the program will result in the development of EC devices having substantially lower operating temperature, improved contrast ratio, faster switching speed and greater mechanical stability for use in terrestrial and space-based thermal control systems, in visible and IR sensors, and in optical data storage systems.",
