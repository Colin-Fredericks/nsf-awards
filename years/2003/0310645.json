Hence, the number of parts in the final\r\nrepresentation is always the minimum: one.  The research requires\r\nstudies in three areas: representation refinement, representation\r\nconversion and representation joining. The aim for representation\r\nrefinement is to develop new vertex generation schemes and\r\ntopological structures that allow local refinement of a subdivision\r\nsurface's control mesh while preserving the crack-free property of\r\nthe refining process.  The aim for representation conversion is to\r\ndevelop conversion algorithms for subdivision surfaces of different\r\ntype or subdivision surfaces of the same type but whose control\r\nmeshes are of different topology.  The aim for representation\r\njoining is to develop direct and indirect joining techniques that\r\ncan be iteratively applied to join different component surfaces of\r\nan object into a single surface.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will significantly\r\nshorten the construction process of a free-from surface because\r\none-piece representation makes Boolean operations more efficient\r\nand, consequently, increase the productivity of a design engineer.\r\nActually, in addition to their roles in one-piece representation,\r\nthe results in the first area will also significantly improve the\r\ncurrent art of subdivision surface theory.  They would not only\r\ninclude current refinement techniques as special cases, but also\r\nprovide more powerful mesh refining rules which allow both local\r\nand adaptive refinement of subdivision surfaces.  The results in\r\nthe second area will also make it possible for a CAD/CAM system to\r\ninclude subdivision surfaces as a new and yet more general free-form\r\nsurface modeling tool because B-splines and NURBS are special cases\r\nof subdivision surfaces.\r\n",
