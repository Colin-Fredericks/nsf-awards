 "awd_abstract_narration": "Italian democracy underwent a dramatic transformation between 1987 and 1996 as historically entrenched political parties disappeared and were replaced by new ones.  A variety of factors, such as the end of the cold war and investigations into government corruption, contributed to the numerous political changes of the period.  Closer investigation reveals, however, that many of the agents behind this party-system change in Italy originated and operated at regional, provincial and local levels.  This research explores the geographical dynamics of party replacement and electoral change in Italy during this period in order to understand better the overall process of political change.  Electoral change is often understood and framed in terms of a zero-sum game; vote gains for one party or candidate are viewed as coming at the expense of another.  In two-party systems like American democracy, such changes from election to election are referred to as vote swings.  In multiparty systems like Italy, electoral changes are often understood through the statistical estimation of the flow of votes between parties.  Such vote-flow estimates are frequently inaccurate because it is assumed that changes are homogeneous nationwide, when in fact such changes may vary considerably from place to place.  This research implements a geographic theoretical perspective and uses spatial analysis to clarify and better understand electoral and party change.  Since political behavior is not uniform across a democracy, it is first necessary to determine how electoral changes are played out differently in different places before a complete understanding of why such changes occur can be obtained.  From this viewpoint, levels of electoral change and types of change (e.g., when one party replaces another, when one party splits into two or more new parties, etc.) are likely to be more consistent within and between proximate geographic contexts because voters are probably responding to similar political messages and experiencing similar local circumstances.  Understanding political change through the identification and evaluation of such geographic contexts, therefore, is more appropriate than assuming uniform levels of change and harmonious voter behaviors across a country as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis research extends the large body of literature on party-system change by detailing the consequences of party decline and change using a geographic perspective.  By identifying how political changes are played out, insights into why such change occurs are obtained.  Such information is useful to understanding political change in established democracies, and can be applied to emerging and transitional democracies as well. Moreover, the project engages and stimulates current discussions about and the role and significance of geography within the democratic process. Finally, by implementing and evaluating recent methodological developments in the fields of geography and political science, this exploration into the geography of political change provides constructive research and educational opportunities for graduate students.\r\n",
