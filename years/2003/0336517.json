 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) is creating pathways from Silicon Valley schools through Foothill and De Anza Community Colleges (FH/DA CC), to the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC).  The goals are to: \r\n1) motivate and support students in order to increase the total number of community college students completing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses and transferring to four-year programs; and\r\n2) create effective supports for underrepresented minority students completing engineering degrees.  \r\n\r\nTo build these pathways, the project is creating linkages through collaborative coursework, specialized counseling, summer bridge activities, innovative online tutoring, Cyber Mentoring, business internships, and course-taking opportunities.  Strong faculty-to-faculty relationships are being developed across institutions through planning meetings, a Virtual Faculty Lounge for online discussions and a series of interactive projects and activities to engage faculty across campuses.  UCSC is creating a residential Learning Community of Engineers (LCE) and providing internships with businesses. Graduate students are working with undergraduates to develop technology exhibits at museums.\r\n\r\nThe project's objectives are to achieve by year five the following annual outcomes:\r\nAn increase in total Foothill and De Anza Community College STEM enrollments by 1245 and underrepresented minority students enrollments in STEM by 151;\r\nAn increase in the number of  Foothill and De Anza Community College students applying to the University of California by 107 and by 20 those enrolling in engineering at UCSC;\r\nAn increase by 208 FH/DA CC STEM students applying to UC system and by 50 those applying to UCSC;\r\nEstablish a baseline and increase by 100% the number of underrepresented minority students at FH/DA CC transferring to engineering programs at UCSC;\r\nIncrease by 56 per year the total number of underrepresented minority students completing a B.S. in engineering at UCSC; and\r\nIncrease by 200 the total numbers of students completing their B.S. at UCSC.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit: The project is studying the effect of the learning community on success of transfer students, particularly Latino students.  The evaluation design is measuring the impact of innovative use of technology and evaluating the essential components of the learning community.  The project team has a deep knowledge of mathematics and engineering content, and pedagogy and experience in supporting underrepresented minority students.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact: The project is disseminating information about a replicable model for other community colleges and universities to use in partnerships that create effective pathways and establish learning communities for supporting and retaining underrepresented students in STEM majors and engineering.",
