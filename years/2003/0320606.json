 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dickinson College under the direction of Dr. \r\nJohn Henson to support the acquisition of a laser scanning confocal light \r\nmicroscope.  The ongoing renaissance in the use of light microscopy for \r\nresearch and education in cell biology, neurobiology and developmental \r\nbiology has been fueled by the capabilities of confocal microscopy \r\nsystems.  They have become the instrument of choice due to their ability \r\nto \"optically section\" cells and tissues and therefore allow for the 3D \r\nspatial resolution needed to define structural relationships, along with the \r\ntemporal resolution needed to follow dynamic processes.  Dickinson \r\nCollege, an undergraduate institution with an excellent record of \r\nstudent/faculty research and an innovative science education program, \r\nwill use this confocal microscope to support student/faculty research, \r\nundergraduate education, and community outreach.\r\n\r\nThe confocal microscopy system will be equipped with a microinjection \r\nset up and will support a wide variety of student/faculty research projects.  \r\nThe mechanism of cell motility and division will be addressed in \r\nexperiments using sea urchin adult cells and embryos.  How the liver \r\ntransports toxic waste will be the focus of studies using cultures of skate \r\nliver cells. The turning on and off of specific genes during embryonic \r\ndevelopment will be worked on using fruit fly embryos.  The neural control \r\nof metamorphosis in molluscan embryos and the localization of memory \r\nmechanisms in the brains of conditioned day old chicks will be subject of \r\nother studies involving the use of this instrument. Undergraduate \r\nresearch students will be integral participants in all of these projects, \r\ncontributing to experimental design, execution and analysis as well as the \r\npresentation of results at meetings and the publication of the results in \r\nscientific journals. In terms of impact on undergraduate education, the \r\ninstrument will be incorporated into the teaching of courses in cell biology, \r\ndevelopmental biology, neurobiology, molecular genetics and \r\nbiopsychology.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a confocal microscope at Dickinson will have a number \r\nof significant and pervasive broader impacts. Importantly this instrument \r\nwill serve as one of the underpinnings for a new interdisciplinary major in \r\nNeuroscience at Dickinson that will involve coursework selected from the \r\nofferings of the Biology and Psychology programs. In terms of service to \r\nunderrepresented student groups, women undergraduate students \r\ncurrently make up roughly 75% of the Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular \r\nBiology and Psychology majors. We also envision making this instrument \r\navailable to faculty and students at Gettysburg and Franklin and Marshall \r\nColleges, the two other member colleges of the Central Pennsylvania \r\nConsortium, as well as using both the Pennsylvania Academy of \r\nSciences and the American Society for Cell Biology meetings as fora for \r\ndiscussing applications of confocal microscopy in a small college setting.  \r\nFurthermore, we plan to write up research-oriented teaching labs that \r\nutilize the confocal for publication in the new on line journal Cell Biology \r\nEducation. In terms of community outreach, the confocal microscope will \r\nbe used in a Howard Hughes Medical Institute-funded program in which \r\nlocal high school teachers attend summer workshops in cell and \r\nmolecular biology at Dickinson. The instrument will be used by teachers \r\nduring these workshops and made available for use by visiting high \r\nschool student groups during the academic year.",
