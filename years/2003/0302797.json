 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project starts the development process leading to an articulation arrangement between high schools, 2-year colleges, and the University of Missouri-Columbia to provide multiple pathways for students to enhance their technical education.  The fields covered include: industrial automation, sensor and identification technologies, programmable logic control, data logging and acquisition, database development and data mining, computer and controller internetworking. Other fields are also being explored as part of this planning grant.  The project is using the College of Engineering teaching laboratories at the University of Missouri-Columbia during the \"off hours,\" such as the evenings and the summer, when the high schools and two-year associate programs can access the technical facilities without incurring major capital expenditures. The planning grant sets into motion the mechanisms by which the articulation partnership can be realized, including the consultation of potential partners from all sectors, the definition of programmatic entry points, curriculum ramifications, and facility scheduling and utilization. As part of this pilot program the laboratory facilities of the University of Missouri College of Engineering are being used for the teaching and training curricula of the Columbia Public Schools Career Center and State Fair Community College.",
