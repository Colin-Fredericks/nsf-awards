 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a polycapillary optics-based micro-x-ray absorption spectrometer (XAS) system with a low-power microfocus x-ray source by building a laboratory  prototype.  The system overcomes limitations of current state-of-the-art systems in that (a) the x-ray source and sample are stationary; (b) a low power x-ray source will be implemented; (c) both XANES and EXAFS analysis are possible using the same instrument; (d) small spot microanalysis with a 15 micrometer x-ray beam is possible with advances in poly-capillary x-ray optics; and (e) the probing energy may be varied by simply choosing the appropriate off-the-shelf mono-chromator.   Custom poly-capillary optics will be developed, a new x-ray source characterized, and a laboratory system will be built and the performance of the  system  will  be  analyzed  to  determine  spot  size,  energy resolution, intensity, detection limits, and ease of use.   \r\n\r\nA  successful  micro-XAS system would be used to determine chemical state information of materials as a tool in manufacturing process control systems, or as for routine screening of field samples. It overcomes the shortcomings of synchrotron based  micro-XAS  systems  (size,  availability,  cost,  maintenance,  etc.)  and  makes it possible to perform chemical state analysis for monitoring manufacturing processes and routine evaluation of field samples.  \r\n",
