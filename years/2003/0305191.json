The PI has investigated and still is\r\ninvestigating different aspects of approximation of convex bodies by polytopes. In \r\none paper, for instance, she -together with her collaborator- proved the surprising \r\nresult that random approximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the\r\napproximating polytope  randomly on the boundary of the body) is as good as best\r\napproximation. Besides convexity tools, probabilistic tools,like concentration of\r\nmeasure, have proved  to be very efficient in convexity. The PI continues her \r\ninvestigation of such probabilistic results for advancing her research in structural\r\nresults in convexity and its applications to local Banach space theory.\r\n\r\n Past experience has led the PI to believe that purely theoretical concepts are also\r\nuseful in applications. She has experienced that the methods and results from these \r\nareas find applications in other fields of mathematics and in applied areas:\r\nGeometric tomography, a tool having its origins  in classical convexity theory,\r\ngives a method to recover convex shapes from its sections or projections. This is\r\nused in computer vision and image analysis, in biology and medicine where convex\r\nshapes(organs) occur naturally. Geometric algorithms find applications in computer \r\nscience.Tools from classical convexity theory and geometric analysis have proved \r\nuseful inquantum information theory. Convexity theory has  mutually beneficial\r\ninteractions with probability theory, Banach space theory,operator theory, the new\r\nquickly developing theory of random matrices,some directions of discrete \r\nmathematicsincluding problems in complexity theory, problems of statistical physics,\r\nPDEs,including non-linear PDEs arising from problems in convex analysis. The PI\r\nfinds it very stimulating to interact with researchers not only from other areas of \r\nmathematics but also from applied areas. She has already worked with  mathematical\r\nphysicists and continues to do so. In particular, she has recently started to work\r\non problems in quantum information theory where methods from convexity theory are \r\nvery effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
