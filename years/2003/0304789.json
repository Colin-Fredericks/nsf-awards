 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research plan is divided into three projects, each of which\r\ncombines combinatorics with cohomology and computation in some way.\r\nThe first project deals with certain systems of partial differential \r\nequations defined by a combination of discrete convex polyhedral data \r\nand continuous parameters.  These `hypergeometric systems' provide a \r\nfertile source of examples for the more general theory of holonomic \r\nsystems, and the goal is to shed light on how their solution spaces \r\nvary in continuous families, using the algebraic theory of local cohomology.  \r\nThe second project applies a computational perspective to the homological \r\nalgebra of injective resolutions.  It aims to demonstrate that exerting \r\nsufficient combinatorial control over the maps in injective resolutions \r\nof finitely generated modules over polynomial rings can make effective\r\ncomputation and storage of these resolutions possible, even though\r\ninjective modules are themselves seemingly intractable.  The final\r\nproject places summands in combinatorial formulae for certain\r\nuniversal cohomology classes in bijection with components in\r\nGrobner degenerations of orbit closures for algebraic groups.  This\r\ndegeneration technique should provide a geometrically positive\r\nproof of the Buch-Fulton conjecture for quiver coefficients, which\r\ngeneralize the famous Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics, the study of discrete structures, arises as an\r\norganizing principle in widely varying contexts throughout the\r\nsciences, including mathematics, computer science, physics, and\r\nbiology.  Applications of combinatorics occur not only when the\r\noriginal problem is itself discrete, but frequently also when the\r\noriginal problem deals with continuous phenomena.  For instance, it\r\ncan happen that a single type of discrete structure can be imposed\r\nuniversally upon a variety of continuous systems.  This kind of\r\nframework often lends deep insight into the nature of such systems\r\nand their interconnections.  Combinatorial frameworks can also\r\nendow certain special systems with enough order to bring previously\r\nintractable problems within grasp, conceptually or computationally.\r\nConversely, within many fields, understanding certain special\r\nsystems whose parameters are defined in a combinatorial context can\r\nlead to methods applicable in general.  The projects outlined here\r\nwill broaden the understanding of how discrete structures arising\r\nin these ways can control phenomena in the areas of differential\r\nequations, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
