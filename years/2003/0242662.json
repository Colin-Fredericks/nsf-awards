 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports construction and testing of a biosensor intended to measure the strength of adhesion of cells to surfaces through use of acoustic shear waves generated by a piezoelectric device.  The sensor, to be called the Acoustic Shear Wave Biosensor for the Analysis of Cell Adhesion and Structure (ABACAS), is expected to measure mass accumulation in the nanogram range, chemical species concentration on the order of 1 ppb, and the complex elastic modulus for a large range of materials ranging from purely viscous to purely elastic media.  Several model systems employing polystyrene microspheres as cell mimics, polymer gels simulating extracellular matrix proteins, and controlled spreading of cells will be used to calibrate the ABACAS measurements. Standard tests for cell adhesion strength, endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and realignment in response to flow will be used to correlate ABACAS measurements with biological function.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, characterization of the dynamics of interactions between biomaterials and cells relies on techniques that require many samples for temporal definition of any property. The new sensor is expected to meet the need for reliable, multipurpose and low cost miniature instrumentation for characterization of such interactions, allowing real-time measurements using a single sample.\r\n\r\nDevelopments from the ABACAS project in both sensor design and cellular mechanics will also be incorporated into the institution's curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  An undergraduate sequence on Biosensors taught by the PI will use ABACAS as both an example to illustrate lecture topics and a laboratory exercise.  ABACAS will also be used as part of a a graduate course in Cellular Biomechanics to emphasize the relationship between theoretical modeling and experimental design in characterizing the mechanics of cell behavior. In addition, the project will be incorporated into the Biosensors Collaboratory, a unique on-line environment that gives access to the laboratory to collaborators and educational partners. This Collaboratory facilitates outreach efforts to 2-year colleges and high schools in the Philadelphia area. \r\n",
