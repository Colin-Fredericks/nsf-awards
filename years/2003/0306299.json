The\r\nfirst project is motivated by a conjecture made by two\r\nphysicists, Gopakumar and Vafa. The conjecture implies several\r\nsurprising restrictions on the Gromov invariants of a Calabi-Yau\r\n3-fold. The goal is to prove the conjectured formula by adapting\r\nsome analytical techiques developed by Taubes to relate the\r\nSeiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants in 4-dimensions.  The second\r\nproject's goal is to obtain new relations in the cohomology ring\r\nof the moduli space of complex structures on a marked Riemann\r\nsurface. Using the techniques introduced in a previous paper, the\r\nPI found several families of interesting relations, one of which\r\nproves a ten year old conjecture of Faber. The last project seeks\r\nto extend the sum formula for Gromov-Witten invariants to\r\ndeformations more general then those appearing from a symplectic\r\nsum. There already seems to be several interesting new phenomena\r\nappearing in the general case.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and\r\nsymplectic topology. String theory developed as a potential\r\ncandidate for a unifying theory of the universe, which extends\r\nEistein relativity theory. It is based on the idea that\r\nelementary particles (like electrons, photons) should be thought\r\nnot as points, but rather small vibrating loops. Working out the\r\ndetails of this theory turned out to be quite delicate, and has\r\nin turn inspired many remarkable results in mathematics. But also\r\nfundamental results in mathematics have inspired many new\r\ndiscoveries in physics. It is hoped that this project will\r\ncontribute to the increased interaction between mathematics and\r\nhigh energy physics. In the same time, one of the projects will\r\ninvolve graduate students.\r\n",
