 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an approach that combines two new, unique, and complimentary technologies to fabricate mesoscopic electronics and sensors. For example, thermal spray as an additive process to deposit a wide variety of high-quality ceramic, metal, semiconductor, polymer, etc. materials, with the precision subtractive capabilities of High-Speed High-Resolution Ultraviolet Laser Micromachining to fashion mesoscale (~10-1000 microns) devices on a wide range of substrates. The technology is based on a direct-write process that requires no masks, photoresist, or wet chemistry. The benefits of such a combined technology are vast, and will allow a dramatic reduction in feature size to the ~10 um level and below, while being able to utilize an enormous variety of materials and perform design iterations in a matter of minutes or hours, compared to the traditional 1-4+ week turn-around time for typical photoresist mask alterations/fabrication. \r\n\r\nThe potential commercial applications are unique and far-reaching. Examples include strain gauges, thermistors, thermocouples, thermopiles, magnetic and piezoelectric sensors, interdigitated capacitors for LCR circuits, antennas, microheaters for integration into chemical and biological sensors, and others. The devices can be integrated into existing components and embedded or overcoated for added reliability and survivability in harsh environments.",
