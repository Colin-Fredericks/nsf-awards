Since October 1, 2001, Systemic Research, Inc. has been working on this two-year NSF grant titled \"Mathematics and Science Education in Rural America: An Evaluative Study of NSF's Rural Systemic Initiative.\"  Hence, the proposal requests support to continue collecting data through the 2002-03 school year.  The collection and analysis of the 2002-2003 data will complete a decade of ongoing research and evaluation of the RSI. The current activities of the grant to be expanded as a result of a one-year extension are:\r\nDevelopment, collection, and compilation of RKID-2004\r\nRural Math and Science Indicator Report:2004\r\nPublication of updated RSI Case Stories with additional indicator data\r\nRSI/RKID web site upgrade for enhanced communication, RKID management, and dissemination\r\nRSI/RKID Annual Workshop\r\nRSI Advisory Panel Meeting\r\nDissemination of study results through printed copy, CD-ROM, and web.\r\n",
