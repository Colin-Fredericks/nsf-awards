 "awd_abstract_narration": "LGORITHMIC SYNTHESIS OF EMBEDDED CONTROLLERS\r\n\r\nIn recent years, microprocessors have invaded the physical world, resulting in \r\nsophisticated but complicated networked embedded systems that defy theoretical \r\nunderstanding, resulting in inadequate design tools for the modern embedded \r\nsystem engineer. Embedded systems require the development of new theories, \r\nmethods, and tools providing the correct understanding of these systems and\r\naccelerated analysis and design methods in order to ensure safety\r\nbut also substantially decrease their design time.   Embedded systems require very novel, very challenging specifications that have \r\nto deal with synchronization, sequencing, and temporal ordering of different\r\ntasks.  Mathematically formulating such desired specifications cannot be \r\nachieved using traditional mathematical formulations in control theory.  On the \r\nother hand, computer aided verification has popularized the use of several \r\ntemporal logics to describe complex specifications. However, the emphasis has \r\nbeen on verification of these properties for purely discrete systems, and not \r\non synthesis for systems with a continuous component.\r\n\r\nIn this research, a novel approach for automatically synthesizing hybrid \r\ncontrollers is pursued in order to satisfy specifications that are expressed \r\nin temporal logics. In particular, methodologies are developed to extract \r\nfinite abstractions of linear control systems, that will be used to design \r\ncontrollers meeting the desired temporal logic specifications.  Contrary to \r\nother approaches, this project considers specification dependent abstractions \r\nfor continuous control systems as opposed to continuous dynamical systems. The \r\nproposed framework will provide algorithms and tools for the computation of \r\ndiscrete controllers, which by refinement will lead to embedded, hybrid \r\ncontrollers for the original system while providing performance and  \r\ncorrectness guarantees.\r\n\r\nThe educational agenda of the proposal focuses on the development of a cross-\r\ndepartmental, undergraduate, signals and systems course that broadens the \r\ndefinition of systems in order to capture software and hardware systems in \r\naddition to traditional control or communication systems.  This course has been \r\ncarefully coordinated with recent curriculum changes and aims at the \r\neducational uniformity of signals and systems concepts in both the discrete and \r\nthe continuous world.  \r\n",
