To meet growing computing needs high performance systems using multiple processors are employed to reduce task latency.  While using multiple processors has been successful in reducing the computation time, the overall processing time has not been reduced proportionally.  This is due to the communication overhead that occurs when data is exchanged between these processing elements.  This research will develop techniques to reduce this communication overhead (thereby improving their throughput) by scheduling these message transmissions. \r\n\r\nThe expected results include new scheduling techniques that can be used in a variety of computing environments such as supercomputers, networks of workstations, mobile networks, the Internet and other architectures to improve overall performance.  Additionally, this project will have a profound positive effect on the Computer Science department at IUSB and specifically on the training of its students.  The department recently started a Master's degree program and this project will provide the first support for a graduate student and the initial equipment for a cluster of workstations laboratory. Recent studies have shown that involvement in research efforts greatly enhances the education of undergraduate students.  With the support of this project, undergraduate students at IUSB will now be given an opportunity to become involved in an exciting research endeavor.\r\n\r\n",
