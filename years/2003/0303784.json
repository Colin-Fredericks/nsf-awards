 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering provides Gerardo Mendoza of Temple University support for a week-long workshop on recent progress in the fields of several complex variables and partial differential equations to be held in Serra Negra, Brazil, in August 2003.  Topics to be covered include 1) local solvability in locally integrable structures; 2) mappings in CR geometry; 3) solvability in L^p of vector fields; and 4) analytic hypoellipticity and the Treves Conjecture.  Current research trends will be the focus of three mini courses designed primarily for graduate students and recent Ph.D.s on the topics of solvability in locally integrable structures, vector bundles in partial differential equations, and equivalences in CR geometry.  Co-sponsoring organizers in Brazil are Jorge Hounie from Universidade do Sao Carlos and Paulo Cordaro of Universidade do Sao Paulo.\r\n\r\nBrazil has a very strong group of researchers in the areas of focus for the workshop, and leading researchers from the U.S. and Europe will join them for this meeting.  Brazil has hosted similar workshops every two years, and these have led to fruitful collaborations between Brazilian and U.S. researchers, as evidenced by joint publications in leading journals.  Graduate students and those at the beginning of their career will have an opportunity to learn from and exchange ideas with many leading researchers in the topical areas of the workshop.  Invitees from the U.S. include several members from groups that are underrepresented in science.\r\n",
