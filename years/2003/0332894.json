 "awd_abstract_narration": "While much progress has been made over the last several years in understanding tornado genesis and dissipation, the exact factors that control the formation and demise of tornadoes is not known.  Recent research using mobile Doppler radars has revealed much about the structure of tornadoes and tornadic thunderstorms.  Many formation/dissipation theories, however, require an understanding of detailed thermal structure in and near the tornado and Doppler radars are not well suited to provide this information.\r\n\r\nIn this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, radiometric imaging equipment will be used to map the temperature field at cloud base in severe convective storms and in tornado condensation funnels.  The project will be conducted in conjunction with another NSF-funded project (ATM-0241037), in which one of the main objectives is to use mobile Doppler radars to study tornado formation and tornadoes in convective storms.  It is anticipated that the temperature field at cloud base near the storms' main updraft region may contain clues as to whether or not tornado formation may ensue.  This project represents the first attempt to sense remotely, thermodynamic information at cloud base in severe convective storms, using a ground-based mobile platform.  \r\n\r\nIf the project is successful, future field experiments could lead to an increased understanding of tornado genesis and an increase in skill in tornado forecasting.  The latter could lead to a decrease in deaths and injuries from tornadoes.",
