The planning workshop \"An IODP Workshop for Drilling of the Indian Ocean Fan Systems, 23-25th July 2003- University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado\" is sponsored by the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI) and the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation (IOMAC).  Specifically the award supports the travel of eight scientists from south Asian countries to attend the workshop and help in planning future cooperative research in that area.  The participation of these scientists is likely to lead to collaboration involving the U.S. scientists with scientists from the four countries of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \r\n\r\nScope: The interactions between the solid earth and the atmosphere and oceans are presently only understood in outline and represent a major field for scientific exploration in the 21st Century. Exploring the relationships between mountain building and climate change has been highlighted as a primary objective for future operations by the NSF funded Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  In particular, the growth of the Himalayas and Tibet and their effects on the climate of South Asia are recognized as the prime examples of climate-tectonic interactions in the recent geologic past.  Moreover, they have been the subject of several Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and IODP proposals for drilling the Indus and Bengal Fans. Together these fans record most of the Cenozoic erosion in Asia and must be accounted for if the relationships between climate, tectonics and erosion are to be quantified.  Because of their different drainage basins each fan contains a different record of erosion and climate change each of which must be deciphered if the behavior of the entire system is to be understood. By bringing together a core community of both marine and land-based earth, ocean, and atmospheric scientists and identifying the key scientific objectives, the aim of the workshop is to develop a coherent drilling strategy for scientific exploration in the region. This meeting will lay the groundwork not only for the final drilling but also for related oceanographic and geophysical work in the northern Indian Ocean prior to drilling.  The participation of South Asian scientists in the planning workshop is important to enhance the science, and to establish new working relationships with that community. Local collaboration is important to pre-drilling work in the region both onshore and offshore. Moreover, because of the desire to drill close to the coasts and within the Bay of Bengal, local scientific involvement will be essential for drilling and other related oceanographic work. \r\n",
