 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funds request from the NSF in support of the international\r\nconference Topics in Astrophysical and Underground Physics will\r\nbe used to support local and/or travel expenses for two groups\r\nof participants.  The first are young researchers, graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral research associates, who lack adequate\r\nresources to otherwise attend.  TAUP is an excellent meeting \r\nfor young researchers because of the opportunities to speak\r\nin afternoon workshops and to participate in the poster session.\r\n\r\nThe second are participants wanting to participate in the \r\nafternoon workshop on outreach and education.  Several key \r\npeople -- a public school teacher active in FermiLab outreach,\r\nan outreach specialist for a major science center -- will be\r\nable to attend only if we can support their travel.  The outreach\r\nworkshop is new to TAUP, suggested by Sandro Bettini, Director\r\nof Gran Sasso and the chair of the TAUP2001 organizing committee.\r\nIts purpose is to bring together outreach specialists from \r\ninternational underground laboratories (as well as other \r\nlaboratories) to discuss how outreach programs can be coordinated\r\nand enhanced.  The TAUP workshop is being organized by Roberta\r\nAntolini (Gran Sasso director of outreach), Len Bugel (involved\r\nwith FermiLab outreach to public schools), and Evalyn Gates\r\n(with the Adler Planetarium).  Bettini will also address this\r\ntopic in his plenary talk.  There is keen US interest in this\r\ntopic because of outreach plans for the proposed NUSEL.\r\n",
