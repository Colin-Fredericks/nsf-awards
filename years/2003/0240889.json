The REU site is designed as a ten-week summer experience and will provide research opportunities for undergraduates in the areas of applied electromagnetics, computer architecture and automated design, optoelectronic materials and devices, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, and telecommunications. Each student will work on an assigned project under the direct supervision of a faculty member with expertise in his or her respective research area. Participants will be provided library, office, and laboratory space. The participants' development will be closely patterned after that of graduate students conducting research. During the necessary literature search and formulation of the problem, the student will be closely guided by his/her supervisor. As the participant gains command of the problem, he/she will be given increasing independence, with the supervisor providing only occasional ideas and suggestions. It is anticipated that students, as a result of participating in the program, will acquire the skills necessary to conduct independent research work. The program will focus on providing an experience that encourages participants to pursue graduate studies in preparation for career opportunities in research.\r\n",
