 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Education Development Center is developing \"Mathematical Themes,\" a four-year high school mathematics curriculum organized along the more traditional lines of Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II and Pre-calculus.  Probability and statistics will be integrated into these courses.  The primary goal is to develop in students a robust mathematical proficiency as defined in \"Adding It Up.\"  Mathematical proficiency is defined by the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n*\tConceptual understanding:  comprehension of mathematical concepts, operations and relations.\r\n*\tProcedural fluency:  skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately.\r\n*\tStrategic competence:  ability to formulate, represent and solve mathematical problems.\r\n*\tAdaptive reasoning:  capacity for logical thought, reflection, explanation and justification.\r\n*\tProductive disposition:  habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one's own efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe materials strike a balance between the common wisdom and tradition that students need to focus on one piece of mathematics at a time and what has been learned about the added value of seeing connections among mathematical topics and to fields outside mathematics.  The work builds on and makes use of materials developed with previous NSF support, namely:  \"Connected Geometry\" and \"Mathematical Methods.\"\r\n",
