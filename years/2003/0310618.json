 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)    We are addressing the problem of limited hands-on experience undergraduate STEM and non-STEM majors have with modern NMR spectroscopy with this CCLI-A&I project. We are providing instruction in NMR spectroscopy to Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, Environmental Science and Education majors, as well as pre-health profession students. Students use NMR in a hands-on capacity, in multiple courses, at increasing levels of sophistication. General chemistry students use NMR in an introductory experiment involving compound identification. Organic chemistry students use proton, carbon-13, multi-pulse, and 2-D NMR in structure determination and equilibrium experiments. In Physical and Analytical chemistry, an upper-level elective course and undergraduate research, students use NMR and CAChe modeling for structure determination, equilibrium and kinetic analyses, and an environmental forensics investigation. We believe that this project provides the students an enhanced understanding of NMR and the use of this most important technique in solving a variety of chemically related problems. Just as important, we feel hands-on use of the NMR helps students overcome apprehension in using advanced instruments. It is our goal that students completing the courses involved will go on to graduate study and join the science and technology workforce with an enhanced, first hand understanding of NMR spectroscopy.",
