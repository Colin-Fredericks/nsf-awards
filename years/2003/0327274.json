 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the air-sea flux of carbon dioxide and the surface physical processes  controlling  it will be conducted during  the Labrador  Sea spring  bloom. The  Labrador  Sea is  highly  significant as one  of  the  areas  of  North  Atlantic  Deep  Water  (NADW)  formation.  During  the  late  spring months, the Labrador Sea experiences a strong plankton bloom, and is an intense sink for carbon dioxide. Deep convection during the subsequent winter mixes the carbon dioxide rich waters throughout  the  water  column.  The  newly  formed NADW is transported southward towards the Antarctic, via a system of deep currents. Given the circulation time scale of  order 1000 years, atmospheric gases within  the NADW are  essentially sequestered. While mid-latitude areas of the global ocean are equally strong sinks of carbon dioxide, gases absorbed into the ocean at these latitudes remain in the near surface waters, and are returned to the  atmosphere  on  the  decadal  time  scale. Hence  the  gas  exchange characteristics in the Labrador Sea are of particular interest because it is one of the few areas of the  global  ocean  that  is  a  long  term  carbon dioxide  sink.  The  ability  to  predict  and  forecast  air-sea  carbon dioxide fluxes over large areas is also necessary to quantify the adjacent terrestrial carbon budget.\r\n\r\nThe  broader  impacts  of  this  work  relate  to  improvement  of  our  ability  to  predict atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and to assess how it might change climate under various scenarios. The large uncertainty surrounding the flux of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and ocean prevent us from determining  the  partitioning  of  the  sink  of  anthropogenic  carbon dioxide    between  the  ocean  and  the terrestrial  biosphere.    This  uncertainty  also  limits  our  ability  to  accurately  model  future atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.  The process study we have proposed will improve the accuracy of the global  ocean  carbon  dioxide  flux  estimates  and  increase  our  understanding  of  the  causes  of  its variability. \r\n \r\nThe project will involve students as undergraduate and post-graduate research assistants. The University of Miami is a Hispanic Serving Institution and thereby fosters the participation of under-represented  groups  in  science  and  engineering.  The  data  will  be  made  available  through several  data  bases  via  the World Wide Web.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  active  outreach  activities coordinated through the Dean's Office at the University of Miami.\r\n",
