 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative research project entitled EcR and RXR Receptor Gene Function in Crustacea-Hormonal Signaling during Gonad Maturation and Early Development.  US PI David Durica, University of Oklahoma and  Gopinathan Anilkumar, Kannur University, Kerala will study reproductive function in Crustacea, particularly relating to the molecular mechanism controlling vitellogenesis and reproductive cycling.  This collaborative project will provide important information on potential ecdysteroid target tissues during oocyte maturation and vitellogenesis, and will be the first to examine ecdysteroid receptor distribution in the early crustacean life cycle. \r\n\r\nScope:  This study will add to fundamental knowledge of crustacean reproductive biology as well as the embryonic and larval development, and will provide a basis for improving shrimp aquaculture.  The collaboration will enable the Indian investigator to obtain more experience in the U.S. laboratory where he will have access to modern molecular technology and will be in a position to answer fundamental questions in the regulation of shrimp reproduction.  In addition to its international and training value, this research promises to yield important basic information that has the potential for practical use in aquaculture.  The NSF Division of Integrative Biology and Neuroscience and the Indian Department of Science & Technology jointly support this project under the NSF/DST joint program.",
