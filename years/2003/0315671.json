 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will in translate the knowledge and methods developed in the field of complex systems science into a curriculum appropriate for bioengineers.  Specifically, Binghamton will develop a vertically integrated sequence of six core courses (including both didactic and lab courses) to serve as the foundation of the technical education in bioengineering.  To complement this core sequence, this will also be developing a sequence of one-credit courses, to run in parallel with the technical core, which will serve to introduce bioengineering students to the necessary non-technical \"hard-skills\" and \"process-skills\" which are essential to successful engineering (e.g. problem-solving skills, management and business skills, decision making skills, and social, cultural and ecological implications of technology).  Explicit links (lateral integration) between the technical and non-technical sequences will be established, with the goal of helping the student learn how knowledge is acquired and integrated to create understanding.  The intent is to create a paradigm which students will find useful in the process of life-long learning, which is essential due to the short half-life of technical knowledge. \r\nThe broad impact of this program on the field of engineering lies in both the new type \r\nof engineering student we will be graduating and the extension of the approach to other schools.  The understanding of, and ability to work with, complex, non-linear dynamical systems will become the factor which distinguishes bioengineers from their engineering and biology colleagues, and will attract a new and diverse group of students into engineering, who are interested in pursuing a wide variety of career opportunities building on this expertise.\r\n",
