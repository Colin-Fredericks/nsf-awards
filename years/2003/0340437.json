 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports the participation of seven US researchers in the US-India workshop on high volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete, its effect on greenhouse gas emissions, and the environmental impact of green concrete.  US PI Anil Patnaik, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and K. Ganesh Babu, Department of Ocean Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras are co-organizers of the workshop to be held in Chennai, India, January 2004.  The objective of the workshop is to review and disseminate recent advances in HVFA concrete and the use of fly ash in high performance concrete as a partial replacement for cement.   \r\nScope:  The workshop will promote greater awareness of the environmental impacts of rapid global industrialization/urbanization and the potential beneficial role of HVFA concrete.  US researchers have done pioneering research in the use of HVFA and demonstrated that it can partially substitute for cement without compromising performance.  Using fly ash in concrete will reduce cement content in concrete and promote the safe and economical disposal of large quantities of industrial by-products.   \r\nDissemination of the American perspective on the use of HVFA concrete will be of high interest to participants and contributes to US efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will publish the workshop proceedings.  This activity is also supported by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems\r\n",
