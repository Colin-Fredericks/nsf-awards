 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific objective of this project is to investigate all-optical approaches to atomic Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC).  The recent demonstration of all-optical BEC by this group provided the first new path to achieving quantum degeneracy in atomic gases since the pioneering demonstrations in 1995.  The method is surprising simple and an order of magnitude faster than standard BEC experiments.  In the new investigations being undertaken in the present project, efforts will concentrate on examining the mechanisms behind the remarkable loading properties of these traps. Additionally, the considerable flexibility provided by tailoring the optical trapping potential will be exploited to explore alternative trapping geometries, allowing for formation of multiple condensates in large-period lattices. This capability, combined with spin-independent nature of these traps, will make it possible to explore many fundamental issues of multi-component (spinor) condensates.  In a broader scope, the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases has created a new frontier of research in AMO physics with significant overlap with traditional areas of condensed matter physics. Given the potential of the field, it is important to explore different methods for reaching BEC, particularly methods that offer new capabilities, simplicity, or speed.  Research efforts will be accompanied by the training of students to work in this emerging new field.",
