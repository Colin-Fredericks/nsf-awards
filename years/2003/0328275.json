These materials can be applied to microscale structures of arbitrary shape with biomimetic features.  Largely inspired by nature, we propose an approach in integrating electroactive materials and control into a new class of cilia-driven microscale robots.  The objective of the proposed research is to investigate key scientific issues on: i) materials development and identification, ii) biomimetic design of microscale cilia structures, and iii) robotic controls.  The proposed cilia-driven microscale robot systems have a wide spectrum of future engineering applications such as drug delivery micro-robots and micro-colonoscopy systems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research program is to provide students with the expertise to broadly address the future needs of industry and academia in small-scale science and engineering as well as robotics on small scales.  Also, the proposed study will help increase the diversity in the research and educational mission of this effort.\r\n \r\n",
