This program aims to increase the percentage of women faculty holding degrees in Computer Science and Engineering  with the rank of full professor by forming and mentoring a cohort of women from the associate professor ranks. \r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the Cohort Project will be the involvement of 15 senior women, appointed as CRA-W Distinguished Professors, who will actively participate as \r\nrole models, mentors, and advisers.  The project will build a community of associate professors,  and provide them with mentoring, leadership training, encouragement and ongoing peer-support activities.  The program will include an initial Professional Development Workshop, a series of smaller meetings in conjunction with technical conferences/seminars, and ongoing electronically-based support activities.  \r\n\r\n",
