 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jason Halfen, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Department of Chemistry, is\r\nsupported for his project making new synthetic analogs for superoxide\r\nreductase enzymes. This family of enzymes has a non-heme iron active site in\r\na square pyramidal geometry. By preparing small molecule models of this\r\nactive site, we can better understand the bonding and three-dimensional\r\nstructure, redox chemistry and reactivity of the enzyme. More specifically,\r\nHalfen will be preparing and studying thiolate-ligated iron and cobalt\r\nperoxo species, the propensity of the model complexes to dissociate these\r\nthiolates, and representative sulfur alkylation and oxidation reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award is made under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)\r\nProgram and incorporates undergraduate education and training. The range of\r\nsynthetic and spectroscopic techniques proposed will provide a foundation\r\nfor undergraduate students pursuing chemistry or biology as a career. The\r\nscientific impact will include a better understanding of metal-thiolate\r\nbonds and how these ubiquitous bonds are involved in enzymatic processes.",
