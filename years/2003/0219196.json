The research focuses on the interface of cognition, collaboration and representational guidance and draws attention to issues that are universal in all interdisciplinary, scientific inquiry settings centered on enhancing understandingof technologically and methodologically sound ways to reach underrepresented groups and perform cross-cultural, collaborative problem solving activities over distances. Using software tools developed under separate funding, the project involves a rigorous experimental study of the mechanisms of cognitive change that are embedded in the social circumstances of learning. With the participation of high school teachers, college students and high school students, the project will contribute to understanding of (a)the function of peer audience to foster learning, (b)the most effective methods of technological support for communication between local and distal peers and (c) congnitively-guided pedagogies that are effective in enriching the learning experiences of students in various technological and instructional setting and in underrepresented regions and cultures. The project is geographically located in an urban setting with a large minority and under-represented population and involves college students, high school teachers, high school students and international collaboration. The outcome of the project will be a practical approach for effective pedagogies to elicit active learning in complex, interdisciplinary and technology driven environments that are expected to prevail in the 21st century.",
