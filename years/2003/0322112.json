 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a great deal of anticipation that nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing will usher in the next phase of industrial revolution.  Yet, the crystal ball is less than clear.  Although much work is being done to create a variety of nanoproducts, there are many issues related to the manufacturing of these nanoproducts at an acceptable cost.  The proposed conference will address issues related to the manufacturing of nanoproducts to accelerate the introduction of nanotechnologies as viable industrial products and processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed conference will be held at the University Park Hotel @ MIT in Cambridge, MA in April 24-26, 2003 for attendees from academia, industry and government.  It will be a single-track conference with an invited-speakers-only format. Distinguished invited speakers from two disparate groups - nanotechnology and manufacturing - will share their vision on nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing.  In order to foster interactions between the participants, a poster session is also planned.  The conference is expected to provide an opportunity to identify important technologies and manufacturing issues in nanomanufacturing among participants.\r\n\r\n",
