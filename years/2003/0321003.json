Post, Michigan Tech University\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant is to purchase a high speed imaging system that will record one-megapixel digital images at frequencies as high as one million frames per second. Standard microscope lenses can be attached to the camera, allowing for micron-scale spatial resolution. The electrically-powered camera is portable, requiring only a standard power outlet to operate, so that it can be transported to different inter-disciplinary labs.\r\n\r\nResearch faculty and graduate students from various departments across Michigan Technological University (MTU) will be utilizing the camera system in their research to resolve small time and length scale processes. The research activities that will use the high speed imaging system will address issues dealing with spray drop coalescence, fabrication of nano-materials from drops of liquid-solid suspensions, chip formation in machining, coalescence of viscous polymer materials, the spreading kinetics of low viscosity liquids, and collisions in sprays. Specifically, these projects will provide new insights into the details of liquid-solid and liquid-gas-liquid interfaces under transient conditions. This system will also aid in the development of new system for direct writing technology on the nano-scale level. Such technology could lead to improved quality and speed for fabrication of small sensors. In all the proposed activities the camera system is expected to yield significant insight into the relevant fundamental processes. With continuously growing research activity at MTU, it is anticipated that the proposed camera system will be utilized to its fullest capacity to investigate the behavior of materials at microsecond time scales and micrometer length scales.\r\n\r\nThe digital high speed imaging system will be incorporated into the PI's research labs, where it will enhance the educational experience of both graduate and undergraduate students working in the lab. The imaging system can also be used for senior design projects and undergraduate research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
