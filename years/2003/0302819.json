 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College, in partnerships with the leading researchers and policy makers in renewable biomass energy technologies, is establishing  a technician training program in this field. The Institute has recently converted the College's all-electric campus to a biomass heating system. This biomass system at the College serves as the focal point for the project. The goal of this project is to establish a biomass technology demonstration site in the Northeastern United States where industry and government decision-makers, students, and educators can learn about renewable biomass energy technologies. A long-term goal of the Institute is to produce replicable undergraduate curriculum for development of skilled workers in emerging renewable biomass energy technologies and policies. Specific activities for this one-year period include: expanding relationships to include new partners in the development of biomass energy; developing support among State and Federal agencies involved in renewable energy technology and policy; and creating an Advisory Board of regional and national stakeholders in the field.",
