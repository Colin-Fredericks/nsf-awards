 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twenty-Second Fungal Genetics Conference will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California, on March 18-23, 2003. Approximately 750 scientists and students from around the world will attend. The conference focuses on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi. This is considered by many to be the preeminent meeting in this area.  It promotes interaction between researchers interested in medical pathogens, plant pathogens, saprobic fungi, and symbiotic fungi.  The meeting will consist of four plenary sessions, four sessions devoted to concurrent workshops in specialized areas, three poster sessions, and informal discussions. Topics to be covered in the plenary sessions are fungal cell biology, fungal-host interactions, signaling and silencing, and genomes and evolution. Specialized concurrent sessions are planned to cover the following diverse array of subjects: fungal genomics, regulation of primary metabolism, evolution of gene clusters, mating and sexual development, signal transduction, DNA repair/genome dynamics, secondary metabolism and mycotoxins, stress responses, targeting and secretion of proteins, epigenetics, transposable elements, prions, the fungal cytoskeleton, fungal-plant interactions, photobiology and clocks, fungal population genetics, teaching fungal biology and genetics, medical mycology, experimental evolution and selection, spores, sporulation and hyphal morphogenesis, parasitic interactions with insects, nematodes and other fungi, and membrane transporters.  In this meeting strong emphasis is placed on the participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This award will help defray the travel and participation costs of students, postdoctoral researchers and beginning faculty.  Funds will be distributed on a need basis to those who apply for financial aid.",
