 "awd_abstract_narration": "Camden County College is purchasing a gas chromatography - mass spectrophotometer (GC/MS) to integrate gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry technology used in industry into all aspects of the two-year college biotechnology/chemistry laboratory experience.  Basic theory and hands-on use of the GC/MS begins in the Organic and General Chemistry courses, where it enhances the science experience of both biotechnology majors and traditional science majors. In addition, GC/MS is being implemented in the Chemistry and Society courses for non-science majors, the new Biochemistry courses (part of the biotechnology program), and Forensic Chemistry. In collaboration with the county police academy (located on campus) and the state forensics laboratory, students are using the instrument in real-life forensic applications. To maximize the implementation of technology across the curriculum, this project also includes extensive faculty development activities in the use, calibration, and maintenance of the GC/MS, as well as industrial field experiences for faculty at area Biotechnology companies. Focusing on inquiry-based learning improves student understanding of important science principles by reinforcing these principles with industry-related demonstrations and experiments.  With the adaptation and implementation of lab experiments across the curriculum, the students have repetitive use of the equipment and gain a familiarity with the techniques and computer systems used in an industry setting. This instrumentation is having a significant effect in raising the quality and scope of the science experience of two-year college students, facilitating inquiry-based learning and fostering critical thinking and problem solving skills. Appropriate assessment of project activities is being conducted throughout the project to measure improvements in student learning.  This project is having an impact beyond the biotechnology program at Camden County College. It is enhancing each course in the chemistry curriculum, and also cuts across disciplines, affecting courses such as genetics (biology), clinical chemistry and immunology (clinical lab science) as well as courses for the allied health majors.  As a result, students, especially women and minorities, are being better prepared to enter the job market directly, or transfer to a four-year institution to continue their education. Most importantly, this project is providing the surrounding tri-state region (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) with sorely needed, well-trained bio-technicians.",
