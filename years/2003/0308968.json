 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this grant is to build a strong research collaboration between the PI in the mathematics department, and the geophysics research group at Boise State University.  This\r\ncollaboration will serve as the prototype for a new internal program to build teaching and\r\nresearch collaborations between applied mathematicians and science and engineering faculty.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will begin the collaboration by attending courses, research group meetings, and assisting in in field experiments.  The PI's primary collaborator will be Professor Partha Routh, and they will work on both forward and inverse aspects of estimating three-dimensional distributions of complex resistivity from electrical measurements.   \r\n\r\nBoise State University, and its mathematics department, are growing and  building graduate programs in response to regional needs.  The development  of this cross-disciplinary research  program\r\nis an effective strategy for increasing both undergraduate and graduate research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
