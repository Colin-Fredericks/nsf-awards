 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Arizona under the direction of Peter Reinthal to collect, compile and repatriate data and digital photographs of biological specimens originating from Mexico for an international database project.  The Zoological Collections at the University of Arizona have one of the largest holdings of biological vertebrate specimens (fish, amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals) from Mexico of any institution in the world.  These specimens represent important scientific information for researchers who are attempting to understand, study, map and conserve biodiversity.  These specimens also were collected over many decades and can not be replicated or replaced.  Support for this project will enable us to digitally photograph specimens and incorporate the photographs and data from each specimen in a collaborative effort with CONABIO, an international biodiversity database project based in Mexico City, and the University of Arizona collection database. Such efforts will make this important scientific information available to the scientific community and general public.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, specimens from all four vertebrate collections will be digitally photographed and the photographs will be incorporated into our BIOTA database currently used at the University of Arizona.  All\r\nphotographs and data regarding these will be electronically incorporated into a biodiversity database project currently underway at CONABIO.  The University of Arizona will become established as a CONABIO node institution.\r\n\r\nThe information generated by this project will fill an important gap in our understanding of biodiversity in North America.  This project will make information and photographs of these important specimens\r\navailable for scientists, educational institutions, government and non-government scientists and managers and the general public. Importantly, Mexican scientists and researchers will now have research access to these significant Mexican specimens through their national biodiversity database.\r\n",
