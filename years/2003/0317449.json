 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel electronic materials of nanometer thicknesses are greatly needed for improved performance in a variety of technologically advanced fields including microelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, and chemical sensors. The leap into controlling thin film quality and composition at an atomic scale requires a novel process and a fundamental understanding of the surface reaction chemistry.  This proposal focuses on developing an atomic layer deposition process using a partially ionized gas chemistry, implementing state-of-the-art surface analytical techniques to characterize the surface reactions, and integrating these materials into microelectronic devices to test the electronic performance.  The success of this research will provide optimized processing of depositing ultra-thin electronic materials, and lay the foundation of future generations of faster microelectronic devices.  \r\n\r\nResearch outcome will be integrated into three courses developed by the principle investigator at UCLA to maximize the impact of the research, i.e., an undergraduate course entitled Semiconductor Manufacturing Laboratory, a graduate/undergraduate course on Surface and Interface Engineering, and a graduate course on Principles of Plasma Processing.  Two female graduate students in the Department of Chemical Engineering will be supported under this program to pursue their Ph.D. studies.  Senior research projects and summer positions will be offered to undergraduate students at UCLA, especially women, to work on spectroscopic data collection and analysis outlined in the proposed research and to help their long term career development in academia or industry.  Summer internships will also be offered to high school girls through the outreach activities established by the principle investigator to promote the interest of female students in pursuing Science and Engineering when they enter colleges.   \r\n",
