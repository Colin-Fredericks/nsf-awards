The separation mechanism is based on nanoscale dimension variations of an attractive potential within the plane of the surface.  This will be achieved by using controllable chemical patterning techniques to create a surface with a variable surface energy.  Nanoscale patterns on surfaces will be produced by using the process of self-assembly of block copolymers to form etching masks that will enable the production of patterned structures with feature sizes of 10 - 100 nm on silicon substrates.  The micelles are versatile in that they can act simultaneously as pattern, mask, and resist.  Preliminary work showed that this method of electrophoretic separation of DNA molecules has the potential to significantly increase the resolution of molecules by size.  The current hypothesis is that DNA surface contact friction is the primary factor determining mobility.  Measurements of diffusion constants and mobility will be performed as a function of molecular weight and ionic strength.  Since the proposed method of electrophoresis on a surface does not require any topological confinement of DNA molecules in the direction of separation, there are no limitations on the size of the molecules to be separated.  In terms of the broader impacts, this work could lead to more efficient methods for separating DNA by size, which is at the heart of genome mapping and sequencing.  Accurate genome mapping could lead to improved understanding and diagnosis of diseases.\r\n\r\n",
