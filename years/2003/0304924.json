 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km baseline detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, and an additional 2 km detector in Hanford. LIGO's operating principle is to use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of seismically-isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small forces from gravitational waves (GW's) emitted by distant astrophysical events.  This project at Louisiana State University (LSU) supports experimental work to reduce the effects of ground disturbances on the detector and on future improved detectors.  It also supports the development of software that analyzes and monitors the data to look for astrophysical GW sources and to understand and improve the detector.\r\n\r\nIn a broad context, this project involves LSU faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates at LIGO, bringing LSU people the benefits of working with experienced LIGO and LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) scientists, and with apparatus that allows an excellent\r\npossibility of significant scientific discovery.  LSU is located approximately 35 miles from LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO) and has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  LSU shares its libraries, networking facilities, and workshops.  The impact on LLO, a close and extensive relationship with a nearby research university, is expected to be strengthened with continued collaboration.",
