 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to the study of moduli spaces of Azumaya algebras\r\nover surfaces. As a first step we construct compactifications.  A\r\ngeneralized Azumaya algebra is a perfect object in the derived\r\ncategory of the surface, endowed with a multiplication. It turns out\r\nthat these objects can be used to give completely canonical\r\ncompactifications. There is also a natural way to define stability of\r\ngeneralized Azumaya algebras (depending on some auxiliary\r\nchoices). The result is what we would like to call a GIT stack\r\ncompactifying the moduli space of Azumaya algebras. The project\r\nproposes to study these spaces and to use them to define ``Donaldson\r\ntype invariants''. In addition the geometry of the moduli spaces will\r\nbe studied for particular types of surfaces, e.g., elliptic surfaces\r\nand K3 surfaces. \r\n\r\nA complex projective surface can be viewed as a 4 dimensional space\r\nwhich is endowed with a lot of additional structure. The most\r\nimportant of these is a choice of a rotation map on the tangent\r\nspaces; it is a rotation over 90 degrees. A lot of research has been\r\ndone to classify four dimensional spaces which are endowed with such a\r\nstructure. This is usually done by defining invariants (for example\r\nnumbers) of complex projective surfaces which can be used to tell them\r\napart. A very basic example are the Betti numbers, which are\r\ndimensions of cohomology groups. To give you an idea, an element of\r\nthe second cohomology group corresponds to a 2 dimensional subspace of\r\nthe 4-fold. Of course we are not simply enumerating these; we use a\r\ncoarser equivalence relation (deformation equivalence).  \r\n   Here is a question: How many of these 2 dimensional subspaces have\r\nthe property that the tangent space at any point is preserved by the\r\nrotation that defines the complex structure on our 4-fold? Such a\r\nsubspace is called a complex curve on the complex surface. This\r\nquestion has been much studied, and is related to the Hodge\r\nconjecture. However, in this project we go the other way. Namely, we\r\nlook at other objects: Complex projective bundles over our 4-fold\r\ndetermine a degree 2 cohomology class as well, and they are typically\r\nnot those which can be represented by complex curves. It turns out\r\nthat by looking at all possible complex projective bundles\r\nrepresenting the given cohomology class we get a new space which, if\r\nwe can understand it, tells us a lot about the original 4-fold. All\r\nkinds of new invariants of the original complex projective surface can\r\nbe defined in terms of these moduli spaces. It is the geometry of\r\nthese moduli spaces that will be studied in this project. There is a\r\nlot of techincal machinery that has to be developed before we can\r\nbegin the exploration of more geometrical properties and part of the\r\nproject will be devoted to developing this machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
