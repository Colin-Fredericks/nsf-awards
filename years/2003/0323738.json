They plan to conduct field research to study the structural evolution of the Neoproterozoic Allaqi-Heiani Suture in southern Egypt.  This structure forms the northernmost arc-arc suture in the Arabian-Nubian Shield that is marked by linear ophiolitic belt. This project will test the hypothesis that the structural styles along the suture change from a fold and thrust belt in the west where the suture trends E-W to shortening zones and strike-slip fault system where the suture trends N-S.  Changes in structural styles might be due to the geometry of the orgon front and/or superimposition of younger Neoproterozoic deformation similar to that of the Hamisana Shear Zone. This hypothesis can be tested by remote sensing and field studies.  Research will be based on a two-month field trip guided by orbital optical remote sensing imagery including the newly acquired Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data.  Field studies will be conducted in southern Egypt during December 2003 and January 2004. The results of this research will outline the evolution of an important structure in the East African Orogen in addition to examining the utility of ASTER data for supporting geological mapping in arid regions. \r\n\r\nScope:   The results of using ASTER data in the planned geologic and structural analysis are of broad importance, since this study is on a new remote sensing platform.  Examination of a well-exposed Neoproterozoic suture and assessment of its variation in structural style by comparison with modern convergent plate margins will also have broad implications as to the nature and modernity of Neoproterozoic plate tectonics.  The international collaboration between scientists at Egyptian and U.S. universities will include training in digital image processing and ASTER orbital optical remote sensing analysis. The two collaborators have complementary expertise.  Dr. Abdel-Salam has experience in structural geology, geological remote sensing and the Precambrian geology of NE Africa, including extensive work on the suture zones of the Arabian-Nubian shield. The project also involves a Ph.D. student from the University of Texas, Dallas who is doing his dissertation on the tectonic evolution of the suture.  The Egyptian collaborator has expertise in the application of a variety of remote sensing techniques to geologic problems.  The project will provide an opportunity for an Egyptian scientist to visit UTD and get trained in the principles of digital image processing and remote sensing analysis as applied to geological studies.\r\n",
