 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term research objective for this investigator is to use a combined approach of molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology to understand the structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of splicing. The current project is aimed at understanding how RNA interactions nucleate the assembly of the catalytic apparatus within the group II introns to undertake splicing. Because domain 5 (D5) is the most phylogenetically conserved region of this intron RNA enzyme (ribozyme) and is absolutely required for any reaction catalyzed by group II introns or its derivatives, this project focuses on D5. The following two specific aims are designed to fully illuminate how D5 recruits components of the catalytic machinery through specific RNA-RNA and RNA-ion interactions to form essential active-site structures. Aim 1-To determine the structure of the catalytically essential D5-PL of group II introns; Aim 2-To test the hypothesis that D5-PL undergoes localized conformational changes on binding domains 1-3 to set up the active site geometry for catalysis. This study is expected to provide detailed molecular understanding of the role of D5 in group II intron catalysis. The resulting deeper understanding of the nature of catalysis within the group II introns might suggest novel approaches to developing group II introns as potential ribozyme therapeutics. Correspondingly, the educational activities connected with this research are designed to demonstrate the versatile and diverse roles RNA molecules play in cellular metabolism, and the project provides an excellent avenue for the interdisciplinary training, tutoring and mentoring of graduate and postdoctoral students in RNA biochemistry and NMR structural biophysics.",
