 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nFRG: Multi-Dimensional Problems for the Euler Equations\r\n     of Compressible Fluid Flow and Related Problems\r\n     in Hyperbolic Conservation Laws\r\n\r\nHistorically, fluid and solid mechanics study the motion of\r\nincompressible and compressible materials, with or without internal\r\ndissipation. For gases and solids with internal dissipation as a\r\nsecondary effect, the gross wave dynamics is governed by inviscid,\r\nthermal diffusionless, dynamics. Within these categories, compressible\r\nmotion for solids corresponds to the study of elastic waves and their\r\npropagation; compressible motion for fluids is usually associated with\r\ninviscid  gas dynamics. Furthermore both compressible solids and \r\nfluids exhibit shock waves and hence we must search for discontinous \r\nsolutions to the underlying equations of motion.\r\nIncompressible motion on the other hand concerns\r\nitself with the motion of denser fluids where the idealization of\r\nincompressibility is useful, e.g. water or oil,  as well as the motion of\r\ncertain solids like rubber. While there are still many important\r\nmathematical issues to be resolved for incompressible fluids, for example,\r\nthe well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations in three space\r\ndimensions, the mathematical study of compressible\r\nsolids (as represented by the equations of nonlinear elastodynamics) and\r\nfluids (as represented by the Euler equations of inviscid flows)\r\nin two and three space dimensions is even less developed.\r\nThis provides the motivation to the proposers to collaborate in a\r\nthree year effort to advance the mathematical understanding of the\r\nmulti-dimensional equations of inviscid compressible fluid dynamics\r\nand related problems in elastodynamics.\r\nThe core of our plan is to arrange a sustained interaction between and\r\naround the members of the group,  who will\r\n(1) collaborate scientifically, focusing on the advancement of the\r\nanalysis of multi-dimensional compressible flows by developing new\r\ntheoretical techniques and by using and designing effective, robust and\r\nreliable numerical methods;\r\n(2) work together over the next several years to create the environment\r\nand manpower necessary for the research on multi-dimensional compressible\r\nEuler equations and related problems to flourish; and in the meantime,\r\n(3) share the responsibility of training graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nThe project is devoted to a mathematical study of the Euler equations\r\ngoverning the motion of an inviscid compressible fluid and related\r\nproblems. Compressible fluids occur all around us in nature, e.g. gases\r\nand plasmas, whose study is crucial to understanding aerodyanmics,\r\natmospheric sciences, thermodynamics, etc.\r\nWhile the one-dimensional fluid flows are rather well understood, the\r\ngeneral theory for multi-dimensional flows is comparatively mathematically\r\nunderdeveloped. The proposers will collaborate in a three\r\nyear effort to advance the mathematical understanding of the\r\nmulti-dimensional equations of inviscid compressible fluid dynamics.\r\nSuccess in this project will advance knowledge of this fundamental area of\r\nmathematics and mechanics and will introduce a new generation of\r\nresearchers to the outstanding problems in the field.\r\n",
