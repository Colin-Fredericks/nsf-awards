 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects represent one of the most diverse and species-rich groups of organisms inhabiting the earth. One of the largest radiations of insects is the Holometabola, or insects that undergo metamorphosis, and includes familiar insects such as butterflies, beetles, flies, and lacewings. Closely related to beetles, lacewings are considered one of the most primitive groups of Holometabola. Lacewings represent a wide diversity of strange and unique life histories, but their evolutionary relationships to each other and the development of these unique life histories are poorly understood. We are examining the historical relationships of the 17 family-groups of lacewings using DNA sequence data from multiple genes, as well as detailed investigations of morphological characteristics. These two sources of information will be analysed using cladistic methodology to develop a phylogenetic or 'family tree' of evolutionary relationships.\r\nThe phylogenetic tree proposed from the analysis of both molecular and morphological data will then form the template for developing a natural classification of the groups of lacewings. This tree will further be used to test hypotheses of development of various life histories under different scenarios, including whether the first ancestors of lacewings were aquatic or terrestrial in origin. The results of this research can be used to further our understanding of the processes of insect evolution. Molecular and morphological character systems and genes explored in this project will be useful in resolving similar-aged radiations in other insects, especially for holometabolan relatives such as Megaloptera (dobsonflies), Raphidioptera (snakeflies) and Coleoptera (beetles). This project will also provide opportunities for education and career development of a postdoctoral scientist and undergraduate students, as well as foster cross-instituional collaborations between scientists.\r\n",
