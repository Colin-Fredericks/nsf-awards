 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automatic On-the-fly Detection, Characterization, Recovery and Correction of Software Bugs in Production Runs\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nWe propose to develop a comprehensive debugging system for automatic on-the-fly debugging of production runs. Our system addresses all the aspects of debugging, including bug detection, characterization, recovery and correction.  The system tightly integrates innovations in computer hardware, operating system, data mining, and compiler support. More specifically, our proposed system hinges on the following innovations: (1) low-overhead compiler-directed checking to detect bugs and pass information to the data miner, operating system, and hardware to characterize the bugs; (2) Low-overhead data mining algorithms that build and use models for bug detection, characterization, and correction; (3) Novel hardware support to roll back and deterministically re-execute buggy sections of code with very low overhead and transparently to the user; and (4) operating system support to roll back and re-execute code sections that cannot be supported by hardware. These four layers are tightly integrated in a software prototype.\r\n\r\nOur work directly aims at improving what has historically been the dark spot of the IT revolution: poor programmer productivity. We can meet the software debugging challenge by focusing on debugging production runs, thanks to providing very low-overhead bug characterization support in hardware. The additional compiler, data miner, and operating system layers can enhance the power of the hardware once the bug is detected. We hope the work will have a broad impact, since expediting the debugging process can lead to dramatic increases in the productivity of IT professionals and students. In addition, the ideas developed can also be used for other anomaly detection, such as intrusion detection and security attacks, which is very important to our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
