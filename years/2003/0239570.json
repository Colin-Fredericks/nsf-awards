 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to produce non-toxic mesoporous materials for use as sensors or controlled release drug delivery systems.  The goal of the project is to use multiple functional groups in conjunction with structurally ordered silica particles to produce \"sensing nanospheres\" of use in the detection of neurotransmitters released by cultured nerve cells.  Unsymmetrical disulfides will be used to attach functionalized molecules to the surface of mesoporous beads.  The surface properties of these materials will be studied, and their use as nanodevices for controlled release of encapsulated drugs also will be explored using FT-IR, solid state NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy.  Dr. Lin's educational focus will be provided by the highly interdisciplinary nature of this project in conjunction with curricular development within and across these areas.  \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Victor V. Lin of the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University.  Professor Lin will focus his work on the use of small particles designed to sense their chemical environment, and then react to changing conditions by the controlled release of drugs or hormones into the surrounding media.  It is expected that these particles will be of use in expanding the horizons of neuroscience.  The educational activities of the award will include teaching state-of-the-art concepts in material science to general chemistry students.  \r\n",
