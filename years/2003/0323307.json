They plan to study the semiconductor nature of nanoparticles that are synthesized at Dr. Nayfeh's laboratory, and their use as biosensors with applications in medical diagnosis and healthcare delivery.  They will focus on the development and characterization of highly luminescent silicon nanoparticles and their potential use as ultrasensitive biological markers.  This includes the synthesis, characterization and application of silicon nanoparticles for the second harmonic imaging of cells, with a focus on exploring the second harmonic generation of silicon nanoparticles in thin films for detection in cell research.  They plan to develop efficient methods for coating silicon nanoparticles on flexible substrates including cells for subsequent fluorescent or second harmonic imaging of the cells.  This will help in developing the understanding of quantum size effects in semiconductor nanoscale materials, in general, and specifically, the mechanisms of photoluminescence and second harmonic generation in silicon nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nScope:  The project provides an international dimension to research the PI is conducting under a current NSF award-BES-0118053.  This project may have a significant impact on the progress in the field of biophotonics and biosensors.  It may result in developing novel, reliable, cheap, sensitive and environmentally safe biosensors with significant applications in biomedical research. This project will provide for training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in this interdisciplinary field of biophotonics, within an international setting.\r\n",
