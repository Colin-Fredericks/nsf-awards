 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future nano-scale electronic device technologies (including advanced molecular, biological, \r\nand magnetic devices) will utilize a much wider range of materials than found in current devices. \r\nAdvanced devices will also require exquisite control over bond structure at interfaces between \r\ndissimilar materials, placing stringent demands on processes and processing conditions.  There is \r\ngrowing interest in atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques that enable atomic-level control \r\nover depositing thin films, to achieve highly conformal and smooth deposition of materials of \r\ninterest in a variety of nano-scale and nano-electronic devices.   For this project, we propose to \r\ndemonstrate the use of solvation energy as a new possible reaction .driver. in an atomic layer \r\ndeposition process.  This concept will be demonstrated using a supercritical solvent (specifically \r\nCO2) to facilitate reduction of a metal-organic precursor adsorbed on a deposition surface.  The \r\nparticular demonstration chosen for this one-year effort does not constitute a completely \r\nintegrated or scalable deposition process.  Rather, the demonstration is designed to show \r\nfeasibility of implementing and utilizing solvation force effects to achieve atomic level control in \r\ndeposition of atomically smooth, nano-scale conformal electronic thin films.  A successful \r\ndemonstration will prompt more expanded work required to achieve more mature and hardware-\r\nintensive deposition tools and methods that are outside the scope of this short exploratory \r\nproject.  \r\nThis work most closely addresses the theme of Manufacturing Processes at the Nanoscale.  \r\nIt specifically addresses issues related to .novel tools.for manufacturing at the nanoscale, \r\ndeveloping novel concepts for high-rate synthesis and processing of nanostructures,.and \r\nscaleup of nanoscale synthesis and processing methods..   The project will take advantage of, \r\nand build upon, the PI.s experience in fundamental studies and practical demonstration of thin \r\nfilm deposition processes.   A new integrated vacuum deposition/characterization system with a \r\nwide range of surface characterization tools, including surface electron spectroscopy and infrared \r\nabsorption spectroscopy, is available in the PI.s lab, and will be used to demonstrate and \r\nunderstand the particular detailed mechanisms associated with the proposed process.   \r\nThis work will have broader impacts beyond the particular research results. In addition to the \r\neducation benefit received by the graduate student and post-doc that will work on this project, \r\nthe PI will use this effort to help expand his graduate/undergraduate Chemical Engineering \r\ncourse .Chemical Processing of Electronic Materials. to include discussion of possible \r\napplications of solvent-based processes in nano-scale materials and device fabrication.  An \r\nexploratory undergraduate lab will also be developed that to supplement the course material.",
