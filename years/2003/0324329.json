 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saturation nonlinearities are ubiquitous in engineering systems. In control \r\nsystems, every physical actuator is subject to maximum and minimum saturation \r\nlimits. In between these maximum and minimum limits, the input-output \r\ncharacteristic of a physical actuator is often neither precisely linear nor \r\nexactly known. Thus, in the analysis and design of many high performance \r\ncontrol systems, it is inadequate to model the actuator characteristic by a \r\nstandard saturation function. A straightforward approach to accounting for \r\nthe nonlinearities and uncertainties in the actuator characteristic is to \r\nformulate the analysis and control design problem as the classical absolute \r\nstability problem, where the actuator characteristic is assumed to be within \r\na linear sector. Such an approach to dealing with actuator nonlinearities \r\nleads to severe conservativeness as the two straight lines, the boundaries of\r\na linear sector, cannot tightly bound the actuator characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will develop a generalized absolute stability approach \r\nto the analysis and control design of linear systems in the presence of \r\nactuator nonlinearities. In comparison with the classical absolute stability \r\ntheory, the main innovation of this proposed approach is that it allows the \r\nactuator nonlinearities to reside in between two nonlinear curves, rather \r\nthan two straight lines. The initial investigation by the PIs has shown that \r\nthe proposed approach drastically improves the results that can be obtained \r\nby the classical absolute stability theory. The proposed research is expected \r\nto lead to a set of powerful tools for various aspects of analysis and control \r\ndesign, including the assessment of closed-loop performance under a given \r\nfeedback law and the design of feedback laws for stabilization, disturbance \r\nrejection and output regulation. An integrated part of the project is to \r\nexperimentally verify the obtained theoretical results on some magnetic \r\nbearing/suspension systems in our laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a strong societal impact by advancing \r\nmagnetically suspended flywheel energy storage technology and by providing \r\nefficient control design for magnetically suspended artificial heart pumps. \r\nOther broader impacts of this research include the development of closer\r\ninteraction among the control theory, the magnetic bearings, and the medical\r\nscience research communities and curriculum enhancement at the graduate and \r\nundergraduate levels.\r\n",
