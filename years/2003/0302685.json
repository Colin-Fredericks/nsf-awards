 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Learning Through Simulated Information Technology Enterprises (L-SITEs) curriculum, first developed and piloted in 2000-2002,  imparts innovative, systemic learning in information technology and business by embedding community college students in realistic but fictitious enterprises. This project refines, expands, and institutionalizes adoption of L-SITEs through a collaborative of community colleges, industry experts, and national organizations. Participant support is increasing the numbers of institutions and faculty who use the simulation. Each participating college takes part in faculty workshops for training on implementation and adaptation of L-SITEs, scenarios, and website use.  Project teams serve as facilitators, augmented by industry and academic partners.  User feedback provides continuous improvement, and project management upgrades L-SITEs through enhanced design and technology of web-based delivery. Students experience longitudinal impact of business and technical decisions via enhanced business and financial management methods, which allow simulated enterprises to track and link financials like profit and loss over semester and longer timeframes. To increase breadth and depth, L-SITEs' content integrates IT skills standards, as developed by the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies; and creates a model for innovative 'soft skills' certification.  A partnership with technical colleges from the Trans-Atlantic Technology and Training Alliance-funded through the European Union-makes L-SITEs a more widely adopted learning environment with an international business element.",
