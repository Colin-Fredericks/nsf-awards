One objective is to improve on the Iwaniec-Bombieri\r\nmethod and to obtain new results in the Gauss circle problem and on the\r\norder of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line. Another aim is to\r\nimprove on the Fouvry-Iwaniec method for estimating exponential sums with\r\nmonomials and to obtain new applications on the distribution of almost-prime\r\nnumbers in short intervals and  B-free numbers in short intervals.\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues are also using Pade approximation\r\npolynomials to obtain new bounds on the fractional parts of rational numbers\r\nand applications to diophantine equations and on the irreducibility of\r\npolynomials. Another line of research is on the convergence of Minmod-type\r\nnumerical methods for hyperbolic differential equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gauss circle problem and the problem of the order of the Riemann\r\nzeta-function on the critical line are two of the most famed problems\r\nin number theory. The Riemann zeta-function is closely related to the\r\ndistribution of prime numbers. Knowledge about prime numbers plays a\r\ncrucial role in the areas of cryptography and data encryption which are\r\nimportant both for national security and e-commerce. Hyperbolic differential\r\nequations find applications in problems involving flow (some examples are\r\ngases around aircraft, wake of aircraft, underground contamination,\r\nweather patterns).  In most cases it is impossible to solve\r\nexactly the relevant differential equation, so numerical schemes for an\r\napproximate solution are applied. The investigator and his colleagues\r\nhave achieved progress and are working toward completely solving an\r\nimportant open problem in the mathematical theory of numerical methods for\r\nhyperbolic differential equations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
