 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid flows in porous materials are ubiquitous in natural, industrial \r\nand biological settings.  These range from relatively simple flows \r\nthrough homogeneous media with uniform and well-characterized properties \r\nto very complex flows in strongly heterogeneous media, or in reactive \r\nand/or deformable porous media in which the thermochemistry of the fluid \r\nand the dynamics of the flow can significantly alter the properties of the \r\nmedia which in turn then further complicate the flow.  Three such complex \r\nflows form the scientific basis for this proposal.  The first, a materials\r\nscience application, arises during the solidification of a ternary alloy.  \r\nHere the porous medium is made up of dendritic crystals that solidify or \r\nmelt depending on local thermodynamic conditions of the interstitial fluid.  \r\nThe fluid flow and solidification processes are tightly coupled in this \r\nreactive porous medium.  The second project arises in response to interest \r\nby environmental scientists in developing strategies for the removal or \r\ncontainment of groundwater contaminants in nonhomogeneous porous media.  \r\nThe proposed work addresses gravity-driven flow through spatially nonuniform \r\nporous media using asymptotic homogenization methods in order to identify \r\neffective media properties which characterize a relatively complex porous \r\nmedia by a much simpler description.  The third project involves fluid flow\r\nthrough a porous medium whose porous matrix can be deformed by the fluid \r\nmoving through it.  Such flows appear in soils, in tissues, organs and \r\ntumors in the human body and in industrial applications such as injection \r\nmolding, filtration and inkjet printing.  The proposed work attempts to \r\nextend mathematical modeling tools for inkjet printing technology and to \r\nconnect these ideas to other application areas. \r\n \r\nThe proposed research is of an interdisciplinary nature that through\r\nthe use of applied mathematical techniques addresses directly problems \r\nin materials processing, environmental science and industrial printing \r\ntechnologies.  Applications impacted directly by this research include \r\nindustrial alloy processing, strategies for the removal or containment of \r\ngroundwater contaminants and related environmental hazards, and flows \r\narising during industrial applications such as inkjet printing.  This \r\nwork may indirectly impact the understanding of geophysical flows that \r\noccur in the earth's core or during the formation and melting of sea ice, \r\nother industrial applications such as injection molding and filtration, \r\nand biological applications involving the transport of fluid in tissues, \r\norgans and tumors in the human body.  The work proposed by the PI at \r\nGeorge Mason University will involve collaboration with researchers at \r\nthe University of Tennessee, the University of North Carolina as well \r\nas with researchers in the United Kingdom and at the National Institute \r\nof Standards and Technology.",
