 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will apply techniques from algebra and\r\ntopology to study a number of basic questions in transformation \r\ngroups, orbifolds, field theory, group cohomology and related topics.  \r\nAmong other things he proposes the following research projects:  \r\n(1) construction of finite group actions using methods from group\r\ncohomology and homotopy theory; (2) research on representation spaces \r\nand K-theory of the braid groups and other discrete groups; (3) algebraic\r\ntopology of orbifolds: the development and study of topological invariants\r\nassociated to orbifolds; (4) field theory and cohomology of groups: the\r\nanalysis of Galois groups using cohomological methods; and (5) computation\r\nof the cohomology of low rank simple groups, using a combination of\r\ntheoretical and computer-assisted methods.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is interdisciplinary in its conception, as it intends\r\nto combine methods from algebra and topology to address a broad range \r\nof problems. Symmetry is a topic of central interest in mathematics,\r\nwhich can be effectively studied using topological methods. Research \r\non mathematical aspects of orbifold string theory is representative \r\nof the emerging fusion between geometry and physics. Many important \r\nideas have originated in physics and they consistently lead to the \r\nopening of new frontiers in mathematics. On the other hand the cohomology \r\nof groups is a subject involving intricate algebraic invariants which \r\nvery naturally play a role in representation theory, number theory, \r\nfield theory, etc.  Recent techniques use advanced methods and capabilities \r\nfrom computer algebra, and the proposed calculations will serve as benchmarks \r\nfor further computational as well as theoretical developments in the \r\nfield--with many potential applications. This proposal will seek to develop \r\nclose and fruitful interactions between topology, algebra and physics, \r\nhelping to consolidate the cohomology of groups as an interactive subject \r\ninvolving both theoretical and computational methods.\r\n",
