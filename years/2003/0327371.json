The amount of digital music information being created and often avaialble via the internet has been increasing at exponential rates and has prompted new approaches within the field of information retrieival to deal with this unique content.  This project will construct the world's first, experimental, internationally-accessible testing and development database environment, for music information.  The PI has worked closely with rights-holders in the recording industry to incorportate a rich set of content into the testing environment.  The corpus of material will exceed, potentially multi-terabytes of mixed-media content ensuring that the testing environment reflects \"real-world\" situations.  The principal work involves research exploring important issues related to systems design and development to support unique functionalities required in building, searching and preserving music infomration, while simultaneously ensuring the unique requirements of rights-holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal :      IIS-0340597\r\nInstitution: University of Illinois\r\nPI:               John Downie\r\nTitle:       Workshop on the Evaluation of Music Information Retrieval\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to convene a workshop as part of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference to be held in Toronto this summer.  Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a rapidly emerging research area requiring new expertise and approaches.  The amount of digital music information being created and often available via the internet has been increasing at exponential rates and has prompted new approaches within the field of information retrieival to deal with this unique content.  The SIGIR Conference is a major meeting on information retrieval and affords many the opportunity to participate in the workshop who might otherwise not be able to attend.  Two earlier meetings in July 2002 (JCDL) and October 2002 (ISMIR) have provided valuable background for this workshop and  demonstrated the intense and growing interest in imusic information retrieval.\r\n",
