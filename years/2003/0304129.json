 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this exploratory research proposal, building upon our vertically aligned CNTs, we aim to achieve growth of horizontally aligned CNTs through Al2O3 nano-porous template, where arrays of cylindrical nano-pores are horizontally aligned on silicon substrate. The eventual goal is to achieve a one-dimensional (1-D) array of CNTs horizontally aligned on substrate. There are two thrusts in this research. In the first thrust, fabrication of horizontal arrays of cylindrical pores by anodic oxidation of aluminum will be carried out through geometric and electric field modulation. In the second thrust of research, growth of CNTs can be carried out using the horizontally aligned nano-pores as templates and eventually a 1-D array of CNTs horizontally aligned on silicon substrate can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed work include improvement of the capability for basic and applied research, enhancement of multidisciplinary research, education and training of tomorrow scientists and engineers in nanotechnology through focused graduate seminars, graduate research, and focused education outreach. The research proposed here would lay a foundation for carbon nanotube-based nano- electromechanical system (NEMS) that integrates the carbon nanotube-based devices with microcircuits and carbon nanotube-based nanoelectronic devices. The outcome of this research may lead to revolutionary fabrication technology for transistors, molecular electronic devices, and quantum devices.\r\n",
