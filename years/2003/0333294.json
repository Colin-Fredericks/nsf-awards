 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Robert P. Gunsalus, University of California, Los Angeles and Michael J. McInerney, University of Oklahoma to obtain and analyze the genome sequence the bacterium, Syntrophus aciditrophicus.  This microorganism represents an understudied class of anaerobic bacteria (microbes that thrive only in the absence of oxygen) that serve essential roles in the anaerobic food chains in natural and man-made environments. It functions in symbiotic partnership with other anaerobic microorganisms to degrade a variety of aromatic and aliphatic compounds to inorganic materials, thus completing the carbon and nitrogen cycles on earth. The goals of this project consist of four parts. The first is to generate a roughly assembled genome sequence of S. aciditrophicus using state of the art DNA sequencing methods.  Gaps in sequences will then be closed to provide a completed DNA molecule. The genes contained therein will be identified and annotated for their function(s) using a combination of automated and hand-editing methods. Finally, the genomic information will be further analyzed with the final aim to reconstruct the metabolic pathways encoded in the S. aciditrophicus genome. \r\n\r\nThe S. aciditrophicus genome sequence and associated gene annotations will be made available to the scientific community and general public to help address a variety of issues of societal importance, and in the process, will also be used to train graduate students in microbial genome analysis.  It is anticipated that these will include the ability to identify new and novel aspects of microbial biochemistry and physiology related to anaerobic decomposition of natural as well as man-made compounds in the environment.  The information will reveal previously unknown pathways in these microorganisms and how they are used in essential and complex anaerobic ecosystems.  Since this information should have a wide impact on our understanding how these microbes function, it should allow us to improve the productivity and sustainability of agricultural, industrial, and natural resources.  Lastly, the S. aciditrophicus genome analysis should provide unique insight into the content and evolution of this essential class of microorganisms.\r\n",
