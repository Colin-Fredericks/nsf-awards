 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stone/0229915\r\n\r\nSeveral recent studies have shown indications of continued ice-sheet thinning in West Antarctica.  Geological evidence of much larger-scale deglaciation in the past is therefore a cause for concern over the future of the ice sheet.  This award supports an exposure-dating study that will help to determine the frequency, extent and duration of previous deglaciations, and show whether the present state of West Antarctic ice cover is typical, or highly unusual.  The project is based on measurements of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides, which accumulate only when rock surfaces are exposed above the ice sheet.  Provided these surfaces are protected during glaciation by non-erosive, cold-based ice, nuclide concentrations build up to record the cumulative history of exposure and ice cover. Although this method cannot be used to date specific prior glaciations, it can be used to obtain minimum limits on the total duration of past exposure and glaciation, and maximum limits on exposure within the late Quaternary (approximately the past million years). As an example of this, trial Al-26/Be-10 measurements on a sample of bedrock from Marie Byrd Land reveal a history extending back to the Pliocene, in which the sampled surface has experienced very limited exposure. The results indicate a cumulative exposure time of ~130,000 years, in 3.5 million years of (non-erosive) ice cover, and limit the total exposure time in the past million years to less than ~10,000 years. Evidently this particular surface seldom outcrops, suggesting that the current state of deglaciation in Marie Byrd Land is unusual compared to most interglacial periods in the late Quaternary. This project will explore this possibility with further, coupled Be-10/Al-26 analyses of bedrock samples collected during the 2000-01 field season. If consistent results emerge, like those described above, scientists will be able to constrain: (i) the long-term average configuration of the ice sheet in this region, (ii) how much of the current terrain is typically exposed during interglacial periods, (iii) the comparative frequency and duration of deglaciation in the early Quaternary vs the late Quaternary, and (iv) the duration of late-Quaternary deglaciation events, which may be linked to previous episodes of extensive deglaciation reported in the literature. \r\n\r\n",
