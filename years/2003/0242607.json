 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of high-pressure optical cells (HPOC) whose design incorporates the use of shape memory alloys (SMA) to facilitate the separation and the mixing of reactants.  The HPOC will be constructed using an activated plug mechanism that separates, for example, an enzyme from its substrate.  After loading, the optical cell will be brought to the desired pressure and temperature with the reactants still separated.  At this point, an electric signal will trigger a spring-like mechanism made of SMA that pulls the plug and allows mixing of the reactants. Concomitantly, a periodic shape change of the SMA will provide agitation and pumping, thus serving to thoroughly mix the components.  The design goal will be to achieve complete mixing within 100 milliseconds of the plug pull-off.  If fully successful, the new HPOC will represent an significant improvement over pressure cells in current use.   The effort will involve two faculty members, one at Temple University and one at Drexel University, with complementary expertise in high pressure studies of biochemical systems and materials science.  Both will work closely in the design of the SMA-activated plug mechanism as well as the testing, interfacing, and calibration of the instrument.  This project will offer a unique opportunity for training graduate students at the interfaces of engineering, biochemistry, biophysics, and hyperbaric biology, and will involve several undergraduate students from the Temple University-Community College of Philadelphia bridge program. Moreover, through this project, a new course module entitled \"High Pressure Biology, Physics, and Instrumentation\" will be developed by the PI and Co-PI for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students enrolled in mechanical engineering, materials, chemistry, physics, bioengineering, and various life-science departments at both institutions.",
