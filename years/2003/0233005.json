 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the skill gap that\r\nexists within the software development community in the production of work-centered\r\nsoftware. To this end, Stottler Henke will develop a novel software development\r\nenvironment that reduces the complexity of interaction design &#8211; bridging the gap\r\nbetween the analysis of the work domain and the development of well-designed supporting\r\nsoftware. The proposed WorkWell system will provide for an enhanced Contextual Design\r\nprocess with tools that enable software developers to draw on the aggregate experience of\r\nother work-centered application designers. This will be achieved through the application\r\nof proven design/interaction patterns that will, for instance, enable software developers\r\nto resolve the conflicts between the desire for automation and user&#8217;s need for a\r\nfeeling of control. Further, WorkWell will support an incremental process for mapping the\r\nsemantics of user goals to underlying software functionality and the user interface\r\ndesign. Phase I will result in a limited prototype that will demonstrate the feasibility\r\nof the proposed approach. The results of these efforts will have a great impact on\r\nsociety &#8211; furthering the understanding of work-centered design and enabling\r\ncorporations to produce software that will enjoy higher user adoption rates and improve\r\nefficiency.\r\nThere is a large market for tools that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nsoftware development efforts. The WorkWell system offers corporations the means to\r\nproduce intuitive and effective software under the time and resource limitations that\r\nexist in the commercial world and thereby achieve much higher user adoption rates for\r\ntheir products.",
