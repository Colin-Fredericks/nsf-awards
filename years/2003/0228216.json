 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports activities of the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Psychological Science (USNC/IUPsyS). The USNC exists to represent the United States in the scientific union, which is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU). The objective of this program is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the international union in response to expanding needs in international science and technology. It will accomplish this by taking advantage of the volunteer tradition of the National Research Council (NRC) -- a tradition that attracts top-level scientists and researchers to serve on USNCs. International Unions affiliated with ICSU facilitate the exchange of scientific information, forge international agreements on standards and measurements, act as scientific advisers to intergovernmental agencies, and promote the right of all scientists to participate in their activities without political or any other form of discrimination. This project engages the U.S. research community in international activities by providing opportunities for colleagues from around the world to meet on common ground, builds partnerships, and discusses collaborations.\r\n",
