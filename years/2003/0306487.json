The first topic of the investigator's research is\r\nthe uniformization problem for Kahler manifolds. More precisely,\r\nthe study is of the geometric properties of the algebra of\r\nholomorphic functions on the universal cover of a Kahler\r\nmanifold. There is a conjecture of Shafarevich formulated in the\r\nearly 1970's stating that the universal cover of a compact Kahler\r\nmanifold is holomorphic convex. This conjecture proposes that the\r\nfunction theory of noncompact universal covers of compact Kahler\r\nmanifolds is very rich. The difficulty in proving the conjecture\r\nis that there is a lack of methods to produce holomorphic\r\nfunctions on universal covers. The investigator has developed a\r\nmethodology to produce holomorphic functions on universal\r\ncovers. Holomorphic functions are shown to arise from the\r\nidentification on the universal cover of the pullback of distinct\r\nvector bundles on the Kaehler manifold. This methodology will be\r\nexpanded, and in conjuction with the work of Kollar, will obtain\r\nvariations of the Shafarevich conjecture.  The second topic of\r\nthis project is about the interaction between the properties of\r\nspecial real submanifolds and the properties of the complex\r\nmanifolds that contain them. More precisely, how does the\r\npresence of a given CR-submanifold in a compact complex manifold\r\ninfluences the global analytic and geometric invariants of the\r\nlatter? A flexible construction of projective varieties with\r\ngiven prescribed singularities shows that even though\r\nCR-submanifolds impose restrictions in analytical properties of\r\nthe ambient complex manifold like the Kodaira dimension, they are\r\nexpected to be less restrictive on topological properties like\r\nthe fundamental group.\r\n\r\nComplex manifolds are natural objects in mathematics and in\r\nparticular in the field of complex geometry. They appear in the\r\nmathematical models of engineering and physics. The research\r\nprogram proposed will contribute to a better understanding of the\r\nproperties of complex manifolds and the theory of their\r\nfunctions. Advances in complex geometry will have a significant\r\nimpact on the development of the models of physics, such as\r\nstring theory, describing the forces that shape our\r\nuniverse. This project will also allow the principal investigator\r\nto organize seminars that will bring experts of the field from\r\nother parts of the country to his institution. This will help\r\nfoster the research in complex geometry in the area and it will\r\nbe essential to the education of the graduate students at his\r\ninstitution. The principal investigator hopes to foster an\r\nenvironment of scientific curiosity and investigation that will\r\nhave a wide range of applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
