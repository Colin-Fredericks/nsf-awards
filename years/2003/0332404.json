 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nHousing is one of the most basic needs of human beings. Providing affordable, durable and\r\nquality homes has always been one of the greatest challenges faced by society. Over the\r\nyears, a fair amount of research efforts have taken place to help meet the challenge of\r\nproviding adequate housing. In recent years, there has been a renewed emphasis on housing\r\ntechnology research due to the PATH (Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing)\r\nprogram initiatives at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the ational Science Foundation (NSF).\r\nThe overall purpose of the proposed workshop is twofold (1) to compile State of the\r\nArt of the housing technology research by summarizing recently completed and on-going\r\nNSF-PATH and other related research efforts, and (2) to develop future research directions\r\nin major areas of housing technology. The workshop will focus on five major areas (1)\r\nConstruction Management and Production, (2) Structural Design and Materials, (3) Building Enclosures, Utilities and Energy Systems, (4) Community and Economic Impacts of Housing Technology, and (5) Systems Interactions and Whole House Approach.\r\nThe proposed workshop will serve as an important step in advancing knowledge in the field\r\nof housing technology, as well as in the broader housing research arena. In order to\r\nensure a broader impact of the proposed workshop, groups that are underrepresented in\r\nscience and engineering fields will be given special consideration when selecting\r\nparticipants. In addition, the focus area leaders and participants will be encouraged to\r\ninclude examples of integrated research and education activities as part of their research\r\nagenda position papers.\r\nThe workshop is scheduled to be held on February 12-14, 2004 at the University of Central\r\nFlorida campus in Orlando, Florida. The funding is requested for August 16, 2003 -August\r\n15, 2004, based on the overall schedule.\r\n",
