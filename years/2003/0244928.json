 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from a UCLA group requests funds to support the operation of the recently completed STACEE ground-based atmospheric air-Cherenkov telescope array.  STACEE uses an array of 64 large heliostats in the National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) solar power station at Sandia National Laboratory; these heliostats focus Cherenkov light from air-showers onto secondary optics and camera systems deployed in the central tower of the solar array.  The goals of STACEE are to make high-resolution observations of astrophysical gamma-rays of energies between 50 and 1000 GeV region, a part of the spectrum previously unexplored. High-energy gamma-rays can be produced in neutron stars, supernovae, active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts. They could also be signatures for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and cosmology. With the addition of new Flash ADC's, the construction of STACEE is now essentially complete and the experiment has been taking data for a couple of years.  The collaboration has observed two sources, the Crab Nebula and the active galaxy Markarian 421, and has set limits on other sources.  The UCLA group negotiates and maintains the user facility agreement with Sandia Labs and is responsible for all STACEE operations at the NSTTF site.\r\n\r\nIn the education/outreach area, this particle astrophysics experiment may impact society through various technological innovations and is also involved in outreach efforts to K-12 students and summer REU students.\r\n",
