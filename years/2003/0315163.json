 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I presents a feasibility study to commercialize a microprocessor technology that will address the challenge of delivering power-constrained technology while still fulfilling the increased performance needs in modern systems. Aggressive performance optimizations enabled by reduction in feature sizes have contributed to increase of power/energy consumption with every chip generation. The approach is based on a tightly integrated compiler-architecture framework and provides a coherent strategy for chip-wide energy reduction with no (or minimal) performance impact. The focus of this is on the microarchitectural components. A key idea is to complement traditional mechanisms in microprocessors with low energy, statically managed access paths enabled by static information extracted at compile time. A central thesis is that much speculative static information can be extracted that is currently not exploited, and that this information can be leveraged in novel statically speculative microarchitectural mechanisms to significantly reduce energy consumption.\r\n     The company plans to license its patented technology in form of synthesizable and hard cores to leading equipment, semiconductor and OEM partners worldwide who focus on applications, design, and manufacturing. Immediate vertical markets targeted include: handhelds such as smart phones and PDAs, wireless portable applications, and battery driven military applications.\r\n\r\n",
