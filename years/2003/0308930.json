 "awd_abstract_narration": "0308930  Peirce  The objective of CLEANER Workshop Three is to build on the accomplishments of two previous NSF workshops to better understand and organize the science, engineering, technology, and administration of emerging capabilities in sensor technologies, communications, and computation to protect, maintain, and restore the water, atmosphere and soil environments.\r\nDuring the past year the academic and NSF vision of CLEANER has become targeted: to provide a network of field and laboratory facilities in a collaboration among engineers, scientists, policy makers and community groups to protect public health and the environment. The need exists for a timely immediate CLEANER Workshop Three to continue these past discussions and to narrow discussions to such topics as environmental cyberinfrastructures and management plans.\r\nCLEANER Workshop One hosted and chaired by Professor Richard Luthy at Stanford University in December 2001 provided a forum for initial discussions on the vision, concept, vocabulary, content and management options for CLEANER. \r\nCLEANER Workshop Two hosted and chaired by Professor Patrick Brezonik at the University of Minnesota in October 2002 provided a larger group of participants with opportunities to learn about CLEANER and learn about the successes and challenges faced during the planning and operation of efforts somewhat similar to CLEANER including NSF's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER's), Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrological Science, Inc. (CUAHSI).\r\n Workshop Three to be co- hosted at Duke University in February 2003 by Professor Jeff Peirce (Duke University) and Professor Mike Aitken (University of North Carolina) will build on the accomplishments of these two previous workshops while continuing those discussions and narrowing discussions on CLEANER to such topics as environmental cyberinfrastructure and management plans. Workshop Three will follow the successful format of Workshop Two with invited participants arriving at Duke for a Sunday evening dinner and introductory discussions followed by two days of general and breakout meetings with presentations and   reports of workshop activities.\r\n",
