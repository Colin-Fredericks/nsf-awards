 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to study the geometry and topology of certain special \r\nmoduli spaces arising in complex algebraic geometry.  Here, \"special\" means that \r\nthey may be described as quotients of Hermitian symmetric spaces by discrete \r\ngroups.  (There are surprisingly many examples of these spaces.)  The first \r\nspecific goal is to understand the topology of a large family of these spaces \r\nthat includes the moduli spaces of polarized smooth K3 surfaces and several other \r\nexamples arising in singularity theory.  By \"understand the topology of\" we mean \r\nthat we beleive these spaces have contractible universal covers, and we want to \r\nprove this.  The idea is to use tools from the theory of negatively-curved metric \r\nspaces that generalize the idea of a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold.  The \r\nsecond specific goal is to complete a joint project with J. Carlson and D. Toledo, \r\nto prove that the moduli space of cubic hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional projective \r\nspace is isomorphic to a quotient of the complex 10-ball by a certain discrete \r\ngroup.  The third specific goal is to close the last open aspect of Hilbert's \r\n14th problem, by showing that there is a representation of the 2-dimensional \r\nadditive group for which the ring of invariants is not finitely generated. \r\n\r\nThe project addresses concrete problems in algebraic geometry concerning the \r\nclassification of various objects like curves and surfaces.  Algebraic geometry \r\nas a subject deals with curves and surfaces that can be defined by means of \r\nequations, and also with higher-dimensional versions of these curves and surfaces.  \r\nAn example giving the flavor of the classification problem is that a circle is \r\nessentially the same as an ellipse, because one of them can be got from the other \r\nby stretching the plane in one direction.  An ellipse is also essentially the same \r\nas a parabola, because you can imagine keeping one end of the ellipse fixed and \r\npushing the other off to infinity.  You can go even further and push the end off \r\npast infinity, so that it reappears on the other side of the plane, and you see a \r\nhyperbola.  An algebraic geometer expresses these ideas by saying that any two \r\nconics are \"projectively equivalent\".  What these shapes all have in common is \r\nthat they are defined by simple equations--two variables, and only terms of degree \r\ntwo or less.  A major part of modern algebraic geometry is studying similar \r\nquestions but with the number of variables increased, or the complexity of the \r\nequations increased to allow higher-degree polynomials.  For example, it turns \r\nout that not all curves in the plane that are defined by degree three equations \r\nare projectively equivalent.  The ways in which these curves can differ from each \r\nother is very important for many fields of mathematics and even physics.  This \r\nexample was understood in the 19th century, but similar problems remain open.  \r\nOne purpose of the current proposal is to gain an understanding of how the \r\nprojective equivalence classes of the degree-three \"surfaces\" in four-dimensional \r\nspace can vary.  We believe that this may be described in a beautiful and \r\nsurprising way using the unit sphere in 10-dimensional complex space.  This result \r\nwould be similar to a classical result for degree three curves in the plane.  We \r\nwant to prove that our intuition is right.  Another problem to address is that of \r\nfinishing a part of Hilbert's 14th problem, one of the celebrated problems posed \r\nby David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century.\r\n",
