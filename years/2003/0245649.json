 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies data analysis and modeling of binary neutron stars and/or black holes, which will be an important source of gravitational waves for the LIGO project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory). The data analysis work will include the development, testing, and use of algorithms and software to perform searches on LIGO data. It will also include mathematical work on extraction of information from detected signals. The modeling of binary dynamics is closely related: Good data analysis requires good predictions of the signals. This project will focus on binaries composed of spinning objects. For these systems the signals are much more complicated than those usually considered. This makes searches more difficult, but can provide much more information once a signal is detected.\r\n\r\nThis project emphasizes graduate student participation. Students are encouraged to work on data analysis problems as well as the traditional gravity and astrophysics involved in source modeling. This provides students with broader than usual training for careers in and out of academia, solving practical as well as theoretical problems. Students will present their work at scientific meetings. Software and data analysis techniques developed under this grant will be publicly available and used by the international LIGO Science Collaboration. The work on binary dynamics may have implications of interest to the astrophysical community as well.",
