 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Viticulture (grape growing) and Enology (winemaking) Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA), a partnership of two-year colleges, universities, vineyards/wineries, and state agricultural agencies is encouraging both traditional and non-traditional students from diverse backgrounds to enter post-secondary education in a rigorous program of study leading to a degree in viticulture and enology. The VESTA program is being designed and implemented as a two-year AAS degree program so that students are fully trained to impact the viticulture and enology industry throughout the Midwest. VESTA is developing and delivering on-line advanced science and technology courses related to the viticulture and enology industry, reinforced by the practical application of laboratory and field experiences in vineyards and wineries. The VESTA partnership includes academics skilled in on-line course development and content and industry partners eager to place student interns, hire students as workers, and encourage their workers to attend college with financial support. Current industry workers, including many from underrepresented ethnic groups, are being encouraged and supported to participate in the VESTA program. VESTA envisions five broad outcomes: 1) a program of study for two-year colleges focusing on the education and training needs of the viticulture and enology industry, 2) the improved proficiency of traditional and non-traditional students enrolled at partnership colleges as programs incorporate industry skill standards, competency-based curriculum, on-line courses, field/laboratory experiences, and common skills assessment; 3) the improved knowledge and skills of secondary and post-secondary faculty through workshops and field experiences; 4) increasing numbers of traditional and non-traditional students enrolling in VESTA programs with increasing numbers of student placements in the field; and 5) VESTA achieving self-sufficiency and expansion to other community colleges. A partnership web site is the clearinghouse for VESTA with directories of participating colleges, program descriptions, curriculum models, jobs, internships, field experiences, and links to state agencies, vineyards and wineries. The VESTA model is being presented at academic and industry professional conferences.\r\n",
