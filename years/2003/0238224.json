 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Sitz will perform state-to-state experiments involving molecular hydrogen and deuterium scattering from reactive transition metal surfaces.  The relative importance of translational, rotational, and vibrational motion and molecular alignment in determining the outcome of scattering events in hydrogen/copper and hydrogen/palladium systems will be investigated.  Stimulated Raman scattering will be used to prepare hydrogen molecules incident on the surface in selected rotational and vibrational states.  Scattered molecules will be detected in a quantum state specific manner by multiphotonionization.  By exploiting the simple systems studied here, a definitive comparison with theory will be possible.\r\n\r\nFully highly resolved measurements provide new insight into surface dynamics.  Experimental results of the kind obtained in this project provide critical data for testing existing models and theories and help motivate the development of new ones.  It is known that the presence of various atoms on a surface can lead to either poisoning or promotion of surface reactions, but these effects are not fully understood.  The collaboration with theoreticians is also expected to enable a predictive understanding of fundamental gas-surface processes that will ultimately impact catalytic reaction processes and other technological applications.  Students in the PI's laboratory are trained in the use of state-of-the-art laser and vacuum technologies.",
