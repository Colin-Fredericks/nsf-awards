The specific objectives of the Preparatory Workshop, June 26-27, 2003, Royal Academy of Engineering, London, England, are 1) to develop the Smart Home portion of the technical program for the High Technology Track  of the International Conference, and 2) to identify strategies for future research and development. Support for United Kingdom participants in the workshop is provided by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and is hosted by the UK Focus for Biomedical Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe EU/US International Conference builds on two White House initiatives: the October 2000 White House Forum on Technology for Successful Aging, and the current New Freedom Initiative. In the United Kingdom the EQUAL (Extend Quality Life) activity has much the same purpose. The year 2003 is the European (EU) Year of People with Disabilities wherein progress is expected to be driven towards achieving equal rights for people with disabilities. Both the Preparatory Workshop and the International Conference are elements of the EU program.\r\n\r\nThe EU/US International Conference will focus on research, practice, and policy in areas outlined in the New Freedom Initiative. In recognition of the challenges faced by the aging of our population, the Preparatory Workshop and the EU/US International Conference bring together experts in technology, research, development, and applications to document the state-of- the-science and to identify research needs in Smart Home technologies.  \r\n\r\nThe EU/US International Conference web site is http://www.asaging.org/icadi/03/index.cfm",
