 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States is experiencing increasing difficulties with its electricity supply infrastructure.  Distributed generation (DG) can play a large role in solving these problems and provide other benefits as well.\r\n\r\nThis proposal details a five-year faculty career development plan in DG technology. The research plan concentrates on: 1) development of novel power conversion systems; and 2) development of a comprehensive computer model of a power system with a high connection density of distributed generators.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of the plan includes: 1) enhancement of an existing photovoltaics course; 2) development of a wind energy course; 3) curriculum-wide use of the systems approach; 4) integration of research-related systems into design projects for undergraduate courses; and 5) development of a mini-course on renewable energy for South Dakota's Native American citizens.\r\n\r\nThis proposal meets criterion 1, intellectual merit, because: a) the work involves novel engineering design, and scientific exploration of an uninvestigated area; b) the PI is qualified in this area; c) the work is of importance to several fields within Electrical Engineering; d) the work plan and resource needs are clearly stated and lead to the desired goals; and e) the needed resources are available.\r\n\r\nThis proposal meets criterion 2, broader impact, because it includes: a) development of new educational materials; b) the involvement of an underrepresented group, specifically Native Americans; c) specific plans for partnerships between investigators, national laboratories, and industry; d) a plan to broadly disseminate results; and e) significant benefits to society at large.\r\n",
