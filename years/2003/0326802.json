 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal #:  0326802\r\nPI:  Ferris Webster\r\nInstitution:  University of Delaware\r\n\r\nThis project will build on an existing research ship schedules and specifications database to \r\ncreate an online portal to information on research vessels. The portal will cover US and \r\ninternational research vessels with information on their science missions, schedules, equipment, \r\nand specifications. It will include the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System \r\n(UNOLS) fleet, US vessels outside of UNOLS, and international vessels. The system will be \r\nopen to all and will operate continuously. \r\n \r\nThe Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware's College of Marine \r\nStudies will support the UNOLS Office activities to modernize their information technology \r\ninfrastructure and interfaces, such as a next-generation Ship Time Request and Scheduling \r\nsystem.  Joint development with the UNOLS Office will help identify and eliminate duplication.  \r\nOnsite development and hosting of UNOLS content and hardware will provide a centralized \r\nlocation for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure and data as the UNOLS office \r\nmoves among participating institutions. \r\n \r\nThe research element in this proposal is to develop innovative procedures for presenting \r\ninformation and supporting users needing assistance in cruise planning and scheduling. New \r\nelements to be added to the existing system include open and innovative online tools to: \r\no Enable interested researchers and institutions to identify opportunities for collaboration. \r\no Locate areas where research vessels are operating and the types of research being \r\nperformed. \r\no Determine geographic hot spots where research vessel activity is high for various \r\nscientific disciplines \r\n\r\n",
