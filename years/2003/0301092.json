 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research involves the coordination-directed arylation of alkanes and further general arylation studies.  A four step process involving transmetallation, C-H activation, reductive elimination and oxidation is proposed to account for the arylation reaction and experiments are designed to address this central hypothesis.  The ability of the method to differentiate between different typed of C-H bonds in complex substrates will test the scope of this palladium-mediated methodology.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dalibor Sames of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.   Professor Sames will focus his work on the development of methodologies for palladium catalyzed C-C bond formation via C-H bond activation.  Owing to the ubiquitous presence of C-H bonds in organic compounds, the methodology could have an extremely important broader impact on organic synthesis, in particular on the pharmaceutical industry.  The work also provides an excellent venue for the training of graduate students.\r\n",
