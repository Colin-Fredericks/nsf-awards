 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project plans to use halophytic plants for the bioremediation of coal bed methane (CBM) discharge water. CBM discharge is widely viewed as an environmental liability. Indiscriminant surface discharge causes salination of soils. The drilling companies are therefore in urgent need for an acceptable discharge process. The hypothesis for the proposed work is that halophytic plants will consume enough sodium to enable surface irrigation of CBM discharge. These bioremediation efforts will be further enhanced by intensive fish production in CBM waters prior to discharge.  Successful experimental results will provide complementary, alternative, sustainable tools to manage CBM discharge.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of bioremediation.  CBM discharge would be more environmentally acceptable when utilizing water that has significantly reduced sodium absorption ratio (SAR).  This could open up huge areas of land for responsible CBM exploration and recovery.  Forage animals could derive significant nutrition from select halophytes irrigated with CBM discharge.  Noxious weeds encroaching on discharge areas would be displaced by organized agriculture of halophytic plants.  Surface soils would ultimately contain less salts.  Nutrient input from fish manures could result in significantly greater growth of desirable plants.\r\n",
