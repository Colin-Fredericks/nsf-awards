The PIs will investigate composite nanocrystalline material, focusing on devices based on dye-sensitized (DS) semiconductor nanostructures.  Dr. Tennakone's team at IFS is conducting research on these DS semiconductor nanostructures, with a focus on the visible light applications (solar cells) while IR applications have not been studied. The GSU group has been studying infrared (IR) detectors, has developed novel IR detection mechanisms and is working on developing IR detectors for various wavelengths.  Dr. Perera has an NSF grant for the development of heterojunction interfacial workfunction internal photoemission (HEIWIP) detectors.  This work on IR detectors has a very close connection to the solar cell research.  By combining the expertise on both sides, it is expected that the solar cell performance could be improved by enhancing the IR absorption and conversion in these DS semiconductor nanostructures.  Different types of dyes will be studied to explore the IR absorption behavior and to obtain the optimum performance of these low cost devices.  The IR absorption studies of different dyes will allow the GSU group to develop another type of an IR detector especially for low cost applications. \r\n\r\nScope:  The project's goal is to advance solar cell research and to provide novel low cost infrared detectors operating at or near room temperature.  The results of the proposed research will improve the understanding of detectors and form the basis for the next generation of detectors.  It will enable GSU to involve Sri Lankan junior scientists in a valuable research experience while working in cutting edge research in the semiconductor device areas.  This will impact significantly the advancement of knowledge, physics and engineering education, and will make a significant contribution to both nations' science and technology. The collaborations will also ensure effective transfer to emerging high-tech applications both in commercial and government laboratories and especially on the Sri Lankan side. \r\n",
