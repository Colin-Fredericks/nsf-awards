 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Fellowship Program at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is improving the quality and quantity of certified secondary science teachers in Texas by reducing or eliminating barriers faced by scientists who desire to transition into secondary science teaching careers. The project combines resources available via Noyce with a new project conducted by BCM and Texas A&M University, known as Opening Pathways for Teacher Instructional Opportunities in Natural Sciences (OPTIONS).  OPTIONS provides academic routes and supporting structures for science graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and professionals to become certified secondary science teachers in Houston, Texas. The program combines online instruction, small-group experiences and mentored teaching under the guidance of highly qualified teachers and project faculty.  The Noyce Fellows Program eliminates financial barriers and makes it possible for talented young scientists to obtain careers in secondary science teaching.  It covers all program-related costs and allows OPTIONS to recruit and enroll 10 of the most talented and motivated candidates each year.",
