 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER Abstract\r\n\r\nIn this research program, Professor Hong Liang at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will develop innovative processes to generate nano-coatings. She will further investigate mechanisms of tribochemical interactions on surfaces of metals and oxides. Experimental approaches include using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a table-top tribometer to polish, manipulate, and test materials at different length scales. The primary methods of surface characterization include Anomic Force Microscope, Transmision Electron Microscope, X-ray Phonon Spectrometer, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectra, and other high-resolution spectroscopic techniques. Materials studied are strategically selected to reveal principles in effects of electronic, chemical, and crystal structures on friction and wear. Fundamental investigation will focus on new phenomena and non-equilibrium surfaces, including surface forces and wear at atomic-to-centimeter scales, new surface bonds, non-equilibrium crystal structures, non-stoichiometric products, and kinetics of growth. This research is at the interface of several scientific and technological areas involving physical, chemical, mechanical, and tribological properties of advanced materials. This research will result in development of novel nanostructured materials and nanofabrication processes. It will open opportunities for developing advanced manufacturing technologies for industries such as semiconductors and optics.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this research will be realized by establishing long-term international collaborations and integrating research and education activities. Students will be trained in the multidisciplinary fields of materials science and mechanical engineering. Students involved in this research will have opportunities to conduct surface analysis at the Washington State University and the Ecole Centrale de Lyon. Professor Liang will use on-line education to deliver new knowledge and technology to rural area students in Alaska and as an alternative for students who take traditional classes. Extensive outreach activities include recruiting female students and Alaska natives as well as involving k-12 students and schoolteachers. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
