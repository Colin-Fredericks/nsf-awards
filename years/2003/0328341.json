 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this projectl is to investigate the structural and catalytic\r\nproperties of Fe-Only hydrogenases. Hydrogenases catalyze reversible hydrogen\r\noxidation and function physiologically to either recycle the reduced electron carriers that\r\naccumulate during a fermentative metabolism or couple the oxidation of hydrogen to the\r\ngeneration of reduced electron carriers that can be utilized in energy yielding processes.\r\nThe metal-containing hydrogenases are classified according to their metal content and\r\ninclude those that contain both Ni and Fe (NiFe-hydrogenases) and those that contain just\r\nFe (Fe-Only hydrogenases). These enzymes are of paramount importance in the\r\nmetabolism of numerous microorganisms. In addition, since hydrogen is being explored\r\nas a future alternative fuel source, there is considerable interest in the details of these\r\nhydrogen producing biological catalysts.  The studies will focus primarily on testing hypotheses that\r\nwere developed as a result of the detailed structural analysis of the Fe-Only hydrogenase\r\n(CpI) isolated from the anaerobic soil microorganism Clostridium pasteurianum. The specific objectives are (1) additional structural and biochemical studies on CpI probing a number of remaining key questions with respect to the H Cluster structure and the role of the accessory [FeS] clusters; (2) site-specific\r\namino acid substitution experiments on CpI to examine the role of the polypeptide\r\nenvironment of the H Cluster in catalysis and stability; (3) structural characterization of\r\nthe second Fe-Only hydrogenase (CpII) from C. pasteurianum to ascertain its primary\r\nsequence and structural relationship to other Fe-Only hydrogenases and to probe the\r\ncontributions of the environment of the H Cluster and the accessory FeS clusters in\r\ndefining hydrogen oxidation versus proton reduction activities in the Fe-Only\r\nhydrogenases.  The above objectives will be pursued by a multidisciplinary approach combining\r\nbiochemical methods, spectroscopic methods and structure determination by X-ray\r\ndiffraction methods to answer some of the key remaining questions with respect to the\r\nstructure and function of Fe-Only hydrogenases.",
