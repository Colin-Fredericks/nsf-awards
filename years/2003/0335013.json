This project will address this evolution with several thrusts:\r\n\t\r\nAnalysis of nonlinear DPSK, PSK and QAM systems. Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature-amplitude multiplexing (QAM) offer increased spectral efficiency and robustness. Fiber Kerr nonlinearity fundamentally limits system performance, but is typically studied using Monte Carlo simulation. Analytical techniques to compute error probability in nonlinear systems using these modulation techniques will be developed. These analyses will provide insight into system optimization and will yield practical engineering design criteria.\r\n\t\r\nNonlinear phase noise: analysis and compensation. Nonlinear phase noise (NLPN) arises when signal and amplifier noise together modulate the fiber refractive index via the Kerr effect. NLPN potentially limits systems using DPSK, PSK or QAM. NLPN will be characterized analytically, and electrical techniques to compensate NLPN will be demonstrated. \r\n\t\r\nCoded nonbinary modulation techniques. Current optical systems use binary modulation and coding schemes matched to binary modulation. In order to realize the full benefits of nonbinary modulation, appropriate coding techniques will be investigated, including trellis-coded modulation (TCM) and turbo TCM.\r\n\t\r\nSystem experiments. Coherent detection of PSK will be performed using MEMS-based external-cavity lasers. These experiments will verify the nonlinear system analysis, test electrical compensation of NLPN, and demonstrate that coherent detection can yield substantial improvements in spectral efficiency and robustness. \r\nThis project will make several broader contributions, by educating students from diverse backgrounds and genders, involving undergraduate students in research, and training future educators. Results will be incorporated into graduate-level lecture and laboratory courses. \r\n\r\n",
