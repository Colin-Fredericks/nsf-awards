 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first area of study is the approximation properties of several types of\r\nfinite element spaces defined on irregular hexahedral elements obtained by\r\ntrilinear mappings from a reference cube. Such spaces are used to \r\napproximate three-dimensional vector functions and arise naturally in many applications,\r\nincluding the approximation of Maxwell's equations and the use of mixed and\r\nleast squares finite element methods for second order elliptic \r\nequations. The research is to determine precisely what is needed for optimal order\r\napproximation and construct families of finite element spaces that have this\r\nproperty.  The second area of study is the finite element approximation by\r\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods of convection-diffusion problems.  The aim is\r\nto derive new local error estimates in order to understand which methods of\r\nthis promising class of approximation schemes work well both for\r\ndiffusion-dominated and convection-dominated second order partial \r\ndifferential equations. The third area of research is to use the now well-developed \r\ntheory for the approximation of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model (used to study the\r\nbending of a thin plate under external loads) as a basis for developing new\r\napproaches to the use of finite element methods for the approximation of\r\nelastic shells.  Both the plate model and to a greater extent the shell \r\nmodel suffer from the problem of \"locking'' when standard finite element\r\napproximation schemes are applied, causing poor approximations for thin \r\nplates and shells.  The final area of research involves the design of effective\r\nnumerical methods for the Einstein equations, used to numerically \r\nsimulate the emission of gravitation radiation from massive astronomical events such as\r\nblack hole collisions.  The approach taken will be to use simpler model\r\nproblems with some of the same features to understand why standard numerical\r\nmethods for the Einstein equations fail and to help design methods that\r\novercome these problems.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical modeling of physical and biological processes using partial\r\ndifferential equations has become the standard method of studying a host of\r\nimportant scientific problems. Since it is usually not possible to solve \r\nsuch equations exactly, the development of reliable and efficient numerical\r\napproximation schemes, which can be implemented on computers, makes this \r\ninto a practical approach and is central to progress in many areas of science and\r\nengineering.  This project studies \"finite element\" type approximation \r\nschemes for mathematical models of a variety of applied problems.  These include \r\nflows of gases and fluids in which both convection and diffusion are present,\r\nMaxwell's equations for the modeling of the electric and magnetic fields \r\nin a body subject to an applied current, the bending of thin structures (e.g., a\r\nroof) under external loads, and Einstein's equations for the simulation \r\nof the emission of gravitation radiation from massive astronomical events such as\r\nblack hole collisions.  This work is expected to lead to new and improved\r\nnumerical methods for use by scientists and engineers in applied \r\ncomputations.\r\n",
