First, the sensors are based upon the use of direct electrical impedance measurements as the basis for signal transduction, providing a direct electronic bio-interface and the possibility of real-time, continuous monitoring of biological molecules, including a wide variety of pathogens.  Secondly, the sensors are based upon the use of carbon-based materials, including diamond and diamond-like carbon, as ultra-stable supports, to provide a robust chemical and electronic interface to biological molecules.    The researchers will conduct experiments aimed at developing optimized biological modification of the carbon-based materials (including glassy carbon, thin-film diamond, and a variety of thin-film diamond-like carbon materials) and the subsequent use of the biologically-modified surfaces as the basis for direct electronic sensing. \r\n\r\nThis research will have broad impact by leading to autonomous sensing systems that are able to detect and identify a variety of biological pathogens in real time on a continuous basis.  The development of these sensors could lead to complete low-power, battery-operated sensing systems that could be inexpensively and widely distributed to provide greatly increased security against hazardous biological agents.  Much of the proposed research would also have broad commercial applicability in areas such as food safety, by enabling improved methods for continuous monitoring of a wide variety of biological pathogens.  The proposed research will also effectively link research with education in several ways.  The principal investigator is actively involved in a number of outreach activities linking the university to K-12 education.  Additionally, graduate students trained through this proposal will be exposed to an unusually interdisciplinary field. \r\n",
