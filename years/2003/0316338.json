Conus, with more than 500 species worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas, is the largest genus of marine animals. It is thus a major contributor to biodiversity in the sea, but it presents many challenges in identification and classification. The project will use both modern molecular sequencing and quantitative analysis of anatomical features in classification and will elucidate the history of rapid diversification of Conus. It will create a website with extensive, illustrated entries for all species and will enhance access to the results in print as well as electronic media. Extending revisionary work to the poorly understood Atlantic Conus fauna will produce a monograph on Western Atlantic Conus, modeled on the 1995 volume on Indo-Pacific species by Dr. Kohn and colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its importance for general marine biodiversity, Conus is notable in that many very similar species-up to 36-co-occur on the same coral reef. Ecological studies of these assemblages have helped show why tropical reef-associated habitats support such high biodiversity. All Conus species produce potent venoms called conotoxins used to subdue prey. These conotoxins are now widely used in neurobiology, and the number of medicines derived from them is increasing rapidly. At least three are in current use, and more than 45 patents for medical uses have been awarded. Each of the many similar species has specific ecological characteristics as well as its own suite of venoms, and accurate species determination is essential to both basic scientific and applied fields, but it is difficult. This project will help understand evolutionary history and will facilitate research in ecology, biogeography, evolution, neurobiology, and medicine.\r\n",
