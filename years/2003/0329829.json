 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research:\r\n\r\nRecognizing the increasing need for highly sensitive, accurate and portable micro-chemical sensors, the project focuses on developing an effective micro- mass spectrometer to positively identify and accurately quantify low concentrations of chemical and biological reagents.  The objective of the research is to design, model, fabricate, test, and integrate a miniature mass analyzer to augment the existing chemical analysis capability of a micro-ChemLab-on-a-chipTM.  This research will focus on assessing the functionality of micro-metered cylindrical ion traps in an array, including the detection sensitivity, selectivity, resolution, and mass detection range.  By combining theoretical analysis and experimental fabrication, the PI will integrate this miniaturize mass analyzer with a miniature gas chromatograph column, a micro- thermal conductivity detector, a surface acoustic wave detector, and an internal calibration unit, for chemical and biological sensing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe research outcome will be integrated into two courses developed by the PI to maximize the impact of the research, i.e., an undergraduate course featuring a Micro-Fabrication Laboratory and a graduate/undergraduate course on Surface and Interface Engineering.  One female student will be supported under this program to pursue her Ph.D. degree.  Senior research projects and summer positions will be offered to undergraduate students at UCLA, especially women, to work on ion trajectory simulation to help their long-term career development in academia or industry.  Summer internships will also be offered to female high school students through the outreach activities established by the PI to promote the interest of female students in pursuing science and engineering when they enter college.\r\n",
