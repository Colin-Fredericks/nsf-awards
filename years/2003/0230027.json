Wannamaker (University of Utah, Energy & Geoscience Institute, 423\r\nWakara Way, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, pewanna@egi.utah.edu)\r\nAbstract\r\nEnd-member possibilities for stable lithospheric extension will be tested according to\r\ntheir influence on physical properties of the deep crust and upper mantle across the Great\r\nBasin-Colorado Plateau transition zone, south-central Utah. The main geophysical\r\nproperty to be investigated is electrical conductivity, together with its implications for\r\nthermal and rheological state, which will be imaged using the magnetotelluric (MT)\r\ntechnique. New MT surveying primarily across the transition zone (TZ) per se will join\r\nexisting data into an E-W transect nearly 400 km in length, with a depth range of\r\nsensitivity from 100's of m to 250-400 km approximately. Data will be acquired using\r\nwideband and long-period recorders of the University of Utah and University of\r\nWashington, which reside in the NSF-supported EMSOC instrument facility. Existing\r\ngeophysical indicators show a strong N-S strike orientation at upper crustal to\r\nlithospheric scales and should allow accurate cross sections of model conductivity using\r\nmainly current 2-D regularized inversion platforms. Substantially reduced electrical\r\nresistivity values at lower crustal and upper mantle depths inferred from MT field\r\ndata most likely reflect melts and exsolved ionic fluids. Previous surveying indicates\r\nthat the onset of low resistivity in the deep crust occurs for T > ~500-550 o C in high-grade\r\nmetaigneous host rocks. Depth variation in low resistivity thus will approximate\r\nan isotherm which should evolve gradually from the GB to the CP in the case of\r\nuniform TZ warming, or show an upwelling under the little-extended TZ in the case\r\nof non-uniform, enhanced extension at depth. Exsolved fluids weaken the lithosphere\r\ngreatly through diffusion creep, so resistivity will provide a clear view of at least\r\nrelative rheological contrasts. Conductivity, heat flow and constraints on composition\r\nand timing of extension, will be used in time-dependent, 2-D thermal modeling for an\r\nimproved projection of the thermal field into the upper mantle.",
