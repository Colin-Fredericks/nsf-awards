The joint research effort will combine theoretical and experimental studies of mechanisms of stochastic synchronization and de-synchronization for deep brain stimulation therapy of Parkinson's disease by the German group and experimental electrophysiological and theoretical modeling of stochastic synchronization and phase resetting in electroreceptors of paddlefish by the US group.  The specific goal of the collaboration is to understand general mechanisms for controlling synchronization in noisy oscillating neurons and to validate the effectiveness and neural basis of novel stimulus protocols developed by the German group for treating Parkinson's patients by deep brain stimulation.\r\n\r\nThe project also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.\r\n",
