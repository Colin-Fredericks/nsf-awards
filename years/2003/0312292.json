 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kunyansky\r\n     The first part of this project consists in developing fast,\r\nhigh-order accurate algorithms for solving eigenvalue and\r\nboundary value problems for certain elliptic partial differential\r\nequations that describe electromagnetic wave scattering by\r\nsurfaces of objects and wave propagation in photonic crystals.\r\nThis work grows from a set of highly efficient numerical\r\ntechniques recently proposed by the author (in collaboration with\r\nO.  Bruno, Caltech) for problems of acoustic scattering.  Those\r\nmethods, which permit computing of scattering fields from\r\nhundred-wavelength-sized objects, with relative accuracies in the\r\nrange from 0.0001 to 0.000001, are not directly applicable to the\r\nproblems of the current project, due to a different structure of\r\nhypersingular kernels in the scattering equations and a different\r\nmathematical nature of the eigenproblems of photonics.  However,\r\nfurther development of this very promising general approach\r\npromises new computational methods of the same unprecedented\r\naccuracy and efficiency.  The second part of the project is\r\ndevoted to the design of analytic (theoretically exact)\r\nalgorithms and search for new analytic inversion formulas for\r\nSingle Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).  In\r\nparticular, explicit inversion formulas recently discovered by\r\nthe author are used to develop an efficient algorithm for 3-D\r\nSPECT reconstruction from parallel beam measurements made from\r\nnon-planar directions.  Also, an analytic solution is sought to a\r\npractically important problem of 2-D SPECT reconstruction from a\r\nreduced (collected in the 180 degree angular range) set of\r\nmeasurements.\r\n     The need for efficient computational methods arises in\r\nseveral broad areas of application.  For example, non-invasive\r\ntesting, remote sensing and, most importantly, radar and radar\r\nevasion technologies require very accurate solution of surface\r\nscattering problems.  The investigator develops new, fast, very\r\naccurate methods for computing solutions of such problems.  The\r\nnew computational techniques find applications in the theory and\r\ndesign of photonic bandgap structures (photonic crystals) --\r\nartificial man-made materials that are anticipated to become a\r\nmain building block of devices for the next generation of optical\r\ncommunication networks, and for optical and quantum computing\r\ntechnologies of tomorrow.  Finally, the novel analytic methods and\r\nalgorithms of SPECT that result from this project are important\r\nfor the theory and practice of functional medical tomography,\r\nstudying abnormalities of blood flow in patients.\r\n\r\n",
