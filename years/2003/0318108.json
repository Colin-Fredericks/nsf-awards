 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms have evolved to use a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis, respond to environmental stimuli, and carry out the programmed changes that drive development.  Regulation is often exerted at the level of gene transcription to conserve energy, and viruses are excellent model systems for the study of such regulatory mechanisms.  The scientific goal of this research project is to describe from a molecular, mechanistic, and structural perspective how the Mor protein, a member of a unique family of small transcription activator proteins, carries out its regulatory role by activating transcription of the genes expressed during the middle phase of development of the model transposable virus bacteriophage Mu.  Experiments will be conducted (i) to complete the three dimensional structure of the Mor protein by X-ray crystallography, (ii) to test the predictions of that structure by isolating and characterizing mutants altered at residues predicted to be important for Mor structure and function, and (iii) to assay the effects of amino acid changes in Mor and the alpha subunit-CTD of RNAP to define the specific interactions that lead to recruitment of RNAP by Mor.  The broader impact will consist of providing the graduate students conducting these experiments, and younger students (including K-12) who hear them described, with (i) an understanding of multiple research technologies, (ii) training in experimental design and interpretation, (iii) experience in critiquing and applying information from the literature to biological research, and (iv) the excitement of making new scientific discoveries.",
