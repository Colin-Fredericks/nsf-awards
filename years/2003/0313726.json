 "awd_abstract_narration": "At present, there are no universities in Chicago that are designated as a Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education (COE/IAE). This proposal is designed to provide the necessary support for the Illinois Institute of Technology to become the first COE/IAE in the third largest city in the United States. To ensure that we do not reinvent the wheel, the proposal is a collaborative effort with Mississippi State University, a school well recognized as an innovative COE/IAE with past experience in assisting other universities in establishing COE/IAE programs. This project implements the following key changes:\r\n1. Migrate a key course on information security to the undergraduate program.\r\n2. Modify existing graduate-level course on Cryptography so that it will also be suitable for undergraduates.\r\n3. Modify existing undergraduate courses in operating systems, database systems, information retrieval, data mining, networking, software engineering, and computer ethics to include information security and information awareness topics.\r\n4. Evaluate all of these courses to ensure they are meeting objectives, using a new evaluation methodology recently developed for other courses.\r\n",
