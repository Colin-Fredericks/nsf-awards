 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a collaborative experimental effort that explores the coherent spin dynamics of electrons, ions and nuclear spins in low dimensional systems that confine electrons and/or photons.  The proposed experiments focus on model nanostructures fabricated from both conventional and magnetic II-VI and III-V semiconductors and exploit the unique opportunities offered by such systems to systematically tailor spin interactions between confined electronic states, magnetic ions, and nuclei.  The project combines state-of-the-art spin dynamical probes having high temporal (~100 fs) and spatial (~100 nm) resolution with sophisticated materials engineering of a variety of semiconductor-based structures whose dimensions span the nano- to the mesoscale.  The overall thrust of this research program is to develop a fundamental understanding of the control, transport and storage of coherent spin phenomena in semiconductors via optical experiments that probe spatio-temporal spin transport in heterostructures, coherent spin control in optical microcavities, coherent nuclear spin dynamics in isotopically-engineered nanostructures, and coherent spin excitations in mesoscopically patterned ferromagnets.  These experiments potentially have a broad and long range impact on future technologies that explicitly use quantum phenomena for new functionality.  The research provides students with advanced technical training in leading edge materials engineering and condensed matter techniques.  The principal investigators will disseminate the results of their scientific activity to the general public, and continue to attract a diverse and talented student base. \r\n\r\nA fundamental understanding of the transport, storage and manipulation of coherent spin states in semiconductors is important for the future development of quantum information science and technology.  Contemporary materials fabrication techniques offer access to important model systems in this context by enabling the systematic tailoring of spin interactions between confined electronic/photonic states and magnetic ions/nuclei.  This collaborative proposal is aimed at using ultrafast and high-spatial resolution optical techniques to probe coherent electronic, ionic and nuclear spin dynamics in a variety of semiconductor-based architectures with dimensions spanning from the nano- to the mesoscale.  The project will address basic issues such as coherent spin transport in complex heterostructures, coherent spin control in optical microcavities, coherent nuclear spin dynamics in isotopically-engineered nanostructures, and coherent spin excitations in ferromagnetic semiconductor nanostructures. It is anticipated that this project will result in important fundamental insights into questions that are at the very forefront of condensed matter physics and simultaneously have a broad and long range impact on future technologies that explicitly use spintronics or quantum phenomena for new functionality.  The research provides students with technically sophisticated training in the synthesis of semiconductor and magnetic nanostructures, ultrafast optical spectroscopy, low temperature transport, and micromagnetometry, and is hence an ideal training ground for both academic and industrial environments.  The principal investigators will disseminate the results of their scientific activity to the general public, and continue to attract a diverse and talented student base. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
