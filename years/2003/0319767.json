 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nDynamic behavior of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microscopic weld-zone dynamics during\r\nultrasonic welding, sonic-infrared imaging for non-destructive evaluation of cracks, vibration-assisted\r\nprocessing of nanocomposites and imaging of microscopic vibro-acoustic sources are all subjects of current\r\nor proposed multidisciplinary research programs at Wayne State University (WSU), and all of these\r\nresearch efforts would be significantly enhanced by adding the capability for precise measurement of\r\ncomplex high frequency microscopic motions and the distribution of those motions over finite regions in\r\nphysical systems. Such measurement capabilities are not currently available at WSU, and this project\r\naddresses that need by outlining a program for systematic acquisition and development of new instruments.\r\nThe acquisition and development activities are tightly integrated. \r\nThe micro scanning laser vibrometer has the capability to perform full modal analyses related to out-of-plane\r\nmotions in micron-sized regions, while the new 3-D Nano-imager will be developed to provide full 3-D\r\nmotion measurements of nanometer-sized regions. The proposed 3-D Nano-imager will be developed\r\nusing two methods, a new optical measuring method based on the inverse scattering phase retrieval, and\r\nstroboscopic interferometer based three dimensional (3D) measurement technology. Both systems are\r\nneeded for the following reasons; (1) motion measurements generated by the newly developed 3-D Nano-Imager\r\nsystem must be validated by comparison with independent measurements, and the micro scanning\r\nlaser vibrometer system would provide that validation capability, (2) the micro scanning laser vibrometer\r\nsystem can measure out-of-plane motions of micron-sized systems, whereas the developed 3-D Nano-Imager\r\nsystem will extend the measurement capabilities to full 3-D motions of nanometer-sized systems,\r\n(3) the micro scanning laser vibrometer system would be available for our research immediately upon\r\npurchase and installation, whereas it is anticipated that the development of the 3-D Nano-Imager system\r\nwill take at least one year, (4) both systems can be used to some degree in all of the research projects\r\ndescribed in this proposal.\r\n The outcome of the research conducted with the requested instruments will add\r\nsignificantly to the knowledge base in the areas of MEMS devices, sensors based testing, ultrasonic\r\nwelding, nondestructive testing of materials and structures, processing of nanocomposites, and imaging of\r\nnoise and vibration sources. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art\r\ntechniques using state-of-the-art instruments. The results of the research will also be a source \r\nof course projects for a large pool of local engineers, undergraduate and graduate students, \r\nparticularly from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
