 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific resistance of ohmic contacts to n- and p-type GaN, AlGaN, and \r\nGaInN are very important for many device properties such as power \r\nefficiency, amplification, noise, device heating, and reliability. In this \r\nwork, a fundamentally novel approach to low-resistance ohmic contacts to \r\nAlGaN, GaInN, and GaN will be developed and investigated. The contacts are \r\nbased on the employment of the strong spontaneous and piezoelectric \r\npolarization fields occurring in GaN and related compounds. The polarization \r\nfields in the near-surface layers of metal-semiconductor contacts will \r\nenhance the tunneling probability of carriers thereby reducing the ohmic \r\ncontact specific resistance. The theory and modeling pertaining to tunneling \r\nprobability, contact formation, and specific contact resistance will be \r\ndeveloped. Polarization-enhanced contacts will be demonstrated and reduced \r\ncontact resistances will be verified. In addition, the role of polarization \r\nfields in AlGaN-GaN superlattices will be investigated and the superlattices \r\nwill be optimized for ohmic contact applications.\r\n     An integral part of the work will be the incorporation of the \r\npolarization-enhanced ohmic contacts in optoelectronic and electronic \r\ndevices. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in particular LEDs used for \r\nhigh-power illumination applications, are in need of low resistance ohmic \r\ncontacts in order to reduce device heating and improve device efficiency and \r\nreliability. GaN/GaInN LEDs with polarization-enhanced ohmic contacts will \r\nbe demonstrated. Polarization-enhanced ohmic contacts will also be realized \r\nin lasers and transistors and improved properties of these devices will be \r\ndemonstrated.\r\n******************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
