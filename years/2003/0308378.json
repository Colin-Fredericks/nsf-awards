 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research involves the development of catalytic, stereoselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.  New ligands for asymmetric catalysis will be synthesized and hydrovinylation of prototypical vinylarenes, dienes and strained olefins will be carried out.  Further, heterodimerizations including dienes and strained olefins will be probed with the goal of solving the problem of exocyclic stereochemistry and applications of palladium-catalyzed, X-Y-mediated ([X-Y] = [Si-Sn], [B-Sn], [Sn-Sn]) cyclization of diynes, alleneynes and allenylaldehydes will be provided for the stereoselective synthesis of carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Thaliyil V. RajanBabu in the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio State University.  Professor RajanBabu will focus on developing methodology for using abundantly available carbon sources in the catalytic processes for the synthesis of chemical intermediates. The hydrovinylation of commercially relevant vinylarenes as well as dienes and strained olefins will be studied.  The utility of the approach will be showcased by the preparation of synthesis of several biologically active targets.  The project has broader impacts for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and provides an excellent climate for the training of graduate students.\r\n",
