 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I will develop research  of a commercial application that permits law enforcement or intelligence analysts to visualize complex relationships among objects in a consolidated database. This software will operate on large data stores that automatically refresh to maintain currency. Existing tools that perform this function display the results of user queries in textual or numeric formats. Certain inherent human cognitive processes interpose difficulties in converting the raw data to actionable information and knowledge. This visualization program will give analysts the ability to discover previously hidden linkages and relationships among criminals, organizations, locations, weapons, and vehicles that may not be readily apparent by simply examining raw data. The Phoenix and Tucson police departments have agreed to be development partners in this effort. Interviews and observations of investigators and analysts at work will form the basis for the research outcome. This will be a comprehensive software requirements statement. There is substantial demand for easy-to-use analytical software that removes technical and data entry burdens from analysts. Software of this type can assist law enforcement and homeland defense agencies in carrying out their tasks more effectively, at less expense and more quickly than is currently possible.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of such a software product is all law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local level that engage in criminal investigations, and all intelligence gathering agencies.\r\n",
