 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent discovery that transgenes with intrinsic direct repeats can induce gene silencing at a very high frequency (80-100%) has significance for dissecting the gene silencing mechanism and for efficient generation of silenced mutants useful for research and agricultural biotechnology products. The goal of this research is to conduct detailed genetic and molecular analyses of the mechanism of direct repeat-induced gene silencing (DRIGS) and to use this phenomenon in functional genomics approaches. Experiments in this project will determine minimal length of repeats needed to activate gene silencing, use silencing suppressors and mutagenesis to identify mutants with impaired silencing, and develop universal cassettes utilizing DRIGS for gene-knock out/ gene inactivation for functional analysis of plant genes. Successful completion of this project will achieve efficient and consistent gene inactivation; allow expeditious gene function analysis, and develop novel strategies for plant genetic engineering. The DRIGS would be invaluable for analyzing genes in the post gene sequencing era. In addition, research described in this project will advance plant biotechnology and may promote general understanding and awareness of biotechnology. The project will also entail training undergraduate students, career advancement and training of postdoctoral scientists and exposure of minority students to plant biotechnology research.",
