 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is partnering with the Worcester Public School System on a project focusing on the development of human resources related to grade K-6 STEM education.    Projects goals include: developing partnerships among graduate and undergraduate fellows, public school teachers and students, and WPI and WPI-affiliated faculty; implementing the Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework (MSTECF) in the K-6 curriculum by using the partnerships to develop specific teaching strategies; and assessing and disseminating the outreach process, student learning outcomes and teacher preparation that result from this project.  The intellectual merit of this project is evidenced by the support given to the innovative technology component of the state standards.  The direct interaction with K-6 schools, teachers and students is part of the broader impacts of this project.   This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n \r\nTitle of Project: K-6 Gets a Piece of the PIEE-Partnerships Implementing Engineering Education Institution:  Worcester Polytechnic Institute \r\nPI/Co-PI:  Judith E.
