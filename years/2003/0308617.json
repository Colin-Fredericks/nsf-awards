 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT [\"Integrating genetic and acoustic data in the study of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) population structure\"]\r\n\r\nUnderstanding genetic relationships among whales from different geographic areas is essential to effectively managing these endangered species.  This project focuses on defining relatedness and gene flow among populations of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the North Pacific and North Atlantic as a case study for better understanding the utility of genetic and acoustic variation for identifying \"stocks\" of vocally active baleen whales.  In order to determine whether gene flow is \"gender-biased\", male-mediated gene flow estimated from Y chromosome-specific molecular markers (inherited only through males) will be compared directly to female-mediated gene flow estimated from mitochrondrial DNA (which is maternally inherited).  Geographic variation in songs produced by male fin whales from populations in the North Pacific and North Atlantic will then be compared to estimates of genetic distance based on both Y chromosome and mtDNA in order to determine whether geographic variation in songs reflects patterns of gene flow mediated by male fin whales, female fin whales or both.  Acoustic features useful for detecting shorter-term discontinuities in fin whale movement and/or social behavior will be also be identified.  Finally, the research will examine the potential utility of Y chromosome markers for studies of other baleen whale species.\r\n\r\n",
