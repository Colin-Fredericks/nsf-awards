 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project explores synthesis and consolidation of aluminum reinforced with a high volume fraction of nano-alumina, thereby producing a composite with a unique microstructural configuration that includes a nano-channel like morphology. Because of the relatively small inter-particle spacing combined with higher volume fraction of  the  reinforcement, these materials are expected to exhibit superior mechanical properties. A major objective is to obtain a uniform, high volume fraction, nano-sized dispersion of the reinforcement in an economical way. Aluminum-alumina powders will be mechanically alloyed followed by subsequent hot-isostatic pressing. The mechanically alloyed powders and the consolidated composites will be examined using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The composites will be mechanically characterized using conventional mechanical testing, neutron diffraction, and instrumented nanoindentation. Structural and mechanical characterization is expected to result in identifying optimized microstructures in such composite systems.\r\n\r\nWhile such composites were not synthesized to-date, based on the current understanding  of strengthening mechanisms, these composites are expected to possess superior mechanical properties. The research is expected to lead to the synthesis of a new class of composites. The research activities will be integrated with education in updating the content of an undergraduate instruction laboratory course, thereby making undergraduate students aware of recent developments in the area of composite materials.",
