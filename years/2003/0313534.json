The AST conferences were established in 1997 in order to promote scientific collaboration in the area of adsorption science and technology among scientists and engineers, especially those from Pacific Basin countries.  The primary goal and hence intellectual merit of the 3rd Pacific Basin Conference on AST is to allow scientists and engineers from the Pacific Basin Region to present their most recent research efforts in the area of Adsorption Science and Technology and to outline further developments in this area.  In particular, this will allow US participants from academia and industry to interact with their international counterparts and especially to enhance and/or establish collaborations and scientific exchange with adsorption researchers from the Pacific Basin Region.  The conference will cover a wide variety of adsorption related fields from fundamentals to applications, and consist of plenary sessions, oral sessions and poster sessions.  To set the stage for the conference, ten plenary speakers will present in-depth overviews of key research areas covering materials, molecular simulations, equilibria, kinetics, and processes.  The conference will last for four and one-half days, and host approximately 200 participants from around the world, with about 20 participants from the US.  The broader impacts of the 3rd Pacific Basin Conference on Adsorption Science and Technology are mainly associated with the publication of the conferences proceedings volume.  \r\n\r\n",
