 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nQEM STEM Leadership Development Project for Tribal Colleges and Universities  \r\n \r\nThe  Quality  Education  for Minorities  (QEM)  Network  is  requesting  a  three-year  grant  from  the \r\nNational  Science  Foundation  in  support  of  leadership  development  in  Science,  Technology, \r\nEngineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at the Nation.s Tribal Colleges. QEM.s proposed project is \r\ndesigned to further the goals of the Foundation.s Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP). \r\nDue to the special circumstances and needs of Tribal Colleges, the proposed project.s activities \r\nfocus on the Tribal Colleges. However, all institutions eligible for TCUP will be invited to participate \r\nin project activities.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nQEM.s STEM Leadership Development Project will provide Proposal Development Workshops for \r\nprospective  TCUP applicants  as  well  as  Project Management  Institutes  to  support  current multi-\r\nyear  grant  recipients  with  project  implementation.  Professional  development  activities  for  Tribal \r\nCollege  faculty  and  a  Visiting  Faculty  Program  will  stimulate  faculty  growth  and  expand  STEM \r\nteaching capacity. Materials to be produced include a \"Best Practices\" manual and a monograph \r\non scholarly productivity. Collectively, these activities provide an intensive level of support for Tribal \r\nColleges and Universities that support the goals of the TCUP program. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe proposed STEM leadership development activities are designed to help increase the quantity \r\nand quality of TCUP proposals submitted by Tribal Colleges, and participating Alaska Native and \r\nNative  Hawaiian  institutions.  The  project  implementation  and professional development activities \r\nwill  benefit  participants  well  beyond  the  life  of  the  grant  through  resource  development  and  the \r\nenhancement of STEM faculty. Since TCUP grants address substantive educational areas such as \r\nfaculty  development,  curriculum  enhancement,  and  undergraduate  training  and  research \r\nexperiences,  this  project  has  the  potential  for  considerable  impact  on  STEM  educational \r\nexperiences for Native American students nationwide.  \r\n",
