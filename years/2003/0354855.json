 "awd_abstract_narration": "This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the Pacific Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command (PACDIV) for engineering services to the United States Antarctic Program's (USAP) South Pole Station Modernization project (SPSM).  \r\n\r\nThe following tasks are included: \r\n\r\n1.\tSPSM PACDIV Management Support\r\n2.\tSPSM Complete Design of Wing A-4\r\n3.\tSPSM Architectural/Engineering Site Inspection - January 2004\r\n4.\tSPSM FY04 Fire Safety Review and Inspection\r\n5.\tSPSM Title II Services for FY04 Summer Season\r\n6.\tSPSM Title II Services for FY04 Winter Season\r\n7.\tSPSM Post Construction Award Services\r\n8.\tSPSM Revised Lighting Design for A4 and B1-4\r\n9.\tSPSM Aircraft Fuel Module\r\n10.\tSPSM Growth Chamber Review\r\n11.\tSPSM Kitchen Hood Exhaust System Redesign\r\n\r\nSimilar services have been provided by PACDIV and their contractors since 1983.  The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional.  It is expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner.  PACDIV is a government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor.  PACDIV has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict of interest.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for PACDIV to continue with the ongoing tasking.  This award is recommended for the amount of $689,486 as estimated by PACDIV to be funded from the SPSM MREFC project budget.\r\n",
