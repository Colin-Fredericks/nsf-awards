 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) has received support for a workshop for to develop a strategic plan for the organization. The current national scientific, political and financial climate requires that an organization such as the OBFS be proactive, comprehensive and efficient with regard to meeting the needs of its member institutions. Necessary tasks for completing the strategic plan include: 1) define the mission and vision of the OBFS, 2) identify goals and objectives that could be accomplished organizationally, 3) prioritize the goals, 4) set the prioritized goals in a 10-year timeline, 5) attach cost figures to the timeline, and 6) suggest strategies for accomplishing the goals within the time frame and budget. The strategic planning workshop will be held in fall 2003 with 18-20 participants. A web-based survey will solicit input from all institutional and individual members regarding appropriate and reasonable mission, vision, goals and objectives for the OBFS prior to this workshop.  At the 2003 Annual Meeting in September a facilitated discussion will prioritize the information gathered from the survey effort. The survey report and prioritization will be provided to workshop participants before the fall meeting. The product of the workshop will be an \"OBFS Strategic Plan\", available via the Internet and also as hard copy. The strategic plan would be used by the organization to identify efforts that should be undertaken to best serve member institutions. The OBFS seeks to assist member stations to the maximum extent feasible in order to offer the best possible field research and educational opportunities and to sustain the role of field study facilities at a level of recognition congruent with the importance these facilities play in the national scientific agenda.",
