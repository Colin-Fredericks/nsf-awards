 "awd_abstract_narration": "This the first International Conference Applied Computer Algebra (ACA), held in Raleigh North Carolina, July 28-31, 2003. In the past several years there has been a dramatic increase in the applications of computer algebra (CA) in engineering, science and education. The goal of this conference is to facilitate this important progress through an international meeting that emphasizes applications of computer algebra and interdisciplinary interaction between computer algebra researchers and serious users from other disciplines. The ACA conference complements nicely the already well-established conferences, such as ISSAC, which are essentially the intradisciplinary forum for computer algebra researchers on fundamental theories (rather than applications and inter-disciplinary interaction). The conference is organized as a collection of twelve mini workshops (sessions) organized by prominent researchers and focused on their own application areas including education, engineering, physical sciences, economics and life/medical sciences. \r\n\r\nThis conference will have the broad impact on two communities: the huge user community and the research community. The user community will be able to learn about the state of the art theories and algorithms that are proven to be applicable. The research community will be able to learn about important problems/challenges facing the serious users from other disciplines, inspiring fresh new theoretical research and algorithm design.\r\n",
