 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine ovarian genes that are regulated by hormones from the pituitary gland, and the mechanisms of this regulation.  The project focuses on hormone action that controls the rupture of ovarian follicles-a process called ovulation.  The project is based on state-of-the-art procedures in molecular biology and recombinant DNA technologies such as \"microarray\" and \"differential display.\"  In addition, the project will utilize standard methods of Northern blotting and in situ hybridization to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of each gene in the ovarian tissues.  As a more comprehensive picture of ovulation-related genes is achieved, the ultimate goal of this project is to integrate information about the protein products of these genes into meaningful metabolic pathways that explain how a follicle ruptures.  In broader terms, the scientific potential of the project is significant in several other respects.  First, this ovulation process will serve as a clear cut experimental model to study the basic mechanisms by which glycoprotein hormones such as luteinizing hormone (or, its homologue, human chorionic gonadotropin) brings about its biologically programmed 'target tissue' response-in this case the rupture of healthy tissue at the surface of the ovary.  Second, the project can provide basic knowledge about mammalian reproduction with potential value for increasing the productivity of livestock and for regulating human fertility.  Lastly, in view of the similarities that exist between ovulatory and inflammatory processes, this project also has the potential for providing useful genetic information about metabolic changes that occur during inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.",
