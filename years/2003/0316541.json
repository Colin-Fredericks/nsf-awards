 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative research: Extra-pair mating in birds---trading up genetically to enhance offspring health\r\nCharles F. Thompson, Laura A. Vogel, & Scott K. Sakaluk\r\nIllinois State University\r\nL. Scott Johnson & Brian S. Masters\r\nTowson University\r\n\r\n     Many animals, including the majority of bird species, form long-term pair bonds with one member of the opposite sex.  In socially monogamous species of birds, the male and female of a pair typically cooperate in rearing the offspring.  However, use of DNA-based molecular techniques has revealed that the progeny of females in socially monogamous species often are sired not only by their social mate (within-pair mating) but also by other males (extra-pair mating), resulting in broods of mixed paternity.  Why females mate with more than one male remains obscure, because females seldom derive direct material benefits by doing so.  One possible explanation for extra-pair mating is that females derive indirect genetic benefits through enhancement of the genetic quality of their offspring.  This enhancement could be brought about by improvement of the function of the offspring's immune system. \r\n\r\n     The project tests the hypothesis that females in socially monogamous species engage in extra-pair matings to secure paternal genes for their offspring that enhance offspring health and survival.  The project will compare the function of the immune system of young in broods of mixed paternity.  If the hypothesis is correct, immunity of young resulting from extra-pair mating will be superior to that of young resulting from within-pair mating.  Furthermore, these differences should translate into differences in the overall health and survival.\r\n     \r\n     The project will also provide excellent opportunities to enhance the professional growth and development of a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, and will help redress the current under-representation of women and minorities in science. All members of the research team regularly involve undergraduates in their projects and frequently coauthor publications with them.  Graduates students at both institutions also work closely with undergraduates, and they regularly present talks at professional meetings and to the lay public. The researchers have been active in programs designed to enhance elementary school teachers' training in science and to mentor high school students, activities that will continue and expand during the course of the research project.\r\n",
