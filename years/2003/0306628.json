Pitts\r\n\r\nThe Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring\r\nand fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 28 times.  The\r\nconference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in\r\nthe Southwest. The next series of conferences will have six\r\nprimary sponsoring universities: The University of Texas at\r\nAustin, Texas A&M University, Rice University, the University of\r\nHouston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian\r\nUniversity. The conference is designed to enhance both the\r\neducational and the research atmosphere of the growing community\r\nof Texas geometers and topologists.  The conference is committed\r\nto bring researchers of national and international stature to\r\nTexas to discuss their research and to interact with\r\nmathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of\r\ntalks with notation of important results have been reported\r\nannually for some time and will continue similarly in the future.\r\n\r\nBy design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two\r\nhigh-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for\r\nthe community of geometers and topologists from Texas and\r\nsurrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share\r\nmathematics on a regular basis, which both stimulates individual\r\nresearch and generates productive cooperative efforts between\r\nschools.  Second, the conference is committed to the\r\nstrengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.\r\nIn order that there be no barrier to participation, the\r\nconference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there\r\nare no registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty,\r\nwomen, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially\r\nencouraged to participate and to apply for support.\r\n",
