 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near-surface fault patterns of strike-slip systems are now reasonably well understood, in\r\nlarge part because of extensive societal interest (seismic hazard) and a wealth of\r\nsubsurface information obtained from petroleum exploration. What happens to these\r\nfaults at depth, however, is poorly understood. One approach to resolve these questions\r\nis geophysical imaging, but these studies are expensive and typically ambiguous because\r\nof imaging problems of structures ranging from low to high angle in crystalline rocks that\r\noften lack sufficient variation in physical properties for clear imaging. A much higher\r\nresolution technique to resolve these issues is to examine well-exposed down-plunge\r\nsections of strike-slip shear zones. Such a structure exists in eastern Chugach Mountains\r\nof southern Alaska, and this project proposes to examine this structure in detail to\r\ninvestigate the three-dimensional architecture of strike-slip systems at mid to lower\r\ncrustal depths. Previous NSF funded research by the PI and V.B. Sisson has documented\r\nthe structural geometry of the lower and upper portions of the system, but a mid-crustal\r\nportion of the system has not been examined in detail. In light of recent theoretical\r\ndevelopments (e.g. Teyssier et al., in press) the PI's initial conclusions require re-evaluation because the classic hypothesis of steep shear zones penetrating through the crustal column predicts a different geometry than a crustal column in which the upper and lower crust are detached along a broad zone of distributed flow. This project will test these alternative predictions through a combination of field structural studies, kinematic analyses (finite and incremental strain, shear-sense determination, and strain path information through growth fibers and development of quartz LPO's).\t",
