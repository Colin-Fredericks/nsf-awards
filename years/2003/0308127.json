 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between T.L. Alford and J.W. Mayer of Arizona State University (ASU) and S.S. Lau of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) addresses fundamental aspects of ion-induced delamination of thin surface layers from Si and other semiconductors. The ion-cut process uses ion implanted gas atoms to promote splitting and transferring of a thin sur-face layer onto a different substrate. Although the ion-cut phenomenon is widely applied, little is known about many of the fundamental aspects of this process. It was not until very recently that the basic mechanics of the cutting process and the related cut-depth were investigated. This pro-ject seeks understanding of fundamental issues of how and why the ion-cut process affects the properties of the split layers. The approach includes study of the dose, dose rate, and the implan-tation temperature dependence of the exfoliated layer properties. In addition to the ASU/UCSD collaboration, a collaboration with M. Nastasi, team leader of the ion-solid interactions and inter-face engineering group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory is established. D. Adams of the University of the Western Cape, South Africa, UWC, a Historically Disadvantaged University will also be participating as a Visiting Scientist. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with significant technological relevance, and places emphasis on the integration of research and education. This project is expected to have broader impacts in education, and in technology-three dimensional integration by providing layers of semiconductors that can be vertically stacked and also provid-ing single layers of single crystal Si bonded to glass substrates. The research program is carried out by a culturally diversified team and with active involvement with a national laboratory, and involvement of D. Adams of the University of the Western Cape, South Africa will benefit the research programs and activities at UWC and will allow continuation of graduate support for the collaboration between ASU/UCSD and UWC. Graduate and undergraduate students will have opportunities to participate in a multidisciplinary and culturally diverse research and education environment.\r\n***       \r\n",
