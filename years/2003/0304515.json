 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT.  \r\n\r\nThe basis of modern catalysis research at the nanoscale lies in the ability to design, control, and fabricate relevant structures with an unprecedented degree of control and precision.  The overall goal of this project is to bring to bear an array of techniques encompassing preparation and characterization within an interdisciplinary team in order to advance catalyst design for selective oxidation catalysts to a new level.   A recent discovery by the investigators focusing on the nanoscale interaction of gold and cerium oxide has led to a fundamental identification of the active site for the water-gas shirt reaction, which is key to the production of hydrogen from abundant natural resources such as coal and natural gas.  Now this advance in understanding promises to greatly enhance the ability to produce more efficient catalysts that utilize reduced levels of noble [costly] metals.  New approaches that directly embed metal ions or clusters within ceria and other oxides will be utilized.  The potential impact on enabling key technology for a hydrogen energy based economy is very high.  The catalysts are potentially key components of fuel cells and alternative fuel reformers.  Graduate and post-graduate students will be involved in high school and other pre-college students, and a special nanotechnology seminary will be developed.\r\n",
