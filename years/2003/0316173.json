 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, Krauss will investigate the effect of charges on the optical properties of single colloidal CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) and nanorods (NRs) in order to obtain a better understanding of the most fundamental properties of these materials, such as, for example, their exceptional \"on-off\" or blinking behavior. Using a novel atomic force microscope (AFM) and an inverted microscope, the correlation between charge and luminescent images of single CdSe NCs will be studied.  Similarly, the work will attempt to determine the permanent electric dipole moment of single CdSe NRs by means of force microscopy.  Correlations between charge and luminescent images for single NRs can be used to determine the effects of charges on their optical properties.  CdSe NCs and NRs are highly promising materials with potentially great technological impacts, which, however, can be realized only if the relationship between electric charges and optical and electronic properties are fully understood, and the harmful effects of electric charges be minimized or removed.  This work will be done with students and postdoctoral research associates.  They will acquire valuable experience in a forefront area of contemporary science that will prepare them for advanced studies or entry in the scientific/technological workforce",
