 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the use of microtubules (MT) as templates for fabricating nanoscale interconnects, interconnect arrays, and networks. MTs are self-assembling, dynamic, and tubular shaped biomolecules with nanometer size diameters and large aspect ratios, made from polymerized tubulin proteins. Their ends are polarized in that each one exhibits unique and specific biochemical moieties. The objectives of the proposed work include establishing the scientific and technical basis for making nano-interconnects from MTs by developing end-specific capping agents to attach to the ends of the MTs, via creation of a combinatorial/phage library. Also, specific ligands to be attached to functionalized metal pads will be identified and synthesized. Attachment control and selectivity will be achieved by creating complementary molecular patterns on the ends of the ligands and capping agents using affinity group - bifunctional reagent complexes and recombinant peptide stretches. Metallization research will provide key insights into the little known area of metal  biomolecular interactions with the goal of depositing thin Cu and Au coatings on the interior and/or exterior surfaces of the MTs to improve conductivity. Multiscale modeling and computer simulations will be used to guide research on molecular recognition at the ligand/cap interface and on the effects of geometric and chemical factors on the controlled assembly and disassembly of MT nano-interconnects. The objective of the educational component of the proposed NIRT is to promote the rapid insertion of individuals from under-represented groups into nanotechnology businesses. This objective will be met through the NanoTechnology Track (NTT), a course of study that integrates the scientific, engineering, and business aspects of nanotechnology. This integration emphasizes the transition between research idea and consumer product through a focus on entrepreneurship as taught by the University of Arizona's nationally renowned Berger Entrepreneurship Program. The objectives of the NIRT will be met by completion of a series of planned tasks with measurable outcomes distributed amongst the members of a highly interactive, interdisciplinary team of investigators. This team includes: J. Hoying (cell biology and biomolecular arrays, Biomedical Engineering (BME)), I. Jongewaard (phage display, peptide chemistry, Arizona Health Science Center (AHSC)), R. Guzman (polymer/biomolecule interactions, Chemical and Environmental Engr.), S. Raghavan (surface chemistry, electrochemistry, Materials Science and Engr. (MSE)), B. Zelinski (sol/gel chemistry, MSE), O. Palusinski (microelectronics, packaging and interconnections, Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)), P. Deymier (modeling and simulation, MSE) and L. Adamowicz (quantum and computational chemistry, Chemistry). This team will create a virtual education and research unit without traditional departmental boundaries, whose focus is to train diverse undergraduate and graduate students in the scientific and technical multi-linguism needed in today's rapidly evolving field of nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: The broader impacts of this program revolve around moving biomolecules into the engineering arena. Natural and engineered biomolecules, including proteins, possess properties that add a new dimension to the structure/ processing/ manufacturing/ utilization paradigm, giving them a fabulous long-term potential in a vast range of engineering applications. Through this paradigm, the proposed activity will help enable the electronics industry to push feature sizes down to the nanoscale. Also, this program will establish a new educational initiative, the nanotechnology track (NTT) that will serve as a model for integrating the scientific, engineering, societal and business aspects of nanotechnology into economically sound enterprises.\r\n",
