 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project evaluates the feasibility of fabricating a module to measure electric field strength that can be dropped from an aircraft through thunderstorms and hurricanes. Electric field strength is a significant factor in the development of lightning and microphysical particle development in thunderstorms, and recent research suggests that it may even play a role influencing the intensity of precipitation. Research aircraft measurements of electric field strength are difficult and potentially dangerous because of the hazardous conditions associated with thunderstorms, such as lightning, hail and turbulence. Droppable devices, such as dropsondes released from aircraft flying over thunderstorms, and devices carried aloft by balloons, such as common weather radiosondes, can be used to probe thunderstorms safely and cost-effectively. There is currently no commercial device available for measuring electric field strength from radiosondes or dropsondes. \r\n     This research in Phases I presents significant commercial potential and opportunities for Broader Impacts through employment of students in work study programs. There are significant potential societal benefits from improved understanding of damaging thunderstorms and hurricanes, and a better understanding of lightning discharges that threaten commercial aircrafts.\r\n\r\n",
