 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable theoretical progress combined with enormous advances in computer\r\ntechnology has made lattice .eld theory a powerful tool in the study of\r\nnuclear and sub-nuclear structure. The proposed activity has the following intellectual\r\nmerits: i) proposal of new ideas and exploration of new theoretical\r\napproaches to compute interesting novel physical quantities; ii) use of existing\r\ntechniques along with state-of-the-art computers to obtain results of experimental\r\ninterest.\r\nCalculations in lattice QCD are often performed in the quenched approximation.\r\nQuenching e.ects will be studied in detail using lattice fermions that\r\nhave exact chiral symmetry. Calculations beyond the quenched approximation\r\nare computationally intensive and planar QCD will be studied to see if it is a\r\nphysically viable alternative.\r\nExotic hybrid mesons contain valence gluons and can only be studied properly\r\nin the framework of QCD. Experiments scheduled in Hall D at JLab plan\r\nto look for such exotic hybrid mesons. Computations of their decay widths will\r\nbe performed to provide some guidance for the experimental searches of these\r\nexotic hybrids.\r\nLattice QCD will be used to study nuclear forces present in a two hadron\r\nsystem. It will also be used to study the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of\r\nhadrons. These computations are technically involved and results would considerably\r\nincrease our understanding of nuclear interactions from .rst principles.\r\nChiral symmetry in QCD is spontaneously broken at low temperatures but\r\nit is expected to get restored at high temperatures. QCD at high temperatures\r\nis described by a quark-gluon plasma. The physics around the chiral phase\r\ntransition will be investigated using lattice QCD with chiral fermions. The role\r\nof instantons at .nite temperature will be carefully studied.\r\nThe proposed research will greatly bene.t from the participation of a fulltime\r\npostdoctoral fellow and a graduate student. The graduate student working\r\nin close association with the PIs and the postdoctoral fellow will become familiar\r\nwith the research done at the forefront of nuclear theory and also get a good\r\ntraining in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources. As part of\r\nthe outreach program, a senior physics student will be employed to set up a\r\nwebsite describing the projects at a level that is accessible to high school students,\r\nteachers and the local community at large. By focusing on high pro.le\r\ntopics currently of great interest at national laboratories, the proposal hopes to\r\nassist in the e.orts of the local university to attract new students from underrepresented\r\ngroups.",
