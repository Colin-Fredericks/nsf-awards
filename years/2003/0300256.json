 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop collaborative research in the testing of MEMS\r\nmaterials with the colleagues in South Africa at University of Witwatersrand (Wits) and\r\nUniversity of Cape Town. The focus of this research is on working jointly in the design and\r\nmanufacture of a testing jig which features the integration of a load cell, high resolution\r\ndisplacement device, mounting and loading of test specimen, and data acquisition with analysis.\r\nThe completion of the proposed collaborative research will result in the design and fabrication of\r\nthe jig for conducting collaborative research at both the US and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe potential technical application of this project is the jig for material testing for MEMS\r\nmaterials. In broader impact, the teaching and research collaboration with the colleagues in\r\nSouth Africa will enable us to work together and to utilize expertise and resources on both sides\r\nto use this jig setup as the basis for further research expansion in MEMS material testing. The\r\ncolleagues in South Africa can also use this testing jig to investigate the fracture properties of\r\nMEMS test specimen (their expertise). Such research collaboration will benefit us, and also will\r\nbenefit research program of our colleagues in South Africa. More importantly, this will lead to\r\nthe introduction of MEMS technology to the universities and industries in South Africa. The\r\nexpected outcomes of the research and teaching collaboration also include the development of\r\nMEMS courses and curriculum in South Africa which will be the first of its kind at the\r\nuniversities in South Africa.",
