 "awd_abstract_narration": "0244169   Casey   The objectives of our proposed project are to identify the fate and transport mechanisms of the endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), 17b-estradiol, in soil-water systems. We chose 17b-estradiol because it is a prototype for many EDCs, it has high potency, it has the potential of being prevalent in the environment, and little is known about it. Our purpose for doing this research extends beyond academic interests. We hope to share the results from this research to advance the knowledge of exposure to EDCs in the environment; to increase our ability to predict the mobility and persistence of EDCs in the environment; to use the result to help develop methods to treat polluted soil and water or to remediate contaminated areas; and to educate and train the local community to promote awareness and interest in this research.\r\nIn the environment, EDCs interfere with endocrine systems by disrupting normal function and/or interfering with development at all life stages. Often, EDCs mimic the reproductive hormones (e.g., estrogens) produced naturally by humans and wildlife, and can produce adverse effects at remarkably low concentrations (< 1 ng L -1 ). Numerous studies have suggested that EDCs have caused widespread physiological and reproductive disorders in birds, fish, shellfish, turtles, gastropods, and mammals. Additionally, EDCs have been implicated in recent adverse trends in human reproduction (i.e., an increase in female breast cancer and decrease in male sperm counts). A recent reconnaissance of surface waters in the U.S. has detected EDCs in approximately 50% of the 139 streams tested. However, little or nothing is known about the fate of these chemicals and how they move in soil before they contaminate our groundwater and\r\nsurface water resources.\r\nTo achieve the objectives of this research, we formed a unique research team that include\r\nindividuals from biochemistry, soil science, mathematical modeling, and biosystems engineering and environmental sciences. We developed six goals: 1) identify fate and transport mechanisms of 17b-estradiol and metabolites in soil; 2) identify transformation/degradation mechanisms of 17b-estradiol to form metabolites; 3) discover the influence of preferential flow on the transport of estrogens; 4) develop, apply, and evaluate a predictive computer model; 5) integrate this research with education; and 6) disseminate this research to a broader community using presentations and publications. We proposed experimental methods and strategies that would be used to accomplish each of these goals. A series of soil batch, degradation, and column experiments would be used to identify the sorption, transformations, and mobility of 17b-estradiol and its metabolites in a variety of soils with different particle sizes, organic matter contents, and structures. This information would be used to formulate a hypothesis of fate and transport and develop a computer model, which would be used to analyze the data. The research would be integrated into education by recruiting graduate students, by including this research in university courses, and by developing a close working relationship with a local K-12 teacher. Preliminary research done by the team of collaborators on this proposal demonstrates the likelihood of success of this project. Furthermore, the proposed project improves networks and partnerships of individuals from diverse areas and backgrounds. The networking of different organizations will also improve facilities by making unique analytical equipment available to other institutions that do not have access to these instruments.\r\n  \r\n",
