 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Project is to study some of the Internet routing vulnerabilities, especially in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) domain, and propose a resilient routing framework. This research develops models, metrics and algorithms as well as validates the results with real traces and scenarios to achieve the reliable IBGP (Internal BGP) reflection topology design, network availability assessment, and routing survivability. Router and link failures, errors in human maintenance, and changes in resource availability lead to reliability variations on different routers, links and IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) paths. Furthermore, IBGP is organized currently using clusters and route reflection topology, where different reflector and clients configurations have different reliability in IBGP operation. It is therefore important to deploy IBGP sessions on IGP paths that are more reliable, as well as place reflectors on reliable routers to avoid reflector failures and client isolations. In terms of network availability it is of crucial importance to address and manage resource availability as dynamic information, as well as to develop a QoS representation that can handle heterogeneity in global Internet routing. This project will develop methods of how to efficiently manage resource availability during route upgrading and link repairs. Finally, this project introduces a new trustworthiness model and light-weighted authentication to increase routers immunity to bad route advertising and misbehaving neighbors.",
