 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on establishing a method for understanding qualitative and quantitative connections among product architecture, product modularity, and life-cycle costs.  Product architecture - the structure of assemblies, sub-assemblies, and components - has an enormous impact on the costs associated with each life-cycle phase of a product - manufacturing, assembly, service, retirement, etc.  Component grouping into modules is one of the critical early decisions made by designers.  This work aims to provide the relationship between modularity decisions and life-cycle product costs that designers lack by quantitatively relating each to product architecture.  The expected result will be a validated, implementable design method that includes these quantitative relationships and it is hoped to explicitly show, and therefore encourage, the application of validation to design methods.  If successful, this research will yield a fundamental bridge between the elements that a design engineer controls early in the engineering design process and the long-term life-cycle costs of a product.  After application by design engineers, the result should be dramatically reduced product life-cycle costs and dramatically reduced product development cycle times.  In the longer term, this research in product architecture should yield fundamental linkages that enable true up front concurrent engineering where products and processes are designed for minimum total life-cycle costs.\r\n\r\nThroughout this project, the PI will team with Ph.D. students in the life-cycle engineering laboratory and undergraduate researchers through the Michigan King-Chavis-Parks Initiative for underrepresented students.  The PI also plans research / teaching opportunities with classes in life-cycle engineering, senior capstone design, and new product development.\r\n",
