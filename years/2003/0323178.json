 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Environmental Science Information Technology Activities (ESITA)\" based at the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) at UC-Berkeley is a three-year, youth-based proposal that seeks to engage 144 inner-city ninth and tenth graders in learning experiences involving environmental science and information technology.  The goal of the project is to develop, field-test, and disseminate an effective student-centered, project-based model for increasing understanding and interest in information technology.  Program components included an afterschool program, summer enrichment and an internship program.  An extensive partnership involving community based agencies, environmental science organizations, a local high school and industry support the project by serving as host sites for the afterschool program and internship component.\r\n\r\nStudent participation in project-based, IT-dependent research activities related to environmental science will occur year round.  Students will research air and water quality in their local communities and study attitudes toward -- and use of -- information technology among their peers.  The focus of the research activities is based on the results of a students-needs assessment.  Students participate in the program over a two-year period and are expected to receive at least 240 total contact hours.  The afterschool program serves as the project's principal mechanism for content delivery.  The five-month afterschool program consists of inquiry-based mini-courses on the following topics:  Information Technology tools and concepts, earth and physical science, data compilation and modeling, and publication of research results.  The summer enrichment component encompasses a series of workshops at LHS; excursions to IT-related exhibits, environmental facilities, and IT-based companies; and an annual student robotics fair.  During the second year of program participation students will complete 12-month internships to support the application of concepts and skills learned the first year.  The LHS Student Geoscience Research Opportunities program will serve as a model host site for the program.  Stipends are provided throughout the program to encourage student participation and retention.      \r\n",
