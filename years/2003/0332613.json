The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Georgia Institute of Technology (Lead Institution), Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute, Savannah State University, Savannah Technical College, Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools, Advanced Control Systems, Advanced Technology Development Center, AGL Resources, Coastal Business and Education Technology Alliance, Energy and Environmental Enterprises, Georgia Department of Industry Trade and Tourism. \r\n\r\nThis award establishes a full scale applied demonstration and evaluation laboratory or Beta site for Alternative Energy Technologies. The laboratory is located in the coastal Georgia region, which provides the resources necessary to demonstrate and evaluate a number of alternative energies. The activity provides a mechanism for technology transfer from academia to society. It spreads knowledge from one leading research institution (Georgia Tech) to other academic institutions (Savannah State University, Savannah Technical College, and the public school system). It partners with industry to apply the technology in real world environment. Industry partners will ensure that successful projects in this effort will achieve national and international attention and transition to society rapidly. The partnership ensures a broader dissemination of knowledge, and the connections in Africa and South America provide further outreach into the economically deprived regions of the world. Information on alternative energy technology will be disseminated through job training, coursework, and public outreach. Research and development activities will be integrated with education and training. Curricula will be available nationally. Minorities will be targeted for education and training. A regional alternative energy center is likely to spur job creation, and the educational component will provide a technologically literate workforce for those jobs. Development of clean, renewable energy will benefit society at large.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nCurrent energy production and usage are emitting high levels of harmful pollutants. World oil reserves are typically found in regions that are threatened by political considerations. World oil supplies are projected to peak by 2020. U.S. oil production is projected to decline while U.S. consumption is projected to increase considerably. The proponents for alternative energy sources predict a large market in manufacturing alternative energies technology. In addition alternative energies will create new job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in its focus on much needed advancements in applied alternative energy technology systems. Research efforts have led to considerable reductions in costs of various alternative energy forms. Cost reductions alone are not sufficient to result in widespread adoption of the technologies. An integrated and combined approach is being taken to provide systems that maximize energy utilization that is acceptable to a wide spectrum of the U.S. economy and society. The approach requires innovation at every level of the alternative energy value chain, including public awareness and workforce education and training.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity include improving technical workforce skills, improving public awareness and acceptance through community programs and demonstration programs, development of knowledge-based curricula for university through secondary school levels, economic development, and knowledge and technology transfer for commercialization. Underrepresented groups will be involved in all of the activities of the grant.\r\n",
