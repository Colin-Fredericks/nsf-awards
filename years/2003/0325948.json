 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seshaiyer\r\n     The investigator organizes a symposium on mathematical and\r\ncomputational modeling of biological systems at Texas Tech\r\nUniversity from November 6-8, 2003.  The conference consists of a\r\nseries of lectures given by outstanding scholars who have\r\ncontributed extensively to the central theme.  The talks cover a\r\nbroad range of topics, including the mathematics of cardiac\r\narrhythmias, past successes and future challenges in continuum\r\nmechanics of soft biological tissues, a 20 year retrospective of\r\nthe Chay-Keizer model, tumor mechanics, computational biofluid\r\ndynamics, and computational models of cardiovascular surgery\r\nplanning.  The main objectives of the meeting are to: (a)\r\ndisseminate the most recent advances in mathematical and\r\ncomputational approaches in understanding biological systems, (b)\r\nincrease the level of awareness in nurturing mathematical and\r\ncomputational research in biological systems, (c) to train senior\r\nundergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral students and early career\r\nscientists in interdisciplinary aspects of problem solving, and\r\n(d) initiate and promote new collaborations between mathematics\r\nand all areas of science, engineering and science education.\r\n     The theme of the meeting is the opportunity to use\r\nmathematical and computational tools to understand biological\r\nsystems.  The meeting includes experts giving lectures on diverse\r\ntopics in the underlying theme, with the expectation to provide\r\nmembers of the mathematical and engineering community an\r\nopportunity to learn about new research venues.  Participants\r\ninclude undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral\r\nresearchers.  The meeting provides a forum for the exposure and\r\nexchange of ideas, methods, and results in the underlying theme\r\nof the conference.  The conference provides an excellent\r\nopportunity to assess the current developments and future\r\ndirections in this area.  Special efforts are made to encourage\r\nwomen and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in\r\nscience, especially in interdisciplinary areas that bridge the\r\nbiological, mathematical, and computational sciences.\r\n\r\n",
