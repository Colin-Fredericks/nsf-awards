 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing ScienceTutor, a new on-line tutoring model designed to improve student performance in gateway science courses. ScienceTutor offers urban commuter students access to much-needed tutoring support around the clock. The college is developing ScienceTutor resources for three gateway courses in biology, mathematics, and computer science. ScienceTutor includes interactive, graphics-oriented content, including summaries of key concepts, overviews, and solutions to problems, ScienceFAQ, answers to questions often asked by students, TutorTips, advice on how to handle assignments, and e-mail your tutor, real-time chat rooms where students can discuss issues. ScienceTutor differs from conventional distance learning in that it is designed to be used by students outside of class, it responds to students most pressing learning issues, and revised so that it truly serves the needs of users. Formative evaluation of the two-year project employs expert reviewers from Brooklyn College faculty knowledgeable in website design, student responses to questionnaires, focus groups, and field tests. Summative evaluation examines whether students continually choose to use ScienceTutor and whether it supports their performance. College support for the project includes the work of its three directors, experts in collaborative learning and computer science, who work with science faculty designing and perfecting the on-line program so that it serves students. Dissemination is taking place on the web and through presentations at conferences devoted to technology and science education. \r\n\r\n",
