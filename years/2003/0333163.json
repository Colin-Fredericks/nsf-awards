 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on ideas and techniques developed in proposer's previous works,\r\nthe proposal is to pursue two projects related to aspects of Floer theory.\r\nThe first is to relate the 3- and 4-manifold invariants recently defined\r\nby Ozsvath and Szabo (OS) with the Seiberg-Witten invariants (SW), based \r\non an extension of the geometric picture underlying Taubes's proof of the \r\nequivalence of Seiberg-Witten invariants and Gromov invariants of \r\nsymplectic 4-manifolds. Since the two definitions (OS vs SW) are\r\ndrastically different and each has its own advantage, a relation of\r\nthe two should yield important consequences in low-dimensional topology.\r\nThe second project is to extend and generalize the proposer's recent\r\nwork on Floer-theoretic torsions. These are symplectic invariants \r\nwhich on one hand refine the Floer homology, on the other hand have\r\ninteresting relations with \"1-loop\" Gromov-Witten invariants. The \r\nrelation remains to be better understood, yet it has already been \r\nused to obtain results in symplectic topology which are beyond the\r\nthe reach of Floer homologies. Moreover, the Lagrangian intersection\r\nversion of this invariant should be regarded as a simplest example of\r\n\"open Gromov-Witten invariants\", which though still not rigorously\r\ndefined in general, are expected to relate to the Chern-Simons invariants \r\naccording to the physicists (Vafa, Witten et al).\r\n\r\nThis proposal showcases the recent fertile interactions between \r\nmathematics and high energy physics. Gauge-theoretic invariants,\r\nenumeratitve invariants of holomorphic curves, and Floer theory\r\nall have their origin in physics, yet have since yielded the most\r\nimportant recent results in the fields of low dimensional topology and\r\nsymplectic geometry. The proposal deals with fascinating relations\r\namong these physics-inspired invariants, and their applications to \r\ntopology.\r\n",
