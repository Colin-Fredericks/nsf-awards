The central idea in the field of cardinal\r\ninvariants is to assign cardinal numbers to various Borel (that is,\r\nsuitably definable) structures on the real line or similar spaces.\r\nThe comparison of these cardinal numbers provides a way to measure\r\ndifferences between distinct Borel structures, and the principal\r\ninvestigator has developed a method for comparing many of these\r\ncardinal numbers.  It turns out that the comparison of cardinal\r\nnumbers frequently translates back to natural Borel questions about the\r\nBorel structures, without loss of information.  Questions to be studied\r\nunder this grant include the extension of the syntactically defined\r\nclass of problems for which the technique sketched above works; the\r\nrelevance of large cardinal axioms to the translation method; particular\r\ncases of Borel structures arising in dynamical systems or in the study\r\nof Borel equivalence relations, and a duality that relates these results\r\nto a method recently found by W. Hugh Woodin.\r\n\r\nOrdinary cardinal numbers are used for counting, i.e., for comparing\r\nthe sizes of collections of objects.  For more than one hundred years\r\nmathematicians have had a version of cardinal numbers for infinite\r\nsets, beginning with the notion of comparison: if two sets A and B can\r\nbe put into a one-to-one correspondence then we say that A and B have\r\nthe same cardinality.  From this point of view the set of natural\r\nnumbers {1, 2, 3, ...} and its subset of even natural numbers {2, 4,\r\n6, ...}  have the same cardinality (size) since multiplication by 2\r\ngives a one-to-one correspondence from the first set to the second\r\none.  Both of these sets are infinite, i.e. larger than any finite\r\nset, and one of the key steps in the development of logic and set\r\ntheory was the realization by Georg Cantor that the set of real\r\nnumbers is definitely of a larger cardinality than the set of natural\r\nnumbers.  Modern set theory has developed notions and tools for\r\nworking with sets of larger cardinality than the real line, and\r\nthese tools are becoming useful in exploring constructions and\r\nproperties that arise in dynamical systems and measure theory.",
