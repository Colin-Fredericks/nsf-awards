In spite of its importance in future agricultural, irrigation, and hydro-electrical energy development plans, the geological and geomorphological evolution of the Gorge of the Nile is not fully understood. This two-year project will combine remote sensing technology and field studies to study the Gorge of the Nile. Remote sensing data that will be used include NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Shuttle Imaging Radar (SRTM) data, as well as RADARSAT data collected by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Field studies will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from the Ethiopian Geological Survey (EGS).\r\n\r\nIn addition to elucidating the geomorphological evolution of the Nile and rivers in general, this project will also demonstrate the usefulness of NASA's remote sensing technology for geological and geo-technical studies, provide an opportunity to train a young scientist, and strengthen international scientific and technical collaboration between a U.S. university (UTD) and an organization in Africa (EGS). Both organizations will benefit from the project through exchange of remote sensing data, jointly-conducted field work, and complementary training opportunities in remote sensing technology for both the U.S. student and the Ethiopian scientist.\r\n",
