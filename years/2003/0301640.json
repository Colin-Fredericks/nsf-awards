 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for purchase of a modern spectropolarimeter intended to replace a 15 year-old instrument that is nearing the end of its useful lifespan.  The new instrument will be equipped to make simultaneous measurements of circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence, and will also be equipped with stopped flow capabilities.  The instrument will permit measurements at short wavelengths and over long time periods that are inaccessible with the existing instrument.  Seven research groups will use the instrument to conduct biophysical studies on proteins, short peptides, nucleic acids, and natural products isolated from organisms living in the Antarctic.  In addition to its use in these research projects, the spectropolarimeter will be used in two formal courses, one at the senior undergraduate level and another at the graduate level.  The institution has a large undergraduate enrollment of underrepresented minorities, and conducts an NSF-sponsored REU summer program targeted at students from smaller institutions. Over 500 graduate students are currently enrolled in the departments that have used the existing instrument.  The instrument will be available for use in both training and research by students at all levels.",
