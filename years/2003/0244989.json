 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing short-lived nuclear beams together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the  structure and reaction mechanisms at very low collision energies of neutron- and proton-rich light nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability.. Much of the work is related to the synthesis of elements in normal stars, as well as in supernova explosions and other extreme astrophysical environments. The work primarily will be done at the University of Notre Dame and will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together  with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) colleges and universities, most located in the Midwest . As in the past, the proposed work will have applications in other areas using nuclear technology  including medicine and national security..\r\n\r\n",
