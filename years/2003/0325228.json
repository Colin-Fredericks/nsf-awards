 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract:\r\nInterconnection network fabrics are becoming an ever-more critical \r\ncommunication backbone of many digital systems, providing the means for \r\nsystems to scale up in capacity. As these systems become \r\npower-constrained, networks stand to be the weakest link, unless there \r\nis a shift from prior performance-driven approaches to one that focuses \r\non the power efficiency of networks.\r\n\r\nThis project takes a multi-level approach to power-efficient interconnection \r\nnetworks that synergistically bridges research in circuits, architecture \r\nand software, providing a complete solution that will make power-aware \r\nnetwork fabrics a reality. Research into novel low-power circuit \r\ntechniques develops basic network building blocks for new\r\npower-efficient network architecture designs. New link and switch \r\nmechanisms uncovered at the circuit-level are leveraged for \r\nrun-time architectural tradeoffs in network power and performance. \r\nHigher up in the hierarchy, the software level closest to users \r\nanalyzes and factors in user power-performance requirements.\r\n\r\nThis research targets a diverse range of systems -- (1) both \r\ngeneral-purpose and embedded systems; (2) both electrical and optical \r\nnetworking technologies, seeking to determine the optimal choice between \r\noptical versus electrical interconnection at each level in the network \r\nhierarchy from a power perspective; (3) from tiny on-chip networks to\r\ndata center-wide chassis-to-chassis networks.\r\n\r\nThe research is integrated into the education curriculum, \r\nthrough existing and new graduate courses, and in undergraduate research \r\nprograms. The project seeks to further broaden the participation of \r\nunderrepresented groups in research activities. As a pioneering effort in\r\npower-efficient interconnection networks, the project seeks to\r\nfacilitate future research and education in this area through the \r\nrelease of simulation tools and other results.\r\n",
