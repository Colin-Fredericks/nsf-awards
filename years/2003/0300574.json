 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research program, Professor Hong Liang at the University of Alaska Fairbanks seeks to develop a new and perhaps revolutionary nanofabrication process to generate nano-scale phases - a crucial step for further expansion of the fledgling nanotechnology manufacturing industry.  There are two objectives in this program. The first objective is to develop nanofabrication processes to generate nanodimension phases. The second objective is to understand the role of mechanical stimulation on phase formation and transformation at small scale. The primary experimental approach is to use an atomic force microscope (AFM) to conduct mechanical stimulation. Professor Liang will use several contact and scanning modes to dope elements from an AFM tip to a substrate surface. The doped surfaces will be subsequently heat-treated to form desired phases. The AFM will also be used for surface characterization, along with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscope techniques. How structure-surface properties are impacted by the effects of mechanical energy and heat treatment processes will be studied. The simplicity and flexibility of the mechanical manipulation techniques is a significant advantage for synthesis and characterization of nano-structures. The potential applications in nanomachining, assembly, nanosensors, and development of MEMS and NEMS are extremely exciting. Intellectual merit also lies in developing scientific understanding of a series of new phenomena and non-equilibrium transformations. These include: properties of nanophases, nanoscale phase transformation, and their property-performance relationships with materials. Understanding friction-induced nanophases and phase transformation will open new areas of materials research in surface science and nanostructured materials. \r\n\r\nThis research is integrated with education activities, including ongoing program development in Materials Science and outreach to Alaskan K-12 and schoolteachers. Both graduate and undergraduate level students will be involved in this research. Students will have an opportunity to explore the most advanced manufacturing technologies.  Expanding such new technologies and bringing them to public attention in the local community is the first step to encouraging small companies in Alaska. Such companies can create more job opportunities in the state, and could change Alaska's technology infrastructure for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n",
