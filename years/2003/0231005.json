 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical chemistry instructional laboratories at colleges and universities in the United States are in need of modernization.  Not only do they lack modern equipment, but many of the topics in the lecture are not reinforced by the laboratory component.  The problem is largely due to the expense involved in purchasing spectroscopic equipment such as lasers.  In this project we are developing several laboratory modules which will utilize new generations of blue and near-UV diode lasers that can serve as low-cost spectroscopy sources for physical chemistry experiments.  The planned modules cover the following topics: laser Raman spectroscopy, laser light scattering to monitor particle size, laser ionization of alkali metal atoms, and luminescence decay to measure excited state life times.  Previous experiments that utilize the blue diode lasers which examine the photoelectric effect, laser-induced fluorescence, and electronic spectroscopy of argon atoms are also being developed into full modules.  The instructional modules to go along with the equipment are being developed both as traditional laboratories and inquiry-based activities.  Partner institutions will test the modules as they are developed.  A commercial vendor will also be a partner to develop these experimental modules into low-cost instrumental packages for those who are unable to build these experiments on their own.",
