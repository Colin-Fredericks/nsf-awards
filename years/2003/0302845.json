 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College of Baltimore County is developing the Grace Hopper Scholars Program  in Mathematics and Computer Science.  This program is designed to prepare women for success in required mathematics courses, provide an environment that builds their confidence, create awareness of careers in computer science, and emphasize the impact women can make in this vital field.  Major components of the program include a summer bridge program before students enter in their first full semester of coursework, a curriculum which emphasizes mathematics and job market skills, and a support network which helps to create a community of learners.  This project also encourages female students to pursue advanced mathematics in combination with computer science. By offering solutions to acknowledged barriers, the investigators seek to demonstrate whether the key to attracting more women to the field of computer science lies in support for rigorous mathematics training, multiple applied learning opportunities, or female role models and mentors.\r\nThis project is also providing a replicable model for other community colleges as it expands to neighboring Anne Arundel and Prince George's Community Colleges. A working group of educational partners from other Vanguard community colleges, in addition to the two partners listed above, are consulting on new course design, program development, and assessment to ensure a replicable program. Course materials, professional development resources, and data are being made available online.\r\n",
