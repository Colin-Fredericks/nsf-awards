 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOur ability to monitor, anticipate, and respond to changing circumstances and events is increasingly\r\nimportant, particularly with regard to our physical surroundings. Nowhere is this capability more vital to\r\nsociety, or the challenges associated with its practical implementation greater, than in the context of the\r\natmosphere, where hazardous local weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, microbursts, snow storms,\r\nand floods  as well as lofted radiological, chemical and biological agents  can, in a matter of minutes or\r\nhours, destroy or contaminate life and property over vast areas. Yet, the portion of the atmosphere that\r\ncontains the bulk of both natural and man-made hazards  the lower troposphere and particularly the\r\natmospheric boundary layer is grossly undersampled by today's sensing technologies.\r\nOur ERC proposes a revolutionary new paradigm in which transforming systems of distributed,\r\ncollaborative, and adaptive sensing (DCAS) networks are deployed to overcome fundamental\r\nlimitations of current approaches. Here, distributed refers to the use of large numbers of\r\nappropriately spaced sensors capable of high spatial and temporal resolution throughout the entire troposphere.\r\nThese systems will operate collaboratively within a dynamic information technology infrastructure,\r\nadapting to changing conditions in a manner that meets competing end user needs. These systems will\r\nachieve breakthrough improvements in sensitivity and resolution leading to significant reductions in tornado\r\nfalse alarms, vastly improved precipitation estimates for flood prediction, fine scale wind field imaging\r\nand thermodynamic state estimation for use in airborne hazard dispersion prediction and other applications.\r\nSuccessful implementation of DCAS systems will require fundamental breakthroughs consistent with the\r\nNSF Technical Merit Review Criteria. Among these breakthroughs will be integration and sharing of knowledge\r\nacross disciplines; design and fabrication of low cost, multi beam, solid state radars; creation of a systems\r\nbased architecture to organize sensing, computing, and communications resources; development of\r\ntwoway end user interfaces that dynamically target system resources; deployment of integrative test beds to\r\nvalidate assumptions and understand emergent system behavior; implementation of cross linked hierarchical\r\ndata storage and processing; and improved understanding of small scale atmospheric processes.\r\nTo achieve these breakthroughs, we have assembled leading engineering and computer science\r\nexperts from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. They will work in partnership with scientists and\r\nengineers from the University of Oklahoma, Colorado State University and the University of Puerto Rico,\r\nMayaguez, and corporate partners including Raytheon, IBM, Vaisala, and federal and state government\r\nagencies to create the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA). We will create\r\nscalable prototype test beds to demonstrate the potential for DCAS to revolutionize our understanding,\r\ndetection, and prediction of hazardous atmospheric phenomena with end users involved from the outset.\r\nCASA meets the NSF Broader Impacts Review Criteria through: comprehensive education and outreach\r\nprograms that introduce systems based engineering to K-12 students via the mandated engineering/technology curriculum in Massachusetts, and serves as the mechanism for expanding participation by under represented groups in engineering and scientific endeavors at all levels. Further, it will engage first responders and other end users through the provision of both technology and training. CASA will address the observation, prediction and response of weather, an issue that affects between 10 percent and 30 percent of the U.S. gross national product.\r\nOur management structure has the flexibility to take advantage of our broad partnership. For example,\r\nCASA will collaborate with industry partners, who, in turn, will create new product lines and services\r\nbased on our new paradigm for sensing, analyzing, predicting and responding to atmospheric hazards in\r\nthe troposphere.",

The CASA team, with guidance from industrial partners, developed an iterative systems engineering approach to design, implement and validate the performance of the system as it operated during four severe weather seasons in Oklahoma.  During a tornado outbreak in 2011, a tornado struck the town of Newcastle, OK where the CASA radar network was providing real-time data to local emergency managers.  Using CASA data, the Newcastle emergency manager was able to track the trajectory of the tornado and keep local first responders and residents safe from the tornado.  In addition, experiments within the testbed showed an historic breakthrough in the rainfall estimation accuracy, where the CASA radars resulted in a three-fold improvement compared to the current state of the art.\n\nAs part of its education mission, CASA\u00c6s second testbed was entirely conceived by and led by students.  The Puerto Rico testbed focused on \"Off the grid\" sensing for rainfall mapping and flood forecasting.  The student group demonstrated their first radar observations using radars powered by solar panels. They conducted a high-profile demonstration in Summer 2010 when their system was used to provide weather information during the Central American Summer games. This test bed continues to operate. \n\nIn 2012, the CASA team relocated the Oklahoma testbed to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex where CASA research, education, and technology translation continues to this day. DFW Emergency managers, in conjunction with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, have arranged for locally-generated funding to pay for the installation and operation of the network.  This new public private partnership represents the first transition into practice of a CASA network in the US, and is sustaining CASA\u00c6s research beyond the original NSF grant.  Current users and evaluators of the system include over 800 participants ranging from public safety officials, storm water managers, airline and airport personnel, hospital administrators, utility and telecom dispatchers, media broadcasters and officials from federal agencies such as the National Weather Service and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nCASA spearheaded the development of next generation radar hardware by creating electronically scanned radars (phased array) for weather sensing applications. This technology is required to make a large-scale, n..."
