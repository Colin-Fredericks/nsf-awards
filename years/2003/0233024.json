 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR) Phase  I  project  seeks  to  develop  and  commercialize  novel monodisperse ceramic membranes and membrane-reactors. Our innovation is based on self-organized anodic alumina with precisely engineered porous structure and previously unattainable  pore  size (down to\r\n1 nm  or less),  greatly  enhanced chemical  and  thermal  stability,  and  superb  mechanical properties. Commercially available anodic alumina membranes have limited practical  application  due  to  their  fragility,  susceptibility  to  acid  and  base  attack,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  membranes with pore size smaller than 100 nm for symmetrical membranes. The proposed approach  addresses  these  limitations  by  combining  innovative  synthesis  of  highly  ordered  nanoporous  anodic  alumina  with  symmetrical  porosity,  conversion  of  anodic  alumina  into  polycrystalline  ceramic  while  preserving  its  morphology,  and  conformal  deposition  of  functional  layers.    The  proposed technology will enable the fine-tuning of the pore diameter in the ranges from below 1  nm to 200 nm. Deposition of materials inside the nanopores will afford desired functionality. \r\n\r\nThe membranes will target selected applications, such as fuel cell reformers sized for Next Generation Vehicles, integrated mesoscopic power sources for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as future portable energy sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
