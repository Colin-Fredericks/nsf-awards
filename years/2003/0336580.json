 "awd_abstract_narration": "The departments of Physics & Astronomy and Chemistry & Biochemistry are engaging in a multi-pronged program to substantially increase enrollment, retention, and success of future students in both of these departments and the 3+2 cooperative engineering degree program.  The program starts with a pro-active recruitment of students who attend a summer camp that focuses on skill and confidence building using multi-disciplinary approaches and a set of both technological and team-building social skills to solve problems. Students subsequently attending Oneonta and majoring in the targeted programs are eligible for a modest financial incentive.\r\nThe retention component of the program focuses on freshman, as well as established upper-level majors and includes (1) a freshman year, interdisciplinary, seminar and skill-building courses that will emphasize fundamental mathematical and problem-solving skills, as well as provide insight into potential careers in the physical sciences, (2) a physical science walk-in tutoring center overseen by faculty and staffed by upper level majors that provides peer-led mentoring and tutoring, and (3) regular freshman guidance by a single faculty advisor who is qualified from both the educational and scientific perspectives.  Opportunities are also available for students to work during subsequent years' summer camp as peer-leaders or to conduct research with faculty members. Faculty advisors are also responsible for providing students information about participation in external research programs and national scientific meetings to meet peer and senior scientists from other institutions.\r\nThis program has set a goal of attracting16-24 new freshman majors in the aforementioned disciplines during each year of the program with a retention rate of 60-75% remaining within a physical science or related major. The recruitment efforts include targeting students from economically disadvantaged geographical areas surrounding SUNY Oneonta. \r\n",
