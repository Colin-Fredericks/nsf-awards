 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award supports the US-India cooperative research project entitled Planetary Boundary Layer Formulation for Improving Monsoon Forecasts.  US PI T.N. Krishnamurti, Florida State University (FSU) and Indian meteorologist S.V. Singh, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, New Delhi will construct a unified planetary boundary layer model for numerical weather prediction that exploits the strengths and weaknesses of several existing schemes used by operational weather centers and research groups in different parts of the globe.  They will synthesize the most current schemes and retain the best aspects of each formulation in order to devise a multimodel superensemble scheme that will provide future algorithm formulations for short range forecasting.     \r\nScope: Improved predictions of monsoon precipitation for the Asian-Australian region are critical for issues of water resources, agriculture, health, and economic well being for the billions living there.  This research extends work completed by the PI for one region of India to the entire area affected by the Asian Monsoon.  The award supports exchange visits to the collaborating institutions by graduate students from each institution. Cofunding for this research is provided by the Indian Department of Science & Technology under the NSF/DST joint program.",
