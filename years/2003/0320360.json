 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposes to explore the feasibility of creating a low-cost gas sensor highly specific to trace levels of HCN and SO2.  The project consists of two parallel efforts; one to create a nanostructured substrate that selectively binds HCN and SO2, and another to create a low-cost, species-specific Raman spectrometer.  Together, both technologies form a complete, quantitative, near real-time sensor for monitoring HCN and SO2.  Such a sensor would have broad applicability to homeland security monitoring, environmental emissions monitoring, and to fire rescue applications (smoke inhalation of HCN).  The project advances the practice of Raman spectroscopy in several significant ways.  First it seeks to apply Au nanostructure technology to solid-gas interfaces.  Secondly, it proposes a Raman monitor that is compact and low-cost.  The technology used to make the Raman monitor is both novel and highly practical for the development of commercial Raman monitors. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis sensor should have broad applications for users of cyanide or sulfur dioxide products. Hydrogen cyanide is particularly toxic and used in large quantities in the production of plastics and mining of precious metals.   Perfunctory analysis of the market indicates several large chemical firms that are interested in the proposed device.  The device is also needed to provide rapid detection of hydrogen cyanide or sulfur dioxide.  \r\n\r\n",
