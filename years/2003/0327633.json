 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of this investigation include \r\ninterdisciplinary studies of tectonically driven spatio-temporal \r\nsignals resulting from complex geophysical processes.  These \r\nprocesses include convergent plate  boundaries, earthquake \r\ndeformation cycle, mantle convection, intra-plate deformations and \r\nGlacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA).  At present, these processes \r\ngenerate small but measurable signals in the form of surface \r\ndeformations, which at present can only be detected over land by \r\neither point measurements using GPS, or on small spatial scales (<100 \r\nkm) using InSAR.  These \"slow deformation\" signals have spatial \r\nscales longer than hundreds of km to continental and planetary \r\nscales, and temporal scales of a year to decades, and millennia.  The \r\nEarth's gravity field and its spatio-temporal variations, providing \r\ninsight on the integrated mass redistributions within the Earth's \r\nsystems, represent a unique fundamental measurable quantity to \r\ndirectly study mechanisms which drive these complex processes with \r\nmany degrees of freedom.  For the first time ever, dedicated \r\nsatellite gravity missions like CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE are anticipated \r\nto measure these small, broad-scale tectonically driven signals in \r\nthe form of integrated mass change and vertical deformations. \r\nHowever, the contemporary mathematical functions to represent the \r\ngeopotential are conventionally spherical harmonics which do not \r\nallow spatial localization.  3-D wavelets have notable advantages \r\nover spherical harmonics, e.g. for multi-resolution representation \r\nand localization, however, would have to satisfy the so-called \r\n\"boundary-value problem\". The overarching scientific goal is to \r\ndevelop multi-resolution based 3-D wavelet tools to enhance the \r\ntectonically driven spatio-temporal gravity signals for improved \r\nanalyses and to make progress towards addressing the major open \r\nscientific questions of understanding the driving mechanisms of these \r\n\"slow deformation\" over land, ocean and ice-covered surfaces.  The \r\ninvestigators propose to develop mathematical tools based on two \r\nwavelet approaches: (1) the rotational invariant spherical wavelet \r\nfunction, and (2) the non-separable compactly supported \r\ntensor-product wavelets to represent the spatio-temporal gravity \r\nfield signals and perform geophysical \"inversions\" to enhance the \r\nsignals.  The \"inversion\" of these gravity signals represents \r\nstringent mathematical and numerical challenges, especially in light \r\nof the need for multi-resolution representation to enhance localized \r\nsignals and to consider extending wavelets to include the time \r\ndimension.  The broader impacts and anticipated results include the \r\ndevelopment of 3-D wavelet tools capable of solving the boundary \r\nvalue problem and inversion of gravity signals using satellite data \r\nand to demonstrate and apply the technique in the Nazca and South \r\nAmerican plate region.  The developed mathematical tools are intended \r\nto be among the first steps to \"popularize\" the use of 3-D wavelets \r\nfor teaching and research, and are applicable to numerous \r\ninterdisciplinary scientific studies and engineering problems.\r\n\r\n",
