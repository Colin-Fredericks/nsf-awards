 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMEAN CURVATURE FLOW IN HIGHER CODIMENSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mean curvature flow is the gradient flow of the volume\r\nfunctional of submanifolds. The analytic nature is a\r\n parabolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations whose stationary \r\nphase corresponds to minimal\r\n submanifolds. Minimal hypersurfaces and mean curvature flows of\r\nhypersurfaces have been studied extensively for decades but many\r\napplications in mathematical physics and topology call for\r\nunderstanding of the higher codimensional case. This project\r\nproposes to embark on a systematic investigation\r\n of minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flows in higher codimensions. Three \r\nimmediate goals are to understand the\r\n minimal surface system in higher codimension, the Lagrangian mean curvature \r\nflow in Calabi-Yau manifolds and\r\n the deformation of maps between Riemannian manifolds by the mean curvature \r\nflow.\r\n\r\nMinimal surfaces  are like soap films, they are surfaces of least\r\narea. The mean curvature flow is an evolution process which movesT\r\na surface in space  in such a way that its area is decreased most\r\nrapidly. This  is a very natural yet highly nonlinear process and\r\nit models physics phenomena such as the motion of an interface in\r\nforming\r\n metallic alloys. Understanding the behavior of this evolution is important for \r\nsimplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces in the\r\n most efficient way. This process, as a geometric evolution equation, tends to \r\ndeform a geometric object to its optimal shape. A goal of\r\n this project is to apply this process to study certain special surfaces in \r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, the spaces of string theory. It is believed\r\nthat  underlying structures of Calabi-Yau manifolds are encoded in\r\nthese special surfaces, called special Lagrangians. The success of\r\nthis proposal will have important impact on image processing,\r\nmaterial science, mathematics physics and\r\n other nonlinear problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
