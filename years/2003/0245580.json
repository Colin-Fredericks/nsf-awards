 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns problems in number theory and algebraic\r\ngeometry in four specific areas.  First, in joint work with Avner Ash\r\nand Mark McConnell, Gunnells is exploring conjectures in automorphic forms\r\nby studying the action of the Hecke operators on the cohomology of\r\narithmetic groups in different contexts.  Second, jointly with Robert\r\nSczech, Gunnells is studying the connections between special values of\r\nL-functions and group cocycles for the unimodular group.  Third,\r\njointly with Lev Borisov, Gunnells is investigating the construction\r\nof modular forms using toric varieties.  Finally, jointly with Eric\r\nBabson and Richard Scott, Gunnells is studying the geometry of certain\r\nconfiguration varieties naturally arising in representation theory.\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with number theory and algebraic geometry.  Number\r\ntheory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the\r\noldest branch of mathematics.  Algebraic geometry studies geometric\r\nfigures that can be defined by the simplest of equations, namely\r\npolynomials.  The questions and phenomena which arise from combining \r\nthese two subjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary mathematics\r\nresearch.  Moreover, the combination of these subjects has contributed many applications\r\nin such diverse areas as codes and data transmission, robotics, and\r\ntheoretical computer science.",
