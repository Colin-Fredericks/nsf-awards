The PIs plan to participate in the following four cruises: (1) the North Atlantic Ocean meridional section (20-25'W) during 2003; (2) the Pacific Ocean zonal section at 30'N during 2004; (3) the South Atlantic Ocean meridional section (20-25'W) in 2005; and (4) the South Pacific Ocean meridional section (150W) in 2005.  Samples recovered during these cruises will be analyzed for Fe and Al.  In addition, aerosol samples will be subjected to an ultrapure water leach to assess the fractional solubility of Fe and Al.  This team of PIs also plans to collect and archive filtered and unfiltered water samples and aerosols for analysis by other scientists in the trace metal and tracer community.  The primary objectives of this study is to generate an extensive database of Fe and Al concentrations in water and aerosol samples that can constrain global and regional dust deposition models and determine the role that atmospheric Fe depositions have in delivering Fe to surface waters in the major basins of the world's oceans.   \r\n\r\n",
