 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Jin-Song Pei, University of Oklahoma\r\n \r\nThis SGER will support exploratory research on wireless sensor networks for structural health monitoring \r\n(SHM)  with  focus  on  handling  noise-contaminated  data  measurements  and  nonunique  system \r\nidentification results, the two main issues that have been identified with the most critical and urgent needs \r\nin  the  context  of  the  rapidly  growing  sensor  networks,  especially  wireless  sensor  networks.  Untested aggressive novel ideas are presented in the proposal while analytical development as well as numerical and  experimental  validation  will  be  carried  out  in  the  project.  Therefore,  the  project  is  considered  as exploratory and high risk.  \r\n \r\nThe project research will be undertaken through collaboration between the University of Oklahoma (OU) \r\nand Massachusetts  Institute  of Technology  (MIT).  The PI  at  OU will  advise  a  PhD  student  at MIT  to conduct  key  parts  of  the  research  efforts.  Experimental  study  will  be  conducted  at  OU  with  the \r\nparticipation  of  the  PI's  team  and  the  student  from  MIT  during  each  summer  while  analytical  and \r\nnumerical work will be carried out throughout the two academic years.  \r\n \r\nThe main research ideas stem from the PI's successful PhD work at Columbia University on transparent \r\nand engineered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with a development plan expanded drastically in both \r\nbreadth and depth. Serving as a proof-of-concept for the PI's novel ideas on sensor network design and \r\ndata  interpretation,  the  results  will  be  used  to  build  the  PI's  academic  credentials  for  her  future \r\nsubmission for NSF CAREER grant and participations in future major NSF solicitations such as .Sensors \r\nand  Sensor  Networks..  As  an  individual  member  and  an  institution  alternate  representative  of  OU  at NEES Consortium, the PI will apply the ideas and methods developed in this project not only to SHM but also to earthquake engineering, especially those NSF NEES related activities.  \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes advancing knowledge on sensor technology and \r\ninformation  technology  for  civil  infrastructure  health monitoring.  Central  to  this  research  is  to  handle real-world  situations  and  uncertainties,  namely  noise-contaminated  data  and  nonunique  system \r\nidentification results. The attempts are two folds: In terms of data processing and interpretation, novel and \r\nambitious ideas including several types of transparent and engineered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) \r\nand  other  techniques  (such  as improved ERA/OKID, demystified HHT/EMD)  will  be  tested  to  1) \r\nidentify  structural  nonlinearities,  2)  de-noise  and  3)  overcome  nonuniqueness.  In  terms  of  sensors  and sensor  network  configurations,  existing  commercially  available  sensors  will  be  compared  in  terms  of performance  for  civil  engineering  applications  with  the  focus  on  practical  issues  related  to  wireless MEMS  sensors  applications.  New  sensor  network  design  methodology  will  be  developed  with concentration on solving noise contamination and nonuniqueness.  \r\n \r\nWith respect to broader impacts, this SGER project will facilitate cross-institutional and cross-regional \r\ncommunications and partnership by bringing together researchers at OU and MIT. Research results will \r\nbe  disseminated  widely  in  publications  and  academic  conferences.  Development  of  algorithms  will  be carried out in a generic form so that the research will impact a wide range of applications involving data \r\nmining.  The  proposed  research  will  promote  applications  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  to  traditional fields  such  as  civil  engineering.  This  research  will  help  strengthen  the  safety  of  our  nation's  civil infrastructures and improve preparedness for natural and man-made hazards.  \r\n",
