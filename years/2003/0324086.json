 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is combining an existing STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP) grant with a CSEMS grant to build an intensive recruitment and retention program for computer science and mathematics majors.  The objectives of the project are:  \r\n     To increase the number of students majoring in mathematics and computer science, \r\nparticularly those from underrepresented groups;\r\n     To provide adequate support so that students remain in the majors through graduation; and\r\n     To educate students about career opportunities in computer science and mathematics in order \r\nto prepare them to enter the workforce.\r\nTo achieve the first two objectives, eight scholarships of $3,125 are being offered annually to incoming, first-year students in mathematics or computer science and 10 scholarships of $2,000 are being offered annually to non-first-year students in the majors.  The scholarships are being given to students with financial need who show promise in the disciplines. While students receiving the $3,125 scholarships maintain their funding through all four years at Xavier, as long as they stay in good academic standing as majors, recipients of the smaller scholarships must reapply every year.   The third objective is being met by enhancing a STEM career exposure series, partially funded by the STEP grant.  Each year, speakers from industry are invited to address gatherings of first-year majors and potential recruits from area high schools.  CSEMS funding is being used to bring in a nationally known person from outside of Cincinnati as one of these speakers. The primary area of intellectual merit in these activities is the unique combination of the STEP and CSEMS grants into a well-integrated recruitment and retention plan.  While the STEP program provides an infrastructure of support for mathematics and computer science majors, especially in the crucial first year, the CSEMS grant provides scholarships to help recruit and retain these students.  Xavier is well suited to conduct this comprehensive program.  With five major active NSF grants, Xavier has demonstrated its commitment to creating innovative curricula and promoting quality research by its faculty and students.  Furthermore, Xavier's mathematics and computer science department provides personalized assistance and a supportive learning environment for all of its majors.   The main area of broader impact in these activities is the focus on underrepresented groups in recruitment activities.  This includes minorities in computer science and mathematics as well as women in computer science.  In particular, high schools with large African American or female populations are being invited to the career exposure series and preference for scholarships are given to these students.  A second area of broader impact is the funding of student travel to \r\nconferences.  This encourages students to participate in research and to become involved in the professional societies in their respective fields.  Finally, the speakers in the career exposure program are chosen to provide a variety of experiences from the workplace.  In particular, Xavier invites speakers whose work in computer science and mathematics has brought about positive changes in society. \r\n",
