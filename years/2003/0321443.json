 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Venezuela award will support the dissertation research of Peter B. McIntyre, Cornell University, under the direction of Dr. Alexander S. Flecker.  This project involves an assessment of how functional diversity of fishes is related to species diversity in two tropical freshwater ecosystems.  One objective of this project is an appraisal of the importance of fishes in nutrient recycling and the way in which recycling rates and ratios are affected by species extinctions.  Another objective is an evaluation of the relationship between species diversity and trophic diversity of tropical freshwater fishes.  \r\n\r\nThis project provides a valuable perspective on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and impacts strategies for conservation planning and management of tropical fisheries and other natural resources.  The results from this project can influence policies that affect tropical freshwater fish communities upon which millions of people depend for protein.  This activity will give an international research experience to a young U.S. investigator, who will work with other students in Venezuela, as well as with subsistence fishermen.\r\n",
