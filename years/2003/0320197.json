 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes develop unique biopolymers as carriers for enzymes used for biocatalysis.  Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a new class of biopolymers, which undergo a reversible, inverse phase transition. When coupled to enzymes as a fusion partner, the ELP can act as a soluble carrier for performing biocatalysis (below the transition temperature) and an insoluble carrier for isolation and recovery of the enzyme (above the transition temperature). The research objectives of the Phase I project include : (1) Design and synthesis of a series of ELP enzyme carriers, each with different properties ; (2) Expression and characterization of ELP enzyme carriers in terms of transition temperature and salt susceptibility ; (3)  Optimization of expression and purification of recombinant glycosylation enzyme-ELP carrier fusion proteins in terms of soluble protein, and (4) Quantitation and optimization of glycosylation enzyme activity for the fusion protein relative to native enzyme and extent of recovery of enzyme post-phase transition. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of  enzymes as relevant to the markets for food manufacturing and fine chemicals. Examples include production of sweeteners and antibiotics. Additional applications are expected in the area of protein therapeutics. \r\n",
