Thomas of the University of New Hampshire to collaborate in a systematic inventory of marine nematodes.  The inventory will include and preserve morphological records linked by database to DNA sequences selected to highlight unique features of each nematode species.  The research site is Mexico's ecologically threatened Gulf of California and specifically the work will focus on five divergent Gulf localities designated as urgent priorities for biodiversity research by Mexican and international agencies.  Special emphasis will be given to the ecologically rich northern region, adversely impacted by diversion of Colorado River freshwater and by agricultural runoff.  Why focus on nematodes?  Nematodes are the most abundant invertebrate on the planet, and yet most species, particularly subtropical and tropical marine forms, remain undiscovered and unnamed.  By developing an inventory of nematode species in this unique region, new insight will be gained into the planet's biodiversity; the impact will be enhanced because new methods employed with this study are designed to accelerate bioinventory of marine nematodes at additional sites worldwide.  The study will provide the \"raw material\" for ecological conservation work and as a source of previously undiscovered specimens it will support separate studies designed to understand nematode evolution.  Outreach is enhanced by providing databases resources on marine nematodes that will be available worldwide to scientists, the public, teachers and policy makers.  The project will develop new identification aids for nematodes that will assist scientists in various systematic and ecological work, including non-specialists (in nematodes), worldwide.  This study is designed to train undergraduate and graduate students including a significant proportion from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
