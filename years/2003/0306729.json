 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort addresses two closure problems arising\r\nin fluid systems: the description of turbulent energy transfer\r\nthrough a large number of wave modes, and the determination of the\r\namount of mixing at internal breaking waves in a stratified\r\nenvironment. The methodology proposed includes the asymptotic\r\nreduction of complex partial differential equations to simpler\r\nsystems, the numerical simulation of dynamic equations, the\r\ncritical analysis of physical principles, and the comparison of\r\ntheory and computations with physical laboratory experiments. We\r\nanticipate that the work will yield both physical insights and\r\ninteresting new mathematics.\r\n\r\nTurbulent energy transfer, dissipation and mixing are key\r\nprocesses in fluid dynamical problems ranging from the wind\r\ngeneration of water waves to climate dynamics. Ocean mixing ultimately\r\ndetermines the sea--surface temperature, which, in turn, affects\r\natmospheric winds, temperature and humidity. Mixing by upward propagating\r\nbreaking waves is known to play a significant role in the exchange of\r\nmomentum between the lower and the upper layers of the atmosphere. In the\r\nocean, turbulent wave action is responsible for the transfer of energy from\r\nthe very large scales of storms to the small scales at which\r\ndissipation takes place. It is expected that the research proposed\r\nhere will contribute to the understanding of fundamental physical\r\nmechanisms behind these important phenomena, and hence improve\r\nour capability to predict and quantify climate changes.\r\nThis proposal will also have a strong educational impact, through\r\nthe training of graduate students, the development of a research seminar\r\nfor undergraduate students, the teaching of challenging undergraduate classes,\r\nand by having undergraduate students participate in summer projects focused on\r\nthe research.\r\n",
