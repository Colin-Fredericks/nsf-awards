 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Engineering Scholars Program (CESP) program promotes increasing the level of student majors and level of retention and matriculation in several CSEMS related disciplines. The CESP program supports 20 summer-enrolled first time freshmen. Fourteen additional freshman to senior recipients are selected from the following discipline areas: Computer Science, Computer Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering Technology.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this program promotes success through recruiting freshmen better prepared than the average incoming freshman in the College to undertake the four-year targeted degree programs, recruiting community college and junior college students who are better prepared than the average current transfer students to undertake the targeted degree programs at mid-level, with no more that three years planned to degree completion and by monitoring and advising CESP scholarship recipients to ensure compliance with program requirements, promote optimal progress, and help identify and resolve problems so that retention is  improved. CESP provides a tutor/mentor to assist the scholarship recipients. This tutor joins the other tutoring and mentoring services in the college to help improve the retention rate in the college, and consequently increase the enrollment in the targeted degree programs. The program contributes to the final objective of increased total number of baccalaureate degree graduates in the targeted degree programs.   \r\n",
