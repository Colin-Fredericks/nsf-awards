 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigation of Large Coastal Bridge Performance In Hurricane\r\nEnvironment, CMS proposal 0301696\r\n\r\nPI: Cai, Louisiana State University\r\n\r\nWhen a hurricane strikes the coast, the results are often devastating. Even as storm prediction and tracking technologies improve, providing greater warning times, our nation is still becoming ever more susceptible to the effects of hurricanes due to the massive population growth in the south and southeast along the hurricane coast from Texas to Florida to the Carolinas. As backbones of transportation lines, coastal bridges  are  extremely  important  in  supporting  evacuations.  In addition to the general wind-\r\ninduced problems, long-span large coastal bridges on hurricane evacuation routes face the threats from the combination of hurricane-induced winds, heavy traffic, and their interactions.   The objectives of the proposed study are: (1) to study the performance of large coastal bridges under the action of strong winds as well as heavy traffic. This situation happens in a scenario of hurricane evacuation;  (2)  to  investigate  the  effect  of  temporary  mass  dampers  in  ensuring  bridge  safety  and/or reducing bridge vibration. The temporary mass dampers can conveniently be driven on the bridge when needed and be removed otherwise; and (3) to advance the state-of-the-art of aerodynamic analysis of large bridges under strong winds. \r\n\r\nIn  a  typical  aerodynamic  analysis  of  long-span bridges,  no  traffic  load  is  considered  by  assuming  that  bridges  will  be  closed  to  traffic  at  high  wind speeds. Therefore, bridges have been tested in the wind tunnel or analyzed numerically based on the pure bridge  section  without  vehicles  on  it.  However,  during  a  hurricane  evacuation,  the  bridges  may  be occupied  by  slowly moving  traffic.  On  one  hand,  vehicles  affect  the modal  characteristics  and  section shape of the bridge, which affects the aerodynamic behavior. On the other hand, the same vehicles may act like mass dampers that may help damp out some vibrations. The total effects of the traffic on bridge performance and also bridge vibrations on vehicles are not clear and no studies have been reported. While it is generally assumed (but still controversial) that turbulence helps enhance bridge flutter velocity, the effects of hurricane-induced high turbulence on bridge stability haven't been adequately studied. These issues  need  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  the  safety  of  both  bridge  and  vehicles  during  hurricanes  and evacuations. While the developed procedures are intended for general coastal bridges, the Luling Bridge near New Orleans will be used as the primary subject of study. Both wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations will be conducted. The bridge performance will be investigated by arranging different traffic patterns to find the worst case for safety assurance, and find the optimal pattern that may be utilized for hazard mitigation (e.g., closing certain lanes). Another alternative is to develop a movable TMD system that  can  be  driven  on  the  bridges  to  act  as  a  temporary  vibration  damper. The  research  activities  and results will be incorporated into the new education curriculum - Hurricane Engineering developed at LSU with the NSF fund.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed study is to address the issue of how large coastal bridges perform in hurricanes under evacuation conditions. The answer is very important since thousands of lives potentially hinge on the decision of when to close the evacuation routes too soon and people may be trapped in coastal areas subject to storm surge, too late and people may be on the bridge under unsafe conditions. The educational activities include high school outreaching, minority  students  recruiting,  and  technical  information  dissemination.  These  activities  will  promote minority  participation,  affect  high  school  students  career  path,  and  foster  future  engineers  to  develop more  systematical  strategies  in  dealing with  the  most  destructive  hurricane  hazards  for  years  to  come. International  collaboration  with  Tongji  University,  China,  will  not  only  utilize  the  second  largest boundary layer wind tunnel facility in the world, but will also foster further research and collaboration, increase the visibility of hurricane engineering in both countries, and combine the resources to deal with the worldwide engineering challenge of the 21st century . mitigating hurricane hazards. To achieve the research objectives, a unique team of researchers is formed. This team consists of Dr. Cai (PI) who has extensive expertise in wind vibration analyses, Dr. Levitan (co-PI), director of the LSU Hurricane Center and an expert in wind loading, Dr. Nikitopoulos (co-PI) is the Director of Wind Tunnel Laboratory with expertise in fluid dynamics and wind tunnel simulation.  \r\n",
