 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Civil and Mechanical Systems Division workshop is designed  to encourage retention and advancement of qualified women and  underrepresented minority engineering educators in pursuit of  scientific and engineering challenges. The workshop brings  together a select group of 100 of the nation's outstanding  engineering educators. Participants are women or minority  engineering educators who essentially have been in tenure track  positions for less than five years, or are in the final phases of  their Ph.D. program and actively pursuing tenure track academic  positions. The participants are usually employed in teaching and  /or research positions and are actively developing their own  unique research programs in civil and mechanical engineering  disciplines. The major goals of the workshop are to foster  technical and intellectual exchange among Ph.D. level  underrepresented and minority engineers who work in the area of  civil and mechanical systems; to instill in its participants, the  sense of a technical community in which they can thrive and to  which they can contribute; and to increase participant awareness  of research and funding opportunities. The workshop emphasizes an  integration of research and education. A panel of university  deans discusses perspectives on reasonable career expectations  and demands, and includes an in-depth discussion of issues  related to tenure, teaching, research, publications, funding,  outreach and a rewarding personal life along the career path of  an engineering educator. All participants give a brief summary of  their current research interests, thus increasing fellow  participants' awareness of the diversity of related opportunities  for involvement in civil and mechanical systems research areas.  The workshop proceedings include research interest statements  from each participant, the outcome assessments, and workshop  recommendations",
