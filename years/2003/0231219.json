 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetics is a fundamental unifying theme of biology. The Human Genome Project and\r\nadvances in genetics and biotechnology are revolutionizing biology, medicine and industry.\r\nHowever, genetics is an intimidating challenge for college students across the full range of post-\r\nsecondary institutions and the growing demand for genetics education outstrips the supply of\r\nqualified teachers.\r\nWe are developing a genetics cognitive tutor to support active problem-based\r\nlearning in undergraduate genetics courses and make genetics accessible to more students.\r\nCognitive tutors are an educational technology that speeds learning and yields large achievement\r\ngains compared to conventional instruction by providing students \"just-in-time\" problem-solving\r\nhelp. Cognitive Tutor mathematics courses are currently in use by more than 125,000 students in\r\nover 700 middle and high schools. The genetics cognitive tutor is building on past successes in\r\ntutoring quantitative reasoning and using the cognitive tutoring technology in novel realms of\r\nscientific inference and experimental design.\r\nWe are pilot testing and evaluating cognitive tutor lessons in six universities representing a\r\ndiverse student population, and including large public universities, private research universities, a\r\nsmall liberal arts university and an historically black university. Pilot testing includes formative\r\nevaluations of tutor effectiveness and student learning rates. Summative evaluations of\r\nachievement outcomes are being conducted by Carnegie Mellon's Office of Technology for\r\nEducation and Eberly Teaching Center. Cognitive tutor dissemination activities are focusing on\r\nsummer workshops and conference workshops, and are facilitated by a project advisory\r\nboard and Carnegie Mellon's Office of Innovation Transfer.",
