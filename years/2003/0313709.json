Since its inception, the NSF has provided support for this body, which serves as a principal surveyor of the scientific and engineering landscape on issues of critical importance to the nation. The committee interacts closely with the President's top appointees, including the Director of the NSF and Chairperson of the National Science Board, and chairpersons of key congressional science and technology -related committees. COSEPUP undertakes major independent studies of national concerns in U.S. science and technology policy.  In recent years, for example, the committee has administered prominent studies on the principles guiding the applications of the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) to research, capitalizing on investments in science and technology, international benchmarking of U.S. leadership, and national goals for science and technology.  In addition it has developed a number of guides for students and faculty on responsible conduct of research, mentoring students in science and engineering, and careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
