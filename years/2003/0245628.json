This research will be based on the new tools\r\nfor computing homology of such sets: a spectral sequence\r\nassociated with a surjective map, and the relative closure\r\noperation on one-parametric families.  The results will be\r\napplied to the problems of quantitative o-minimality: the\r\ncomplexity of topological, geometric and algebraic operations on\r\ndefinable sets in o-minimal extensions of the real numbers.  The\r\nresults of the proposed research will advance quantitative and\r\nalgorithmic aspects of the o-minimal theory.  As a broader\r\nimpact, these results will provide a theoretical basis for\r\ncomputer algorithms for operations on sparse polynomials,\r\nexponential and trigonometric functions.\r\n\r\nObjects defined by systems of algebraic equations and\r\ninequalities (semi-algebraic sets) appear in many areas of\r\nmathematics and its applications, such as control theory,\r\nrobotics, and computer-aided design.  Understanding the\r\ncomplexity of operations on such objects is crucial for\r\ndeveloping efficient computer algorithms. In many practically\r\nimportant cases, polynomials in the definition of a\r\nsemi-algebraic set are sparse, i.e., have few non-zero\r\ncoefficients. Sparsity is not preserved by many natural\r\noperations, such as projection to a subspace or closure.  The\r\nresults of the proposed research would allow one to evaluate the\r\ncomplexity of operations on semi-algebraic sets in terms of the\r\ncomplexity of some auxiliary sets, retaining sparsity of the\r\noriginal polynomials. This may drastically improve upper bounds\r\non the complexity of such operations, leading to more efficient,\r\nfaster computer algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
