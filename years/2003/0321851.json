 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nTo meet the expanding need for nanotechnology workers, new nanotechnology education\r\nprograms, courses, and course modules must be developed and delivered to students at all\r\nlevels. There is a particular need for secondary science teachers to receive hands-on\r\nnanotechnology training and research experience so that they are equipped to incorporate\r\nnanotechnology principles and concepts into science curriculum. This proposed\r\nResearch Experience for Teachers (RET) project will provide a three-day hands-\r\nnanotechnology training and research experience to 20 high school science teachers from\r\nVirginia at the Penn State Nanofabrication Facility during late March or early April 2003.\r\nThis project will build upon prior investments by the state of Pennsylvania and the NSF\r\nin nanotechnology education in Pennsylvania.\r\nThe Pennsylvania NMT (Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology) Partnership was\r\ninitiated in 1998 by the state of Pennsylvania. It involves more than 30 colleges and\r\nuniversities, secondary schools including vocational-technical schools, and private\r\nindustry. The NMT Partnership leverages the $26 million Penn State Nanofabrication\r\nFacility, part of the NSF National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN), to provide\r\nsemester-long, hands-on nanofabrication education to students enrolled in associate\r\ndegree programs in nanofabrication at community colleges and other institutions across\r\nPennsylvania. The NMT Partnership also provides professional development workshops\r\nfor educators and industry personnel, and summer iunano campsln secondary school\r\nstudents. The NMT Partnership is also a NSF Advanced Technology Education Center.\r\nThe NMT Partnership first began offering professional development workshops for\r\neducators at the Penn State Nanofabrication Facility in 1999. To date, 169 educators and\r\nindustry personnel have attended these workshops. This proposed project builds upon\r\nand expands the components of the Pennsylvania NMT Partnership associated with\r\nprofessional development of educators, and will take the NMT Partnership beyond the\r\nboundaries of Pennsylvania through an alliance with the Initiative for Nanotechnology in\r\nVirginia (INanoVA). INanoVA is a statewide initiative involving higher education,\r\nnational laboraties, state and local education and economic development organization,\r\nand private industry. INanoVA aims to promote collaborative nanotechnology research,\r\ncommercialization, and workforce education. The University of Virginia provides\r\nleadership for InanoVA.\r\nThe University of Virginia will coordinate recruitment of 20 secondary science teachers\r\nfrom Virginia for the proposed RET workshop, ensuring balanced geographic\r\nrepresentation across the state. Penn State will deliver the three-day nanotechnology\r\ntraining and research experience at the Penn State Nanofabrication Facility. The project\r\nwill be managed by Penn State. The project has clear intellectual merit, as evidenced by\r\nthe role of the PI in leading the Penn State site of the NSF NNUN, the NSF Center for\r\nNanofabrication Manufacturing Education, the September 11-12, 2002 NSF Workshop\r\non Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE), and other nanotechnology research\r\nand education activities. The project is expected to have broad impact on the science and\r\nengineering workforce of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the nation.",
