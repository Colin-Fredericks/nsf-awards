Awardees will include mathematics teachers and supervisors, mathematics teacher educators and researchers.  The major objectives of the project are to provide U.S. representatives with the opportunity to acquire knowledge of mathematics education world wide, interact with leading contributors to mathematics education from other countries, establish liaisons and begin to build networks with foreign mathematics educators, bring problems in the U.S. into better focus by learning from the experiences of others, derive insight into new ways to approach and solve U.S. problems in mathematics education, widely disseminate information from the Congress to the U.S. mathematics education community, and to share knowledge of the current and future plans of U.S. mathematics education with foreign colleagues.",
