 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbara A. Imperiali, Department of Chemistry, MIT, Karen Allen, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University School of Medicine and Harald Schwalbe, Department of Chemistry, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany, are supported with an award from the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program with funds provided by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  The team will carry out research aimed at producing a novel and generally applicable chemical tool for structural and functional proteomics. Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs), comprised of short peptide sequences (fewer than 25 amino acids) that are optimized to bind trivalent lanthanide ions, can be incorporated into a protein for applications in luminescence spectroscopy,  NMR and X-ray analysis that rely  upon  the unique photophysical properties of the bound complex.  These will supersede the  capacity of a variety of existing tools in a single entity. LBT  sequences  will  be  evolved  in  the  Imperiali  lab  at  MIT  through  state-of-the-art strategies that include both combinatorial synthesis and directed design stating from simple protein  scaffolds.    These  sequences  will  be  integrated  into  target  proteins  and  tested  by  a multidisciplinary, collaborative effort by experts in nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, fluorescence spectroscopy and cell biology.  \r\n\r\nThe lanthanide binding tag strategy provides a single tool, a chemical tag, that encompasses the breadth of applications, including nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, and fluorescence spectroscopy and cell biology,  needed to conquer the proteome challenge.   The  goal of the program is to  provide the  LBT technology in  a form that can be  readily implemented by  a diverse set of end users in the chemical, biological and biomedical communities.  Additionally, postdoctoral research scientists, graduate students and undergraduates will be involved in multidisciplinary, multi-institution research that includes an international collaboration at the forefront of proteomics research.",
