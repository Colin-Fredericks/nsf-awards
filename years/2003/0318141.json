The PIs will study new surface treatments based on cerium, vanadate, molybdate and permanganate compounds applied by sol-gel method as replacement of processes involving hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium is a widely used corrosion barrier that is a known carcinogen. The corrosion protection provided by these new treatments will be evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization tests. The adhesion performance will be also measured using standard test methods. A series of specimens will be prepared under different experimental conditions such as rate of gelation, drying temperature and also, under different surface preparation prior to applying the treatment compounds. The viscosity and the time to convert sol into gel will be also investigated. The corrosion protection performance of the new coatings systems will be investigated under scratched and uniform coatings conditions. The adhesion performance will be also measured. The durability of the promising coating systems will be compared with a chromate-based coating system under severe conditions using the salt spray chamber test.\r\n\r\nScope:  The research results can have a significant impact in solving an engineering problem, that of protecting aluminum alloys and composites from corrosion.  Replacement of toxic hexavalent chromium as a method of corrosion protection of Al alloys is of great importance in a very large number of applications. The results will lead to the gradual use of non-toxic materials as coatings for Al alloys and Al composites.  There is clear identification of roles by the collaborating teams and both groups have experience with sol gels.   The two institutes have the necessary facilities for this work. Students are expected to participate in the project and will develop an understanding for problems related to corrosion, interfaces, and processing techniques.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
