 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Emin Aktan, Drexel University\r\n\r\nThe advantages which are inherent in the management of the entire highway transportation infrastructure as one integrated hyper-system based on the principles of integrated asset management has been articulated by the FHWA as well as the NSF. Currently, both the FHWA and the NSF are very interested in synergistic research and technology demonstration programs that would advance the states-of-the-art and practice \r\nof the engineering and management of infrastructure systems. These two agencies offer a set of complementary resources that would very much enhance the Nation's capabilities for scientific research and demonstrations to advance the engineering and management of infrastructures. \r\n\r\nThe challenge is to understand, conceptualize and frame the problem, and articulate the critical issues and their possible resolutions clearly. We need to bring together an expert community representing the broad spectrum of stakeholders and reach consensus on the definitions, issues and their possible resolutions. Then we may formulate, sponsor and execute research and demonstrations on actual operating or decommissioned infrastructures to test these resolutions. This proposal submitted to the NSF envisions bringing a group of multi-disciplinary experts to discuss and frame the problem and articulate the issues. \r\n  \r\n",
