 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nImpact: The Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico's MRI/RUI for Equipment\r\nAcquisition to Increase Network Engineering Laboratory Capacities for Hispanic Engineering\r\nStudents will significantly impact three institutional goals: (1) Improving access to and\r\nincreasing the use of modern research and research training instrumentation for our Hispanic\r\nstudents and faculty in Computer Engineering; (2) lessening the technological and research gap\r\nexperienced by the institution's 1,330 Hispanic students in Electrical Engineering and directly\r\nover 300 Hispanic students studying Computer Engineering; and, (3) integrating education and\r\nresearch in Computer Engineering. These three institutional and departmental goals are\r\nconsistent with the NSF-MRI program and the RUI program. The Hispanic faculty to be\r\nimpacted includes 19 full-time EE faculty members and specifically 6 faculty members in\r\nComputer Engineering.\r\nResearch: The research activities utilizing the Network Engineering Laboratory will be\r\ncentered on Open Learning Objects and Inner Metadata. These include the design of Open LO\r\n(OLO), which is based on Open standards, mostly XML markup languages and their related\r\ntools. It exposes an interface to export the results of LO-to-Learner interaction, and for LO\r\nadaptation. Inner Metadata is the collection of layered meta-data mechanisms that are used to\r\ndescribe the OLOs, their adaptive features, and the Learner interaction tracing. LO objects\r\ndesigned according to this architecture still retain the encapsulation and modularity required to\r\nabstract those implementation aspects of a LO that researchers can investigate for future\r\nenhancement and growth, yet they provide a systematic and consistent interface for extracting\r\nthe results of the interaction with the Learner and for LO adaptation.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: The proposed research project advances\r\nknowledge and understanding within the field of Computer Engineering and explores creative\r\nconcepts. Several organizations most notably the IEEE and the IMS Consortium, have proposed\r\nstandards for describing Learning Objects. While these efforts substantially advance the goals of\r\ninteroperability, they fall short at addressing the need for accessibility to the internal composition\r\nof the Learning Objects (LO). Under present standards, the LO remains an opaque entity from\r\nwhich valuable information cannot be easily gleaned or harvested, nor introduced or adapted.\r\nBroader Impact of the Proposed Activity: Research in this area will fully integrate\r\neducation and research activities by utilizing the IDEAL eLearning environment as a platform to\r\ntest and explore these and similar issues from a unique perspective; that of a potentially very\r\nlarge learner pool as available through the web. The research activities to be undertaken in the\r\nenhanced Network Engineering Laboratory will equally serve to expose PUPR to collaborate in\r\nComputer Engineering research with other engineering colleges and universities in the United\r\nStates.",
