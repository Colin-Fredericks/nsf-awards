Together they will build a theoretical framework for tracking one or more moving objects in two dimensions (Korean group) and in three dimensions (US group.) Their research will use multiple active video sensors and they will explore image-processing techniques to enhance input images gathered by a self-controlled specialized camera.  Stabilizing input images from moving video sensors is a challenging task because of the irregular movements of the camera as well as its self-controlled mechanisms for focusing, adjusting shutter speed and iris, and gain control.  Computational efficiency is the primary issue for achieving real-time video tracking on various computing platforms.  The anticipated results of this work are improvements in both software and hardware used for video tracking. \r\n\r\nImportant societal benefits of this research are improved video-based surveillance for security of large areas and enhanced control of robots used in hazardous situations.  Broader impacts of this research include the educational value to the participating student and postdoc who will have access to complementary state-of-the-art equipment in the U.S. and Korea, while benefiting from the experience of research collaboration and establishing professional contacts in another country.\r\n",
