 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Frank Bright of the State University of New York at Buffalo is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop and evaluate the performance of molecularly-imprinted xerogels (MIXs) for sensor array development.  The goal is to improve the selectivity and stability of sensors. The team will study a wide range of synthesis space using array methodologies in a highly parallel approach. In this fashion, they will be able to prepare and screen many different xerogels in an attempt to rapidly optimize the system.  The use of well-designed fluorescent probes will provide for information about the molecular dynamics at the site of analyte binding. Finally, these sensor materials will be implemented into arrays and used in conjuction with a CMOS array detector towards the development of a portable and inexpensive integrated sensor device.\r\n\r\nThe development of chemical sensors and biosensors continues to receive substantial support from industry and federal government agencies. The sensors field has enormous market potential, and would revolutionize many analytical methodologies if various limitations could be solved. Among these limitations are the availability of 'receptors', stability of such selective reagents, convenience and cost of assembly of sensors, and ability to multiplex to improve reliability and provide for broadened screening for multiple targets concurrently. Professor Bright brings all these elements into this work, enabling students to be trained in this relevant and cross-disciplinary area.\r\n",
