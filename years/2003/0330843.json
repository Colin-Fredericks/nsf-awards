 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sednterp is a computer program designed to enhance the interpretation of analytical ultracentrifugaton data.  The program was first developed as a collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and Amgen researchers over ten years ago.  Currently, Sednterp exists as a VisualBasic program and it has enjoyed wide use by the analytical ultracentrifuge community.  Now in use for more than eight years, Sednterp has proven to be a popular and useful tool.  It is, however, becoming dated in its functions, and there have been numerous requests for additional functionality.  A new Web-based version of Sednterp could enable users around the world to share information, and would provide a good opportunity to incorporate many of the additional features requested by users.  \r\n\r\nThe research and programming work will be conducted for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Bimolecular Interaction Technology at the University of New Hampshire.  \r\n",
