 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the integration of a Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA) based approach to demand analysis with a Decision-Based Design (DBD) framework that supports a company's goal of making profitable products.  The research will address four major topics, including (1) improving predictive capability of demand analysis, (2) incorporating behaviors of multiple market players in demand modeling, (3) predicting uncertainties in demand analysis, and (4) extending engineering modeling for DBD implementation.  The proposed approach and techniques will be demonstrated through a real vehicle engine design problem, and verified and validated based on the basic economic principles and the properties of a rigorous alternative selection method. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed research will have an immediate impact on improving the predictive capability of demand analysis in product design. The proposed method can incorporate many important factors that are currently ignored, such as the behavior of competitors and other players in a market and the uncertainty issues in demand estimation. The proposed DBD framework will offer a rigorous engineering design approach that supports a company's goal of making profitable products.  The work on extending engineering modeling is beneficial for bridging the gap between business and engineering modeling in product design.  The proposed research is expected to extend the extant knowledge in engineering design as well as in market research.  The research is also expected to have a broader impact on increasing industrial competitiveness and improving educational activities.  Research is anticipated to contribute to education in the areas of engineering design theory and methodology, decision analysis in engineering design, quality engineering, and market research for engineering design. A strong collaboration is planned among the university and industry teams including regular seminars, visits, and co-supervisions of graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
