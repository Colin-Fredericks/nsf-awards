 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant explores the processes leading to mechanical mixing in metallic alloys during high-energy ball milling and during dry sliding wear. A major objective of this work is to elucidate the atomistic processes leading to mechanical mixing during ball milling, and their competition with thermal decomposition in the case of alloys with positive heats of mixing. The aim is to use analytical and high-resolution electron microscopy as well as atom probe field ion microscopy for characterization of the selected Ni-based alloys processed under controlled conditions. A goal of the project is to improve the understanding and the development of self-lubricated materials, and to apply the findings on the evolution of alloys during ball milling to the microstructural and chemical evolution of solids undergoing dry sliding wear. Along with the experimental studies, molecular dynamics modeling will be developed for improved kinetic model and simulations of mechanical alloying.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project results are expected to lead to structural nanocomposites with improved properties. A goal of the project is to broaden the impact of the proposed work by implementing and developing a student teaching-based instructional method, by integrating research and teaching, and by developing collaborations on techniques with nanometer-scale resolution, such as electron microscopy and atom probe field ion microscopy. Collaborations with academic institutions and laboratories in US and abroad are planned.\r\n***",
