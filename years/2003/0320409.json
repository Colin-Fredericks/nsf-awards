 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a biosensor that measures the inherent electron transport properties of DNA on a semiconductor chip. This biochip is expected to improve data quality, decrease cost and minimize sample processing. The ability of DNA to transport electrons is dependent on the bases being perfectly matched. Thus, only the correct target DNA would give a signal in the proposed system. Furthermore, since the signal is electronic, the instrumentation required to make the measurements will be far less expensive than currently used fluorescent systems. Finally, since the ability to transport electrons is intrinsic to DNA, no modifications and very little sample processing will be required. This project will address two fundamental barriers to a reliable, mass-manufacturable biosensor based on electron transport through DNA. First, the project will investigate decreasing the voltage biases required to initiate electron transport by decreasing the overall resistance of the DNA/electrode assembly. Second, the project will investigate methods to decrease the contact resistance between the electrode and the DNA. Overcoming these two obstacles will greatly facilitate the manufacture of an inexpensive, accurate biochip that will detect DNA without amplification. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in four select markets : biological agent detection for homeland defense, life science research, drug development and medical diagnostics.\r\n",
