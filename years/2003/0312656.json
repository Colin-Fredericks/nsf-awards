 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been annotated to show the presence of\r\nclose to 30,000 genes. Many of these genes are both predicted by computer programs and\r\nsupported by experimental evidence ' their similarity to characterized genes from plants, animals\r\nand microbes. However, 15-20 % of the gene annotations are based only on computer evidence.\r\nIn addition, comparison of the Arabidopsis genome sequence with its close relative Brassica\r\noleracea (the cabbage/cauliflower/Brussels sprouts family) reveals many regions of sequence\r\nconservation that are not at present annotated as genes. Preliminary experimental analysis of\r\nsome of these regions indicates that a significant fraction do encode genes that have so far been\r\nunrecognized by the annotation process. Full-length cDNAs provide both the basis for greatly\r\nimproved gene structure annotation by alignment of their sequences with genomic DNA, and\r\nalso the reagents with which to analyze their function by expression and other kinds of analysis.\r\nThe objective of this research is to generate full-length cDNAs for approximately 2,000 of these\r\ngenes that represent the least well-understood genes in the genome. We will use 5 and 3 RACE\r\nto define the precise structure of each gene and then generate full-length cDNA clones for\r\nprotein-coding genes (ORFs) in a recombination vector suitable for functional studies by the\r\nresearch community.\r\nWe will generate clones and sequence at a rate of approximately 100 clones per month within\r\nthree months of the start of the project with a goal of producing 2,000 novel and previously\r\nuncharacterized clones over the period of the project.\r\nSequences of the clones will be submitted to GenBank as they are generated and will also be\r\navailable from the TIGR ftp site. The clones themselves will be made freely available to the\r\nresearch community through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Details of the\r\nproject will be maintained at a project-specific web site\r\nhttp://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/2010_cDNAs\r\nAt the scientific level, this project will enhance the Arabidopsis genome annotation by increasing\r\nthe total gene count in Arabidopsis by ~10% and will be a major step towards completing the\r\nidentification and validation of all the genes in the first fully sequenced plant genome\r\nArabidopsis thaliana. The cDNAs will be available as community resources. Integrated into the\r\nproposed research is a curriculum development component that will provide research experience\r\nto high school science educators in which they will work on the project and use project materials\r\nfor the development of new curricular modules designed to provide exposure to fundamental\r\nconcepts in plant genomics to high school students.",
