Our overall objectives are:\r\n1. Encourage and support student participation at GECCO 2003, targeting\r\nunderrepresented groups and including both undergraduates and graduates\r\n2. Encourage undergraduates to pursue graduate research in genetic and evolutionary\r\ncomputation\r\n3. Encourage students to pursue academic or industrial careers that research or use genetic\r\nand evolutionary computation\r\nThis funding opportunity will be advertised with all conference advertising. This will include\r\nphysical mailings, email broadcasts, listsere\r\nIntellectual merit: this proposal will enhance development and dissemination of research in\r\nevolutionary computation by helping students attend a major international meeting to present\r\ntheir work, attend tutorials and other events, and establish collaborations. Our primary target for\r\nstudent support is students from underrepresented groups that are presenting peer reviewed\r\nwork-specifically, those who are already making a scientific contribution. Evolutionary\r\ncomputation is still considered an experimental and innovative approach, so this is responsive to\r\nthe mission of NSF/EIA. It is also biologically inspired, and events at GECCO 2003, particularly\r\nworkshop, tutorials, and one of the technical tracks, will specifically emphasize applications to\r\nbioinformatics problems, so this is responsive to the mission of NSF/DBI as well.\r\nBroader impact: this proposal funds student participation at a major international meeting, with\r\nan emphasis on underrepresented groups and undergraduates. We will disburse the funds from\r\nthis grant to students in the form of registration fees, travel, and housing awards. All funds from\r\nthis grant will go to students. Students will be selected for awards by the general chair, the PI of\r\nthis proposal. I will give precedence to students who: are presenting a paper that will be\r\npublished in the conference proceedings; are self-identified as being from underrepresented\r\ngroups; are participating in workshops; are undergraduates\r\n\r\n",
