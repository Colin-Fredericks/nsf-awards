 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an  anticounterfeiting technology, which is the magnetic  analog  of  thermo-luminescence. This technology makes  use  of  a  series  of ternary alloys  that  exhibit  a  unique  first  order  transition  and is  based  on  the  iron-rhodium classical antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (F) behavior.  Additional alloying elements such as Rhenium, Platinum and Palladium by varying their concentration, enable this transition to be precisely varied in temperature. This material, will be synthesized in  perfectly spherical particles ranging in size from 2-10 microns and will be  suitable for use  in  an  ink  pigment.  This  capability  enables  standard  ink  jet printing  to  be  used,  to  print  a  series  of  complex  three  dimensional  bar  codes,  two  spatial  and  one  in temperature. The bar code will be non magnetic at ambient temperature. In the proposed program the ability  of  the processing  technology  to  yield  compositions and  particle sizes  which  are  uniform  and  small  enough  to flow in a ink jet printer, will be explored.\r\n\r\nFrom a commercial point of view, the  cost  to  the US  economy of counterfeiting is  conservatively  estimated  at  $200B/year.  It is estimated  that implementation of this technology would save between 1 to 10% of this figure or up to about $20B/year.  \r\n\r\n",
