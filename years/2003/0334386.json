 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative research project entitled Improvement of Biohydrogen Production by Investigation on the Hydrogenase Coding Gene of High Yielding Strain of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 in Fast Growing Escherichia coli.  US PI Nejat Veziroglu, University of Miami and Debabrata Das, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IITK) will investigate unique strains of the microbial hydrogenase gene that will lead to new information on hydrogenases and hydrogen-producing microorganisms that could be applied to biohydrogen production.  The microorganisms chosen are suitable for utilization in waste treatment plants for more economic production of hydrogen.         \r\nScope:  Extensive research is being carried out on different aspects of biological hydrogen production at the University of Miami.  IITK's Department of Biotechnology is very experienced in conducting research on fermentative hydrogen production using a high yielding strain of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08, suitable for biological hydrogen production.  This is a research area of high current interest that holds considerable promise from both technical and social standpoints, which has the potential for developing a clean, easily distributed, and inexpensive source of chemical energy.  The collaboration is mutually beneficial.  It is cofunded by NSF's Division of Bioengineering & Environmental Systems and the Indian Department of Science & Technology under the NSF/DST joint program.",
