 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n     Reading is one of the most complex skills for children to master but is vital for success in school and beyond (Kintsch, 1998; National Research Council, 1999; Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989). It consists of decoding and other skills that have been studied extensively in isolation. Integrative theories that assemble the various pieces of the reading puzzle are lacking in the scientific literature (Nist & Simpson, 2000; Winne, 1996). Compensatory-Encoding Theory (Walczyk, 2000) has been proposed to account for how aspects of reading that normally function automatically (e.g., decoding) interact with processes to which readers must attend (e.g., understanding the theme of a passage). The theory highlights the flexibility of reading and how, as they mature, readers become more facile at dealing with reading problems. It also describes the diverse ways readers compensate for poor decoding or other reading skills that fail. The theory identifies classroom conditions likely to restrict readers' use of compensatory strategies and thereby lower comprehension. The purpose of the proposed research is to test predictions of Compensatory-Encoding Theory in children. Whereas most research on poor decoding highlight its negative effects on comprehension (see Perfetti, 1985; Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989), this research is expected to reveal that readers at different skill levels compensate for weak skills or difficult text. Moreover, the research should reveal how as children age they become more efficient at overcoming reading problems.\r\n\r\n     The theory's predictions will be tested during a year-long project. The skill profiles of third-graders, fifth-graders, and seventh-graders will be assessed. Children will also be recorded as the read passages aloud, followed by literal and inferential comprehension tests. They will be asked to read under restrictive conditions, such as time pressure, that will limit their ability to slow reading rate, pause, reread text, or compensate in other ways to determine their effects on comprehension. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact of this Research\r\n\r\n     A major prediction of Compensatory-Encoding Theory is that when reading is unrestricted, readers will compensate for poor reading skills such that comprehension is unrelated to reading skill profiles. Under restrictive conditions, including taking standardized reading achievement tests, readers are less free to compensate. Consequently, those with poor decoding are likely to suffer lower comprehension. If this and the theory's other predictions are confirmed, the broader impact would be to inform how reading instruction takes place. Beyond a low threshold of skill development, an emphasis on improving decoding or other skills may be misplaced. Rather, children who comprehend poorly might better be taught how to compensate for poor skills and difficult text. The broader impact of the findings would also be to indict time restricted standardized tests as unfairly penalizing less efficient readers who cannot compensate freely.\r\n",
