 "awd_abstract_narration": "While researchers have made major breakthroughs in controlling nonlinear continuous time systems over\r\nthe last two decades, more recently the research has started to focus on methods for controlling continuous\r\ntime systems based on discrete time models and over digital networks, because of the need to control increas-\r\ningly complex systems and because of the increasing computer power typically available. The proposed work\r\naims to use previously developed nonlinear continuous time control methods as a springboard to develop\r\nnew, high performance control algorithms for general nonlinear systems based on discrete-time models. The\r\nfocus will be on developing algorithms that are robust, adaptive, and don't require full measurement of\r\nthe system state. Applications of these results will include the development of optimal treatment schedules\r\nfor HIV patients, leading to a non-progressive state where treatment is no longer needed. Other applica-\r\ntions will include control and calibration of automotive engines where state constraints, which are easy to\r\nincorporate into certain optimization-based control strategies but which often lead to non-robust control\r\nalgorithms, play an important role. The proposed work also aims to give new, improved stability conditions\r\nfor networked nonlinear control systems, especially those using protocols that don't necessarily guarantee\r\ntransmission to every node of the communication network within a fixed amount of time. It is expected that\r\nthese new stability conditions for networked control systems will give insight into the development of novel\r\ncommunication protocols which will, in turn, make networked control systems more successful and prevalent.\r\nBroader impact:\r\nThe work in this proposal has the potential for broad impact via the role that control plays as an enabling\r\ntechnology. As suggested above, the ideas that we will investigate may help lead the way to efficient drug\r\ntreatment schedules for HIV patients leading to a non-progressive state, thereby eliminating the need for\r\nfurther drug therapy. In general, it should make it more feasible to rely on optimization-based automation\r\nalgorithms for a wide range of engineering tasks that impact all of society. The proposal will support\r\ngraduate students who will present their findings at national and regional conferences. The results will be\r\nmade available, promptly, on the web and will be immediately incorporated into graduate courses at the\r\nproposing institution. The work will help to further shape UCSB's Center for Control Engineering and\r\nComputation, which is one of the leading programs in control education in the nation. It will strengthen\r\ninteractions with international partners, e.g., in Australia, France and Italy, will foster novel collaborative\r\nefforts with theoretical biologists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and will further\r\ncollaborative efforts with researchers at Ford Motor Company.",
