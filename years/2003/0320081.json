 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Phase  I  project  offers  a  solution  to  the  fundamental challenge facing the designers of the physical layer of diagnostic systems and scientific instruments.  Many  of  these  instruments  currently  monitor  and  analyze  signals  and  systems  in  the  frequency domain,  and  are  used  in virtually  every  technical  endeavor.  Currently  these  systems  are compute-bound,  either  in  speed  or  area/power.  The Phase I  aims to  develop an innovative instrumentation technology, called GAUSS, that will achieve a new standard in speed/power performance and, in the process, enable the development of new and powerful test and measurement products. \r\n\r\nUsing the proposed technology, engineers can rapidly enable system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions for the  test and measurement market. Marketed as a semiconductor IP technology, the GAUSS technology can be used to develop both high-end and embedded SoC solutions. This  powerful  design  paradigm  will  become  available  to  design  engineers responsible for developing the physical layer of future diagnostic and instrument products requiring ever  increasing  performance,  lower  cost margins,  and  time-to-market  advantages.  \r\n\r\n",
