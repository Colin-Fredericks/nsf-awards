The program will provide meaningful research opportunities for eight undergraduates in mechanical engineering for a ten-week period each summer. The program's research focus is on improving exhaust emissions systems; assessing alternative fuel utilization in engines; using computer models to predict engine performance and validation through experiments; and understanding complex engine combustion processes and impact on engine performance. Students involved in experimental projects will be exposed to and have opportunities to use some of the modern instrumentation in combustion and engine research. The program addresses important and timely issues in pollutant emission control and alternative/efficient energy usage. Students will participate in seminars on ethics and the values of ethics in research. The primary goal of the program is to provide a meaningful research experience to undergraduate students in preparation for research careers in engineering. Students will be recruited from colleges and universities across the United States, with directed efforts at attracting students from population groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering in the United States.\r\n",
