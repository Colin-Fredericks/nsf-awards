 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to provide a total of 54 one-year scholarships to economically disadvantaged but academically talented students from underrepresented minority groups to improve the enrollment, retention, and graduation in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Incoming high school students to receive an associate degree in one of the CSEMS disciplines, and current students to transfer from an associate degree program to a baccalaureate degree program are targeted. The recruitment takes place through outreach activities on campus and at regional feeder high schools, and through the electronic and hard copy dissemination of detailed program and application information. The project links and leverages existing resources providing all scholarship recipients access to academic support, tutoring, priority registration, counseling, educational planning, academic excellence workshops, career development resources, work-based learning opportunities/internships, priority transfer support, additional financial aid, and state-of-the-art computer and technological equipment and laboratories. The project also builds on the strengths of the current MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement Award) program, and the articulation agreements with four-year programs.\r\n",
