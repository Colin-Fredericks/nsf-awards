 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, investigating a spectrum of research topics centered in software engineering and AI, proposes building a common infrastructure that would enable expanding the educational program to include the production of high-quality PhD students and to continue to conduct nationally competitive research. Additionally, the project seeks expansion in networking expertise. Specific goals include:\r\n\tDevelop a PhD program in Computer Science,\r\n\tPrepare productive research faculty to take on PhD students,\r\n\tImprove faculty research, especially research with student co-authors,\r\n\tRecruit and retain excellent graduate and undergraduate students,\r\n\tIncrease student support, thereby encouraging students to stay in school, \r\n\tIncrease mentoring and improve tracking of graduate students,\r\n\tImprove departmental laboratory and research facilities, and\r\n\tMonitor department progress towards the program goals with an external evaluation team.\r\nInitially the following projects will directly benefit from the infrastructure proposed:\r\n\tSoftware Reuse Measurement,\r\n\tReliability Modeling,\r\n\tRequirement Simulation,\r\n\tSoftware Performance Engineering,\r\n\tReal-Time Secure Processing of Data on Distributed Systems,\r\n\tAdvanced Knowledge Acquisition and Dissemination, and\r\n\tFault-Tolerance.\r\nEducational and outreach activities involve faculty development, mentoring, curricular changes, and active recruitment. A PhD program in CS at an HBCU should prepare more African American students in CISE areas and fulfill some of the high demand for minority faculty. At the moment, no HBCU offers a PhD in CISE areas.\r\n",
