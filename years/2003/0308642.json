The\r\nsamples necessary to evaluate the relationship between a known signal of individual quality,\r\nfeather coloration, and the social and genetic mate choice of females across different group\r\nsizes were collected during a field experiment in 2002. Funds are requested to conduct genetic\r\nparentage analyses using variation in five polymorphic microsatellite loci. These data will (1)\r\nprovide information about the differences between social and genetic mates selection and\r\nwhether these vary with group size; (2) are necessary to parameterize the mate selection rules\r\nfor an agent-based model; and (3) will also add to our knowledge of the effects of density on\r\nfemale mate choice decisions, a relationship that has only once been examined experimentally\r\nand has potentially large impacts on sexual selection. Additionally, the genotype data will be\r\nused for the independent honor's thesis of a Cornell undergraduate and the DNA samples will\r\nbe deposited in the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Genetics Facility and made widely available to\r\nother researchers.",
