To accomplish this goal, students follow the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedures. The second objective is to implement six new exercises in the plastics technology curriculum, and two new lab exercises in the Computer-Aided Design engineering analysis curriculum to develop problem-solving skills. The equipment is used in four different courses with a combined student enrollment of one hundred students. Using this equipment, the students develop individual or team research projects, and present their findings at Central Michigan University's annual Student Research and Creative Endeavors Exhibition (SRCEE). All students presenting at SRCEE are eligible for consideration to present their research at the \"Posters Under the Dome\" located at the State Capitol Building.",
