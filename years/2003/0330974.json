 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Philip J. Wilke, Matthew R. Des Lauriers will conduct archaeological excavations of prehistoric sites on Isla Cedros, Mexico.  This island is located on the outer coast of the Baja California peninsula, 426 air miles south of San Diego, California. Prior to European contact, it was home to a thriving indigenous population, which is the focus for the current dissertation research.  Spanish galleons, pirates, otter hunters, whalers, and fishermen followed these early occupants.  The research being funded by NSF will consist of excavations at five of the 41 sites located during the survey portion of this project.  Excavations will proceed with the intent of recovering information regarding the subsistence economy, stone tool technology, and exchange relationships of the original inhabitants of Isla Cedros.  The recognition of shifts in resource exploitation and technology, and evidence for the production and/or consumption of trade items will be sought.\r\n\r\nThe archaeological research on Isla Cedros is significant for several reasons:  \r\n1)  Archaeological research in Baja California is in the pioneering stage, and the very real potential for surprising and unexpected findings exists.  2) The cultural heritage of the two Californias was not divided in the past, and modern political boundaries should not shape our understanding and appreciation of the rich past of this remarkable coastline.  The research on Isla Cedros can bridge this gap, by highlighting an indigenous culture that had much in common with its northern neighbors.  3)  The answers to the specific research questions addressed by this research will provide insight into the nature of relationships between mainland and island groups along the Pacific coast of North America.  4) Finally, the broader issues of the development of human cultural systems, and how different ecological and social factors either spur or constrain such developments will be addressed as part of the analytical phase of this project.\r\n\r\nBeyond the academic relevance of this project, a number of positive impacts will result.  In Mexico, until the initiation of this project, the people of Isla Cedros were unaware of the indigenous history of their island, and this project has sparked interest, among both adults and children, to learn more.  Classes at the elementary and high schools are planned following the completion of the first field projects.  Closely related is the development of ties with archaeologists working for the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia de Mexico (INAH).  Already underway is the development of a local site stewardship program, currently being organized by Archaeologist Jorge Serrano of the Ensenada office of INAH.  As recent partnerships between INAH and such U.S. agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and California State Parks have shown, these relationships can improve the quality and efficiency of cultural resource management on both sides of the international border.  This research project will be the culmination of the professional training program for Matthew R. Des Lauriers, will provide field experience for several undergraduate students, and begin training local people participating in the site stewardship program. \r\n",
