 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arizona (UA) will conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program (REU) designed to teach students science by involving them in research.  The specific focus of the program is molecular biosciences - the application of biochemical and molecular biological techniques to biological problems.  \r\n\r\nStudents recruited nationally will participate in summer research on the University of Arizona Campus.  Particular attention will be paid to identifying students from ethnic minority groups underrepresented in the sciences and those who have little opportunity for research experience at their home institution.  Participating students will work for 12 weeks during the summer.  REU students will be matched with participating faculty and will have a major voice in determining which lab they enter.  In addition to regular lab meetings, they will participate in a two day orientation covering lab safety and an introduction to research ethics at the beginning of the summer followed by weekly REU student group meetings with the project PI and co-PI.  The REU group meetings will enable students to develop professional skills, such as presentation of research results, and will feature presentations on preparing for, applying to, and selecting a graduate program.  In addition, students attend seminars by UA and visiting scientists on relevant scientific topics.  Field trips to places such as the Biosphere II and the Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum will supplement the research experience.  The summer will culminate in a poster session at which students share their experimental results.\r\n\r\nCarol Bender, UBRP Director, is the contact person.
