 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWhy do bureaucrats delay?  Why do regulatory choices made under identical\r\nadministrative procedures exhibit highly varying decision times?  The\r\ninvestigator conducts a formal and empirical analysis of the duration of\r\nbureaucratic decisions, with applications to drug approval times by the\r\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The speed with which drugs are\r\nreviewed is now one of the most controversial issues in federal regulation,\r\nand is arguably the most salient case where the duration, more than the\r\ncontent, of bureaucratic decision making is at issue. While the political\r\ncontrol of agencies has been well studied, relatively little is known about\r\nwhy agencies wait, and whether the duration of agency decisions is subject\r\nto political control and from what sources.\r\n\r\nThe project tackles this problem through the elaboration of a\r\ngeneralizable formal model of the approval decision.  The investigator models\r\nproduct approval as an optimal stopping decision by an uncertain\r\nregulator subject to political demand for the drug.  The regulator seeks to\r\npreserve a reputation for consumer protection and sees drug approvals as\r\nirreversible (or reversible only at a significant reputation cost).  The\r\npayoff of approval is also a function of the political \"demand\" for drug\r\napprovals from consumers (patients) and producers (firms).  The model\r\npredicts that even under risk-neutrality, quick approvals are highly\r\nunlikely, not all drugs will be approved, and that larger firms receive\r\n\"protection\" (quicker approvals) even when firms are not politically\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe investigator tests this model using maximum likelihood\r\nduration analyses of FDA drug review times.  The formal model suggests that\r\nthe proper hazard function for estimation is the inverse Gaussian\r\ndistribution, which has a non-monotonic hazard function.  Drug approval\r\ntimes will be modeled as a function of political preferences, budgetary\r\nshifts, media coverage and congressional hearings on the diseases treated\r\nby the drug, and characteristics of the submitting firms.  Preliminary\r\nresults on a partial sample of 67 drugs approved from 1985 to 1995 support\r\nthe model's predictions, and also suggest that political \"control\" in drug\r\napproval occurs less through \"principals\" (Congress and the presidents)\r\nthan through organized interests (patients and firms) and the media.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
