 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract:\r\n\r\nIn this research, we develop efficient congestion control\r\nmechanisms for high-performance interconnection networks used in\r\nmultiprocessors, distributed network-based multicomputer clusters,\r\nstorage systems, and IP router fabrics.  Techniques will be\r\nexplored that allow rapid advancement of packets directly involved\r\nin network congestion.  Our approach is based on adding minimal\r\nintelligence to routers and network interfaces---in the form of\r\nspeculative scheduling capability---such that resources are maximally\r\nutilized while packets are efficiently routed.  This can be done by\r\nmore effectively steering packets around congested areas and by more\r\nprecisely detecting and handling potential deadlock situations arising\r\nfrom cyclically-correlated congestion on a closed set of resources.\r\nA by-product is that global expansion of congestion trees/cycles which\r\ncan seriously degrade performance is prevented.  In addition to\r\ndeveloping formal theoretical support for the approach, detailed\r\nevaluations will be carried out through modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this research is two-fold. First, by effectively\r\ndispersing packets out of congested regions of the network, higher\r\nsustained throughput and lower, more predictable latency can be\r\nachieved.  That is, more data can be sent and received through the\r\nnetwork over a given period of time, and the time it takes for the\r\nnetwork to deliver the data can be reduced, with less variability.\r\nSecond, by efficiently resolving deadlock in the network, the\r\nrouting of packets is guaranteed never to come to a halt.  These\r\nimportant factors allow computer applications which require a great\r\namount of communication between system components to run much\r\nfaster and dependably.\r\n",
