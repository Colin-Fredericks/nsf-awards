 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines hands-on experiential discovery laboratory exercises with computer-aided instruction into computer aided laboratory instruction (CALI). The goal of the project is to enhance laboratory learning and understanding while significantly reducing the time, equipment, staffing and space requirements.  A generalized, interactive software application is being developed which presents the laboratory problem, guides students through setup of the experiment and physical apparatus, monitors the experimental effort, provides feedback during the laboratory exercise, and evaluates student performance.  An existing prototype CALI experiment is being modified, based on experience to date, and two new experiments are being developed.   \r\nThe efficacy of the CALI system is being evaluated by having randomly selected experimental groups perform the CALI experiments and comparing their short and long term learning with control groups performing conventional laboratory experiments with similar apparatus without the CALI interface.  This evaluation procedure is being replicated at another institution for one of the experiments.   Resources are being tracked to estimate potential savings.  CALI details and the evaluation results will be disseminated by conference presentations and through testing of the system at the second institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
