 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will train New Mexico science, mathematics and technology teachers at the secondary level (grades 6-12) to integrate IT concepts and computer modeling, especially of complex adaptive systems, into their curricula using StarLogo simulation software, participatory simulations using handheld computers and related computer technologies.  Students and teachers will analyze and explore (and later design and build) models of complex adaptive systems using a computer programming environment (StarLogo), and accompanying curriculum (Adventures in Modeling) specifically built for and tested in middle and secondary schools.  Students will learn 1) design and presentation of information as they develop computer simulations that must convey certain principles; 2) system design and analysis, as they design and conduct experiments using their simulated systems; 3) data analysis tools and techniques as they collect data from their experiments and analyze it using spreadsheets, graphing tools and statistics, and; 4) computer modeling and simulation techniques that have broad applicability across many scientific and technological domains.  The existing StarLogo community will be an immediate national audience for the revised free software resulting from this project.",
