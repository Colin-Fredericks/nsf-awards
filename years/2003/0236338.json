 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how informal experiences with plants and animals may enhance the development of biological reasoning in children between the ages of 5 and 10. Research on folk biology -- commonsense, everyday understanding of plants and animals -- suggests that by age 5 children already organize informally-acquired biological knowledge and use it to reason about the natural world. Further, children growing up in rural areas, who presumably have more informal experience with relatively intact natural ecosystems, exhibit relatively sophisticated folk biological reasoning.  However, research has yet to identify specific experiences associated with rural versus urban environments that contribute to differences in cognitive performance among these children. This project will investigate how experience influences the development of folk biological reasoning by comparing how the different experiences with nature available to rural and urban children may lead to differences in how they think about nature. The project focuses on children from urban schools in Boston and from rural schools in Western\r\nMassachusetts. Children and their parents will be interviewed about how they spend their time and what kinds of nature-related activities they regularly engage in. Children will also be given structured interviews and experimental tasks designed to assess different aspects of folk biological thinking. Relations among these measures promise to shed light on how different environments lead to differences in thinking, and more general links between experience and cognitive development\r\n\r\nResults will advance what we know about how specific differences in experience lead to differences in thinking, and provide a picture of precisely which kinds of experiences lead to more sophisticated folk biological reasoning. This research may serve as the basis for developing experiences for children growing up in other environments that will support their conceptual development in the area of biology.   Findings are potentially valuable to educators by clarifying how activities outside of the classroom may impact knowledge relevant to science education, and by elucidating the informal biological understanding that children bring to the classroom. \r\n",
