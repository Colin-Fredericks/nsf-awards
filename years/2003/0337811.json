The workshop will be held from 1st to 5th September 2003, at the Computer Services for Academic Research (CSAR) center of the UM.\r\nThe workshop participants will represent researchers from Europe, Japan and the U.S. The main objectives of the workshop for the U.S. participants are:\r\n(a) The development of collaborations amongst U.S. participants and the participants from Europe and Japan; and,\r\n(b) The development of research needs in the area of high performance, parallel computing (HPPC) in the general area of Civil Engineering.\r\nA group of approximately 24 participants will represent experienced researchers as well as learners and graduate students working in the area ofHPPC. The learners represent researchers who have done some work or have a great need for HPPC.\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the proposed participation at the workshop is in allowing the advancement of knowledge and understanding on cun-ent state of the art and in defining the future research needs in the area of high perfonnance, parallel computing within civil engIneenng.\r\nThe Broader Impact of the proposed participation at the and leaming among a diverse group of participants.\r\nis promoting teaching\r\nworkshop\r\n",
