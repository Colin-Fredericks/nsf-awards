 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of research of this project is the topology of closed symplectic\r\nmanifolds of dimension 4. A symplectic 4-manifold is a smooth manifold\r\nendowed with a closed and non-degenerate (symplectic) 2-form. Symplectic\r\nmanifolds arise naturally in various areas of mathematics, and their study has\r\nrelevant consequences also in physics and engineering. Kaehler manifolds are\r\nnatural examples of such manifolds, and until 30 years ago it was an open \r\nquestion whether other examples exist. Since then, wealth of other\r\nconstructions have appeared, and important results (often arising from\r\nthe interaction of physics and mathematics) have started to unveil the\r\nrichness of this class of manifolds. This project investigates the properties of\r\ncertain natural submanifolds of a symplectic $4$-manifold, namely lagrangian\r\nsubmanifolds (where the restriction of the symplectic form vanishes) and\r\nsymplectic submanifolds (where the restriction of the symplectic form is again\r\nsymplectic). The common theme underlying the various parts of the project is the\r\nuse of a technique, developed by R.Fintushel and R.Stern, that allows one to\r\nconstruct symplectic $4$-manifolds and study their submanifolds. The first goal\r\nis to study symplectic representatives of the canonical homology class of a\r\nsymplectic manifold; it is known, by a result of C.Taubes, that such\r\nrepresentatives exist, but little is known about their topology. The author wants\r\nto show that there exist manifolds whose canonical class admit several\r\nrepresentatives distinguished by the number of components. This would lead to a\r\nbetter understanding of how to define invariants of a symplectic manifold starting\r\nfrom the study of its canonical. The second goal is to analyze the existence of\r\nlagrangian submanifolds that are homologous but not isotopic, i.e. connected by a\r\nsequence of embeddings. Results of this kind have been obtained in the past for\r\nsymplectic submanifolds, but little is known in the lagrangian case. The third\r\ngoal is to study the relation between certain symplectic invariants (recently\r\nintroduced by P.Seidel for a particular class of symplectic manifolds) and the\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants. Other applications of these techniques to other\r\nproblems of symplectic and smooth topology of 4-manifolds are expected.\r\n\r\nSymplectic manifolds of dimension 4 lie at the intersection between two areas\r\nof research. Both the first, the topology of low dimensional manifolds, and\r\nthe second, symplectic topology, are traditional areas of investigations that in\r\nthe last 20 years have experienced a tremendous progress. This progress is due\r\nto new and exciting interaction with theoretical physics, that has served as a \r\nsource of models and conjectures, and a renewed relation of topology with other \r\nareas of mathematics that has produced in both directions fruitful applications \r\nand consequences. Topology in dimension 4 attracts great interest from both \r\nmathematics and physics as it investigates the dimension of the space-time; \r\nsymplectic topology involves the properties of certain manifolds that appear\r\n naturally in the description of problems arising from physics and\r\nengineering. A growing number of researchers, with original and stimulating\r\napproaches, is increasing in a spectacular way our comprehension on the\r\nsubject, verifying or disproving old conjectures, and suggesting new relations\r\nwith other areas of mathematics and physics. The investigator wants to continue\r\nhis research in this field, using techniques of topology that originate from\r\nclassical results in theory of knots, in conjunction with modern tools as the\r\ninvariants of 4-manifolds introduced by the physicists Seiberg and Witten.\r\nIn particular, the aim of the research is to better understand the submanifolds\r\nof a symplectic 4-manifold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
