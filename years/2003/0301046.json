The workshop has the objectives of 1) providing undergraduate women with exposure to computing research, 2) establishing and nurturing multi-institution and interdisciplinary research collaborations, 3) strengthening one's decision making power and coping ability with regard to the job and 4) providing support for teaching, advising, and service components of an academic career. The project incorporates a special keynote dinner with an inspirational woman speaker and opportunities to form and nurture relationships with potential mentors and colleagues.  These workshops have been very successful in the past and this project will continue with similar results.\r\n",
