 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stony Brook Superconducting Linear Accelerator provides heavy ion beams\r\nfor basic research in nuclear and atomic physics, and an infrastructure for\r\nthe recruitment, development and training of students in the areas of\r\nradiation detection, hardware development and experimental analysis.  The\r\nplanned research with the accelerator and at other facilities will build\r\nupon the activities currently in progress, and will continue the educational\r\nprogram of current and new PhD and other students. The research program in\r\ngamma ray spectroscopy will investigate several areas of nuclear structure\r\nincluding two projects that were started at Stony Brook and are now very\r\nactive areas of research. The first studies the fingerprints of chirality,\r\nwhich involves the existence of right-handed and left-handed geometries in\r\ncertain special nuclei, and the second project studies the limit of how much\r\nangular momentum a nucleus can carry.  Another research project uses the\r\nunique capability of our LINAC to provide intense Fr beams of 107\r\nparticles/sec.  The effort will focus on polarizing, cooling and trapping of\r\nFr for precision measurements of the nuclear magnetic moments that are\r\nneeded to test the atomic calculations of the Fr atom.  The Fr beams will\r\nalso be used to continue the development of weak interaction measurements in\r\natoms.   The Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory also serves as a focus\r\nof many educational activities. Students at the high school, undergraduate,\r\ngraduate, and postdoctoral levels participate in the research program with\r\nvarious intensities, from beam line construction to running actual\r\nexperiments.  In addition to these students, high school students, incoming\r\nstudents, and various classes tour the laboratory as an example of an\r\naccelerator research facility.\r\n",
