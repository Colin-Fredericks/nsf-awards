 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plastics Resources for Educators Program (PREP) has developed a broad range of multimedia instructional reassures on synthesis, structure, properties, applications and processing of plastics.  The interactive programs and virtual instruments create an exploratory learning environment that allows students to explore complex multivariable problems. This project is to develop a sustainable dissemination effort that includes workshops for faculty and the construction of workbooks and CDROMs that customize the use of various modules to address educational needs of different audiences.  Dissemination is done through a commercial publisher, but marketing is done through faculty contacts, industrial partners, a special interest group associated with the Society of Plastics Engineers and presentations at professional meetings.  A PREP website is a communications and distribution hub.  Formative and summative evaluation of all components is done by a third party evaluator.  The interactive electronic materials provide faculty with new ways of teaching.",
