 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to being among the most energetic of astrophysical events, core collapse\r\nsupernovae are the most productive factories of the heavy elements which are necessary for\r\nlife. As a result, they are critical players in the origin and evolution of the chemical\r\nelements, a subject of study central to the Directorate of Mathematical \\& Physical\r\nSciences' Origins of the Universe theme. Supernovae have also been, and continue to be,\r\nobjects of great interest to a wide range of NSF-funded astronomical, nuclear and particle\r\nphysics experiments and observatories, from radio and optical telescopes to nuclear\r\naccelerators and neutrino and gravity wave detectors. The theoretical study of core\r\ncollapse supernovae has progressed greatly in recent years, however compelling questions\r\nremain.\r\nIn this proposal, we advance a plan to improve our understanding of\r\nthe nucleosynthesis which results when a core collapse supernovae explodes. This proposal\r\nbuilds on our current efforts and is complimentary to DoE funded research into the core\r\ncollapse supernova mechanism at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While the theoretical\r\nstudy of core collapse supernovae has progressed greatly in the past decade, fundamental\r\nquestions remain, including ''Can the neutrino reheating mechanism, when calculated\r\naccurately in multidimensions, successfully produce supernova explosions?'' Key to\r\nanswering these questions is the ability to compare the computed models with observations.\r\nSince many of the important observations of supernovae highlight the elemental\r\ncomposition, accurate calculation of the nucleosynthesis of these multi-dimensional core\r\ncollapse supernova simulations is needed. In particular, we need to see how realistic\r\nnucleosynthesis, calculated in a self-consistent multi-dimensional fashion, differs from\r\ncurrent parameterized one dimensional models. We therefore propose to build on our\r\nworld-leading neutrino radiation hydrodynamic capability and investigate the\r\nnucleosynthesis of these models. Our ultimate goal is self consistent nucleosynthesis,\r\ncalculated in situ within the neutrino radiation hydrodynamic models, but we will also\r\ndiscuss interim steps that will give us some nucleosynthesis information more immediately.\r\nThe realization that \"we are star stuff\", that the chemical elements that compose our\r\nbodies and our world originate in stars, has penetrated deep into the public awareness,\r\nreaching as far as pop culture and philosophy. Thus, the study of Cosmic Origins is\r\nscience with broad societal impact and interest. In response to this public curiosity,\r\nHix and Mezzacappa have given several public lectures on this topic in recent years and\r\nexpect to continue to do so as part of this proposed effort. This proposal would further\r\nthe interdisciplinary collaboration between nuclear physics and astrophysics. This\r\nproposal would also further educational and professional development on several fronts.\r\nThis proposal would fund the involvement of a graduate student in supernova research\r\nefforts at ORNL, providing educational access to a world class scientific environment. We\r\nalso anticipate the involvement in this research of summer undergraduate students, as we\r\nhave in the past, through the Science Alliance funded by the state of Tennessee. Finally\r\nthis proposal would allow Hix to develop his independent research agenda, furthering his\r\ndevelopment as a scientist.",
