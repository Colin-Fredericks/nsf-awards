 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Fast Track Program is to continue recruiting, graduating, and preparing women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and low-income graduate students to make a smooth transition into the workforce and/or to continue toward a CSEM doctoral degree.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe four-year program will benefit CSEM graduate students by:\r\noencouraging uninterrupted study toward a graduate degree in CSEM fields, while preparing students to make a smooth transition to the workforce or doctoral degree completion;\r\norecruiting and retaining 29 recipients per year, in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics disciplines;\r\noreinforcing partnerships with CSEM faculty, students, key administrators, professional organizations, local, state, and national industries and governmental agencies;\r\nosupporting and assisting industries and current initiatives, such as LS CO-AMP, McNair\r\nScholars Program, WMEP (Women and Minorities in Engineering Program), and\r\nPEAKS/AGEP, to recruit and enroll underrepresented minority students, including women and persons with disabilities in the CSEM fields;\r\noinforming and providing funds for recipients to attend professional development workshops, seminars, and conferences to present their research and network with prospective employers; and\r\noadministering a tracking form to awardees annually to maintain relationship for future use of campus activities, such as mentoring, employment contacts, and presentations.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe Fast Track Program is based on the current model to strengthen the 21st century workforce. In response to current economic conditions and hardships, more individuals are applying for graduate school in the CSEM fields. Also, corporations continue to report a lack of women and underrepresented minorities in the engineering, scientific, and other technical workforce. The management team uses its existing collaborators to increase awareness and recruitment of underrepresented groups in CSEM fields. The purpose of this partnership is to develop and implement new strategies to match students' interests and skills with a compatible workplace. The highly qualified graduate students provide excellent work performance in the workforce, and quality teaching and mentoring in the classroom.\r\n",
