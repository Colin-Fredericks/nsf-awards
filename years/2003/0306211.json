 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1978, William Thurston revolutionized low-dimensional topology by\r\ndemonstrating that many 3-manifolds have hyperbolic metrics. The Mostow\r\nRigidity Theorem then implies that these metrics can be used to generate\r\ninteresting invariants to distinguish hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  A tremendous\r\nnumber of results have come out of these ideas. The goal of this proposal\r\nis to further understand hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In particular, there are a\r\nset of invariants that come out of the cusps of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and\r\nhyperbolic knots, including the cusp volume, the meridian length and the\r\nlongitude length. The plan is to continue to work on these invariants,\r\ndelineating better their possible range of values and determining their\r\nimplications for the rest of the hyperbolic structure. Moreover, recent\r\nwork has demonstrated the existence of totally geodesic surfaces in\r\nhyperbolic knot complements. Their existence is suprising and exciting. It\r\nis hoped that a determination can be made as to which knots possess such\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding hyperbolic 3-manifolds has implications for determining the\r\nshape of the spatial universe.  These invariants will be the kind that\r\ncosmologists may use to empirically identify the universe. Although recent\r\nmeasurements of the cosmic background radiation point to a curvature very\r\nclose to flat, this could mean that the universe is hyperbolic, but very\r\nlarge. Then more subtle hyperbolic invariants will be necessary to\r\ndetermine its topological shape.\r\n",
