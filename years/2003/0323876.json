 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)-York College, City University of New York (CUNY), is using $100,000 annually from NSF in creating a comprehensive scholars program in Computer Science, Information Systems Management and Mathematics. The funds are to provide $3,125 scholarships to 29 students and to cover administrative support for the project. A community-based approach to retaining students in the CSEMS disciplines is being implemented. Scholars are recruited through broad advertisement and cooperation from local high schools and colleges within the CUNY system. The Selection Committee is basing its decisions on student's academic ability, motivation, and demonstrated financial need. Scholars are benefiting from current programs, including the Job Placement Center, tutoring, and modern computer facilities. The project team is also providing a mentor system with activities that bring students, counselor, faculty and high technology partners together on a regular basis. This mentoring system is forming relationships and networks between the Scholars and the industry partners and graduate school connections. Student support activities called \"Scholar Community and to Scholars\" is in place to offer a student retention component to the project. The supporting activities are: 1) Faculty Mentors; 2) Annual Open House; 3) Monthly Meetings of Scholars, Mentors and Partners in High Technology; 4) Monthly Seminars from our Partners in High Technology Business; 5) Personalized Counseling; and, 6) Annual Scholars Reception. The goals of this project are to: 1) Increase the number of students recruited and enrolled in the CSEMS disciplines; 2) Increase the quality of support services and educational opportunities available to students enrolled in the targeted curricula and to CSEMS Scholars; 3) Increase the number of students retained and graduated in the CSEMS disciplines; 4) Recruit technology companies to be a part of the Project Team; and, 5) Expand the interaction and involvement of the students and the high technology companies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project offers an opportunity to financially handicapped and underrepresented students to study current, rigorous curricula with the guidance of high-technology industry leaders. The Project Team is composed of all the necessary leadership for a Scholars Community, professors, counselor, and high technology industry partners. The PI has the leadership ability, the infrastructure to make the project function smoothly and the full support of the Department and College. The program relies on longstanding structures, such as the Math and CS Club, an experienced counselor and modern computer facilities. All building blocks are in place for a successful program.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is based on a plan that promotes interaction between faculty, scholars, high technology representatives and strong curricula with activities that are bring together all of the partners on a regular basis. Scholars are benefiting from broad-based exposure to both the academic and the industry views of the high technology fields. Underrepresented groups are naturally benefiting since the student body is composed mainly of minorities (75%) and women (71%). Partnerships formed among faculty and business are fostering communications that are essential in the fast changing STEM fields, which is leading to further collaborations that are benefiting the students. Society is benefiting from these Scholars who are being prepared to participate in the high technology work force of the future.\r\n",
