 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56) \r\nOur project involves the development of innovative solutions to the major challenge of improving students' conceptualization of system dynamics concepts. Students struggle to understand application of seemingly abstract mathematics to predict and visualize the dynamic response of physical systems. The work we have adapted is from the work on Virtual Laboratories done by Moseterman and his team. In addition, the work of Johansson and his team is being utilized to develop pre-laboratory exercises and eventually have these experiments serve as stand-alone fully developed laboratories for the virtual laboratory format. \r\n\r\nInter-university laboratory formats utilizing virtual systems and remotely-accessible experiments are being developed to complement the mechanical engineering curricula at the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) and the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) - institutions that serve significant populations of non-traditional students that struggle with strict time constraints. Hispanic students constitute 87% and 46% of the student populations at UTPA and UTSA, respectively. Over 70% of UTPA's and 40% of UTSA's entering freshmen are first-generation college students, and a significant percentage work at least part-time. The majority of these students enter college with limited exposure to physics and calculus and must catch up rapidly to compete. Our goal has been to effectively engage students in the engineering process of modeling and controlling dynamic systems. The objectives have been to develop and evaluate laboratory formats that: \r\n\r\n1. enhance conceptualization and use of fundamentals using multiple means of visualization;\r\n2. increase participation through improved dissemination, accessibility, and availability of experiments via the Internet to students at many institutions; and\r\n3. engage students collaboratively to improve understanding of system dynamics.\r\n\r\nWith aid from the Office of Institutional Effectiveness at UTSA, the PI and his team have been evaluating the new curricula.\r\n",
