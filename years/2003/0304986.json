 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference is concerned with the theory of computability and\r\ncomplexity in analysis, physical sciences, and engineering over the real\r\nnumbers, which is built on the Turing machine model. This research is an \r\ninterdisciplinary area between applied analysis and computability and \r\ncomplexity theory, and sometimes also involves works in numerical \r\nanalysis. The goal of the research is to understand the laws of real number \r\ncomputation, the computability content of existence results in analysis, and \r\nthe computational complexity of computable operators. \r\n\r\nComputability brings to mind computers, which are playing an ever larger\r\nrole in our society. Computers operate on finite strings of digits.\r\nHowever most mathematical models describe continuous problems ranging\r\nfrom physical phenomena such as electromagnetism and sound waves, to\r\nengineering applications such as bridge designs and air flows around\r\nairplanes, to financial predictions such as expected investment returns.\r\nContinuous models are based fundamentally on the concept of real\r\nnumbers. Although a large portion of computer resources is devoted to\r\ncompute the solutions of such continuous problems, real number\r\ncomputation is not as well understood as it should be. There still \r\nexists a big gap between the continuous nature of problem from the \r\nphysical world and the computability and complexity theory of discrete \r\nstructures. The explosion of Ariane 5 rocket on June 4, 1996, is a drastic \r\nexample. The problem at the center is that computers operate on finite \r\nstrings of digits  while the real numbers are infinite mathematical objects.\r\nThe increasing demand for reliable as well as fast software requires a\r\nbetter understanding of real number computation. Computable analysis is\r\na theory which studies the laws of real number computation. Its goal is\r\nto bridge the gap between analysis, the mathematical theory of real\r\nnumbers, on the one end, and computability on the other. It studies\r\nwhich computations in analysis, physical sciences, and engineering are\r\npossible and which are not. The research lets us understand why a\r\nproblem cannot be solved on computers, or provides us with a better\r\nunderstanding of the computability content of a continuous problem and\r\nthus better tools for constructing more efficient algorithms. The\r\nresearch outputs of the conference series are substantial. The series\r\nhas produced five volumes of proceedings containing more than 100\r\n(refereed) papers ranging from theoretical investigations of\r\ncomputability and complexity in analysis to new implementations of exact\r\nreal arithmetics as well as further developments of existing\r\nsoftware packages.\r\n",
