Emphasis on the role of coadsorbed solvent molecules on mechanisms of reaction and rates of reaction are being examined.  Time of flight electron stimulated desorption ion angular distribution (TOF-ESDIAD) measurements are used to characterized the electron stimulated desorption and dissociation processes for halogenated molecules in the presence of polar and non-polar solvent species in the condensed thin films.  Fundamental mechanisms by which the coadsorbate influences electron induced reactions are examined.  Information from these studies is useful for understanding mechanisms of ozone depletion and environmental remediation. \r\n\r\nChemical reaction processes driven by electron irradiation are the focus of the research of Professor Madey and his coworkers.  By measuring the angular distribution of ion products of electron irradiation of thin films and surfaces, information about the mechanisms of desorption and decomposition of adsorbed halogen containing species is obtained.  This information is important in developing an understanding of environmental and atmospheric chemical processes involving halogen containing molecules. \r\n",
