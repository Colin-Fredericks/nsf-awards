 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project is focused on transition metal oxides and related materials. Specimen synthesis, magnetic and electrical measurements, and experiments under high pressure (pressures to 1.5 GPa) will bridge aspects of the chemistry and physics of these materials. Investigations of layered nickel oxides, such as the single-NiO2-layer La2NiO4 compound, are expected to clarify relations between the nickel oxides and the superconducting cuprates. This work will yield the first studies of these systems under high pressure. Syntheses and related experiments are designed to simulate the magnetism of the cuprates. Other targeted chemical systems include molybdenum oxides and the copper pnictides. An innovative high-resolution quartz dilatometer, the only device of its kind in the USA, will be constructed to measure the thermal expansion of sub-millimeter sized single crystals, thus enabling the investigation of phase transitions. The education component of the project will involving graduate and undergraduate students in the research, and will also involve new classroom teaching methods for introductory physics. The teaching method for introductory physics will integrate active processes into lectures through demonstrations and single-concept problems aimed at improving conceptual understanding and creating a more enthusiastic learning experience.\r\n%%%\r\nThis CAREER award will enable the development of a research project involving transition metal oxides, and an educational component leading to new classroom teaching methods for introductory physics. The research focuses on the study of transition metal oxides which are known to exhibit unusual electrical and magnetic properties. These materials may ultimately find important technological applications. Specimen synthesis, magnetic and electrical measurements, and experiments at high pressure play major roles in the research, which spans areas of chemistry and physics. A number collaborations with researchers at other institutions extend the range of experiments that can be performed on the materials. An innovative high-resolution quartz dilatometer, the only device of its kind in the USA, will be constructed to measure the length change of tiny specimens as the temperature is varied. This will allow the detection of important phase transitions occurring in the materials. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive valuable training for future careers in the high-technology marketplace. The teaching method for introductory physics will integrate active processes into lectures through demonstrations and single-concept problems aimed at improving conceptual understanding and creating a more enthusiastic learning experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
