Work carried out by Professor Gewirth and his colleagues at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign examines structure-reactivity correlations in the electroreduction of oxygen, peroxide, and nitrate species at underpotential deposition modified surfaces. A combination of scanning probe microscopy, surface x-ray methods, and vibrational spectroscopy methods are being used to investigate these systems.  In addition, the structure of novel adsorbed inorganic oxometallate monolayers are being probed.  This work provides fundamental insight into the mechanisms of electrocatalysis and electrode modification relevant to fuel cell and battery technologies. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Gewirth and his group at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign are examining the structure and reactivity of metal and inorganic monolayer electrode surfaces.  Using a combination of spectrosocopic and microscopic methods, the structure and reactivity of metal modified electrodes are examined for a series of small molecule electroreduction reactions.  In addition, the structure of polyoxometallate monolayers is studied.  The results of this work help to develop an understanding of important fuel cell and energy storage technologies. \r\n\r\n",
