 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the study of a class of \r\nnonlinear differential equations arising in such diverse \r\nareas as fluid dynamics, cosmology, topological quantum \r\nfield theory as well as theory of automorphic functions. \r\nThese equations admit a large family of solutions in terms \r\nof modular forms and exhibit novel singularites in the \r\nform of movable natural boundaries in the complex domain. \r\nThe main objective of this project is to characterize the \r\ncomplex dynamics of these nonlinear systems by analyzing \r\ntheir general solutions, symmetries and singularity structures\r\nin the complex plane. Various algebraic and geometric methods\r\nakin to the theory of completely integrable systems will be \r\nemployed to carry out the proposed studies.\r\n\r\nNonlinear differential equations are well known to have \r\nimportant applications in the modeling of complex physical \r\nphenomena arising in many areas of science and technology. \r\nThis proposal is aimed to investigate the general solutions \r\nto a class of nonlinear differential equations, thereby shedding \r\nmore light on the properties of the underlying physical systems \r\ndescribed by these equations. The project will also explore \r\nthe connection between these nonlinear equations and the theory \r\nof automorphic functions which traditionally arises in areas of \r\npure mathematics such as number theory. The proposed research \r\nactivities will be carried out in a primarily undergraduate \r\ninstitution. It is strongly anticipated that the proposed research \r\nwill lead to undergraduate projects in several areas including \r\nnonlinear waves, dynamical systems, special functions and conformal \r\nmapping, all of which have wide ranging physical applications.",
