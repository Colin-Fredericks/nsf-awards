Saigal\r\nCarnegie Mellon University\r\n\r\nTitle: Analytical-Experimental Approach to Verified Cohesive Zone\r\nFracture Models in Engineering Applications\r\n\r\nAbstract: The chipping of coatings is studied using the cohesive \r\nzonebased cohesive finite elements formulation. An integrated \r\nanalytical/experimental/numerical approach is followed. The cohesive \r\nzone models are postulated to include irreversibility, rate-dependence, \r\nand the effect of environmental factors. These postulations are both \r\nguided by and validated by a set of experiments designed to highlight \r\nvarious phenomenon occurring in the fracture of materials systems. The \r\ndevelopments are applied to the industrial application of chipping of \r\npaint systems. For this application, multiple, interacting cracks \r\npropagating along unknown trajectories need to be accounted for. The \r\ncohesive finite elements approach provides a natural vehicle for such \r\ncracks. Additional applications of cohesive elements include layered \r\nconstructions found in numerous engineering applications such as \r\ncomposites, laminated sheets, coated metal, and microelectronic \r\ndevices. The proposed research is carried out in close cooperation with \r\nthe DuPont Company. The experiments for validation as well as for the \r\nindustrial application are carried out at DuPont.  The cohesive models \r\nare developed under the guidance of DuPont researchers to ensure that \r\nthese elements have full industry validity. The project serves as a \r\nunique training mechanism for graduate students, introducing them to \r\nuniversity-industry interactions as well as to the effectiveness of \r\ncombined analytical/numerical/experimental approaches in solving \r\nreal-world problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
