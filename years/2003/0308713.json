 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traub and Wozniakowski\r\n     The goal of information-based complexity is to create a\r\ntheory of computational complexity and optimal algorithms for\r\nproblems with partial, contaminated, and priced information, and\r\nto apply the results to solving specific problems in varied\r\ndisciplines.  For brevity, information-based complexity will be\r\ncalled IBC.  The theory is developed over abstract spaces,\r\ntypically Hilbert and Banach spaces, while the applications are\r\nto multivariate problems.  Because the information is partial and\r\ncontaminated, only approximate solutions can be obtained.  IBC\r\nstudies computational complexity and optimal algorithms for\r\ncomputing e-approximations in various settings.  Because the\r\nworst case setting often leads to negative results such as\r\nunsolvability and intractability, settings with a weaker\r\nassurance such as average, probabilistic, and randomized settings\r\nare also studied.  A fairly new area of IBC research is quantum\r\ncomputing.  The best known algorithms discovered to date, Shor and\r\nGrover, are for discrete problems.  But many problems occurring\r\nin science and engineering are continuous.  Examples include\r\nhigh-dimensional and path integration, high-dimensional\r\napproximation, and partial differential equations.  To understand\r\nthe power of quantum computation for continuous problems one must\r\nknow the computational complexity of these problems on a\r\nclassical computer in various settings.  This is exactly what has\r\nbeen studied in IBC.  Questions to be answered include:  For what\r\nproblems is quantum computation (exponentially, polynomially)\r\nfaster than classical computation?  For what problems is there\r\nprovably no speed-up of quantum over classical computation?\r\n     For some 40 years, computing has been driven by Moore's law,\r\nwhich is the empirical observation that computing power doubles\r\nabout every 18 months.  This has made it possible for people to\r\nhave computers in their homes as powerful as computers owned by\r\ncorporations just 20 years ago.  It has made the internet\r\npossible.  Finally, powerful computers are indispensable to our\r\nnational security.  Computer chips and wires are getting so small\r\nthat there is a consensus among technologists that Moore's law\r\nwill end in 10 to 15 years using current silicon technology.\r\nBecause it is critical for our country to maintain the Moore's\r\nlaw trajectory, new ways to compute are being considered.  One of\r\nthe most promising ideas is to use the principles of quantum\r\nmechanics to do quantum computing.  The investigators and their\r\ncolleagues are studying the following question:  If physicists\r\nand chemists succeed in building quantum computers, for which\r\nproblems are there big payoffs?  That is, what are the killer\r\napplications?\r\n\r\n",
