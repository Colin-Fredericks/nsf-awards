 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Building Engineering Team Skills Program proposes to determine industry best \r\npractices by culling practitioners' experience and expertise and then adapting those\r\npractices to build engineering team skills as part of the University educational\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThere is a great need for research to determine what capabilities, characteristics\r\nand dispositions of engineers working on teams are most valued by industry. Similarly,\r\nthere is a great need to understand what practices best serve to create and nurture which\r\nteam skills.\r\n\r\nBest practices will be determined through multiple research methodologies targeting\r\nmultiple respondent sources and utilizing a phased approach. Completion of each phase\r\nwill provide results specifically designed to inform the next research phase. There will\r\nbe three phases consisting of Manager Interviews, Manager Survey, and Engineer\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\nAfter the research phases determining skill value and the best practices for creating those\r\nskills have been completed, then course curricula, materials and exercises will be planned.\r\nActivities will first occur at California State University Hayward, then at University of \r\nCalifornia, Berkeley, two institutions rich in the diversity of their underrepresented student populations.\r\n",
