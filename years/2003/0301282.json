The proposer's work on the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem gives a \r\nnew method for constructing solutions to certain systems of diophantine \r\nequations with many variables, and the method may lead to a solution of one \r\nof more unsolved problems in this area.  The work on cryptology centers around \r\nshowing that certain algorithms for attacking public-key cryptosystems, that \r\nfind low-height roots of polynomials modulo an integer q \r\n(such as Coppersmith's method), cannot be easily improved.\r\nFinally, the proposer plans to continue developing a sieve method\r\nfor counting the number of primes in a given set of integers, which allows \r\none to use additional analytic information (besides the usual data used by the\r\ncombinatorial sieve) about the set, in the hopes that the method will\r\nlead to the solution of one or another known, difficult, unsolved problems\r\nin prime number theory.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the ancient Greeks, mathematicians have been trying to\r\nunderstand how the prime numbers are spaced; that is, how does the distance\r\nbetween consecutive prime numbers vary as one considers larger and larger\r\nprimes?  Sieve methods were developed as a theoretical tool for answering\r\nthis type of question; however, there are many natural questions about such \r\nspacings that they currently cannot answer.  One of the proposer's\r\nresearch goals is to finish developing a new sieve method which he hopes \r\nto use to make progress on some of these unsolved problems.  The proposer's\r\nwork on cryptology was motivated by research with an undergraduate on\r\na certain method (Coppersmith's algorithm) for attacking the \r\nRSA cryptosystem, which is a procedure for sending secure data via the internet.\r\nThe proposer (and student) plans to continue his work\r\non a related problem in number theory, the solution of which would show that\r\nthis method of attack cannot be much improved.  Lastly, the proposer plans\r\nto continue his work on the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem.  This problem is  \r\na longstanding unsolved question in number theory, and proposer is\r\ndeveloping new methods to make progress on it and other, similar problems.",
