These problems are universally important and involve developing new computational techniques and improved methods for efficient and robust modeling in such diverse areas as climate and weather and optical communication and high-speed electronics. Problems and models that absorb boundary conditions and effect boundary conditions will be emphasized. \r\n\r\nThe U.S.- French interdisciplinary team consists of Jan Hesthaven (Brown University), Peter Petropoulos (NJIT) and their graduate students and Elaine Becache, Houssem Haddar and Patrick Joly (all from INRIA Rocquencourt). They bring to this collaboration complementary expertise in applied and computational mathematics (Hesthaven and Petropoulos) and numerical analysis (INRIA team). This combined effort is required to develop the proposed new computational techniques and to understand properties and limitations of the proposed models.  \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and INRIA.  NSF provides funds for visits to France by US investigators and students. INRIA supports the visits of French researchers to the United States.  \r\n",
