 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long tradition of social influence research has documented many antecedents of social change. In contrast, little is known about consequences of change. This project examines group dynamics in the aftermath of change that occurs when, due to social influence, majority and minority factions within a group switch their positions. The proposed theoretical model posits that such a change is more than a mechanical reversal of positions. Rather, change is assumed to affect functioning of the group as a whole. An asymmetry in reactions to change is hypothesized such that typically negative reactions to loss of majority position are stronger than typically positive reactions to gain of the majority position. As a result of the asymmetry, change initially should weaken group functioning, including a group's ability to retain its members. This hypothesis will be tested in an experimentally created group with opinion-based majorities and minorities. Examining the effect of change on the functioning of these groups is a first step in counteracting negative consequences and capitalizing on positive consequences of social change. This research, therefore, has implications for political, work, and other groups in which advocates of once prevailing ideas trade places with proponents of once uncommon but eventually embraced ideas.\r\n\r\n",
