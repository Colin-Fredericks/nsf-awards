This is an\r\ninternational conference held annually in the Midwest region,\r\nrotating among different universities. The aim of this conference\r\nwill be to introduce the latest developments in the field of\r\ngeometric analysis and some closely related areas.  A partial\r\nlist of topics which will be covered by this conference include:\r\n(Kaehler-) Einstein equation and constant scalar curvature metric\r\nequation (Yamabe problem); (Hermitian-) Yang-Mills equation;\r\nminimal surface equation; harmonic map problem and J- holomorphic\r\ncurves (Cauchy-Riemann equation); and the geodesic equation in\r\nthe infinite dimensional space of Kaehler metrics which is given\r\nby a homogenous complex Monge-Ampere equation.  These equations\r\nfit together with the corresponding evolution equations:\r\n(Kaehler-) Ricci flow, Yang-Mills flow, the mean curvature flow,\r\nand the harmonic map flow, etc. People would like to know (local\r\nand global) existence, regularity and uniqueness of solutions to\r\nthese equations.  Many deep works have arisen by studying\r\ndifferent aspects of these challenging problems.\r\n\r\nDifferential geometry is a fundamental and vital field of\r\nmathematics which has many far reaching applications beyond the\r\nrealm of pure mathematics. To name a few: the study of Kaehler\r\ngeometry, especially Calabi-Yau manifolds, has important\r\napplications in theoretical physics; the study of (inverse) mean\r\ncurvature flow has important applications in image processing;\r\nand the study of curves, surfaces and their higher-dimensional\r\nanalogues have important applications in computer graphics,\r\nengineering and optimization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
