 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n1. Intellectual Merit\r\nWe have recently demonstrated experimentally that hybrid thin film structures possessing\r\nan appropriately selected geometric interface between a semiconductor and a metal display a\r\nnew phenomenon that has been labeled extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) and that InSb\r\ndevices with either internal or external Au shunts exhibit room-temperature EMR as high as\r\n100% to 750,000% at magnetic fields, ranging from 0.05T to 4 Tesla, respectively. These\r\nnonmagnetic structures are readily fabricated for practical sensor applications such as read-heads\r\nfor ultra-high density magnetic recording and rival the performance of conventional sensors\r\nbased on the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. We have also demonstrated that EMR\r\ndevices are scalable from macroscopic to nanoscopic dimensions in the range of millimeters to\r\n20 nanometers. It has recently been realized that EMR is but one example of a broad class of\r\ngeometry-driven interfacial effects in hybrid semiconductor-metal structures. Now a second\r\nexample of such interfacial phenomena, extraordinary piezoconductivity (EPC), has also been\r\ndemonstrated by Solin et. al. Here we propose to establish proof of principle, elucidate the\r\nunderlying physics and develop prototypes of a new class of ifEXXly sensors in which the\r\nsensitivity of the metal-semiconductor interface to external perturbations gives rise to similar\r\nextraordinary responses. In the case of EMR we propose new prototype array structures for\r\nultra-high resolution magnetic sensing and magnetic imaging. For EPC we propose to clarify the\r\nphysical principles and to develop prototypes of ultra sensitive and robust strain and pressure\r\nsensors. For extraordinary electroconductance (EEC), extraordinary thermoconductance (ETC)\r\nand extraordinary optoconductance (EOC) devices we will first establish proof of principal and\r\nthereafter move to the prototype stage.\r\nAll EXX effects are critically dependent on the geometry and physical properties the\r\nmetal-semiconductor interface. We have already shown that the finite element method (FEM)\r\nfor modeling EMR provides excellent ixno adjustable parameterl\" agreement with experiments\r\nwhile revealing the current and potential distribution in the device in exquisite detail. Therefore,\r\nwe propose collateral investigation of these novel EXX effects using FEM modeling since it\r\nincorporates geometrical issues, while accounting for the attendant complex boundary\r\nconditions. FEM is also ideally suited for the design optimization of the structures in order to\r\nenhance sensitivity.\r\n2. Broader Impact\r\nIt is anticipated that the proposed research will have broad beneficial impact on\r\neducation, technology, and society. It will expose graduate and undergraduate students from a\r\nnumber of disciplines/departments to new experimental techniques, basic physical principles,\r\nand novel fabrication methods related to EXX sensor development thus providing\r\ninterdisciplinary skills that will be mandatory for the next generation of the nation's scientists\r\nand engineers. Research results will also be integrated into the undergraduate course work at\r\nboth institutions and into a special topics course for ioMagnetlo high school students. The\r\nproposed research will enhance the opportunity for adding women and under-represented\r\nminorities to the Washington University faculty through hiring programs currently chaired by the\r\nPI. It will also significantly augment the development of a new campus-wide Materials\r\nInitiative/Center that is lead by the PI. EXX sensors could impact a variety of diverse\r\ntechnologies including sensors for medical applications, manufacturing quality control,\r\nautomobile safety, pollution-control and fuel-efficiency, thermal imaging devices and consumer\r\nelectronics with obvious social, medical and economic benefits.",
