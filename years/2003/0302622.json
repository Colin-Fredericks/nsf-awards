 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: This project concerns two main topics: harmonic analysis on\r\nnoncompact semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces, and unique\r\ncontinuation problems and absence of positive eigenvalues of Schrodinger\r\noperators on Euclidean spaces. The author's goal is to develop\r\nreal-variable methods that could be used to study boundedness properties\r\nof certain natural operators on noncompact semisimple Lie groups and\r\nsymmetric spaces. Some of the problems to be investigated are the\r\nfollowing: sharp estimates related to the Kunze-Stein phenomenon,\r\nbehaviour of the solution of the wave equation on symmetric spaces at\r\nlarge time, singular integral operators on symmetric spaces, transference\r\nprinciples for operators defined by Fourier multipliers on symmetric\r\nspaces, and maximal operators and applications in ergodic theory. The\r\nauthor made progress on these problems in certain special cases, mostly\r\non Lie groups and symmetric spaces of real rank one. The second part of\r\nthe project is aimed at understanding the absence of positive eigenvalues\r\nfor Schrodinger operators with potentials in appropriate Lebesgue spaces\r\nand with certain decay properties at infinity.\r\n\r\nThe problem of eliminating the possibility of positive eigenvalues for the\r\nSchrodinger operator associated to one or many particles comes from\r\nmathematical physics. One expects on physical grounds that such positive\r\nenergy \"bound states\" cannot exist. This is indeed the case for a large\r\nclass of Schrodinger operators associated to potentials which satisfy\r\ncertain uniform decay conditions, such as the Coulomb potential.\r\nThese potentials were studied in the 60's by T. Kato, S. Agmon, J.\r\nWeidman, B. Simon, and others. In the last twenty years there has been\r\ngrowing interest in extending these classical results to more general\r\npotentials in various Lebesgue spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
