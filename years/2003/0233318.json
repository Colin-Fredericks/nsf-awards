Janusz Konrad and William Karl in the US and Michel Barlaud in France lead the team of investigators and students on a joint project in video segmentation and subsurface sensing.  They will develop new variational methods for segmentation and reconstruction of scenes with dynamic objects, with particular attention to temporal event detection by applying contour-based representations of the underlying object geometry.  The approach builds on the investigators' previous work in dynamic medical imaging, video segmentation, and image reconstruction.  The US investigators are known for their computational expertise in motion estimation algorithms, motion based segmentation, and image reconstruction.  This is complemented by French expertise in mathematical methods for image and video processing and coding.  The French team is currently pursuing applications using medical data. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers and to the United States.   US students will benefit from the exchange of scientific techniques and experience with an international research team.  \r\n",
