 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes an innovative approach for development of a high sensitivity laser ultrasonic receiver for applications in industrial environments. Combining the high sensitivity of classic reference beam interferometer with the ability to efficiently overcome the limitation caused by the speckle light generated from the reflection from rough surface will make this interferometer well suited for demanding industrial applications where a low cost, sensitive and rugged receiver is needed.  Because the proposed interferometer takes advantage of the high integration level of current state-of-the-art in electronic packaging, the system can be made very compact. The robustness, high sensitivity and lower cost of this ultrasonic receiver will enable laser based ultrasonic inspection to become a cost effective solution.\r\n\r\nThe commercial market for this measurement system is the very broad NDT market. More specifically, this laser ultrasonic receiver is targeting process control and in-service inspection applications where there is a very high need for reliable and low cost inspection systems capable of withstanding the demanding environment of factories.\r\n",
