The co-PI's past research into physicalism and emergentism shows that philosophers cannot always afford this neglect, for viably formulating these metaphysical theses requires appeal, first, to the notion of a fundamental force or interaction; and second, (insofar as fundamental forces/interactions are standardly taken to be systems of interacting fields) to the notion of a field. More generally, our best-confirmed scientific theories are field theories; yet with few exceptions (including Sunny Auyang, Tian Cao, and Paul Teller) philosophers have not engaged the task of working out the presuppositions and entailments of a field metaphysics, and metaphysical debates commonly presuppose the sort of atomistic metaphysics associated with Democritus and Hume.\r\nThis proposal aims to give the co-PI the scientific understanding necessary to help correct this neglect. The first component consists in studying advanced physics at the University of Michigan, under the committed guidance of Gordon Kane, an eminent physicist working on super-symmetric extensions of quantum field theory. The course of study will consist in auditing several graduate courses in modern physics, supplemented by directed study of additional texts on gauge theories and quantum field theory, coupled with weekly meetings with Kane addressing the technical and conceptual foundations of contemporary physics.\r\nThe second component of the proposal consists in applying physics training to projects in fundamental ontology (especially as pertaining to a field metaphysics), and disseminating the results in metaphysics and philosophy of science journals. Relevant papers include \"The Particular Nature of the Quantum Field\" and \"The Reality of Non-field Particulars on a Field Metaphysics\".  More broadly, the co-PI will explore the impact of the concepts of force/interaction and field on metaphysical debates concerning causality, laws and modality. Since these debates tend to proceed under the atomistic principle that there are no necessary (ontological or causal) connections in nature (which principle is undermined from the perspective of a scientifically-informed field metaphysics), the proposed research is of considerable potential impact. The proposal also strikes a triple-blow for gender equality in three of the most male-dominated areas of the academy: physics, foundational metaphysics, and philosophy of physics.\r\n",
