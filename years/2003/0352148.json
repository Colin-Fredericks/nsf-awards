 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to conduct an exploratory test of the assumption that different test development procedures for creating achievement tests in two languages elicit different kinds of thinking in students, different kinds of development processes when applied to science and mathematics, and insights on how to streamline a costly process.  Traditional translation procedures raise concerns that they do not capture student thinking associated with the second language and culture as much as they do the translator's thinking.  The approach to be explored (CAD) takes into account the finding that student performance is highly sensitive to wording and context.  Thus, as items are developed independently for say English and Spanish versions the developers try them out on students and get together to discuss the wording as it relates to language and culture of the students.  The CAD or Concurrent Assessment Development is proposed as a promising strategy for assessment that captures student thinking without a lessened cultural and language bias while maintaining fidelity to psychometric principles and a structured shell or test specification guide used by both the new CAD approach and conventional translation approaches.",
