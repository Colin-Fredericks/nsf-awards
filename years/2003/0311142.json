 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suciu\r\n     This is a collaborative project between Henry Schenck and\r\nAlexandru Suciu.  The investigators study the interplay between\r\nthe topology of a manifold X and certain algebraic structures\r\nrelated to X.  From a theoretical standpoint, such an undertaking\r\ninvolves a mainstream question of algebra, geometry, and\r\ntopology: how geometric, topological, or combinatorial aspects of\r\na manifold manifest in algebraic properties of objects such as\r\nthe cohomology ring, fundamental group, and resonance varieties.\r\nThe focus is on the case where X is the complement of an\r\narrangement of lines or rational curves in the projective plane,\r\nor a configuration space.  The investigators develop a software\r\npackage of algorithms to study the aforementioned algebraic\r\ninvariants of X.  The software is used to generate tables of\r\narrangements (similar to the tables used in knot theory),\r\nproviding an extensive list of examples and invariants.  The\r\ninvestigators use these tables to search for counterexamples to\r\nopen conjectures, and to spot patterns leading to theorems.  The\r\ntables and code are a community resource, available online, and\r\ngenerate considerable synergy between disparate groups\r\n(algebraists, topologists, combinatorialists) involved in MSRI's\r\nspecial semester on hyperplane arrangements (Fall 2004).\r\n     There is also a practical benefit: hyperplane arrangements\r\nand configuration spaces are ubiquitous in pure and applied\r\nmathematics, arising in numerous areas including braid groups,\r\nknot theory, robotics, approximation theory, and mathematical\r\nmodelling.  For example, in approximation theory one can\r\napproximate a function of several variables, say k of them in a\r\nk-dimensional region, by dividing the region into pieces and on\r\neach piece approximating the function by polynomials; the\r\nresulting piecewise polynomials are called splines.  Technically,\r\nthe region is divided into simplices using hyperplanes; the set\r\nof splines on the resulting simplicial complex is an algebraic\r\nobject that depends strongly on the geometry of the chosen\r\nhyperplanes.  In robotics, arrangements arise in motion planning\r\n(finding a collision-free motion between two placements of a\r\ngiven robot among a set of objects).  Configuration spaces show up\r\nin multidimensional billiards (describing the periodic\r\ntrajectories of a mass-point in a domain in Euclidean space).\r\nInformation about the structure of the cohomology ring translates\r\ninto bounds on the complexity of the motion planning problem, or\r\nbounds on the number of periodic trajectories.  Thus, finding fast\r\nalgorithms to compute algebraic invariants associated to\r\narrangements and configuration spaces could have real world\r\napplications.  The problems the investigators study are also well\r\nsuited to introducing graduate (and undergraduate!) students to\r\nresearch and the use of computational tools.  Students conduct\r\ncomputational experiments, discover patterns and the structure of\r\nthe problem, and thus have motivation to learn new theoretical\r\ntools.\r\n\r\n",
