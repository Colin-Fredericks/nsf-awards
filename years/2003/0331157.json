 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth Exposed: Engaging the Public in the Art and Science of Earth Imagery\r\n\r\nThis very innovative project proposes to use digital satellite images of the Earth as art objects in an art gallery in Philadelphia that has a tradition of using a combination of art and science to introduce the public and school children to scientific concepts. In addition, web-based activities will extend the reach of the exhibit and provide access to the materials through DLESE for schools in other cities. This project is a powerful synergistic activity among science, education and art, where all participants benefit from each other. Salem College provides imagery and visualization research, TERC Inc. develops the learning activities and interactive web site, and the Klein Gallery assists with the artistic nature of the production, ensuring that the presentation meets gallery guidelines and style as well as coordinating extensive in-gallery K-12 education for students from the Philadelphia area. This exhibit will form an official part of the centennial meeting and celebrations of the American Association of Geographers, which will be held in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe grant also provides the seed money for the project to expand on the preliminary interest expressed by leading art galleries and museums throughout the country, such as the Boston Museum of Science, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Exploratorium, and the Rhode Island School of Design. An exhibit of Earth science imagery and interactive exhibits at these venues would potentially reach and educate thousands of people about some of the most advanced tools that are in use by geoscientists today.\r\n\r\nEvaluation will be carried out through post-visit interviews with both adult and student gallery visitors, and will include questions about aesthetic quality, scientific content, understanding of concepts, and interest in geoscience. The web-based component of the project will similarly be evaluated in the classroom, and more widely through montoring site usage. \r\n",
