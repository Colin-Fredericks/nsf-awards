Specifically, the study will address: \r\n(1)\tWhat is the general structure of teacher preparation in the countries selected? The study will select six countries using criteria such as high levels of achievement in TIMSS, challenging 8th grade curricula, distinctive teacher preparation approaches and \"map\" the structure of teacher preparation in each country. \r\n(2)\tWhat is the mathematical and pedagogical content those preparing to teach eighth graders have an opportunity to learn? The project will select a probability sample of teacher preparation institutions in each country and within it a sample of students in their last year of study to probe their curriculum experiences and mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. \r\n(3)\tWhat is the cost-effectiveness of different approaches to teacher preparation?\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that results from the study will provide a conceptual framework for comparative study of teacher preparation; help understand the greater diversity of approaches; provide a methodology, indicators and analytic tools to study the influence of teacher preparation on prospective candidates; and provide policy insight on how to improve the preparation of middle school mathematics teachers. \r\n",
