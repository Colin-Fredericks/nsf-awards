 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  This project addresses the need to support undergraduate research by introducing inquiry into two introductory courses. The PIs are restructuring two introductory biology courses to include inquiry- based, multi-week laboratory modules adapted from several successful external models. Simultaneously, they are revising the lecture portion of these courses to increase interaction and inquiry. \r\n\r\nAmong the laboratory models being adapted in the BIO I course are the Plant Profile Project (R. Noyd, (http://www.botany2001.org/section13/abstracts/9.shtml, 2001), Yeast Genetics Model System (T. Manney, et al., Kansas State University), Evolution Lab, a unit in Biology Labs On-Line (BLOL, http://biologylab.awlonline.com/, a collaboration of the California State University system Center for Distributed Learning and Addison Wesley Longman), Angiosperm Hormones (D. Emmeluth and D. Brott, Am. Biol. Teacher, 1985), Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecology in Springs (D. Glazier, http://faculty.juniata.edu/glazier/researchlink/rl2kpage1.htm ), and Conservation Biology (N. Ruggeri, University of Wisconsin-Madison.)  \r\n\r\nModel interactive lecture techniques include debate, role-playing, and mid-lecture review questions answered singly or cooperatively (J. Faust and D. Paulson, J. Exc. Coll. Teach, 1998; K. DeNeve and M. Heppner, Innov. Higher Educ., 1997; F. Caccavo, Am. Biol. Teacher, 2001).\r\n\r\nThis new curriculum produces students with better research skills, a deeper understanding of science, and enthusiasm for conducting research. The project also incorporates significant faculty professional development on interactive teaching skills.  The project is novel because it integrates exemplary laboratory, lecture, and web-based exercises to promote inquiry and because it explicitly emphasizes evolutionary biology as a unifying concept throughout. Because the university has a mandate to provide programs for students with disabilities and graduates a high proportion of underrepresented minority students, the curricular revisions have a large impact on these populations of students.  \r\n\r\n",
