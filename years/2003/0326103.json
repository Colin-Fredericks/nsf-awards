 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary project at the University of Idaho, in cooperation with The National Judicial College and The National Tribal Justice Center, aims to enhance access to the legal materials of American Indian tribal systems through creation of a nationwide, web-accessible electronic database of tribal court opinions, tribal codes and constitutions, and related legal materials.  The resultant product, the Tribal Law Reporter digital library, will be fully searchable and accessible on the worldwide web through its own web address and by hyperlink from web pages maintained by The National Tribal Justice Center, and The National Judicial College, and the University of Idaho.  In addition to designing, creating, updating, and maintaining the project database, search engine, and web interface, the project participants will enter into contractual agreements with tribal courts and councils for permission to make their court decisions, codes and constitutions available through the project digital library.  Other legal materials, including selected federal and state court opinions addressing federal Indian law, treaties, and United States Statutory and regulatory provisions affecting Indian rights and tribal governance will round out the legal materials accessible through the digital library.  In addition, the project participants will provide training in the use of the database and in conducting legal research more generally to tribal court judges and members of tribal councils.",
