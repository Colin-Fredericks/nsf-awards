 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Hope College under the direction of Dr. Graham Peaslee for\r\na particle accelerator and attached microprobe facility to enhance the research efforts of\r\nfaculty and undergraduate students. This new instrumentation will be used in a variety of\r\ninterdisciplinary research projects conducted in the areas of environmental chemistry,\r\nbiochemistry and biophysics, condensed matter physics and materials science,\r\nelectrochemistry, paleontology and geochemistry. While the disciplines affected by this\r\nstate-of-the-art instrumentation vary, the intellectual merits of these research projects are\r\nconsistent in that they each advance a field of basic scientific research, and they each\r\ninvolve significant opportunities for undergraduate training in doing so. Additionally,\r\nmost of the research projects proposed will strengthen interdisciplinary connections\r\nbetween two or more research groups.\r\nIon beam analysis techniques that will be available with this instrumentation include\r\nmicroPIXE, STIM and RBS, which allow characterization and quantitative measurement\r\nof elements on the surface of materials. Specific examples of the work to be pursued with\r\nthis instrumentation include direct measurement of anthropogenic metals in the lake\r\nsediment and quantitative assessment of metals in protein gel assays. Other projects will\r\nsimply use the analytical tools provided by this instrumentation to further the\r\nunderstanding of materials developed on campus or to solve problems that cannot be\r\nanswered by other methods. Examples of this include characterization of amorphous\r\nnitrite films for optical and electronic devices and phthalocyanine films for use in\r\nelectrochemical sensors, or studying the chemical surroundings of dinosaur bones\r\nbetween the time of their death and their discovery as fossils.\r\nIn addition to these valuable research contributions that become possible with this\r\ninstrumentation, the broader impact of this proposal includes the training of\r\nundergraduate students in some of the state-of-the-art analytical methods employed in\r\nphysics, chemistry, biology, geology and environmental science. What is novel about this\r\nparticular instrumentation is that it will form a common tool that multidisciplinary teams\r\nof undergraduates (and their research mentors) will use together to solve complex\r\nresearch problems. In addition, it is anticipated that companies will be able to obtain\r\nsophisticated materials analysis from this facility occasionally, which will help local\r\nindustries stay competitive.\r\n",
