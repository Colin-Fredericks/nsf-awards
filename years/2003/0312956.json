 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed applications comprising components from multiple\r\nadministrative domains, pose scalability and availability challenges\r\nbecause of the lack of a central administrative authority.  This\r\nproject investigates, in the context of the Web Services architecture,\r\nwhether application-level intelligence on the network path between\r\nclients and services can help address these challenges. The\r\nintelligence is embodied in modules for inspecting client traffic,\r\nmaking decisions about service actions such as replication, request\r\nredirection, or admission control, and finally realizing these\r\nactions.  The project combines a system architecture for executing\r\nservice-specific actions at intermediate routing nodes with\r\napplication-neutral algorithms for servicing client requests closer to\r\nthe network edge.  Both the architecture and the algorithms work with\r\na semantic framework, which treats service requests as structured\r\naccesses against a (physical or virtual) database.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the activity include (1) development of\r\nnovel techniques and algorithms for automatically scaling\r\ncomponent-based services in response to adverse client and network\r\nload conditions; and (2) investigation of architectures for securely\r\nand efficiently realizing service-specific actions on client requests\r\ncloser to the network edge.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the activity include (1) techniques for improving\r\nthe resilience of the nation's cyber-infrastructure against malicious\r\nattacks; and (2) integration of the research results into an\r\nundergraduate-level course that will train students to build\r\ncomponent-based distributed systems.\r\n",
