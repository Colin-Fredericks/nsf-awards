 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties  of  molten  minerals  become  more  and  more  important  for\r\nunderstanding  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the  Earth's interior, as\r\ncrystalline minerals have been much more extensively studied. This proposal\r\nwill  take  the advantage of new experimental capabilities at synchrotron\r\nbeamlines to study molten minerals, and to explore new possibilities at the\r\ncommunity  owned  facilities.  The proposed research activities include: 1)\r\nMeasuring  the  density  of  molten  Fe-FeS  system  at  high pressures and\r\ntemperatures  2) Observing Fe and H alloying at high pressure and measuring\r\ndensity  of  Fe-H  melt. 3) Exploring the reality of density measurements of\r\nmolten silicates. The project will use a multi-anvil press for pressure and\r\ntemperature  generation,  and  monochromatic  x-ray  radiography  and x-ray\r\nabsorption  simulation  for  melt  density  measurements at high pressures.\r\nResults  of density measurements on the iron alloy system will \r\nprovide essential\r\ninformation  for understanding Earth's core composition and robust data for\r\nfuture  DAC  melt  density  measurement development to advance the pressure\r\nrange  up  to  core conditions. The materials to be studied in this project are\r\nnot  limited to core minerals. This research will also include \r\nexploring the possibility of measuring iron-rich silicate melts. \r\nCollaborations and technical developments will be\r\nbrought  into  the  project  as  the  research  proceeds.  All  of  the new\r\nexperimental  capabilities  developed  at  synchrotron x-ray beamlines as a\r\nresult  of  this  project  will  be  open  to  the community for scientific\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
