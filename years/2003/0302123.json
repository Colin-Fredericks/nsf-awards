She will develop a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that will predict the observable spectro-polarimetric features of the newest supernova explosion models. Increases in computing capabilities have encouraged the development of three-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion models at the nation's largest supercomputer centers. The validity of such models and their fundamental assumptions can only be tested, however, by direct comparison with observations. Her calculations will facilitate the testing of these models against the recently available spectro-polarimetric observations of supernova ejecta on 8-m class telescopes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her research, Dr. Hoffman will pursue a three-pronged plan to foster the development of a local support network for women in the physical sciences at all educational levels. She will (a) organize a new student orientation for first-year female students intending to major in physical sciences at UC Berkeley, (b) forge partnerships between the University and the local community by arranging opportunities for female physical science students at UC Berkeley to participate in existing Bay Area educational and outreach programs aimed at girls' science education, and (c) sponsor a colloquium series that will bring female scientists to the UC Berkeley campus to speak about their research and to network with their female colleagues.\r\n***",
