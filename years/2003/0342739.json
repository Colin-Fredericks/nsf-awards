 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a workshop that brings together educators from the military academies, the Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, and the commercial sector to facilitate discussion, definition, and planning for a National Cyber Defense Exercise. Such an exercise will provide civilian universities significant educational benefits related to computer network security, as has already been demonstrated by experience with the service academies Cyber Defense Exercise. This workshop determines the structure of such an exercise among several civilian universities, using lessons learned from the originators of the original exercise at the United States Military Academy (West Point). Funds for this workshop cover a meeting of a small steering committee prior to the workshop, and production a report about the workshop and communicating those results to appropriate audiences. This resultant workshop designed to allow multiple independent universities to use the Exercise as a supporting tool in developing their own creative and original solutions to teaching and research about computer security and information assurance. And the Exercise will broaden the knowledge and expertise about defending computer security beyond the students at the military institutions.\r\n",
