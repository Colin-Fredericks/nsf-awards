The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include University of Missouri Kansas City (Lead Institution), University of Missouri Outreach and Extension, University of Missouri Rolla, Washington University, Missouri Department of Agriculture, Missouri Department of Economic Development, U.S. Small Business Administration, Missouri Small Business Development Centers, Boeing Company, Prolog Ventures, Wilkinson Evans Consulting; Missouri Biotechnology Association, Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute, Ewing Marion Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership.\r\n\r\nThe University of Missouri and its partners provide a solid critique of the conventional, linear model of technological innovation and suggest an alternative social network model for study. The hypothesis states that within the social network theory, innovation is an outcome of interaction between financial, human, social, and physical capital. Within this framework, the effort examines the role of social capital in the process of technological innovation. The investigators will create an electronic 'innovation information infrastructure' that will provide access to technology and business resources, and to then monitor interactions and conduct surveys of participants to measure the relationship between types and levels of interaction and innovation.  A tool for predicting innovative behavior and the inputs to maximize innovation will be a major outcome. This model will also create the means for development of educational materials, databases and training focused on the innovation process. This program provides a linkage between creativity and new sources of economic growth. Findings will be used in real time to improve access to innovation resources and to generate new knowledge concerning the role of social capital in innovation.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe database and predictive model will improve the ability of universities to interact with industry and small businesses to increase innovation in the region. The resulting new business will provide long-term economic well-being for the region.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in developing a model for prediction of successful innovative behavior by all of the partners, i.e., universities, small businesses, venture capital funds, incubators, and regional and state government agencies. Economically distressed communities do not fully benefit from the activities of the national research enterprise and they often do not have the expertise to know how to promote innovation. This model and analytical tool can be adopted by other regions in the nation to promote innovation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity include the development of research-based educational materials and databases for K-16 digital libraries, partnerships among researchers and students for education and training and use of information technology and connectivity to enhance the factors responsible for innovation. Identifying the individuals critical to the region's innovation will allow the engagement of underserved individuals, groups and communities in science and engineering. The model will demonstrate the linkage between discovery and the societal benefits of creation of new wealth.\r\n",
