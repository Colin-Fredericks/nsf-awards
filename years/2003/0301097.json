 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has as its long-term goal the development of chemosensing molecules that bind metal ions and signal specific metal ion binding.  The specific aims of this study are to design and synthesize peptide derived macrocyclic ligands with an intrinsic fluorescent signal to indicate metal ion binding.  The strategy is to employ peptide based macrocycles incorporating intrinsic signalling molecules that display a fluorescence response.  The ion binding selectivities will be comparatively studied by NMR, CD, potentiometry and fluorescence techniques.  Ground state properties of these macrocycles, in the solid state as well as in solution, will be investigated by X-ray diffraction methods, NMR and conformational analysis.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor Maria Ngu-Schwemlein of Southern University.  Professor Ngu-Schwemlein proposes to study the interactions between metal ions and small molecules that are modeled on proteins.  With a detectable interaction between these molecules and specific ions, applications toward ion selective sensors, ion chromatography, and metal ion detoxification will be possible.\r\n",
