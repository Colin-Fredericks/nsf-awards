The proposed research concentrates on automorphic\r\ndistributions, a technique he has been investigating with Wilfried Schmid\r\n(Harvard University).  They hope to use these distributions to develop\r\nsummation formulas, similar to Poisson's and Voronoi's, whereby arbitrary\r\nsums weighted by modular form coefficients and additive twists can be\r\ndualized.  The PI plans to investigate various applications of the\r\ndistributions and these summation formulas.  Many concern developing new\r\nconstructions for automorphic L-functions, in particular approaches for\r\nwhich archimedean and ramified computations are possible.  Another is to\r\nproblems in analytic number theory, such as the subconvexity problem for\r\ncusp forms on GL(n).  The PI also plans to refine a numerical algorithm\r\nwhich identifies modular forms, by reversing summation formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of automorphic forms slices across many important areas of\r\nmodern mathematical research, including number theory, representation\r\ntheory, geometry, analysis, and mathematical physics. Through L-functions,\r\nLanglands has conjectured many deep and interesting structural\r\nrelationships between automorphic forms which have implications in the\r\nabove areas. As an example, the work of Wiles et al demonstrates the link\r\nbetween certain automorphic forms and the ancient problem of solving\r\nequations between squares and cubes. The proposed research aims to apply\r\nand develop new tools for automorphic forms and L-functions from analysis,\r\nwhich is the branch of mathematics expanding calculus, and representation\r\ntheory, the concrete study of symmetry. Current applications of\r\nautomorphic forms and L-functions are manifest in constructing the\r\nsophisticated codes which enable high-speed and secure transactions over\r\nthe internet.\r\n\r\n",
