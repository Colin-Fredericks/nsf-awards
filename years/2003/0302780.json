 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our faculty team from Greenville Technical College in collaboration with faculty members from Clemson University have developed and implemented an interactive virtual reality (VR) model of the aircraft inspection maintenance process for asynchronous delivery. Our model has emphasized the curriculum development and workplace preparedness needed by modern aircraft maintenance technology for local, state and national audiences. Our effort has brought together a multidisciplinary team including a two-year technical college, research university, high schools and industry. Our participants have expertise in aircraft maintenance technology education, VR, human/machine systems design, inspection and maintenance processes in aviation, asynchronous learning and curriculum assessment with demonstrable results from previous NSF, FAA and NASA grants. Moreover, we have had the resources of the Advanced Technology Systems Laboratory and Virtual Reality Eye Tracking Laboratory at our disposal. The industry partners contributed experienced practitioners, a diversity of inspection tasks and test beds for integrating our VR products. This innovative approach is the first effort to extend tested VR technology to the aircraft maintenance technology curriculum in a two-year college. Existing approaches have not been able to mimic accurately the complexity of the aircraft maintenance process, reporting limited transfer capabilities and student preparedness for the workplace. The outcome of our collective efforts have lead to the following: an innovative, high-impact model for curriculum application in aircraft maintenance technology for college students and industry employees; an increased workplace pool of aircraft maintenance technicians prepared for the transition from learning to workforce; recruiting and mentoring material to attract under-represented groups to aircraft maintenance technology; a program providing the use of VR technology as a pedagogical tool; and a national model for collaboration among research institutions, community colleges, industry and high schools. Most importantly, this effort has integrated deliverables from on-going research funded by NASA and FAA in the use of advanced technology and virtual reality to improve the aircraft inspection and maintenance processes.",
