 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Vicki Wysocki at the University of Arizona to \r\ndesign  and  construct  an  improved  quadrupole-time-of-flight  (Q-TOF)  tandem  mass  spectrometer (MS-MS) designed to include two complementary activation methods, surface-induced dissociation (SID; surface target) and collision-induced dissociation (CID; gaseous target).  Two biological measurement challenges that will be addressed by the proposed instrument are (1) protein identification from complex mixtures with improvements  in  numbers  of  total  correct  identifications  and  (2)  analysis  of glycoconjugates, specifically  glycosphingolipids,  from  complex  mixtures  without  prior  deglycosylation.  The  proposed instrument will consist of the following components: a combination ion source (atmospheric MALDI and micro/nanoESI);  a  quadrupole  mass  analyzer  to  select  ions  of  interest  for  activation;  a  surface  for surface-induced  dissociation;  a  hexapole  for  collision-induced  dissociation  or  for  trapping  of  surface-activated ions; and an orthogonal TOF chamber for analysis of product ions produced by CID or SID.  This project will result in an instrument with  several enhanced  capabilities  and  in  an  excellent training experience for project members. The instrument will provide high sensitivity, flexibility in ion activation, a  high duty  cycle,  high  resolution  and  high  mass  accuracy  for  product  ions,  and  fast acquisition of spectra (compatible with microcapillary LC introduction into the ESI source).  Successful development of this instrument will have a significant impact on proteomics research.\r\n",
