 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of mathematical models\r\nfor partially ordered  materials. The focus is on electro-magnetic, electro-optical, \r\nand electro-mechanical interactions, emphasizing  ferroelectric and piezoelectric \r\nresponses in smectic liquid crystals and elastomers and flux pinning in superconductors.\r\nUnderstanding these interactions is central to the design process where\r\none strives to make smaller, faster, and more accurate devices. Liquid crystals \r\nand elastomers are used to make optical switches, nano devices, and displays. They  have \r\nalso been used by physicists to model artificial muscles. Superconductors are used\r\nfor power transmission and to make extremely strong magnets. A hierarchy of mathematical\r\nproblems will be considered for each material taking into account increasingly \r\ncomplex interactions. Special emphasis will be given to scaling-up from\r\nmeso-scale models where the physical interactions are delineated to macro-\r\nscale models used in applications. The PI seeks to find qualitative features of\r\nsolutions for the models. In superconductivity the PI will try to exhibit solutions\r\nwith large stationary currents (pinned currents). One reason for the interest in \r\nsmectic liquid crystals is the dramatic decrease in switching times between optical \r\nstates relative to those for dielectric liquid crystals . A major\r\ngoal here is to estimate these switching times for the models considered. \r\nTechniques from mathematical modeling, partial differential equations, and finite \r\r\nelasticity will be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  proposed research centers on the study mathematical models for  electro--mechanical \r\r\nand electro-optical interactions in liquid crystals and models describing the \r\r\nelectro--magnetic properties of superconductors. With regard to liquid crystals, the \r\r\napplications that we address are motivated by optical and biological systems and focuses on \r\r\nthe design of optical switches and  nanodevices, including detectors, actuators, and \r\r\nvalves. These applications are found in a wide range of products such as artificial muscles \r\nand liquid crystal displays for monitors. The development and analyses of analytic models \r\r\nfor these materials serves as an important  complement to  experimental investigations \r\r\ncarried out by materials scientists and physicists. An example of the phenomena we are \r\r\naddressing  is switching times in liquid crystal displays. Recent studies using smectic \r\r\nliquid crystals show a dramatic decrease in switching times between optical states, \r\r\nrelative to those for standard (nematic) liquid crystals. We study a hierarchy of \r\r\nmathematical problems  for these materials, taking into account increasingly complex \r\r\ninteractions with the goals of capturing the correct physics and to accurately estimate and \r\r\ncompare the switching times for the models considered.",
