 "awd_abstract_narration": "The over-arching goal of this project is to increase science literacy of general education learners who may not become scientists. The specific goal of this project is to create a well-researched oceanography course, live and online, widely disseminated, with a modern inquiry based pedagogy. The design focuses on science literacy using real earth data, collaboration between learners, and a strong connection to societal issues. The project is based on a successful NSF CCLI pilot project that supported the creation of software and course materials that enables online auto-graded homework assignments, scientific writing activities, on demand grade calculation, and peer interaction, with powerful instructor assessment capability. It has been tested, refined, and evaluated in two live oceanography classes at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). New capability is being created to support the fully online course with collaborative projects with strong peer to peer interactions. An instructor team consists of faculty from four California community colleges, two California state colleges, two large state universities (not including UCSB), and a small private college. Yearly workshops support team collaboration and dissemination of technology and pedagogy. Major themes include the integration of technology in education and faculty development. This project is having an impact on teacher education and diversity through the composition of the project team, some of whom have been active in teacher preparation and/or teach at campuses with a diverse student population.\r\n",
