The goals of the REU site are to (1) provide ten undergraduates of chemical engineering or allied fields with a unique research opportunity; (2) provide American Indians, women, and other under-represented groups a working knowledge of research in chemical engineering as a career path; (3) provide an opportunity to gain research experience in an international setting; (4) enhance students' critical thinking and communication skills (including written, oral, listening, and audio/visual presentation skills); (5) increase the students' interest in graduate studies with a target of 30% of participants pursuing graduate degrees; (6) introduce students to the 'beyond the classroom' experience in a research setting; and (7) enhance the students' ability to think independently. At least 30% of the students will be recruited from Tribal, four-year, and community colleges and universities from the four surrounding states of Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming, where research opportunities historically have been lacking. \r\n",
