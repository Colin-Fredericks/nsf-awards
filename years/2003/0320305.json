Khan, Tuskegee University\r\n\r\n\r\nExtensive efforts are currently underway to develop ultra efficient engine technology. Factors being evaluated are fuel efficiency, noise and environmental impact. The interaction between stator and rotor blades in the compressor (and turbine) greatly influence these factors. Of the many variables, the clearance between the rotor blade tip and the casing has been cited to have the most significant impact on engine fuel efficiency and noise. Extensive experimental and numerical efforts have been directed towards a better understanding of the flow field in the tip region in order to desensitize engine design to the influences of the rotor tip clearance. The recent use of swept blades has introduced further complexities in the flow in this region. Earlier investigations have reported that the axial strain rates generated due to the sweep impact the vortical structures in a blade-hub juncture. The instrumentation procured under this grant will be used to investigate the influence of axial strains rates on the flow physics of the tip clearance region. The 2DPIV system and water tunnel acquired under this proposal will be utilized to map the flow field of such a configuration. Mean and turbulent characteristics of the flow in tip clearance region would be analyzed to understand the physics. The impact of changes in sweep and clearance would also be studied. The influence of relative motion between the blade and simulated casing would also be documented. \r\nThe availability of this research instrumentation at Tuskegee University will enable the faculty to conduct competitive research.  Involvement of students at Tuskegee University in fluid mechanics research and exposure to modern measurement techniques of fluid phenomena would be an extremely beneficial consequence of this instrumentation. Other laboratory courses in the Aerospace Science Engineering Department will also utilize the instrumentation to strengthen theoretical concepts for undergraduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
