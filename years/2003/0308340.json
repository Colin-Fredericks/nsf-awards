 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the use of state-of-the-art techniques for retrieving cloud optical properties, utilizing both in-situ and satellite data from the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) to quantify the first and second indirect effects of aerosols on clouds, that is  the effects on cloud albedo and on cloud lifetime. The principal research objectives are to: (a) retrieve and collocate liquid water path, effective radius, cloud number concentration, and cloud thickness data; (b) develop and validate a technique for drizzle/rain detection using the ratio of the liquid water path derived from microwave brightness temperatures to the liquid water path derived from solar reflectances; (c) estimate the interrelated terms that determine cloud particle size, and use them to assess aerosol indirect radiative effects, and (d) extend the methodology to satellite measurements to gain better temporal and spatial coverage.\r\n\r\nThe modeling community will benefit from a better quantification of aerosol indirect effects. Further, the synergetic use of different airborne instruments is a necessary step before combining data from similar spaceborne instruments and developing cloud products. \r\n\r\nOne post-doc and one graduate student will also receive scientific guidance and training during their contribution to this study. The project also promotes collaboration between Florida State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",
