This four-day workshop and symposium has been offered annually since 1997 at COMB facilities in the Columbus Center, Baltimore, MD. NSF support will enable the COMB to conduct the workshop and symposium from July 21 to July 24, 2003The \"Extremophile Research: Theory and Techniques Workshop and Symposium\" includes a three-day intensive laboratory workshop and a one-day symposium. The one-day symposium brings experts from various areas of extremophile research together to discuss the current state of knowledge on growth, ecology, biochemistry and genetics of hyperthermophiles, extreme halophiles and anaerobic methanogens. The three-day laboratory workshop includes lectures, blocks of hands-on experiments, and demonstrations focusing on specialized techniques used to study these groups of microorganisms. NSF support provides scholarships to facilitate the attendance of faculty from small colleges and universities who will introduce these approaches into their teaching curricula, as well as post-doctoral and graduate students who are interested in working in areas of extremophile research. \r\n",
