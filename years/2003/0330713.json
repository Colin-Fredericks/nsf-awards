 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wheeled mobile robots belong to a class of complex interconnected mechanical systems, which includes existing and emerging new applications in autonomous systems in the air, on the ground, and under the water. As the performance requirements on these control systems get more stringent, the existing nonlinear control theories, mostly developed for general nonlinear systems, are found to be inadequate. A possible solution would be to develop new control theories for a special class of systems, which is yet broad enough to encompass wide range of practical engineering systems, by fully exploiting the system inherent dynamical characteristics. A class of complex interconnected mechanical systems is such a special class of system. To gain insight into the underlining system dynamics and its inherent structures, it is proposed in this SGER project to study the dynamics of wheeled mobile robots as an example. The following problems are addressed: (a) dynamical modeling of mobile robots considering the nonlinear characteristics of the terrain-tire interactions for different motorization and different configuration, and (b) dynamical analysis of mobile robots by exploiting the inherent geometric structure of the interconnection of the mechanical components and the nature of the interaction of the mobile robot with the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of the proposed research will (a) lay a firm foundation for developing advanced nonlinear control theories for a class of complex interconnected mechanical systems, therefore contributing to the advancement of state-of-the-art technology in high performance control of spacecraft, aircraft, underwater vehicles and land-based vehicle; (b) add new tools and techniques to the repertoire of analysis of nonlinear system dynamics; (c) provide new avenues for developing path planning algorithms for sensor based navigation, thus facilitating the transition of autonomous mobile robots from research laboratory to practical applications in important areas of national interest and commercialization; and (d) provide systematic guidelines in improving or designing new mechanical platforms for mobile robots.\r\n\r\n",
