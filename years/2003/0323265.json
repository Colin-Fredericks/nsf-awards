 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study uses the case of Northern Ireland to examine the effect of the Internet on efforts\r\nto build a democratic polity in a deeply divided society with an historical problem of democratic\r\nrepresentation. The Internet both exacerbates problems of community detachment and opens\r\nnews opportunities for communication. Northern Ireland provides an excellent site for this\r\nexploration of information technology and democracy because the region combines a long history\r\nof Western parliamentary politics, a rich free press tradition, and a developed economy with\r\nlong-term political divisions characterized by violence and segmented communities. This research\r\nwill move forward the relatively undeveloped literature on the Internet and democracy by\r\ncharting out the patterns of the heterogeneous effects of the Internet on political and religious\r\ndialogue and conflict. In moving between the fields of science and technology studies,\r\nparticularly its participation and design focus, and media studies, especially regarding the impact\r\nof media, the project will examine in detail the relationship between technology and democracy in\r\na multi-ethnic society. As a result, this study will examine the potential impact of the Internet\r\nfrom the creation and design of web sites through user experiences in comparison to other\r\ncommunications technologies. The project uses interviews and archival research to explore how the construction and use of web sites reveal interpretations of a multi-ethnic democracy, and how the Internet compares with other media in representing political views of a multi-ethnic democracy. The larger concern of the project in focusing on the fragility of democracy in a multi-ethnic society is the potential of\r\ntechnology to reduce divisions that give rise to violence. This project will contribute to an\r\nanalysis of democracy, technological development, and multi-ethnic societies.",
