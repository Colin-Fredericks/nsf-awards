 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program seeks to build, through the American Educational Research Association, an educational education statistical analysis infrastructure to conduct scientific quantitative studies of education policy and practice. The program awards small grants of $15 to $35 thousand to researchers for field initiated studies and awards fellowships for researchers to reside in federal agencies while conducting statistical studies. The focus of this\r\n grant is the building of capacity to conduct analysis of large-scale national and international datasets. The proposal includes activities for funding Federal Agency Fellows, Postdoctoral Fellows, Small Grants, Training, Grants, and Think Tanks for issues of concern to federal agencies. The grants are administered by an active Governing Board composed of 17 prominent researchers from a wide range of fields related to education, science, mathematics, and psychology.",
