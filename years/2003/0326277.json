 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Internet usage increasingly penetrates all aspects of society,\r\nsecurity concerns increasingly rise in importance.  As one moves from\r\nmerely hosting web sites to supporting electronic commerce, banking,\r\nauctions, health-care, and voting, the ability to prevent malicious\r\noutsiders, or even malicious insiders, from gaining confidential\r\ninformation or manipulating the system becomes increasingly critical.\r\nLooking to the future, one can expect the evolution of even more complex\r\nsystems, such as digital rights management systems and elaborate single\r\nsign-on web services, with correspondingly complex security\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nCryptography is an essential tool for implementing secure distributed\r\nsystems over the Internet: no other technology provides the required\r\nconfidentiality, authentication, or other security properties.\r\n\r\nYet using cryptography effectively is surprisingly difficult.  While\r\nthere are good candidates for the underlying basic cryptographic\r\noperations (encryption, digital signatures, etc.), such cryptographic\r\nprimitives by themselves are not sufficient: they need to be utilized\r\nwithin a larger framework---a cryptographic protocol---specifying\r\nexactly how they are to be used in a multi-party distributed system. The\r\nability to design and prove secure a cryptographic protocol for a given\r\npurpose is essential to the secure evolution of our Internet-based\r\nsociety; yet our tools for doing so are still surprisingly awkward and\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nAt the highest level of description, this proposal aims to remedy this\r\nsituation by providing tools and techniques that facilitate the easy\r\ndesign and analysis of secure cryptographic protocols.\r\n\r\nToday, there are two major approaches to protocol design.  The first is\r\na formal approach pioneered by Dolev and Yao, based on theorem-proving\r\nand model-checking.  This approach offers surprisingly good design\r\ntools, but at present this approach has a very limited domain of\r\napplicability, and furthermore the limitations on what an adversary is\r\nallowed to do in this approach make the analysis only suggestive, rather\r\nthan conclusive, in practice.  (That is, a ``proof of security'' for a\r\nprotocol in this formal model doesn't necessarily imply that the\r\nprotocol will be secure in practice.)  The second approach is based on\r\ncomputational complexity; this approach offers solid conclusions, since\r\nthe adversary is not unreasonably restricted, but is very difficult to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of proposed research: The most significant research\r\ndirection proposed here is to build strong effective relationships\r\nbetween these two approaches, greatly expanding upon earlier seminal\r\nwork by Abadi and Rogaway, and more recently by Herzog, and then Herzog,\r\nMicali, and Liskov.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to provide methods so that one may use simplified formal\r\nmethods to design and analyze cryptographic protocols, with the\r\nconfidence that the result will be secure in the real world (that is,\r\nwhen realistic computational models and assumptions apply).  The formal\r\nmethods will be enlarged to handle many of the important ``details''\r\nordinarily not considered by formal methods, such as error handling and\r\nalgebraic identities.  Cryptographic techniques will be used to\r\n``force'' a real-world adversary to be no more powerful than his\r\n``formal'' counterpart.  The research will proceed by develping\r\n``compilation'' techniques that enable any protocol proven secure within\r\nthe formal model to be implemented securely in the ``real world'' (that\r\nis, within the computational model).\r\n\r\nThis research program is challenging; it requires an interdisciplinary\r\napproach as it crosses boundaries normally respected.  Furthermore, \r\ndeveloping ``generic'' techniques that apply to any protocol is\r\nnecessarily more challenging than the usual procedure of working on\r\nprotocols individually.\r\n\r\nBroad impact: The results of this research will not only advance the\r\nacademic state of the art, but will also provide practitioners with\r\neffective tools and technology for making Internet-based society\r\nincreasingly secure.  The simplifications resulting from the proposed\r\nresearch will also enable cryptographic protocols to be taught in an\r\neffective and secure manner to a larger circle of students and\r\nimplementers.\r\n",
