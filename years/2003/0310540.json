Our objectives are to increase students' interest in and understanding of psychology as a research-based field, to improve students' quantitative preparation and to provide opportunities for use of technology, and -- for majors and minors -- to enhance students' readiness for advanced courses by practice with key concepts of experimental design and familiarity with descriptive data analysis. The objectives of enhancing students' methodological and quantitative skills are in keeping with national pedagogical emphases on critical thinking and stronger preparation in scientific and technological areas. We are introducing active, inquiry-based laboratory experiences for students at the introductory level. The questions posed to the students are taken from various content areas within psychology.  We are also making use of recently published experiments in psychology by Hock (\"Forty Studies that Changed Psychology,\" NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2002) and the collection of experiments developed for use in the E-Prime software system.  However, the one theme that is consistently being carried across areas is the relation between biology and behavior. Few universities include laboratory sections in psychology at the introductory level. We model our project on the introductory course sequence and laboratory sections used at Reed College and are adapting their approach for the student population at Eastern Oregon.  Although we have different student populations, we have similar goals of increasing interest in research-based psychology and improving students' facility with quantitative and methodological skills. This project also matches our university's initiative to enhance training related to biotechnology as well as its overall goal of being a quality student-centered public liberal arts institution.   \r\n",
