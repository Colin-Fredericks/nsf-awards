 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Salmon Research Team:  A Native American Technology, Research and Science Career Exposure Program\" is a three-year, youth-based ITEST project submitted by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.  The project seeks to provide advanced information technology and natural science career exposure and training to 180 middle level and high school students.  Mostly first-generation college-bound students, the target audience represents the Native American community and those with Native American affiliations in reservation, rural and urban areas.  Students will investigate computer modeling of complex ecological, hydrological and geological problems associated with salmon recovery efforts.  Field experiences will be provided in three states:  Oregon, Washington and northern California.   The participation of elders and tribal researchers will serve as a bridge between advanced scientific technology and traditional ecological knowledge to explore sustainable land management strategies.   Students will work closely with Native American and other scientists and resource managers throughout the Northwest who use advanced technologies in salmon recovery efforts.\r\n\r\nStudent participation in IT-dependent science enrichment and research activities involving natural science fields of investigation will occur year round.  Middle school students are expected to receive at least 330 contact hours including a one-week summer research experience, a one-week spring break program, and seven weekends of residential programs during the school year.  The high school component consists of 460 contact hours reflecting one additional week for the summer research experience.  In addition to watershed and salmon recovery related research, students will be involved in other ancillary research projects.  A vast array of partners are positioned to support the field research experience including, for example, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Redwood National State Park, College of Natural Resources and Sciences at Humboldt State University, Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, University of Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Washington Columbia Basin Research project, the Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources at Chemeketa Community College and the Integrated Natural Resource Technology program at Mt. Hood Community College. \r\n\r\nThe project is intended to serve as a model for IT-based youth science programs that address national and state education standards and are relevant to the cultural experience of Native American students.  Two mentors will provide continued support to students:  an academic mentor at the student's schools and a professional mentor from a local university or natural resource agency.  Incentives will be provided for student participation including stipends and internships.  Career exposure and work-related skills are integrated throughout the project activities and every program component.  Creative strategies are used to encourage family involvement including, for example, salmon bakes and museum discounts.\r\n\r\n",
