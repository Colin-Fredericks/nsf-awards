 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Stipend Program supports recently initiated efforts to address the critical shortage of qualified\r\nscience and mathematics teachers in the Chicago Public Schools, particularly in urban areas of high need.\r\nIt builds on a successful partnership between CPS and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) that\r\noffers standards-based program opportunities for career-change candidates with strong science, technology,\r\nengineering and mathematics (STEM) backgrounds interested in becoming a certified teacher. This Noyce\r\nProject specifically features two such program opportunities: 1) the Middle Grades Science (MGS) and\r\nMiddle Grades Mathematics (MGM) Program, and 2) the Master of Science in Teaching Secondary School\r\nMathematics (MST) Program. Teacher candidates in the MGS/MGM Program earn an elementary school\r\ncertificate (K- 9) with a middle grades (5 - 8) endorsement in science or mathematics. It is an alternative\r\nroute program, with separate science and mathematics cohorts, offered through the College of Education.\r\nThe MST is a conventional secondary teacher preparation program (6-12) offered through the Department\r\nof Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. The beneficiaries of a Noyce Stipend Award are\r\ncareer-change candidates with strong academic abilities and STEM qualifications and demonstrated\r\nfinancial need, within the broader social commitment to preparing a diverse workforce of science and\r\nmathematics teachers prepared to address the needs of urban youth (Ladson-Billings, 1995). There are three specific objectives: 1) to enhance the recruitment of STEM candidates to the MGS/MGM and MST programs; 2) to support the retention of MGS/MGM candidates, given the documented need for heightened support for those entering through alternative certification routes across the first three years (CSMPT, 2001; Huling, Resta, & Rainwater, 2001); and 3) to redirect the MST student pipeline at UIC to teacher employment in CPS in high-need areas. These goals are being attained by awarding stipends to the appropriate students. The program includes two types of stipend awards: one to aid the recruitment of new candidates, and the other to assist with the retention of recently admitted candidates. \r\n\r\n",
