Brockwell\r\nTitle:\t\tApplied probability and Time Series modeling \r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nProperties and applications in finance of Levy-driven linear and non-linear continuous-time autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) processes will be investigated.  Questions concerning existence of stationary solutions for non-linear continuous-time models and relations between discrete-time models and their continuous-time analogues will also be addressed.  In discrete time, the stochastic stability of generalized linear versions of ARMA models will be studied with a view to modeling time series of counts.  Efficient estimation techniques for these models and for all-pass models driven by non-Gaussian noise will be developed.  The results for the latter processes will be applied to the problem of identification and estimation for non-causal and/or non-invertible ARMA models. \r\n\r\nIn the last decade there has been a widely recognized need for the development of new models and techniques for the analysis of time-series data from scientific, engineering, biomedical and financial applications.  Major features giving rise to this need include non-linearity, complex dependence structures and strong deviations from normality, with discrete-valued data arising in many genetic and biomedical applications.  In financial applications there is a need for continuous-time models exhibiting these characteristics.  The proposal addresses these needs, with the goal of enhancing scientific understanding of the physic and economic processes represented by the models.\r\n",
