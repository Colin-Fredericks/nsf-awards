This program will take a multidisciplinary approach utilizing experimental and numerical techniques to provide a research experience that encourages students to consider graduate studies and pursue careers in engineering research. Students will be recruited from colleges in the Great Lakes region and also nationwide, with a special focus on students that do not have access to research opportunities at their home institution and students from underrepresented groups. Activities will include a short course on computer-aided testing and simulation; an ethics workshop; an evaluation program; and other related professional and social activities that will allow a fuller appreciation of research opportunities and careers in academia. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.\r\n",
