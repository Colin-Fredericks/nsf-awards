Miller of the University of Mississippi Medical Center to help students and young investigators attend the 9th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative Immunology (ISDCI) to be held in St. Andrews, Scotland on June 29th-July 4th.  This congress convenes every three years and brings together the world's leading experts in developmental and evolutionary immunology.  This congress serves to foster collaborations and allows young investigators and students to meet some of the most renowned experts in the field. \r\nThe congress will include topics ranging from innate immunity, adaptive immunity and evolution all the way to environmental and ecological immunology.  The most significant developments presented at the congress will be published by Elsevier in the journal Developmental and Comparative Immunology.\r\nThese funds will be used to facilitate travel for students and junior faculty from U.S. institutions.\r\n",
