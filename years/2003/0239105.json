 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, we propose an intensive program to develop new controller design\r\nmethodologies for a variety of inherently nonlinear systems, and to apply the findings to\r\nthe control problems of underactuated mechanical systems, mobile robots with flex link,\r\nand other practical systems with various uncertainties. The systems under consideration do\r\nnot have a controllable linearization that is a common requirement of existing control\r\nschemes. Therefore, most of the control problems for these systems are still open and\r\nindeed bring new challenges to the control engineering. In this project, we concentrate on\r\nthe development of both theoretically sound and practically useful controller design\r\nschemes, which enable us to solve the difficult problems of global stabilization, adaptive\r\nregulation, and output feedback control, for inherently nonlinear systems that cannot be\r\nadequately controlled using the existing methods.\r\nOur primary approach relies on the adding a power integrator technique developed by the\r\nproposer and collaborators, which fully utilizes the nonlinearity of the systems to\r\neffectively control the inherently nonlinear systems. The recent research work based on\r\nthis tool has led to new solutions to a number of control problems for systems with\r\nuncontrollable linearization, and suggests that very promising advances can be achieved by\r\nthis research program.\r\nThe educational component of this CAREER development plan aims at developing and reshaping\r\ncourses, introducing innovative teaching techniques, mentoring undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents, setting up new laboratories, and creating research-oriented projects and\r\nhands-on experiments. With all these efforts, we believe that the research program can be\r\neffectively integrated into the academic curriculum of the University of Texas at San\r\nAntonio. Moreover, while exposing the students to state-of-the-art techniques, the\r\neducation plan will also help bridge the gap between theoretical research and engineering\r\npractice, and therefore stimulate students' interest in control engineering.",
