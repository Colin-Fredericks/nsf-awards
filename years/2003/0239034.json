 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project takes advantage of a powerful new coding technique called Group Coding (GC) pioneered in Phase I by Data Reliability Inc. (DRI), and an innovative storage system architecture called NetSTOR, to build a prototype for a highly available, reliable, high performance, application-friendly, and scalable network-based storage engine. The engine is multi-platform software that cost-effectively aggregates distributed islands of independent storage resources into a single virtual shared pool of storage. GC typically offers 6 to 27 times enhancement for encoding and 3.5 to 6.5 times enhancement for decoding. The NetSTOR approach is superior to commonly used data replication because it offers optimal redundancy leading to better resource (storage and bandwidth) utilization. NetSTOR is capable of aggregating the capabilities of multiple parallel storage nodes to get improved response times in both WAN and LAN environments. NetSTOR dramatically enhances the overall system throughput and exhibits perfect linear throughput scalability. \r\n      The NetSTOR engine serves as an enabling core storage technology. Applications can build on and benefit from the unique feature of this core. Many applications will exploit the competitive advantages of NetSTOR including storage virtualization, electronic software distribution, multimedia network-based services, modeling and simulation applications, data grids, document storage and delivery, distributed information retrieval, medical imaging, video on demand and terrain visualization. The GC technique pioneered by this project provides a new way of looking at and understanding existing array codes. This understanding will lead to the discovery of new codes and could result in significant scientific advances in coding theory. \r\nThe impact of Phase II is not limited to the technological and commercial merits. For this project, DRI is partnering with Jackson State University (JSU); therefore, the project will offer JSU students a tremendous educational experience. Since Jackson State University is an HBCU (Historically Black College and University), the project will set a precedent for continuous collaboration and will increase the participation of underrepresented and minority groups in science and technology.\r\n",
