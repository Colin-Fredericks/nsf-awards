 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to plan for a new multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and universities on technologies for wireless internet. This new multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the industry through having its existing resources enhanced by the addition of the partner that is also being recommended to receive a planning grant.  The two partners are this University and Polytechnic University of New York.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Center's goal is to work on two overlapping  categories: \r\n\r\n- Information delivery focussing on software development, addressing security and robustness, and\r\n- Data transmission related to management of radio resources and the management of competition and cooperation between  different technologies\r\n\r\nThe proposal deals with an area of significant need and by assembling the two institutions into one research team, the breadth and depth is enhanced \r\n",
