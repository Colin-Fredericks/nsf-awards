 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project the feasibility of integrating finite element method and neural network technologies in a reliability-based framework for assessing serviceability reliability of geotechnical structures such as braced excavation systems is explored.  A deep braced excavation in an urban area is a complex construction operation that often causes unacceptable ground movement and damage to adjacent buildings.  Reliability assessment of potential ground displacement and damage to adjacent buildings aids in the safe design and construction of such geotechnical structures.  The framework and procedures for conducting reliability assessment are established based on the results of reliability analyses.  Provisions for reliability updating using field monitoring/measurement data are also established.          \r\n\r\nIntellectually, this research may lead to a significantly improved method for design and construction of deep braced excavations that is both sound and safe for the environment.  The developed methodology, which integrates the finite element method, neural networks, and the observational method into a reliability-based framework, is considered innovative. This methodology, if successfully developed, represents a significant breakthrough in assessing reliability of complex geotechnical structures.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research are also significant.  First, this research is likely to result in an improved method for design and construction of deep braced excavation that is both sound and safe for the environment.  The results of the research may be adopted by the engineering community, and thus, contribute in a significant way to protecting the public and their properties.  Second, the results of the research will be disseminated broadly through a number of ways. Technology transfer, which is emphasized in this project, is an important element in the overall objective of integrating research and education.  Third, the proposed research will enhance the infrastructure for research at Clemson University through its strong national and international collaboration. Fourth, the proposed research will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in a significant way, by participation of a female engineering faculty from an undergraduate institution through a subcontract and a female postdoctoral research assistant at Clemson University, and by recruiting and mentoring graduate and undergraduate assistants from underrepresented groups.  Fifth and lastly, but equally important, the proposed research will advance the state of knowledge while promoting teaching, training, and learning by incorporating various activities that contribute to the overall objective of research and education integration. \r\n",
