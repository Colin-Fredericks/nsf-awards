One of the most \r\nimportant examples of a Hamiltonian T-space is the coadjoint orbit of a \r\ncompact Lie group. Coadjoint orbits arise in physics, as they are the \r\nset of all matrices with specified spectra. They also occur in \r\nrepresentation theory, as all irreducible representations of a complex \r\nreductive Lie group occur as holomorphic sections of a line bundle over \r\na coadjoint orbit. They occur in algebraic geometry as projective \r\nvarieties. The intersection theory of naturally arising subvarieties, \r\ncalled Schubert varieties, appears in questions of linear algebra, \r\nvaluation rings, and representation theory. Schubert calculus is \r\nimportant as it is the linear case for (and hence the first step \r\ntowards) understanding complex algebraic intersections more generally. \r\nAlgebraically, Schubert calculus analyses the multiplicative structure \r\nof the cohomology of flag varieties. The main open question is to find a \r\ntotally positive formula for the (equivariant) structure constants. In \r\njoint work with A. Knutson, Goldin has discovered new techniques that \r\ngive hope for a positive formula in certain cases. Goldin is also \r\ninterested in topological invariants that distinguish reduced spaces for \r\nany compact Hamiltonian T-space, such as certain ideals found in its \r\nequivariant cohomology ring or generalized equivariant Euler classes. \r\nGoldin is additionally developing techniques to calculate integrals on \r\ncertain symplectic reduced spaces using small amounts of information \r\nabout how the torus acts on the original symplectic manifold.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Schubert calculus is a small step towards the larger \r\nquestion of how to study intersections of algebraic varieties. Such \r\nintersections arise outside of mathematics, as scientists ask questions \r\nthat involve the concurrence of several physical constraints, and want \r\nto understand what possible solutions there may be. Symplectic geometry \r\nis a natural setting to describe physical systems. The space of the \r\nposition and the momentum of a particle, for example, is called \"phase \r\nspace\" and has a natural symplectic structure on it. In many cases, \r\nthere is a lot of symmetry; physical observations of the Hydrogen atom, \r\nfor example, are unaffected by the position of the observer a fixed \r\ndistance away from the particle. The study of \"reduced spaces\" is a way \r\nof studying the physics while simplifying the space by ignoring (in \r\nfact, dividing out) these symmetries. Much of Goldin's work involves \r\ntechniques to do computations on these simplified systems, which may \r\nshed light on questions that physicists and chemists are posing about \r\nmolecules and particles. Goldin is also writing a book (joint with G. \r\nGoldin) on myths in mathematics education.\r\n\r\n",
