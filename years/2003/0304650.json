 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Teams (NIRT) project is to establish an interdisciplinary research and education program in a new area of nanomanufacturing involving scalable processes for the fabrication of wide-band gap three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals (PC) possessing engineered defects and their integration into photonic devices and systems. New approaches are needed for the miniaturization and integration of optical components into compact functional systems capable of generating, processing, and detecting light signals. PCs have been recognized as one of the most promising technologies for this goal. However, the fabrication of 3D photonic ban gap (PBG) structures for the visible and IR spectrum remains a considerable challenge. This proposal presents techniques to fully realize the potential of the PC paradigm for industrial application and commercialization. The building blocks will be coated nanospheres. Periodic arrays of such metal-dielectric nanospheres present a wide, robust, and complete PBG. Traditionally unrelated techniques will be used to fabricate and integrate the PCs: atomic layer deposition (ALD), self-assembly of colloidal nanospheres, 3D femtosecond nanomachining, and lithographic processing. Self-assembly will be combined with anisotropic etching to pattern the PC on silicon wafers with controlled shape, thickness, orientation and location relative to other opt electronic components. Ultra short laser pulse nanomachining will be used to create well-defined defects.  Several characterization techniques will be implemented to analyze the composition, structure, and optical properties of the PC, and devices.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide a fundamental understanding of basic manufacturing processes and, if successful, will establish an unprecedented large-scale integrated-nanophotonics fabrication technology. Partnerships have been established with the National Institute of Standards and Technologies and with Agilent technologies laboratories.  Another objective of this project is to educate graduate and undergraduate students as well as the general public in the area of nanomanufacturing of photonic systems and its implications for society. The project will integrate education and outreach with research in nanomanufacturing processes to create the human infrastructure required for the development of nanophotonics technologies in the years to come. The program proposes the following specific activities: (1) to incorporate the outcome of research into graduate and undergraduate courses; (2) to coordinate a new interdisciplinary nanomanufacturing seminar series; (3) to organize outreach activities with graduate student participation, (d) to generate and maintain a dedicated website for the general public; (4) to interact with industry and national labs; and (5) to make available the developed infrastructure to other researchers.\r\n",
