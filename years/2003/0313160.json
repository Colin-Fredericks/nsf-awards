The networks are\r\nscalable in the sense that time, space and bandwidth resource costs\r\nfor all major operations are polylogarithmic in the number of nodes in\r\nthe network.  The networks are attack-resistant in the sense that most\r\nof the services are guaranteed to most of the participants, even after\r\nmassive adversarial attack.  The approach of this project is primarily\r\ntheoretical, i.e. algorithm design and analysis.  However, the project\r\nalso includes building prototype systems to empirically test the\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nThis project has potential for significant impact in other areas of\r\nresearch.  One major deliverable of the project is algorithms for\r\ncreating a p2p network which, even under attack, will enable sharing\r\nof massive data sets.  This type of network could have an impact on\r\nseveral scientific disciplines, including, physics (e.g. for projects\r\nlike GriPhyN), astronomy (e.g. for projects like Sloan Digital Sky\r\nSurvey), and biology (e.g. for projects like the Human Genome\r\nProject).  Another major deliverable of this project is algorithms for\r\ncreating a p2p network which, even under attack, will enable\r\ndistributed computation.  This type of network would allow scientific\r\nprojects to tap into idle desktop computers to efficiently and\r\nrobustly do lengthy computations.  Astronomy (e.g. for projects like\r\nSETI@home) and biology (e.g. for projects like FOLDING@home) are\r\nexamples of disciplines that would benefit from such a network.\r\nFinally, it is expected that the project will provide theoretical\r\ninsights into the problem of building robust embedded networks, which\r\nshare many similarities with p2p networks.\r\n",
