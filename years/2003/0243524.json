They plan to investigate the application of geophysical research tools in archeological research.  The test site is a 4th century Roman Fort and surrounding environs located in Humayma, Jordan.  One objective of this project is to correlate in detail the interpretations of geophysical data already collected in 2002, and others to be collected in 2003, with the results of archaeological excavations to be conducted in 2003 and 2004.  Planned excavations will focus on areas where geophysical interpretations clearly show subsurface structures as well as areas where there is no indication of structures. Thus, a quantitative calculation of both Type I and Type II errors in the application of near-surface geophysical techniques to archaeology at the site can be determined.  The second objective of this project is to advance the process of fusing geophysical data from different geophysical tools.  Satellite remote sensing tools will collect different bands of data to be combined in various ways to generate better images.  Preliminary research will be conducted to transfer this approach to a new methodology of geophysical data fusion.  Data from different geophysical tools will be mathematically combined to determine if more information can be obtained than would be available by only qualitatively combining data from each tool separately. \r\n\r\nScope:  In addition to support from NSF, support is provided from Canada for the archeological studies and part of the geophysical work, while the Jordanian Department of Antiquities will support their staff member for data collection.  The project represents an opportunity to leverage funds and resources from several different sources toward basic science objectives in geophysics and in anthropology, and to answer basic questions about the development of the settlements in the Humayma region.  The results will have applications and benefits to scientists in Jordan.  Three students at SUNY Buffalo will participate in this international collaboration.\r\n",
