Height functions\r\nfirst arose in connection with elliptic curves, and are ubiquitous in\r\nmodern number theory.  One of the goals of the project is to establish\r\nproperties of heights for arbitrary curves and arbitrary dynamical systems\r\nwhich are similar to those for elliptic curves. This will be approached by\r\nusing methods from potential theory.  Another goal is to establish\r\n\"p-adic\" analogues of results which are known to hold in the theory of\r\nmanifolds.  When completed, the project will reveal new connections\r\nbetween number theory, dynamical systems, and potential theory.  Funding\r\nfor this project will support the infrastructure of the University of\r\nGeorgia's number theory group, which has historically been very strong. \r\nThe project will impact both the graduate and undergraduate programs at\r\nUGA: some of the questions raised by this research will lead to PhD\r\ndissertation topics for graduate students, and others will provide an\r\nopportunity to involve undergraduate students in cutting edge mathematical\r\nresearch. \r\n",
