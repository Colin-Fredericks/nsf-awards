 "awd_abstract_narration": "\nThis action is to provide partial support for an International Workshop on Seismic \nStability of Tailings Dams, being jointly organized and sponsored by the National \nScience Foundation, the Office of Surface Mining (a bureau of the U.S. Department of \nthe Interior), and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (an agency within the \nDepartment of Labor). Tailings dams are the residue of the milling process used to \nextract materials of interest from mined ores. They are characterized by hydraulically \nplaced fills held in place by an embankment. Failure of tailings dams due to earthquakes \nhas occurred many times in the past in several Pacific Rim earthquake-prone countries, \ncausing significant loss of property and human lives, as well as severe environmental \nproblems. \nAccording to the most current data supplied to the National Inventory of Dams, there are \n860 coal-mining related dams in the United States. Of these, 232 are considered to have \na high hazard-potential by FEMA's hazard rating system, indicating that failure would be \nreasonably likely to result in loss of life and significant property damage. The vast \nmajority of these high-hazard-potential dams are coal refuse tailings dams located in the \nAppalachian Coal Field. A few are over 200 m (600 feet) high. Failure of such a \nstructure due to earthquake loading would be catastrophic. Even though considerable \nprogress has been made in seismic design and analysis of earth dams, little research has \nbeen conducted on the seismic stability of tailings dams. Past research has shown that \ncoal waste materials have mechanical properties quite different from that of most soils. \nThe structure and construction method of tailings dams are very different from \nconventional earth dams. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research to investigate \nthe stability of tailings dams under earthquake loading, and to develop seismic design \nprocedures suitable for this unique type of structure. \nThis workshop will bring together US and international experts to discuss the critical \nissues involved. The objectives are: 1) to summarize the current state-of-the-art, and the \nstate-of-the-practice in the design and seismic analyses of tailings dams; 2) to identify \nresearch needs; 3) to facilitate communication and collaboration between researchers, \ngovernment regulatory agencies, and practicing engineers. \nWithin the limits of the required expertise, the organizers will include underrepresented \nminorities. The workshop will be hosted by the Department of Civil Engineering, Case \nWestern Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio on 22-23 May 2003. The workshop \nproceedings will be posted online on the workshop web site and the web sites of the \ngovernment regulatory agencies.",
