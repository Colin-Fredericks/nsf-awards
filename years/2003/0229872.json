 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, CA, will develop a three-pronged project called \"Round and Round\" focused on the geometry, science and technology of circles and wheels.  All three project products (one permanent and one traveling version of a 2000-sq. ft. exhibition; an array of complementary educational programs for children ages 3-10; and published research on patterns of interactions among families of diverse backgrounds in museum settings) will be developed in cooperation with developmental psychologists from the University of California at Santa Cruz and advisors from Latino and Vietnamese communities in San Jose.  \"Round and Round\" exhibits and programs will offer a trans-cultural, gender-neutral, and multi-disciplinary look at the ingenuity and ubiquity of circles.  Together they will provide a comprehensive array of interactive experiences that help children, ages 3-10, and adults explore the mathematics, physics, physical properties and engineering advantages of circles and wheels.  The project is expected to serve three million visitors in science and children's museums across the nation within four years of implementation.\r\n",
