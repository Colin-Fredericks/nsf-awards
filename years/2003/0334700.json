 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is proposed for minority/HBCU undergraduate student travel assistance for the 2003 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference.  The conference, which has been held twice previously, brings together researchers focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to electronic, magnetic and photonic devices and systems.  The requested support will be used to provide travel and per-diem stipends for minority undergraduate students who wish to enhance their educational experience and develop an understanding of  nanotechnology by attending the conference.  Priority will be given to those undergraduate minority students involved in nanotechnology programs through summer research experiences and other extracurricular projects.  The broader impact of the proposed program includes involvement of minority undergraduate students in a technical conference hosted by a major professional society.  In addition to technical exposure, this experience will provide the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers involved in the nanotechnology field and will provide minority undergraduate students a more informed background with which to make decisions regarding future studies.",
