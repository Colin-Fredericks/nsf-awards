He will carry out a multi-faceted campaign of observations and theoretical studies to study intracluster stars, i.e. stars between the galaxies within galaxy clusters. Intracluster starlight can be a valuable tool in understanding the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, but it has been difficult to detect, and its detailed structure is still unknown. The campaign will consist of imaging and spectroscopic observations of hundreds of intracluster planetary nebulae in nearby galaxy clusters and groups to perform dynamical studies, ultra-deep imaging observations to produce global measurements of the intracluster light in more distant clusters, and theoretical analysis of high resolution numerical simulations of galaxy clusters, designed to obtain observable predictions. This effort will determine the fraction, distribution, and metallicity of the intracluster starlight, and connect its properties to cosmological models and known properties of galaxy evolution. \r\n\r\nIn addition to his research, Dr. Feldmeier will develop a career course for astronomy undergraduate majors.  This course will encourage early research and thoughtful self directed career development. In addition, he will continue an ongoing outreach program towards the unique population of homeschooled children. In an effort to overcome obstacles towards promoting astronomical literacy in this population, Dr. Feldmeier will produce a flexible web based curriculum and educational publications. \r\n***",
