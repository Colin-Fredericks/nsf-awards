An organizing committee will meet to develop a framework for capturing what can be learned from current research followed by a conference in Washington, DC for representatives for each site that participated in a research study.  The intent is to bring together researchers and implementers to discuss perspectives and evidence of the impact of systemic reform.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe aim of the conference is to use findings from research to determine if systemic reform was effective in narrowing the achievement gap among subpopulations of students.  Thus, by looking at the impact of the building a better education infrastructure and on assessing the impact on teaching and learning science and mathematics, the results can be used to advance methodologies and in identifying reliable measures for gauging progress of system wide reform.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nHorizon, Inc. envisions that the outcomes from the conference to be useful in guiding the science and mathematics community and assisting those who do research on large-scale science and mathematics programs.  Moreover, jointly synthesizing the studies in one place will enhance their overall use while building a consensus framework and instruments of demonstrated reliability and validity are likely to be used by other researchers nationally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
