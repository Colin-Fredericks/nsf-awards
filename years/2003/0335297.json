 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will investigate a broad class of packet-based network architectures, protocols, and services where the core switch/route fabric has limited or no buffering capability. These networks - called mbuffered networks - have two distinguishing features. First, packet loss due to contention is treated as an erasure that can be corrected via coding techniques. Information is encoded into code words and each codeword is divided into fragments. The redundancy built into the codeword acts like a \"virtual buffer\" that mitigates contention and packet loss so that if several of the codeword fragments are erased as they pass through the network, there is still a high probability that the information within the codeword can be decoded correctly at the destination. Adaptive flow control can be implemented by adjusting the coding overhead (code rate) as well as the fragment generation rate. The second distinguishing feature is the robustness with respect to hardware and routing failures. In particular, different codeword fragments belonging to the same codeword can be sent using different routes within the network to increase resilience. Route diversity also provides unique security and authentication features.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is the exploration of new architectural approaches that use little or no buffering in high-speed networks where buffers are becoming increasingly difficult to implement.  Results of this project will impact research directions in optical systems technology, and increase the base of knowledge in communication systems theory. The project will provide unique training of both undergraduate and graduate students in a systems-oriented multi-disciplinary effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
