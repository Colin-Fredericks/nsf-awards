 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to use advanced materials and microfabrication techniques to produce a micro-opticalelectrical system (MOEMs) gyroscope. The innovation uses both self-assembled silicon quantum dot nano-composites and a unique poled plasma polymer to produce micro-photonic structures suitable for construction of a solid-state equivalent of a fiber optic gyroscope (FOG). Typically, in a MEMs or micro-optical-electrical-mechanical system (MOEMs),  a reduction in size is often accompanied by a reduction in precision. The proposed technology provides the high levels of FOG precision in the compact, low cost MOEMs format. We propose to construct the photonic portion of an optical gyroscope using linear self assembled quantum confined silicon nanocomposites and non linear, stable poled polymers including spiral waveguide arrays to produce significant optical path lengths in a compact form. The compact spiral waveguide structures, which possess long optical path length, can be used for replacement of the optical fiber coil in a FOG and other applications such as biophotonics. The nano-composite materials permit deposition of thin films with varying in plane index of refraction (VIPIR) that achieve performance levels of conventional fiber optic gyros to be constructed in miniature, on chip waveguide optical gyros.\r\n\r\nMicrofabricated gyroscopes for measuring rate or angle of rotation can be used either as a low-cost miniature companion with micromachined accelerometers to provide heading information for inertial navigation purposes or in other areas, including automotive applications for ride stabilization and rollover detection; consumer electronic applications, such as video-camera stabilization, robotics applications; and a wide range of military applications. Current market for fiber gyroscopes is estimated to be $200 million and growing by 7% a year. Other gyroscope type represents a current market of well over $1 billion per year and is one of the fastest growing of the MEMs sensor categories. We believe the proposed technology can bring fiber gyroscope precision to the broader commercial gyroscope market and significantly increase both market sizes. We believe it is possible to attain a minimum of 10% market share with the proposed technology in the five to ten year time frame.\r\n",
