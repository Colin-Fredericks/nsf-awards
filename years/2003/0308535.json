 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to invigorate the introductory biology core course by implementing an active-learning format.  It is based on an appreciation that knowledge must be constructed, and learned, by each individual, and that while the responsibility for teaching rests upon the instructor, the responsibility for learning rests with the students.  The PI aims to move away from the standard lecture/note-taking format and implement an active-learning approach that he has been developing for the past few years, a strategy he thinks it is critical to implement starting with introductory biology.  With the active-learning format proposed, students are held responsible for the basic reading prior to the start of each day's class. The use of reading quizzes provides a positive reinforcement for ensuring that active learning begins prior to class.  The majority of class time then can be spent on group problem solving.  In this format, students collaborate, rather than compete, in the learning process. Concept quizzes provide rapid feedback and allow both the student and instructor to follow the students' progress in learning the material. The major emphasis is on keeping up, thus allowing the class to build on material that was covered in a previous session.  This active-learning format is being used for the large introductory classes of approximately 450-500 students.  A smaller class of 60 is being offered for students who are enrolled in the honors program.  A revised laboratory course (and a new lab course for the honors class) complements the \"lecture\" class.  The laboratory is designed around one scientifically interesting topic and incorporates opportunities for individual thinking.  The main goals/outcomes of this approach include: 1. Students gain an understanding that it is their responsibility to learn by taking an active role in the process; 2. Students who are introduced to a scientific method of thinking both through in-class problem solving and the laboratory; 3. Students who develop higher-order thinking skills because they use the information they learn in problem solving, and learn to synthesize the material in a conceptual manner, rather than simply memorize facts.  Intellectual merit: The proposal advocates a substantial modification of the current approach to teaching/learning for undergraduates at research universities. The methodology can be applied by any instructor, including research-active faculty. The essence of the proposal is to move away from passive learning to an active, inquiry-based approach.  Broader impact: The targeted group for this proposal is freshmen and sophomore students taking a class in introductory biology. Approximately 1,000 students per year take the introductory course at the University of Michigan.  The \"lecture\" part of the course in particular could easily be implemented at other schools, increasing the target audience to hundreds of thousands of students across the nation.",
