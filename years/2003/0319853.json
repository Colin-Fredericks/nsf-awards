 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n1\r\nThe overall objective of the proposal is to acquire a VICON 612 Motion Analysis System (MAS)\r\nand to 1) integrate it into existing research setups of the PIs, 2) strengthen new collaborative\r\nresearch among the PIs, 3) develop new measurement techniques, 4) integrate it into selected\r\nundergraduate and graduate courses in the two departments of the PIs, and 5) make the equipment\r\navailable to other researchers at the University. A MAS uses high-resolution CMOS cameras to\r\ncapture pictures of a dynamical system when visible red digital LED strobes light up tiny retro-reflective\r\nmarkers that are fixed on the system. Instantaneous three-dimensional coordinates of\r\neach retro-reflective marker that is seen by at least two cameras are automatically calculated\r\nusing photogrammetry, and displacements, velocities, and accelerations of all makers are\r\navailable for performing dynamic animation and further signal processing for dynamics\r\ncharacterization, damage detection, and control. Physically different from common point sensors\r\n(e.g., accelerometers and proximity sensors) and profile sensors (e.g, video recorders), the MAS\r\noffers simultaneous, non-contact, and accurate measurements of 3D coordinates of as many as\r\n100 points on a mechanical system undergoing large motions.\r\nThis work will solve critical experimental issues and develop advanced\r\nexperimental techniques for the testing, design verification, damage detection, modeling, and\r\nrapid prototyping of HFSs and other mechanical and aerospace systems. This work will advance\r\nthe knowledge of nonlinear statics, dynamics, control, and design of deployable/inflatable space\r\nstructures and other mechanical systems. The system will dramatically enhance\r\nresearch-intensive learning environments for training engineering students in the areas of 1)\r\nvibration testing and analysis of mechanical and aerospace systems, 2) testing and\r\ncharacterization of deployable/inflatable space structures, 3) motion control of mechanical\r\nsystems, 4) design of active structures, and 5) modeling of human movement. The potential\r\nimpact of this work on the design of modern space, aerospace, mechanical, and civil systems is\r\nexpected to be very significant and broad. \r\n",
