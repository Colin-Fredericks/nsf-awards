 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr.  Charles H.  Winter at Wayne State University to develop and evaluate precursors for the growth of thin metal nitride and oxide films by Atomic Layer Deposition and related layer-by-layer film growth techniques.  As the microelectronics industry moves to progressively smaller sizes, traditional materials may no longer provide the required properties in future devices.  This research aims at producing thin films of new metal nitride barrier materials (TaN, WNx) and new metal oxide insulators through the study of volatile tantalum complexes and the synthesis, structure, and properties of tungsten(VI) complexes.  Substitutents in these compounds will be manipulated to achieve the thermal stability and reactivity toward ammonia, hydrazine derivatives, and other nitrogen source compounds required for nitride Atomic Layer Deposition film growth.  Volatile zirconium, halfnium and lanthanide metal amidinate compounds will also be explored to achieve the thermal stability and reactivity toward water, oxygen, ozone, and other source compounds required for oxide Atomic Layer Deposition film growth.  Information from the deposition experiments will be used to design improved second and third generation precursors that maximize materials properties.\r\n\r\nSuccessful execution of this research leads toward a range of optimized Atomic Layer Deposition precursors to provide important types of metal nitride and oxide thin films.  The growth of very thin layers of nitride barrier materials and high dielectric oxides by Atomic Layer Deposition techniques is a central challenge that must be solved to maintain the pace of future miniaturization in microelectronics devices.  A central feature of the proposed research is the collaboration with Professor Niinisto at the University of Helsinki to perform Atomic Layer Deposition film growth studies.  The proposed pairing of synthetic inorganic and film growth groups will accelerate the development of Atomic Layer Deposition precursors and film growth procedures.  Students will benefit from working in an interdisciplinary environment that includes synthetic inorganic chemistry, film growth and characterization, international experience, and industrial internships.  The scope of the proposed research requires the development of excellent communication skills to prosper in academic, industrial, and international settings.  The students will experience a diverse educational environment, and will emerge with very broad scientific skills and perspective that will prepare them well for their independent careers.  \r\n",
