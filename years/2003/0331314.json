Funding will support the participation of approximately 40 invited scholars and researchers who have distinguished themselves in disciplinary and organizational achievements in the area of digital libraries and networked knowledge environments, and who have demonstrated leadership in the national and international community.  The workshop is being organized by senior members of the digital libraries community, some of whom have been instrumental in designing past agency and interagency programs.   The event is scheduled to be held June 15-17, 2003 in Chatham, Massachusetts.\r\n",
