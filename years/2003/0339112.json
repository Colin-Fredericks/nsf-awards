 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nDuring June 27 to July 2, 2004, the 11th International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction (WRI-11) will be held in Saratoga Springs, NY, USA. The meeting, sponsored by the Working Group on Water-Rock Interaction of the International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry, represents one of the best opportunities for students in the fields of aqueous geochemistry, biogeochemistry, hydrogeo-chemistry, organic aqueous geochemistry, geothermal chemistry, metamorphic fluid chemistry, sedimentary diagenesis, and environmental geochemistry to mix with an international group of scientists and engineers in similar fields. The conference brings together international scientists in a formal scientific setting but also provides an informal social program in which students and scientists mingle and learn from one another in a dynamic setting. In this regard, the meeting represents the best setting for students interested in the chemistry of water interaction with rocks to meet junior and senior scientists from around the world. The international focus allows students to learn about water problems and solutions, as well as to learn about geochemical settings from around the world. The cross-disciplinary nature of the meeting, wherein low-temperature geochemists rub shoulders with high-temperature geochemists, also fertilizes new approaches to science as high-temperature geochemists interact with environmental geochemists in a moderate sized meeting in discussing problems of mutual interest.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we request support to subsidize the cost of the meeting for students. The broader impacts of this subsidy are the following: 1) Improved understanding on the part of attending graduate students of the current field of water-rock interaction; 2) An opportunity for graduate students to make strong connections to international colleagues from around the world at an early point in their careers; 3) An opportunity for graduate students to present their work in oral or poster format to a collection of 500 or so of the top scientists in their field; and 4) An opportunity for graduate students to participate in field trips around the Adirondacks and the Saratoga Springs area, led by local experts\r\n",
