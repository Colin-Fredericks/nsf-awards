 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will conduct ionospheric research using a new radar technique called passive radar.  The passive radar makes use of commercial FM radio broadcasts as transmitters.  Signals acquired by low-cost receivers are analyzed to discriminate and recover echoes scattered in the ionosphere.  The radar requires no transmitter and no radio license, and is therefore a useful tool to demonstrate radiowave observing techniques to students from high school through graduate school.  Existing receivers will be augmented by two receivers in Canada to study E region irregularities at auroral latitudes.  The research has four primary goals:  (1) to create a dedicated radar instrument that is sensitive to 1.5 meter irregularities in the auroral zone, (2) to use the instrument to study the temporal and spatial evolution of auroral electrojet irregularities, (3) to improve the capabilities of the passive radar technique, and (4) to provide a rich educational and research experience for undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition to studying ionospheric irregularities in the auroral zone, the passive radar will be able to observe the development of the subauroral polarization stream that develops during large magnetic storms and is a source of scintillation in communication signals.  This novel radar technique has attracted international attention because of its potential application to aerospace and military systems.  This award will provide for continued development of the technique, along with training of the next generation of radio engineers.",
