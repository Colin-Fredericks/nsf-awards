 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Physical Society (APS) will use funds from this award to support student participation in a joint Canadian, U.S. and Mexican conference (CAM2003) in October 2003.  The funds will be used to award travel grants to U.S. students to participate in the conference and to cover administrative costs.  The CAM2003 U.S. organizing committee intends to competitively award approximately 85 U.S. students with \"CAM2003-NSF Student Presenter Awards\" of up to $500.00 per student. Nominating institutions will be asked to either match or provide some supplement to the grant provided through APS. \r\n\r\nThe APS, the Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) and the Mexican Physical Society (SMF) will jointly organize CAM2003: \"Student Visions for Physics in the 21st Century.\"  The SMF will host the meeting as a satellite to its annual meeting in Mexico City and will serve as the local organizing committee.  Students from the three societies, including members of the APS Forum on Graduate Student Affairs (FGSA), will serve as the conference organizers.  The meeting will focus on the participation of graduate and undergraduate students from the three respective countries and will provide them the opportunity to learn about a broad range of physics topics.  \r\n",
