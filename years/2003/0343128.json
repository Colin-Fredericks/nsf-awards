 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this planning grant to Worcester Polytechnic Institute is to plan for curriculum changes in the mechanical engineering department that will better prepare students for professional work in an environment where changes are rapidly taking place. The new curriculum will preserve and enhance the unique character of a WPI education, including the emphasis on skills that go beyond the narrow discipline and the freedom to individualize the curriculum, but also result in both a structure and material that can be exported to other institutions. At the highest level the goal of the changes are to achieve a program that: \r\no provides solid preparation in the Engineering Sciences, focused on preparing\r\nstudents to deal with modern problems in a modern way, including understanding\r\nhow to integrate the material between disciplines and take a \"systems\" view of\r\nproblems.\r\no prepares the graduates for the human aspects of professional life, including working in teams and communicating with diverse audience and who understand the need to consider non-technical aspects in engineering decisions.\r\no is structured in a way that recognizes that the ME degree is becoming more interdisciplinary and that ME students will pursue many different career paths requiring many diverse skills.\r\no emphasizes the education of the \"technical humanist\" who understands the global aspects of engineering and is both able and interested in applying engineering knowledge to help solve \"non-engineering\" problems.\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation of these goals into concrete changes are likely to involve an emphasis on introducing students to modern manufacturing in the freshman year; A \"compact\" core of ME \"engineering science\" courses designed to meet the ABET-ME requirement; A number of courses introducing the students to engineering practice, including design and realization; Opportunities to specialize in at least one area of current interest through a concentration within the ME department or a minor in another department; and continuing focus on engaging our students in the broader aspects of engineering, including a strong emphasis on the WPI global project.\r\n",
