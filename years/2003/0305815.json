The solutions of such problems can often be obtained\r\nas the critical points of an associated variational functional\r\ndefined on a suitable function space. In recent years infinite\r\ndimensional Morse theory, which is one of the most important tools\r\nin critical point theory, has been used to study semilinear\r\nproblems with striking success, but unfortunately this is not so\r\nin the quasilinear case. Basic Morse theory describes the local\r\nbehavior of a functional near an isolated critical point by a\r\nsequence of groups called the critical groups, and there are\r\nserious difficulties in determining the critical groups, both at\r\nfinite critical points and at infinity, for functionals arising\r\nfrom quasilinear problems. Standard tools such as the generalized\r\nMorse lemma and the shifting theorem can no longer be applied\r\nsince the domains of such functionals are generally not Hilbert\r\nspaces. Moreover, a complete description of the spectrum of a\r\nquasilinear operator is usually not available and there are no\r\neigenspaces to work with. The goal of this proposal is to\r\ndetermine the critical groups in a broad class of variational form\r\nquasilinear problems, both resonant and nonresonant, and apply the\r\nresults to obtain existence, multiplicity, and qualitative\r\nproperties of solutions such as the number of nodal domains.\r\n \r\nNonlinear partial differential equations is one of the most\r\napplicable and highly interdisciplinary areas of mathematics. They\r\nare widely used to model fundamental processes in science and\r\nengineering. While tools for numerically computing solutions of\r\nquasilinear equations have been developed extensively, there is\r\nvery little analytical theory currently available. Our goal is to\r\nestablish parts of the needed theory and to investigate the\r\nstructure of solutions. The knowledge gained by this project will\r\nhave applications to a wide variety of physical systems.\r\n\r\n",
