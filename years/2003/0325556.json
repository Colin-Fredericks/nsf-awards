 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of our proposed ITR research is the development of rapidly-deployable, self-configuring sensor networks that can provide life-saving information to rescue personnel after major urban disasters.  The proposed networks will be survivable, autonomous, adaptive, self-configuring, and provide minimal risk to rescue personnel.  Our approach to this project is broad in scope, yet highly integrated.  The PI separate the problem of developing self-configuring sensor networks into layers -- device, link, network, and application - in order to get a clear perspective on the problems that have to be solved.  The PI research teams will characterize and exploit the information that flows across these layers, with the goal of insuring that the technology development at each layer is realistic and effective, while integrating seamlessly with work at other layers.  Using this approach, we propose research into four areas: sensor development and characterization, distributed detection and sensor fusion, self-configuring network control algorithms, and application development.  The PI will coordinate the proposed research with ongoing research supported by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, using an actual, complex system to test sensors and model sensor deployment strategies.   \r\n\r\n",
