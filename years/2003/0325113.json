 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning theory deals with the design and analysis of algorithms that learn from data. The goal of this proposal is to extend the recent theory to reach out and cover new areas, thus enhancing its impact and power. There are four directions the PI's wish to pursue.\r\n\r\nA first direction examines the question of \"unsupervised\" learning, i.e., learning in the absence of a teacher who provides labels and feedback.  Problems of clustering, density estimation, information extraction etc. are instantiations that will be considered. Our approach makes contact with ideas in geometry and topology. A second direction considers \"active learning\" where input points of the data are determined in some manner other than random sampling. This direction makes contact with Shannon sampling theory, and parts of scientific computation.  A third direction considers \"population learning\" where one considers a population of learning agents interacting with and learning from each other and studies the dynamic evolution of such populations.  This framework contains natural models for the evolution of language in societies of linguistic agents and the evolution of financial markets in societies of economic agents. A fourth direction examines problems of large scale data analysis, classification, and retrieval in the context of speech, image, and text data. Many of the algorithms developed will be empirically\r\nevaluated.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will stimulate cross fertilization between diverse fields such as linguistics, engineering, mathematics, economics, computer science, and statistics.\r\n",
