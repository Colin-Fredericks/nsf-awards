 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the \"Arctic gap\" in the ocean observing system, the National Science Foundation funded an instrument-development project in July 2003 entitled: \"An Ice-tethered Instrument for Sustained Observation of the Arctic Ocean.\" This new instrument concept is for an expendable, ice-tethered variation of the now-operational Moored Profiler (MP) instrument developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) with NSF support. A loose array of these Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITP's) is envisioned, repeatedly sampling the upper ocean below the perennial ice pack and telemetering the data back in real time to the users ashore. Long lifetime and modest cost will permit coarse, basin-scale coverage to be maintained through regular seeding of replacement systems as necessary, similar to the surface ice buoys of the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP). Operationally, the ITP array will serve as the Arctic analogue of the ARGO float program now being initiated in the lower-latitude oceans. Ideally, an array of such ice-tethered platforms can serve as an effective observing system of the polar surface atmosphere and sea ice conditions as well as the upper-Arctic Ocean. Moreover, addition to the ice platforms of a telecommunications link through the surface ice pack would allow the array to serve as the backbone for two-way transmissions to buoys, AUVs, and subsurface moorings in the Arctic Ocean as well as acoustic tomographic receivers. \r\n \r\nIn order to optimize the capabilities of future Arctic observing systems and to coordinate international efforts in Arctic observing, this group will hold a workshop entitled \"Arctic Observing Based on Ice- Tethered Platforms\" at WHOI, June 23-25, 2004. This workshop will be a logical continuation of an earlier Arctic Instrumentation Workshop. It is expected that approximately 40 key experts plus interested scientists and students from the USA, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Russia, and possibly other countries will attend to brainstorm ideas of ice-tethered observing systems. Support is included here to cover the travel and lodging expenses of meeting participants, the meeting logistics, and report preparation and dissemination. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merits: \r\n \r\nThe proposed workshop will contribute significantly to the design and implementation of a full Arctic atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean observing system. It is expected that this workshop will push the boundaries in environmental measurements and telemetry capabilities, as well as the collection, acquisition, integration, analysis, synthesis, access, and long-term preservation of the observations. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n \r\nThis workshop will bring together experts from different countries to coordinate the efforts of various countries in Arctic studies. Results of the workshop will be widely distributed through the internet and scientific publications. Additionally, the workshop will have educational impact through the involvement of graduate students. \r\n\r\n",
