 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the ability of populations to reacquire normal levels of genetic diversity genetic following a recolonization event. Populations of multiple marine species will be compared from 1) Krakatau, a volcanic island colonized less than 120 years ago following a catastrophic eruption, 2) the Sunda Shelf colonized 10,000 years after postglacial sea level rise, and 3) Manado Bay where populations have remained largely unaffected by vulcanism or sea level fluctuations. DNA sequencing will be employed to estimate levels of genetic diversity within populations of each species from each region to determine the effect of time, dispersal ability, and generation time on the reacquisition of genetic diversity.\r\n\r\nGenetic diversity is fundamental to the ability of a population to respond to environmental stress and perturbations and is an essential component of biological diversity. The maintenance of genetic diversity in populations is a primary concern of both conservationists and resource managers. Understanding how populations acquire genetic diversity, as well as the variables affecting this process, is critical to developing effective management strategies to preserve both genetic and biological diversity. The results of this study will provide insight into how populations may recover following a severe reduction in population size or reintroduction as well as how managers might facilitate the reacquisition of genetic diversity within populations.\r\n",
