 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance \r\nSummary \r\n \r\nThe Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance is a coalition of fifteen universities working together \r\nwith federal, state, and community agencies1.  It will significantly enhance the STEM infrastructure \r\nwithin Ohio and will serve as a catalyst for change, innovation, and resource enhancement \r\nthroughout the state.   \r\nThe primary goal and broad impact of the Alliance is to double the number of underrepresented \r\nminority students who earn bachelor.s degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \r\n(STEM) fields and to significantly increase the number who pursue graduate study in these fields.  \r\nThis goal will be accomplished through the integration of new and existing campus-based and \r\nstatewide programs; the monitoring of student progress through their undergraduate degrees and \r\nbeyond; and the promotion of the Alliance to students, their parents, faculty, and the general public.  \r\nThe Ohio Alliance will focus on a comprehensive series of effective recruitment and retention \r\ninitiatives that address key transition points from undergraduate recruitment through preparation for \r\ngraduate school.  These transitions include: \r\n \r\nA.  Transition to College . Effective Coordination and Quality Programming; \r\nB.  First-Year and Beyond Student Programming; \r\nC.  Research Experiences for Rising Juniors and Seniors; and \r\nD.  Professional Development for Students, Faculty, and Staff. \r\n \r\nNSF funds will be used to support Alliance-wide initiatives (e.g., cooperative recruitment, research \r\ninternships, professional development, Alliance Forum) as well as individual campus-based \r\nprograms (e.g., mentoring, bridge programs, tutoring, supplemental instruction, drop-in centers, \r\nworkshops).  Research faculty will continue to be involved in program planning and will play an \r\nactive role in the selection of student participants, matching students with their research projects, \r\nmentoring, and assessing the quality of individual student performance.  STEM students who receive \r\ncompetitive funding will be referred to as Glenn-Stokes Scholars.   \r\nOhio State University will serve as the lead institution on behalf of the Alliance, and President \r\nKaren Holbrook, a research scientist herself, will serve as the principal investigator and chair of the \r\nGoverning Board.  Together with the Board, Steering Committee, and research faculty, she will \r\nprovide intellectual leadership to the Alliance.  The co-PI, Susan Huntington, Dean of the Graduate \r\nSchool, will provide its organizational home.  The project director, Jean Girves, has served as the \r\nassociate director of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) for fifteen years, where she \r\ncoordinated and raised funds for numerous collaborative projects among the 12 member institutions, \r\nincluding the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) for minority students, the Women in \r\nScience and Engineering (WISE) Initiative, and the Graduate Minority Fellows program.  In 2000, \r\nshe accepted the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering \r\nMentoring on behalf of the SROP.",
