 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research is concerned with the property of helical chirality using redox systems integrated with organic materials for the synthesis of electro-active materials.  Porphyrins, pthalocyanines and oligothiophenes will be integrated with methionine-based redox switches to afford materials able to act as photochemical switches.  For the characterization of materials, the study will take advantage of stopped-flow circular dichroism, fast voltammetry with microelectrodes, scanning electrochemical microscopy, fluorescence and electron transfer kinetics\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. James W. Canary of the Department of Chemistry at New York University.   Professor Canary will focus his research efforts on preparing new compounds that will be engineered to produce novel optical switches.  In terms of broader impacts, the project has potential for the development of industrially important devices.  The project will also be used as the basis for curriculum development at the undergraduate and graduate level and the PI is active in outreach activities.\r\n",
