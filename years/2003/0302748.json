 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN GENERAL RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with mathematical aspects of the problem of\r\ngravitational collapse and the formation of black holes. Analytically\r\nspeaking, this is the study of the initial value problem for\r\nappropriate Einstein-matter systems for asymptotically flat initial\r\ndata. The central questions in the subject are the celebrated weak and\r\nstrong cosmic censorship conjectures of Penrose. In previous work,\r\nthe author was able to resolve the issue of strong cosmic censorship in\r\nthe setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell scalar field\r\nsystem, confirming a heuristic picture that had been the subject of debate\r\nin the physics community. The present proposal concerns the development\r\nof a complete theory for gravitational collapse in spherical symmetry,\r\nwhich at the same time takes into account the physics of angular momentum.\r\nIn view of the constraint of spherical symmetry, angular momentum is\r\nsimulated through charge. Mathematically, a rigorous formulation is given\r\nby the initial value problem in the large for a charged self-gravitating scalar\r\nfield, i.e. for the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field system. The\r\nstudy can be divided roughly into three analytically distinct families\r\nof problems: the study of the formation of trapped surfaces,\r\nthe study of the decay of fields on the event horizon, and the study of\r\nthe instability of the Cauchy horizon.\r\nAll problems require methods which go well beyond standard techniques of\r\nthe theory of quasilinear hyperbolic p.d.e.'s in two dimensions.\r\nIn particular, the interaction between geometric features characteristic\r\nof black holes with non-linear wave equations will certainly play a big\r\nrole. Understanding these issues in the spherically symmetric case will\r\nhopefully point to the correct framework where these issues can eventually\r\nbe studied in the absense of symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of a star under the force of its own gravity and\r\nthe possible subsequent formation of a black hole is one of the\r\nmost exciting predictions of the general theory of relativity. This\r\nprocess, however, is not well understood. Most of our current\r\nintuition derives from so-called ``explicit solutions'' of the\r\nEinstein equations, the governing equations of the theory.\r\nThese ``explicit'' solutions, however, in addition to exhibiting\r\nbehavior which is hoped to be physically relevant, exhibit also\r\nbehavior widely considered to be pathological. For example, the Kerr\r\nsolution, on which our intuition for the final state of gravitational\r\ncollapse is largely based, contains so-called ``closed timelike curves''.\r\nThese allow observers who enter the black hole to subsequently travel in time.\r\nIs this an unhappy accident of the very special nature of this\r\nsolution, or is this a general property of black holes? In view\r\nof the strong non-linearity of the Einstein equations, and the difficulty\r\nof making accurate predictions on the basis of numerical or heuristic\r\nwork, this seems to be an area where the techniques of rigorous\r\nmathematical analysis can make a tremendous impact.\r\nIn this project, it is proposed to undertake a rigorous mathematical\r\nstudy of a realistic model of gravitational collapse, in particular one\r\nwhich takes account of angular momentum, the mechanism that leads to the\r\nfailure of ``causality'' in the Kerr solution. Partial progress has\r\nalready been made in the author's previous work, and in particular, the\r\nquestion of the stability of the picture alluded to above has been\r\nresolved in a very restricted setting. As this problem addresses a\r\nspectacular failure of Newtonian determinism in the setting of a\r\ncompletely classical (i.e. non-quantum)\r\nphysical theory, this work could impact current views\r\non some of the fundamental principles of physics.\r\n\r\n",
