 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain is an incredibly complex organ.  If neurons do not talk to their partners, the brain does not function.  How does the brain manage to allow the correct communication to occur? One way is to regulate the amount of signaling proteins that are used by the neurons.  The purpose of the proposed research is to understand how the brain performs this process.  Dr. Firestein has cloned a protein called cypin which is involved in making sure that there is a correct amount of proteins at sites where neurons communicate.  The proposed studies will first investigate how cypin performs this function by analyzing portions of cypin and determining which regions are responsible for cypin function.  Second, Dr. Firestein will analyze why cypin regulates the localization of some proteins better than others.  Finally, Dr. Firestein will determine what happens when cypin levels are increased in neurons.  The results of these studies will increase our understanding of basic mechanisms that underlie brain development.  In addition, the performance of these experiments will be part of a program to train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting edge-techniques in neuroscience. Two doctoral students, one of whom is an underrepresented minority, and two undergraduate students, will be involved in performing the experiments proposed.  In addition, Dr. Firestein will be developing an Advanced Neurobiology Laboratory to prepare undergraduate students for bench work in  laboratories at Rutgers University.  Taken together, the proposed project will help us to understand how the brain is wired for communication, at the same time providing opportunities for students to conduct bench science.",
