 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to explore one of the new\r\ndirections in coding theory: code families constructed from bipartite\r\ngraphs which afford iterative decoding of complexity proportional to\r\n(the first degree of) the number of transmitted bits.  Potential\r\napplications of expander codes include forward error correction in\r\nhigh-speed optical lines, wireless lines, and deep-space applications.\r\nIt is known that there exist easily constructible code families that\r\nreach capacity of the channel under iterative decoding and ensure\r\nexponential decline of the error probability of decoding. A\r\ndistinctive feature of these code families is that convergence of\r\ndecoding to the correct decision is established relying on expanding\r\nproperties of the underlying graph.\r\n\r\nThis project concentrates on constructing families of expander codes\r\n(parallel concatenations) that match or surpass the error performance\r\nof serially concatenated codes in the sense of G. D. Forney, while\r\nbringing the decoding complexity down from quadratic to linear-time,\r\nand studying the error probability of codes of moderate length (up to\r\n10,000) constructed from bipartite graphs.  The specific problems\r\nbeing addressed are: (a) to establish improved estimates of the error\r\nprobability and of the number of errors correctable under various\r\nversions of the basic iterative decoding procedure; (b) to study the\r\nerror probability of expander codes for code rates in the neighborhood\r\nof the channel capacity; (c) to construct practical codes of moderate\r\nlength based on bipartite graphs and specific short binary codes and\r\nto perform computer simulations of their error probability; (d) to\r\ngeneralize the expander code construction from two levels to a\r\nmultilevel version; to study the error performance of the multilevel\r\nconstruction.\r\n",
