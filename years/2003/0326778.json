 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the hydrologic cycle remains one of the least well understood aspects of the climate system, and  freshwater  forcing  the  most  probable  cause  for  differences  among  climate  models,  the  proposed research will provide an important observational foundation for evaluating ongoing and future changes in Earth's climate. Over  the  past  fifty  years,  ocean  salinity  distributions  have  been  changing  and  the  accumulating observational  record  is  beginning  to  suggest  some  trends  of  near  global  extent.    Various  studies  have individually documented salinity increases in tropical and subtropical surface waters of the Indo-Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean in recent decades; while over the same time period, the intermediate and deep water  masses,  ventilated  at  higher  latitudes  in  both hemispheres,  have  become  increasingly  fresh.  The proposed  research  will  investigate  whether  these  apparently  large-scale  and hemispherically  symmetric shifts in ocean salinity distribution can provide evidence of a change in the planetary hydrologic cycle.  It will engage in comparing the observed rates of freshwater gains and losses in the ocean to results from climate model simulations. Reflecting model predictions that the hydrologic cycle may have climatically important  effects  on  the  thermohaline  circulation  (THC),  the  study  will  evaluate  the  impacts  of  the observed changes in salinity and freshwater distributions on ocean density. A systematic census of ocean property content changes will  be  conducted  for  the  Pacific,  Atlantic,  Arctic,  and  Nordic  Seas  from  30 degrees S  to 90 degrees N utilizing new climatology products and tools.    Volumetric integrals  of  salt  will  be  used  to  identify  first  order  changes  in  ocean  freshwater  transports  over  the instrumental record and to estimate E-P anomalies for the ventilated ocean layers.  These anomalies will be compared to the latest evaporation and precipitation climatology products derived from other sources. Combining the Bergen Coupled Model with observations, the time-dependent formation and subduction rates for Salinity Maximum Waters will be investigated  in  conjunction  with  researchers  at  Laboratoire d' Oceanographie Dynamique et de Climatologie (LODYC) in Paris, France. The observational analyses will also be compared to results from NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled ocean-atmosphere  models.  These  comparisons  will  assess  the  degree  to  which  the  model  projected changes in salinity resemble the observed changes and provide perspective on whether they represent a signal of any significance against the background variability of the climate system.  Finally, the amplitude of the dramatic freshening of the water column that has occurred in the northern North Atlantic will be assessed in the context of threshold values for the THC, as determined from model simulations.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The  broader  impacts  of  this  study  are  likely  to  be  threefold.    First,  it  will  establish  collaboration among researchers from several groups,  i.e., modelers and observationalists from WHOI, GFDL, and LODYC.  Second,  the  model-data  comparisons  will  constitute  a  powerful  tool  for  calibrating  climate simulations and may be a significant stimulus for further model experiments to diagnose the mechanisms of  hydrologic  changes.    Third,  the  larger  research  community  will  benefit  from  the  expansion  of  the HydroBase  quality-controlled  database  and  gridded  climatology  products  which  will  result  from  this work.\r\n",
