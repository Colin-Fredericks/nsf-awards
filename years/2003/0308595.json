 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this U.S.-Czech materials research project between Michael Tringides of Iowa State University and Zdenek Chvoj of the Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences, CR, is to study adatom dynamics and the role of surface diffusion in epitaxial growth. This includes atomic diffusion mechanisms on (111) surfaces, using primarily silver, Ag, as a model system.  Specifically the researchers intend to examine interlayer diffusion in epitaxy, the role of adatom-substrate interactions, and the kinetics controlling the formation of uniform height metal islands on semiconductor surfaces. Experimental work will be done by the Ames group using high-resolution electron defraction and scanning tunneling microscopy to obtain atomic images of the growth structures.  Czech partners will address theoretical aspects of the joint project using analytical models and Monte Carlo simulations.  Results are expected to refine the basic context for understanding and manipulating the complex dynamics and growth modes of metal adatoms on metal and semiconductor surfaces.  Success would enhance our ability to grow and control the formation of nanostructures, with potential applications in the field of film growth. \r\n \r\nThis materials research project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. and Czech students to the international research community through work at partner institutions and direct involvement in the project's advanced experiments and modeling techniques.",
