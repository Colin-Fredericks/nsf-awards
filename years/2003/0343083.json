In particular he and Teichner are\r\npursuing the question of whether Vassiliev invariants detect knottedness.\r\nThe principal investigator is also looking for more powerful versions of\r\nthe theory of Vassiliev invariants, hopefully giving rise to four\r\ndimensional (concordance) information. Some of this is joint with Jacob\r\nMostovoy and Ted Stanford. Working jointly with Matt Horak and Karen\r\nVogtmann, the principal investigator is studying the mapping class group\r\nof surfaces via a tool developed by Harer, Penner, and elucidated by\r\nKontsevich (graph homology). Graph homology is very similar to the algebra\r\nthat appears in the context of Vassiliev invariants. The principal\r\ninvestigator is also studying the group of outer automorphisms of a free\r\ngroup via graph homology. Finally, the principal investigator, working\r\njointly with Ryan Budney, Kevin Scannell, and Dev Sinha, is pursuing a\r\nprogram for grounding Vassiliev invariants in classical homotopy theory\r\nand differential topology. This program has already borne fruit in terms\r\nof geometric interpretations of the simplest Vassiliev invariant.\r\n\r\nThe yoga behind the theory of topological invariants is that they provide\r\nuseful, computable topological information. When the number of dimensions\r\nis large, complete answers to topological questions can often be found\r\nusing algebraic invariants. In low dimensions, such as 3 and 4, the\r\nsituation is more complicated. The invariants still exist, but they are\r\nmuch weaker, and usually do not give complete answers.  On the other hand,\r\nthere are lots of invariants in low dimensions which don't have high\r\ndimensional analogues, and which are poorly understood topologically. For\r\nexample, there is a polynomial you can associate to any knotted loop (such\r\nas a piece of DNA or a singularity in spacetime) which will not change\r\neven if the loop is pushed and pulled into a new shape. This polynomial,\r\ncalled the Jones polynomial, has a definition which eludes any topological\r\ninterpretation and whose topological applications have been modest. The\r\nprincipal investigator is working to understand precisely the connection\r\nof this polynomial (and other similar objects) with topology, and this\r\nwill lead to more effective methods for answering questions in low\r\ndimensional topology and beyond.\r\n",
