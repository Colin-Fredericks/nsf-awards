 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott A. Calabrese Barton, Columbia University, is supported to create high-rate biocatalytic electrodes for biofuel cells using ambient organic fuels in plants. The work draws on results from ongoing studies in biocatalytic electrodes and will focus on (1) fuel composition and glucose-fructose-sucrose proportions; (2) enzyme systems such as glucose oxidase, oligosaccharide dehydrogenase and invertase-mutarotase-glucose oxidase; (3) electron mediation through redox polymers to facilitate high-rate electron transfer at low electrode potential; (4) highly porous carbon fibers as optimized anode support structures; and (5) convection effects and how they will impact electrode porosity and overall cell geometry.  Mathematical models will be used to direct implementation in the anode system and in the complete biofuel cell. \r\n\r\nThis work will lead to enhanced understanding of biocatalytic energy generation from plant sources. In addition to the technological impact, this project also includes outreach to the public school systems and the integration of research and education. This award is supported jointly by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.",
