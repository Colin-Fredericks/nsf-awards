The workshop is held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom in San Diego, CA and is sponsored by ACM Sigmobile. The special mission of MobiDE is to act as a bridge between the data and information management community and the mobile computing community. Thus, MobiDE brings together researchers in databases, networking, and mobile and pervasive computing. The workshop provides opportunities for a full day of exciting discussions on the topic of data and information management in mobile environments; in addition to paper presentations, we are soliciting panels on emerging topics. The workshop, as many other academic activities, relies on the experience of senior members of the community, but also aims to generate fresh ideas, foster new collaborations, and expose new people to emerging research opportunities. This grants enables graduate students to participate in the exciting technical program. This will have a broad impact on the students' ability to form future (international) collaborations and will also contribute to making the workshop an excellent forum for exchanging of ideas. Young attendees will also have the opportunity to meet distinguished scientists-educators and be inspired by them to follow careers in academia. For these reasons, students from underrepresented groups (for example, women, minorities and disabled students) are especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship through this grant. Travel support for student attendance will be advertised nationwide.",
