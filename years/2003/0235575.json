 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tFor the nervous system to function, neurons must establish their \"correct\" identities, meaning, they must express an appropriate set of genes in order to establish effective synaptic connections with their target(s).   The nervous system is divided up into two parts: neurons in the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system (CNS) while neurons that reside outside of the CNS comprise the peripheral nervous system (PNS).  The neurons of the PNS include all the sensory neurons that are activated by touch, pressure, pain and temperature stimulations on the body.  They must transmit their information into the CNS in order for the organism to make an appropriate response to the particular stimulus: e.g. when one touches a hot surface, one pulls one 's finger away.  In order for an organism to respond effectively to one's environment, each neuron in this circuit must function correctly meaning, each neuron must have established their designated identity.  Thus the goal is to identify the sets of genes that distinct neuronal cell types must express in order for that particular neuron to establish its correct identity. \r\nConsidering the panoply of neuronal subtypes that exist within the CNS and PNS, our understanding of the complete sets of genes that drive these distinct patterns of cellular differentiation is sparse.   The goal of our proposal is twofold: one, to determine the function of one gene, NEL in both a PNS tissue and a CNS tissue, in order to compare the development of neurons in these two distinct regions of the nervous system, and two, to conduct a global comparison of genes expressed during the process of neurogenesis and differentiation within the CNS and PNS.  The data yielded from these experiments will significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the establishment of the diverse spectrum of neurons within the nervous system. \r\n",
