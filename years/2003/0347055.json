 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquake engineering began in the early decades of the 20th century. Today, it is rapidly losing those who pioneered in the development and evolution of seismic design and earthquake hazard reduction.\r\n\r\nIn order to capture the events that influenced the thinking behind today's engineering theories and practices, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute inaugurated Connections, The EERI Oral History Series.  Begun in 1994, limited resources have prevented EERI from publishing many of the interviews that exist only as rough audio tapes or from capturing the increasingly perishable information that resides with the few remaining founders, while they are still alive.  \r\n\r\nCollectively, their histories provide one of the few records of the way in which scientific and engineering knowledge has developed over time and has influenced codes, practices, and society.  Most importantly, once published, their stories transmit the passion and commitment that motivated them and help to attract a new generation of prospective leaders in earthquake hazard reduction fields. \r\n",
