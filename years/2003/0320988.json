 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Barnard College under the direction of Dr. Rae Silver to purchase a confocal imaging system with spectral imaging capabilities. The instrument will be used by eight faculty in the Biology, Environmental Science, and Psychology Departments to carry out cutting-edge scientific research. In addition to carrying out substantial research programs, Barnard faculty teach classes, supervise undergraduate independent research projects (for majors and non-majors) and senior theses (of science majors), and actively involve student researchers in their own laboratories and projects. As such, faculty in the Biology, Environmental Science, and Psychology Departments will not only use the confocal microscope to advance their own research, but also to teach cutting-edge research techniques to undergraduates. \r\n\r\nThe confocal microscope will be used in the study of the neural basis of circadian rhythms, Drosophila developmental genetics, mechanisms that produce adaptive behavior, viruses in RNA bacteriophage infections, molecular regulation of transcytosis in hepatocytes, synaptic transmission between neurons, protozoan grazers and hydrophobic organic contaminants, and the role of brain monoamines and neuroactive peptides implicated in ingestive behavior. Moreover, it is expected that a total of 30 undergraduate Biology, Environmental Science, Behavioral Neuroscience, and Psychology majors will use the confocal microscope for research projects each year under the supervision of their faculty mentor. In addition, faculty will create laboratory exercises involving the confocal microscopy for four courses: molecular biology, cell biology, environmental measurements, and behavioral neuroscience. As a result, 80 additional students each year will have exposure to the equipment\r\n",
