 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the development of a new non-destructive testing and evaluation  (NDT/E) sensor for in situ monitoring  of temperature,  stress,  and  corrosive  chemical  compounds  from  within  the  core  of  concrete  blocks.  The sensor, made of a magnetostrictive ferromagnetic ribbon embedded inside concrete structures, is remotely detected via the magnetic higher-order signature. Multiple sensors of different properties can be arrayed for  simultaneously  monitoring  various  parameters.  The harmonic  sensor  is  powered  by  the  magnetic query field used to interrogate the sensor, thus eliminating the need of battery replacement or physical wire connections to the sensors.  The sensor effectively has an unlimited lifetime, certainly comparable to that of the buildings and structures it could be used to monitor. \r\n\r\nSince each harmonic sensor costs less than a fraction of penny, the application of this sensor technology for highway and building-health monitoring can significantly reduce the maintenance cost of these structures and, perhaps more importantly, inform as to whether the building is still structurally stable after an earthquake, explosion, etc. \r\n",
