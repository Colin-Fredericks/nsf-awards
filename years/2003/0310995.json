They achieve  this by  responding to cues from the environment with  neuroendocrine adjustments that affect reproductive  physiology and behavior. A great deal has been learned about  these processes through studies of temperate zone birds that  breed on relatively invariant schedules each spring, but  little is known of how opportunistic species capable of  breeding throughout the year time breeding flexibly.  This  study explores how the brain regulates reproduction in a  species that breeds on an extremely flexible schedule.  Red  crossbills are finches that are highly specialized to feed  on the seeds of coniferous trees such as pines.  These seeds  may be sufficiently abundant for the birds to nest at almost  any time of year.  However they are not produced regularly  at particular locations.  Consequently the birds must wander  nomadically, and the season when they discover abundant  seeds may vary dramatically from year to year.  Crossbills  regularly breed during about 10 months of the year (late  December through early October), and apparently occasionally  nest even during the remaining two months. Two complementary  questions about how crossbills achieve this reproductive  flexibility will be addressed in the present study.  First,  how does reproductive responsiveness to environmental cues  change seasonally in crossbills?  In other temperate zone  birds, the spring increase in day length first leads to  reproductive development, but then induces birds to become  \"refractory\" to long days.  That is, they cease to respond  to the stimulatory effects of long days.  This refractory  period ensures that breeding terminates in time for birds to  replace their plumage and prepare for fall migration.  It is  ubiquitous among temperate zone birds that have been studied  thus far, and restricts flexibil ity by prohibiting breeding  for several months in late summer and autumn.  It may be  absent or much reduced in crossbills.  Two experiments will  test to see whether crossbills become refractory to the  stimulatory effects of day length, and of non-light cues  such as food supply and behavior of mates.  Second, how do  changes in crossbill sensitivity to environmental factors  relate to changes in the brain?  All other temperate zone  birds that have been studied show dramatic reduction in  production of brain reproductive hormones during the  refractory period.  I will examine these hormones in  crossbills at several times of year to determine whether the  greater reproductive flexibility of crossbills reflects  relatively constant hormone production, providing a  mechanistic explanation for their extraordinary reproductive  flexibility. This study is important because it addresses  phenomenological and mechanistic questions in a species with  a highly flexible reproductive schedule.  The results will  clarify the physiological basis of reproductive flexibility  and help to reveal whether findings based on studies of  rigidly seasonal breeders apply to birds generally, and to  reproductive opportunists in particular. Studies of how  animals respond to environmental information help us to  understand the effects of changing environmental conditions  in the short and long term, and therefore have conservation  implications.  They also answer basic questions about  responses to the environment that continue to provide  insight into how all animals, including humans, may be  affected by their environment.",
