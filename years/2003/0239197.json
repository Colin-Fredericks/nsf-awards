 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase II project is concerned with the development and commercialization of electrochemically operated devices that will revolutionize the disinfectant industry by providing on-site, on-demand generation of extremely potent dual disinfectants. Peroxyacids are well known disinfectants that remove even resistant microorganisms (i.e. spores) by attacking S-S and S-H bonds on cell walls. The conventional method of manufacturing peroxy acids involves mixing concentrated hydrogen peroxide, an organic acid, and a catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid), and involves the transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. During the Phase I, the feasibility of a novel approach for the generation of the dual disinfectant was amply demonstrated. In this process, reactants for converting organic acids to dual disinfectants are generated within the device, avoiding problems associated with storage. All the criteria of success specified have been successfully accomplished and a well-known industrial partner has shown a keen interest in commercializing the novel devices. In Phase II, further optimization of the electrochemical devices will be followed by fabrication of prototypes of three devices for demonstrating their efficacy for a variety of disinfection applications. \r\n\r\nThere is a considerable need for devices that produce potent disinfectants that are biocidal against a broad spectrum of microbes including spores and viruses. These devices that produce potent disinfectants on-demand have commercial potential in domestic health care and food service establishments as well as in infection control applications in hospitals and nursing homes. It is estimated that revenues of the entire cleaning/sanitizing industry will be $31 billion in 2007. \r\n",
