 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geminiviruses replicate their small DNA genomes in mature plant cells using host DNA replication enzymes. Infected cells also replicate host chromosomal DNA but do not undergo cell division. The uncoupling of DNA replication and cell division - or endoreduplication - is a common developmental event in plants and animals. The overall goal is to characterize a novel protein kinase that occurs in endoreduplicating leaf cells and is induced by geminivirus infection. The first aim is compare the properties of the kinase and second, closely related protein to determine if one or both of them play a role in endoreduplication and infection. The second aim is to determine the impact of altering kinase expression on leaf development and viral infection. The third aim will identify proteins that interact with the kinase and may be phosphorylation targets. The research will increase understanding of the mechanisms that control plant development and disease as well provide insight into basic eukayotic processes. The research may lead to new strategies for altering plant growth, resulting higher yields and shorter growing seasons, and new methods for controlling geminivirus disease. The research will provide training in state-of-the-art molecular, cellular and genomic technologies for scientists at all levels of their education.",
