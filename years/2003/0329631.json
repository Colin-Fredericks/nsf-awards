 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed research program is to successfully demonstrate dramatically improved performance of nanocomposite SnO2 sensors made using a novel synthesis approach.  Staged nucleation of nanoparticles will be used to make high-value-added SnO2 sensor materials doped with noble metal additives using a multi-element diffusion burner.  In particular, gold nano-islands are expected to yield remarkable increases in sensor sensitivity due to the extremely high catalytic activity of Au demonstrated in previous studies.  Therefore, the Au/SnO2 system will be the primary focus of the research effort.  The effects of particle size, Au loading and relative particle morphologies on sensor performance will be quantitatively determined.  High-resolution microscope imaging (e.g. scanning and transmission electron microscopy coupled with elemental analysis methods) will be used to characterize the materials properties.  Performance of the powders in gas sensor applications will be quantified in terms of sensor time response, sensitivity, selectivity and stability.  \r\n\r\nOutcomes of the research include the potential to create mechanically simple, rapid time response, sensitive, selective, stable, toxic-gas sensors that can be operated over a large temperature range.  NOx sensors with these properties are a specific focus of the research program due to applications in internal combustion engine systems.  The broader impacts therefore include more precise design of automotive exhaust gas catalysts and corresponding materials and costs savings.  \r\n",
