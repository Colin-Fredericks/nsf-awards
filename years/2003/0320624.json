 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of Tomographic Imaging Instrumentation with Terahertz Radiation\r\nA Project Summary\r\nThe Center for Terahertz (THz) Research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is seeking NSF\r\nsupport for the development of a THz wave tomographic imaging system that will provide the\r\nfirst-ever THz capability to produce real-time, large-scale, long-distance, three-dimensional (3D)\r\nimages. Like conventional X-ray CT systems, the THz system will provide 3D mapping of\r\nstructured objects, but without subjecting biological tissue to harmful radiation. In addition, it\r\nwill offer important spectroscopic information that conventional systems cannot supply. The\r\ninstrumentation will provide real-time images across an ultra-wide frequency band, extending\r\nfrom 100 gigahertz to 10 terahertz, at a variable frame rate from single-shot up to 1,000 frames\r\nper second, and it will be able to non-invasively image moving objects, turbulent flows, or\r\nexplosions.\r\nTHz research is central to Rensselaer's strategic plan because it is a key enabling technology for\r\nboth of the university's major focus areas, information technology and biotechnology.\r\nRensselaer has strongly supported the formation of the THz Center, with Dr. Zhang as founding\r\ndirector. The university is providing 5,000 square feet of laboratory space, substantial financial\r\nsupport for renovation and equipment, and three new faculty positions in the next four years,\r\nwith a concomitant increase in graduate and undergraduate researchers.\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposed instrumentation will be an important step forward for THz\r\nscience. During the last decade, Rensselaer's team has been exploring this previously hidden\r\nportion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is located between the infrared and the\r\nmicrowave bands. Basic THz science and technology is in its infancy, but as it improves, it has\r\nthe potential to trigger transformational advances that will impact economic development and\r\nquality of life at every level. Examples of interdisciplinary fields that could gain important new\r\ninstrumentation include homeland security, biomedical research, communications, environmental\r\nmonitoring, agriculture, and forensic science.\r\nBroader impact: Successful development of the equipment will have a broad impact. In recent\r\nyears, worldwide excitement about this field has grown exponentially, as evidenced by an\r\nexpanding number of research groups that have published more than 1,400 scientific papers on\r\nTHz science since 1990. During the last several years, scientists and engineers from 75\r\nuniversities, companies, and clinics have visited Rensselaer THz-related programs, and\r\nRensselaer's team has helped scientists from 18 countries learn how to use THz sensors. This\r\nnew instrumentation will be a key enabling technology for the THz Center, providing new\r\nresearch capabilities for an interdisciplinary group of Rensselaer faculty, postdoctoral associates,\r\nand graduate and undergraduate students, as well as for visiting scientists and external\r\ncollaborators. It will be used to test numerous advanced sensing and imaging concepts in the\r\nTHz frequency range, with immediate concentration on homeland security and a longer-term\r\ninterest in biomedical applications. Jefferson Laboratory, UC Santa Barbara, and Rensselaer\r\nhave proposed creation of the National THz User Facility, and this system would be at the heart\r\nof one of the user nodes. Based on past experience with Rensselaer's THz research, the\r\ninstrumentation is also expected to provide a model for systems that will be developed in\r\nlaboratories around the world.",
