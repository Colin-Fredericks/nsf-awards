 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research is to functionalize nanoparticles, eliminate aggregation of the resulting particles, segregate and assemble the particles in polymer materials, and explore the chemistry of the functionalized particles at liquid-liquid interfaces.  The goal of the project is to achieve precise interfacial control of the nanoparticles within polymer matrices by the simultaneous use of tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) to control solubility, and ruthenium-based Grubb's catalyst sites to initiate polymerization in a spacially segregated manner.  A second aspect of the proposed work involves orienting the nanoparticles along an aqueous-organic phase boundary.  Unique educational opportunities for students will be pursued in collaboration with scientists from Kodak.  \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Todd Emrick of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Professor Emrick will focus his research on the development of new materials containing nanoparticles oriented along specific planes within the materials.  This could have important ramifications in the development of new types of optical and electrical devices.  The educational activities of the award will include interactions of his students with scientists at Kodak Park in Rochester, New York.  \r\n",
