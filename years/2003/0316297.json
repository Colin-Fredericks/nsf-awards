This is used in fundamental studies of turbulent diffusion flames of interest in combustion and propulsion.  By using simultaneously the combination of PIV and CH-PLIF it is possible to address, in a unique way, two broad classes of fundamental problems: (a) the velocity, strain rate, and residence time on the flame surface as marked by CH at locations ranging from the jet injection nozzle to the flame tip of an attached diffusion flame; and (b) the nature of the flame-stabilization region spanning the range from flame liftoff to flame blowout.  These results provide new understanding of fundamental flame structure and flame stability, and a database for comparison to large-eddy simulations (LES) of these flows\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research relate to the acquisition of fundamental knowledge of combustion systems.  Energy will remain a major issue in the 21st Century and combustion will be a large part of this, so this broadly contributes to energy issues.  These studies also train students to the Ph.D. level, thus producing a highly trained technical workforce which adds to national competitiveness;  these students, including  under-represented minorities, are fully experienced in all aspects of electronics, computers, spectroscopy, high-powered lasers and combustion. \r\n\r\n",
