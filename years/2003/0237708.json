 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The overall goal of this career proposal is to explore the purely interdisciplinary subject\r\nof feedback control system design for generation of rhythmic patterns found in animal locomotion,\r\nand to develop effective pedagogical methods for inspiring engineering students with benefits of\r\nbiological knowledge in the context of systems and control.\r\nSpecific Goals:\r\nI. Develop an orbital trajectory analysis method for a class of nonlinear systems arising from\r\nmodeling of biological pattern generators.\r\nII. Establish a method for designing a dynamical system that achieves pattern generation with a\r\nprescribed oscillation profile.\r\nIII. Revise the dynamics and control curriculum to provide a broader view of systems through\r\ncrossdisciplinary training in neuroscience.\r\nIV. Integrate the bio-control research into the science and engineering education at broad levels\r\nincluding K-12 and college undergraduate.\r\nV. Broadly disseminate the results of the proposed activities.\r\nMethods and Procedures (Keyed to the Specific Goals):\r\nI. Mathematically formulate an oscillation analysis problem and derive a solution using tools\r\nfrom robust control theory. Examine the degree of conservatism exploiting the biological knowl-edge\r\nof particular central pattern generator (CPG) architectures.\r\nII. Use the analysis result in I as a basis for developing a general theory for the design of CPGs\r\nutilizing linear matrix inequality methods. Test the applicability of the design conditions against\r\nthe CPGs known from biology.\r\nIII. Improve an undergraduate course on systems modeling by introducing neuronal modeling\r\nand pattern generation mechanism. Develop a new graduate course on robust and nonlinear control\r\nfor regulation and biological oscillation.\r\nIV. Develop research-based educational tools through multidisciplinary, teamworking, senior\r\nthesis projects. Use the tools to stimulate K-12 and undergraduate students' intellectual curiosity\r\ninto engineering and science through a series of outreach/educational activities.\r\nV. Utilize conference presentations, publications in archival journals, invited seminars, and\r\npossibly tutorial workshops in major international conferences.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The central theme of feedback control theory has been the regulation around an\r\nequilibrium point of a dynamical system. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to control\r\nspecifications involving periodic motion (or oscillation) generation despite their practical impor-tance.\r\nThe basic research outlined in this proposal will provide an initial stepping stone toward a\r\nnew control paradigm that focuses on autonomous pattern generation by feedback dynamics. In\r\nparticular, the project will establish a systematic method for analysis and design of pattern genera-tors\r\nthrough the exploitation of biological knowledge on neuronal oscillators.\r\nBroader Impact: The crossdisciplinary research activities over biology and control fields are in-tegrated\r\ninto educational activities at all levels. The revised curriculum will provide undergraduate\r\nand graduate students with a broader perspective on engineering problems. The senior thesis project\r\nwill develop students with team-oriented problem-solving skills in a multidisciplinary environment.\r\nThe outreach activities will contribute to improve scientific literacy of K-12 students.\r\n",
