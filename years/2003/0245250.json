 "awd_abstract_narration": "An algebraic surface of type K3 is a 2-dimensional analog of an elliptic\r\ncurve.  It is characterized by the property that its tangent bundle is not\r\ntrivial but the first Chern class is trivial. Its group of algebraic\r\nautomorphisms is a discrete group sometimes infinite sometimes finite and \r\nits structure is closely related to the structure of the orthogonal group \r\nof the the Picard group of divisor classes equipped with the intersection \r\nproduct. The structure of the automorphism group of a complex K3 surface \r\nis well understood thanks to the availability of trascendental methods \r\nbased on the study of the integration of a holomorphic 2-form on the surface \r\nover transcendental cycles. No such methods are available in the case when \r\nthe characteristic of the ground field is positive. In the proposal the \r\nprincipal investigator outlines several new approaches to the study  of \r\nautomorphism groups of K3 surfaces over such fields. Some of them based \r\non the study of possible automorphisms of finite order which will allow \r\nto compute the character of the group in its representation on l-adic \r\ncohomology. Other approaches use the relationship between the Picard \r\nlattice and the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. The principal investigator \r\nwill also study some applications to coding theory and cryptology related \r\nto K3 surfaces over a finite field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of symmetries of mathematical structures is one of the most\r\nimportant and oldest problems in mathematics. A symmetry group of a\r\nRiemann surface or an algebraic curve is now well understood. Much less \r\nis known about symmetries of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. The\r\nprincipal inverstigator proposes such study for a class of algebraic\r\nsurfaces known as K3 surfaces which are two-dimensional analogs of\r\nelliptic curves. The symmetry groups of K3 surfaces are related to\r\nsymmetry of other objects, for example lattices in hyperbolic spaces \r\nand convex polyhedra. Many known abstract infinite and finite groups \r\nadmit a beautiful realization as symmetry groups of K3 surfaces.  \r\nApplications of symmetry groups of elliptic curves over finite fields \r\nto coding theory and cryptology is well known. It is expected that the \r\nknowledge of symmetry groups of K3 surfaces over finite field will find \r\nnew applications to these theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
