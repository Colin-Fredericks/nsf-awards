 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Nanotechnology, An Active Learning Experience for Undergraduates,\" at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM), under the direction of Dr. Miguel E. Castro, is co-funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers in the Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). This will be the first course focused on nanoscale science and engineering at the undergraduate level at UPRM. This proposed course will have the following five  features: 1)introduction of nanotechnology concepts early in the academic development of sophomore level science and engineering majors; 2) development and implementation of active learning activities to assist in the introduction of basic concepts related to NSE; 3) participation of scientists and engineers from local industries including Dupont Microelectronics; 4)conducting research in nanotechnology early in the academic development of undergraduate students, and;  5) interaction of students early in their undergraduate development with faculty involved in nanotechnology research at the UPRM Chemical Imaging Center.",
