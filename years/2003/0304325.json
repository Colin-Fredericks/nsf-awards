 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 02-148.  The one-year project will develop novel solid-state and soft nanopore devices for rapid DNA sequencing.  It has been suggested that one may be able to detect genetic sequences in individual DNA molecules by measuring the change in the ionic conductance of a nanometer-scaled pore embedded in an insulating membrane as a single-stranded ssDNA molecule is driven through by an electric field.  The use of two types of new synthetic nanopores will be explored: (1) a nanopore with 1 nm in length or depth fabricated by molding soft materials using a novel \"cutting-edges\" concept; (2) an integrated nanopore circuit consisting of three nanopores in series using silicon technology.  Novel experiments will be performed to study the microscopic processes by which a long ssDNA molecule \"translocates\" through a nanopore, and to explore a new sensing mechanism exploiting the hydrogen-bonding effects between two ssDNA molecules.  The proposed projects, if successful, could lead to a great advance in the development of a nanopore DNA sequencing technology.  The projects will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in an exciting emerging field of single molecule biophysics.  The students will receive advanced training in the state-of-the-art nanofabrication technology and single-molecule biophysics.  This project is jointly supported by the Divisions of Materials Research and Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, as well as the Division of Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological Sciences\r\n\r\nThis Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 02-148.  The one-year project will explore a new generation of nanometer-scaled sensors, solid-state nanopores, for detecting and characterization of biological molecules. Nanopore biosensors have shown great promise in basic studies of single-molecule biophysics. These novel devices may also be useful in disease control and in anti-bioterrorism.   Two types of new synthetic nanopores will be explored: one based on the state-of-the-art silicon technology, and the other based on polymeric materials.
