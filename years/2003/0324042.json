 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CSEMS (Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics) Program is providing scholarship support for a new cohort group of 19-20 students in years one, two and three with continuing support in years two through four in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. The project is focusing on the recruitment, retention, and graduation of scholars from underrepresented groups who are academically talented and financially needy. It is projected that at least 90% of participating scholars will graduate with a CSEM A.A. or A.S. degree and either enter a CSEM occupation or enroll in a CSEM baccalaureate degree program.  The overall goals of the CSEMS Program are to: (1) increase the numbers of employees in CSEM areas of local, state, and national need; (2) improve educational outcomes for academically talented, financially needy students in CSEM disciplines; (3) ensure the ongoing academic/career success of CSEMS scholars; (4) continuously improve the quality/scope of student support services available to students; and (5) build meaningful partnerships with education and industry partners that will enhance and improve the quality of professionals entering the high-technology workforce.  The strategic objectives of the CSEMS Program at St Petersburg College are to: (1) establish/maintain exemplary high-technology scholarship and degree programs; (2) recruit and retain a superb faculty in CSEM disciplines that is fully engaged in the academic success of all students; (3) recruit, educate, and graduate ever increasing numbers of academically talented, financially needy students in CSEM disciplines; and (4) create and maintain a student support infrastructure that significantly increases the rate of academic success for students entering CSEM degree programs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
