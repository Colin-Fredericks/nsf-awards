To pursue the effort of understanding the dispersal of anthropogenic Pb, the following studies will be carried out:  (1) continue the automated moored time series near Bermuda and Hawaii and analyze samples from the deep South Atlantic for Pb isotopic ratios; (2) participate in a cruise to the North Western Tropical Atlantic to determine how the Upper North Atlantic Deep Water maximum is developed; (3) analyze surface water samples from the North Atlantic collected between 1998-2003 and samples collected during the CLIVAR section south of Iceland to establish how the surface distribution of Pb has changed relative to 1981-1984 and 1985-1989; and (4) analyze a Bermuda coral for Pb back to 1880 to assess whether high 206/207 and 208/207 Pb isotopes are a peak or are stable.  In addition, to further our knowledge on oceanic Fe, the PI plans to continue the high-resolution time-series of surface total Fe values at Bermuda and Hawaii and analyze vertical profile for Fe from the major western North Atlantic basins for <0.4 um and <0.2 um Fe, as well as complete an iron stable isotope reconnaissance for Fe in marine samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
