 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology (71).  Within the Ithaca College psychology department, student-faculty collaboration in research is a well-established tradition.  Prior to the implementation of this project, however, student exposure to modern systems of measurement was limited. In this project we are creating the capacity for faculty and students to use modern, scientific approaches to studying body and mind connections through the use of modern mind-body laboratory technology.  The laboratory is equipped with a JVC digital video system that is used to create visual stimuli and record subject responses, with Biopac units, a Qualisys precision motion analysis system, and six SuperLab workstations. The laboratory is being used for student-faculty collaborative research and also for classroom demonstrations. We are also automating experiments. The students who benefit from use of the mind-body laboratory include those enrolled in psychology courses and also those working with faculty in other departments seeking to provide their students with an interdisciplinary approach to the scientific study of health and human performance. Many of these latter students, for example, from theater, dance and music, do not typically participate in a hands-on scientific approach to studying human functioning. \r\n\r\nThis project is following APA guidelines for building into coursework and student experiments the use of equipment that is proven in psychology.  In particular, it is adapting Alma College's successful approach in using Biopac units both in student research in its psychology department and in an introductory course in anatomy and physiology. (See: Glynnis Beagley and William Beagley, \"Using Micro-computer Based EG to Enable and Encourage Student Designed Projects,\" Behavior Research Methods, Instruments & Computer, Vol. 30, No. 2, 1998, pages 223-226, and J. Lundmark and A. Salmi, \"Inquiry-Based Labs Using the Biopac Student Lab System: Results from an NSF-CCLI Grant Supported Project,\" paper presented at the HAPS Conference, Maui, HI, 2001.)  It is also adapting ideas developed in the biology departments at Wagner College and Marymount College. (See: T. Jackson, et al., \"Physiological Responses to Guided Relaxation,\" poster presented at the Eastern Colleges Science Conference, Ithaca College, 2003, and J. Sutherland and C. Hoegler, \"Effects of Higher Brain Functions on the Diving Response in Humans,\" Poster presented at the Eastern Colleges Science Conference, Ithaca, College, 2003). The project is leading to an increase in student-faculty collaborative research and we expect  this activity will lead to publications and be reported at student and professional conferences. The principal investigators are training other faculty at Ithaca College in the use of the laboratory.  \r\n",
