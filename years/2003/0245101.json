 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem for theoretical physics is the description of the structure of hadrons\r\nand their interactions.The building blocks of hadrons are quarks and gluons,among which\r\nthe distribution of .avor,momentum,and spin is an area of intense study.This project will\r\nstudy two of the outstanding challenges to theory posed by recent experimental results:1)\r\n.avor asymmetry in the proton sea,measured by E866 at FermiLab,in which the excess of\r\nd -antiquarks (Pd )over u -antiquarks (Pu )for low values of x (the fraction of proton momentum\r\ncarried by the antiquark),is replaced by a dominance of Pu over Pd for larger values of x ,and 2)\r\nthe spin transfer measurements of PS185 at CERN,for Pff production from Pp collisions with a\r\npolarized proton target,which disagree with all theoretical predictions.These investigations\r\nwill be extended to calculation of polarized .avor asymmetry in the proton sea,and to other\r\nantihyperon-hyperon (PYY )production reactions.A new area of research,singular potentials\r\nand limit cycles,will be studied in the context of e .ective .eld theory.\r\nFlavor asymmetry in the proton sea will be calculated in terms of a meson cloud model,\r\nin which the proton can .uctuate into meson-baryon states,whose quark distributions then\r\ncontribute to the measured quark distributions of the proton.The quark and gluon degrees\r\nof freedom of the proton will also be included in a statistical model of the gbare proton, hthe\r\nleading term in the proton wave function.E .ects of charge symmetry violation,arising from\r\ndi .erences in the masses of the Pd and the Pu ,will be included.The goal of this project is to\r\nexplain the x -dependence of the experimentally determined unpolarized .avor asymmetry,\r\nand to predict the polarized asymmetry.\r\nHigh precision calculations of Ppp\r\nPYY will be carried out which will include:a)e .ective\r\ninteractions that represent the leading contributions to Pqq annihilation and creation,b)\r\nan initial state interaction which has been determined by .t to PNN reaction data in the\r\nmomentum region spanned by the strangeness production experiments,and c)a contribution\r\nto the reaction mechanism from a spin singlet term,for which there is evidence from the\r\nrecent spin-transfer data.The goal of this project is to learn about the reaction mechanism\r\nand the otherwise unknown PYY interactions in the .nal state.\r\nThe study of singular potentials and limit cycles will include investigation of real and\r\ncomplex potential regulators and their renormalization properties.Applications to cold atom\r\nscattering and problems in e .ective .eld theory will be made.\r\nThis project has intellectual merit because,as described above,it addresses important\r\nproblems in hadron structure and interactions for which there is signi .cant disagreement\r\nbetween nuclear theory and experiment.It extends prior work to new areas.The preliminary\r\nwork necessary for the project has been successfully completed by the P.I.\r\nBroader impacts of the project include placing the research in an undergraduate setting,\r\nin which students are drawn from a diverse population (40%minority)with a high percent-\r\nage of women physics majors (40%).The student research experience will be complemen-\r\ntary to coursework,and provide an integration of classroom learning and the excitement\r\nof contemporary research.Students will receive training in research methods and scienti .c\r\ncommunication.They will work in teams,mentor younger students and present their work\r\nin papers,posters and talks at meetings of professional societies.In addition to presentation\r\nof research .ndings in journal articles and at scienti .c meetings,seminars and colloquia will\r\nbe given at other undergraduate institutions.",
