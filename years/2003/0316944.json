 "awd_abstract_narration": "Claire A. Tessier, University of Akron, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for studies on phosphazenes and poly(phosphazenes). Poly(phosphazenes) are the largest group of inorganic polymers, with phosphorus and nitrogen atoms alternating along the backbone. The properties of the polymer can be tuned by varying the phosphorus substituents. The main goals of this research project are (1) to develop a convenient, Lewis-acid catalyzed synthesis of linear dichlorophosphazenes; (2) to understand the chemistry of small phosphazene rings with three or four P-N units; (3) to understand the properties of both linear and crosslinked polyphosphazenes. Multinuclear NMR is a key tool for this project.\r\n\r\nPoly(phosphazenes) have a wide range of applications in elastomeric materials, insulating foams, solid solvents for ion conductors, bioinert films, fireproofing materials and controlled-release drug polymers. Full commercialization of other promising poly(phosphazenes) has been hampered by inconvenient and often irreproducible syntheses. This project will attempt to develop syntheses that will work under milder conditions and give more of the desired linear polymers. Students trained on this multidisciplinary project, including women and members of underrepresented groups, will learn key synthetic, spectroscopic and polymer characterization techniques.",
