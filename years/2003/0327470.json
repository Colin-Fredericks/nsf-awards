 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of eddy flux statistics in increasingly realistic regimes will be conducted. The proposed work will employ idealized simulation, analysis and theoretical development using an isopycnal ocean model (HIM) to address, in particular, the applicability of the potential vorticity flux theory based on horizontally homogeneous (but vertically inhomogeneous) quasi-geostrophic turbulence to more complex regimes. The studies will address the following points: the model resolution necessary to achieve converged eddy statistics in an idealized primitive equation model; interaction of adiabatic interior eddy fluxes with surface fluxes and surface forcing; the effects of horizontal mean flow inhomogeneities on eddy fluxes; and eddy flux statistics and dynamics in the presence of topography.\r\n\r\nThe successful extension of the flux theory to realistic regimes will pave the way toward a new parameterization scheme that may lead to significant improvements in operational climate models, and hence to improved understanding of the ocean component of climate. The  availability of government laboratory resources for this project benefits the laboratory via potential improvements in its models, and benefits the larger scientific community in generating unhampered fundamental research in ocean dynamics.\r\n\r\n",
