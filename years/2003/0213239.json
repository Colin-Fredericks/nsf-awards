This instrumentation is crucial for isotopic analyses required in three major projects currently supported by NSF: Central American volcanism (Continental Dynamics/MARGINS/Subduction Factory), New Jersey drilling (Continental Dynamics and ODP), and Biocomplexity (Ocean Sciences). The new facility for radiogenic isotope analysis will complement recently acquired stable isotope and noble gas mass spectrometers in the department. It will also replace the currently operating, aging TIMS, a VG Sector single collector, which was put into operation in 1986 and has served its purpose well over the past 15 years. The ongoing research projects in Central American volcanism and Late Cretaceous to Holocene sea-level and global climate change will be greatly augmented by the new instrumentation, and will allow a significant increase in the number of samples analyzed. The Central American studies will enhance our understanding of volcanic processes in an active arc system, and in the future may increase our ability to predict volcanic eruptions. The New Jersey drilling program and the biocomplexity research focus significantly on global climate change, and thus have direct impact on an important scientific, social and political problem.\r\n***",
