 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supercomputer simulations of the final coalescence and merger of compact binary stars will be performed using a new 3D relativistic hydrodynamic computer code developed by the PI and his students. In particular, the first 3D relativistic calculations of the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole in a close binary system will be performed using this code. The gravitational wave signals emitted during these compact binary merger events will be computed self-consistently as part of the simulations. The dependence of the signals on the properties of the nuclear fluid will be studied systematically.\r\n\r\nCoalescing binary systems containing compact stars are among the most important sources of gravitational radiation for current laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO. The theoretical study of gravitational wave sources is crucial for the interpretation of data to be collected by the interferometers, and for the planning of future, more advanced detectors. The new hydrodynamic calculations for binaries containing a neutron star in orbit around a black hole will represent a\r\nsignificant improvement over previous, more approximate treatments. The study of coalescing compact binaries is important for many other problems of great current interest in astrophysics, such as the origin of gamma-ray bursts, and the production of heavy elements in galaxies. The 3D\r\nrelativistic hydrodynamics code developed by the PI is a general tool, which will be useful for studying many other problems involving relativistic stars and fluids. Public outreach activities are planned that will take advantage of the resources of the nearby Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Chicago and will educate the public about Einstein's theory of General Relativity and the great discovery potential of gravitational wave astronomy.\r\n",
