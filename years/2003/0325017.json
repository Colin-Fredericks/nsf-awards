 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, a collaborative with 03-24864 Papanikolopoulos at University of Minnesota and 03-24977 Kostas Daniilidis at University of Pennsylvania, and 03-25017, addresses research issues key to an important application of robot teams and information technology (emergency response in hazardous environments for various tasks). The research sets 6 goals:\r\n\tDevelopment of new algorithms that enable collaborative sensing.\r\n\tDevelopment of distributed localization/mapping methods that leverage capabilities of the heterogeneous robots.\r\n\tIn-depth study of communication issues with emphasis on transparent integration of ultra wideband communication methodologies.\r\n\tDevelopment of methods for team coordination and dynamic distribution of tasks to robots.\r\n\tCreation of algorithms for the presentation of sensory information to users.\r\n\tExperimental validation of the scalability of the aforementioned algorithms and techniques.\r\nThe PIs use the Scout and MegaScout robotic platforms designed at the University of Minnesota along with other testbeds at CalTech and U Penn to conduct the research. The project integrates the algorithms with first responder teams, emphasizing realistic scenarios; mentors students from underrepresented groups in order to retain them in CS/EE programs; conducts outreach activities through demonstrations at local schools and youth groups; conducts workshops that emphasize cross-disciplinary interaction; creates web resources; innovates classroom uses of multi-robot teams; and includes parts of the research in design projects for seniors. The project also includes international collaboration with groups at NTUA (Greece) and the University Louis Pasteur-Strasbourg I (France).\r\n",
