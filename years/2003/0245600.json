Novikov, Boone\r\nand Higman showed deep connections between logic (especially the theory of\r\nrecursive functions) and group theory. A more recent work by Gromov and\r\nothers showed a connection between algorithmic and asymptotic properties\r\n(especially isoperimetric and  growth functions) of groups and the related\r\ntopological objects. The PIs found even more intimate connections between\r\ncomplexity of algorithms and asymptotic properties of groups. In particular,\r\nthey have characterized groups whose word problem is in NP in terms of Dehn\r\nfunctions and Higman embeddings, found an NP-complete group, etc.. The PIs\r\npropose to further study these connections, and their applications to some\r\noutstanding Burnside-type problems.  In particular, they propose to use\r\nHigman embeddings to construct finitely presented torsion groups and in the\r\nstudy of Dehn functions of metabelian groups. Another direction of their\r\nresearch deals with connections between geometry and structure of groups. In\r\nparticular, they propose to study the class of finite dimensional diagram\r\ngroups,  for dimension greater than two  which, they believe, include a large \r\nclass of groups acting ``nicely\" on cubical complexes. Structural properties of \r\nhyperbolic groups will also be under investigation.\r\n\r\n",
