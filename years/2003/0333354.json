 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a pair workshops to bring together scientists, engineers and data management system developers from a variety of disciplines and data management projects in the environmental sciences \"to identify methods and tools\" that may have applications beyond the disciplines for which they were developed and to explore how to promote their broader adoption.  The two workshops, and a period of electronic communication in between them, are intended (1) to collect, and publish, a set of best practices, tools, and lessons learned from experience in data management system development, (ii) as an experiment to see if it is possible to identify opportunities for consolidation and standardization in environmental data management systems, (iii) as a way for the environmental research and education community to make recommendations on how the issue of interoperability between environmental data systems should be addressed and promoted.  \r\n\r\nThe project will advance the discussion of how to address the issue of the interoperability of environmental data systems and increase the interactions between groups developing data systems in different environmental disciplines.  The main impacts are likely to be a strengthening of the data infrastructure of environmental research and education.  Easier and more extensive access to environmental data advances not only the ability to do research on societally relevant topics associated with the environment but also enhances the availability of data for decision-making. \r\n",
