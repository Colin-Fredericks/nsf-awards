 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this proposal is to develop systematic design tools that exploit, rather\r\nthan override, nonlinearities and structural properties in feedback systems. Encouraged by our\r\npreliminary results, we address the problems of observer design and robustness to unmodeled\r\ndynamics, which are crucial for practical applicability of nonlinear control techniques. The variety of\r\ndynamic phenomena in nonlinear systems have hampered constructive solutions to these problems.\r\nIn contrast, we pursue structure-specific designs which are tailored to inherent system properties\r\nand nonlinear phenomena. Our robust design tools exploit types of unmodeled dynamics and\r\nmultivariable structures to recover stability and performance achievable with nominal designs. Our\r\nobservers take advantage of nonlinearities to enhance observer convergence and to recover stability\r\nof full state-feedback designs in certainty-equivalence implementations.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with United Technologies Research Center, the PI will apply these design tools\r\nto emerging feedback problems in fuel cell power systems. Fuel cell technology is particularly suit-\r\nable for United States, because the wide geography makes centralized power networks prone to\r\nfailure, and the strict environmental regulations accentuate the necessity of clean power genera-\r\ntion.A major challenge for potential vehicular and portable power applications is the high-order,\r\ninterconnected, system structure, and severe nonlinearities, which arise from tight integration of\r\nsystem components and wide variations in the electric load. Robustness to unmodeled dynamics\r\nis crucial for reliability of low-order designs. Nonlinear observers are of great importance because\r\ncommercially available sensor technologies are not designed to operate in a fuel cell environment.\r\nThe study of fuel cells will set the stage for abstractions and broad design methodologies which will\r\nalso impact other technologies, such as computer networks, chemical processes, and fluid control\r\nproblems in aeroengines, where high-order system models and severe nonlinearities constitute an\r\nobstacle to efficient and reliable feedback designs.\r\n\r\nThe educational objective of the proposal is to make nonlinear concepts accessible to a wider\r\nspectrum of students. The PI will introduce a new course for undergraduates, and graduate stu-\r\ndents who wish to study nonlinear systems at an introductory level. This course will enhance the\r\nappreciation of nonlinear systems among practitioners of the future, and attract more students\r\nto our graduate research program. In collaboration with the New Visions Program of local school\r\ndistricts and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, we will include high-school students in project teams\r\nwith our undergraduates. Several pedagogical experiments and computer animations, detailed in\r\nthe proposal, will give them a motivating real-life exposure to dynamic phenomena and control\r\nconcepts.",
