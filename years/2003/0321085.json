 "awd_abstract_narration": "0321085\r\nJudex\r\nThis NSF-MRI proposal requests funds to purchase a high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanner (uCT), which will serve as a resource to enhance the research and education links between a significant number of interdisciplinary faculty from the departments of Anatomical Sciences, Anthropology, Biomedical Engineering, Brookhaven National Laboratories, Chemistry and Material Sciences (all affiliated with the Program in Biomedical Engineering).  While micro-computed tomography has been available for several years, the newly developed scanner has the ability to scan in-vivo, permitting longitudinal studies to examine how tissues grow or adapt to new functional challenges.  Further, due to its cone beam technology, the higher scanning speeds and extremely high resolutions will allow scientists to address unique research questions beyond the scope of current equipment. This scanner also possesses a significantly larger scanning chamber than previous generations of uCT scanners, thus allowing full three-dimensional reconstructions of organs and tissues without the need to compromise valuable specimens.",
