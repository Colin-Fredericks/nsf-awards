 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal concerns computational aspects of the study of surfaces in three \r\ndimensional space. The Knot Recognition Problem, a key example of such problems,  \r\nseeks a procedure to determine when two curves in 3-space can be deformed to one \r\nanother. Its computational complexity, the number of steps required to run such \r\nan algorithm, is still not completely understood. Investigations into this  \r\nproblem have revealed intriguing and unexpected connections between complexity \r\ntheory, low-dimensional topology, the question of how much area is required of a \r\nsurface spanning a  curve (a problem in differential geometry), and questions \r\nconcerning  how to construct surfaces with as few triangles as possible (part of \r\ncomputational geometry). The investigator plans to show that this  problem, \r\nalready known to be in a class of problems called NP, is also in a class called \r\ncoNP. He further aims to improve both upper and lower bounds on the running \r\ntimes known for this and related problems, and to explore connections to \r\ncomputational and differential geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree dimensional manifolds and the surfaces contained in them model objects \r\nthat are found in the world we live in. Their mathematical theory is both \r\nnatural and widely applicable.  Computational issues are playing an increasing \r\nrole in investigations in these areas. Computational complexity, a field in theoretical \r\ncomputer science, studies algorithms and their running times. Many important \r\nalgorithms have geometric components, and geometric methods can lead to insights \r\ninto efficient computation. Techniques originating in topology  and  geometry have led \r\nto improved algorithms in computer graphics, visualization, medical and molecular \r\nmodeling and image recognition.  The problems considered in this proposal concern the construction of algorithms to analyze the nature of geometrical objects, and the  analysis \r\nof the computational complexity of these algorithms. \r\n",
