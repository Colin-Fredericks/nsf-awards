 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project  aims to advance the fundamental knowledge and process technology for mass-production of lightweight, high-performance injection molded parts by creating synergistic marriage of two emerging technologies, i.e., nanocomposites and microcellular injection molding. Systematic experimental, analytical, and modeling studies will be conducted to identify the key processing parameters for microcellular injection molding with nanocomposites and their effects on materials properties and to advance the understanding and mathematical modeling of cell nucleation and growth in microcellular plastics with micro-/nano-scale particles and fibers.  Since 1976, plastics have been the most widely used materials in the U.S., surpassing steel, copper, and aluminum combined by volume. Among the various plastics processing methods, injection molding accounts for one-third of all polymers processed.\r\n\r\nThese  research activities and results will be incorporated into the polymer engineering curricula to stimulate students' interest in advanced research and education. Students of underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate in the research through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplement. Close collaboration with industrial partners via the industrial consortium and the Engineering Outreach Program will be emphasized to facilitate sharing of expertise and resources, validation of research outcome, transfer of technology, education of the workforce, and assessment of the economic gain. Successful execution of this research will have broad impacts in extending the industrial applications and adoption of nanocomposites and microcellular injection molding, ultimately helping the U.S. plastics industry to gain competitive edge in the global marketplace.\r\n",
