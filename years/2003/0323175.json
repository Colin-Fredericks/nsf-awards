 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this information technology (IT) project include familiarizing students and teachers with use of the technology resources, developing standards-based STM curriculum materials that incorporate these resources, preparing teachers to use the curriculum and exposing students to technology-related career options. \r\n\r\nThis project will introduce teachers and students from the Monterey Bay area of California to information technology skills through research experiences at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.  Working with marine biologists from laboratory's research staff, 30 participating middle and high school teachers will participate in 2.5-week biotechnology research investigations and learn how the technology is used to analyze data and answer scientific questions.  Teachers will be supported with follow-up meetings and classroom visits during the school year.\r\n\r\nDuring the three-year project technology-based instructional units that include DNA isolation and sequencing, biodiversity studies and environmental policy will be developed, field-tested and prepared for national dissemination through an interactive website.  The technology resources needed to support these units will be available to participating teachers, exposing over 5,000 local students, many from currently underserved populations, to relevant experiences with information technology.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
