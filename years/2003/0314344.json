 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is continuation of a successfully-developing cross-disciplinary program in synthetic organic chemistry, molecular recognition and supramolecular photochemistry.  The research aims to develop an efficient modular synthetic approach to a variety of elaborate multi-unit nanoscale objects assembled with the aid of photolabile molecular linkers and, therefore, capable of photoinduced disassembly.  At the core is the recently developed photo electron transfer-induced cleavage in substituted alpha-hydroxyalkyl dithiane and a family of related compounds.  Secondly, utilizing these photo-latches this group will develop novel photolabile nanoscale objects equipped with elements of molecular recognition that can be used in biological applications.  Specifically, the second goal will encompass the following two general directions: (i) self-assembled photolabile cages and capsules, (ii) photochemical amplification in externally sensitized photocleavable linkers for solid support combinatorial screening.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Andrei G. Kutateladze of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver, Denver.  Professor Kutateladze will focus his research on the development of new materials containing photo-cleavable nanoparticles.  This could have important ramifications in the fundamental understanding of the principles governing supramolecular organic photochemistry and molecular recognition, the results of this research will also have broader implications for applied biomedical sciences, including drug discovery and drug delivery.\r\n",
