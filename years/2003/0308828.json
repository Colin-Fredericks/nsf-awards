 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two parts of this project will contribute specific items of intellectual merit for the evaluation community: the development of a new type of assessment tools, and compilation of significant baseline data in a new area. In particular, the assessment items to be developed as part of this study will be appropriate not only for the study of QL, but for other areas that utilize multiple disciplines, institutional centers, and other non-conventional forms of curricular organization. Developing such assessment items will be challenging, but essential to collecting data that are aligned with the goals and standards of QL. New assessment items in combination with existing items from other projects will create a rich resource for data collection.\r\n\r\nThe baseline data will include the collection and evaluation of pilot data on QL Centers at their institutions. These data will focus on curriculum and course development, and faculty development. Because curriculum and faculty development are common to many educational innovations, the data collected-and methods used-will be directly transferable to other evaluation projects. However, the unique multi-disciplinary, center-based nature of QL means that other non-conventional endeavors will have new resources for data collection.\r\n\r\nExperiences from curricular reforms in calculus and other disciplines reveal that a supportive network can be used to promote buy-in by all affected individuals and groups. Therefore, an important part of the QL movement is the design and formation of the National Numeracy Network (NNN) to assist locales in which efforts are underway to translate QL from aspiration into educational practice, to disseminate promising practices, and to exchange information among existing and potential network sites. Planned activities of the network include professional development experiences and opportunities to learn about QL for educators and others and a Web site through which resources, information, and exchange of ideas regarding QL will be made accessible to the broadest possible audience. However, critical to the success of NNN are the development of standards for assessment of QL-both in terms of student learning and institutional programs. This project will begin this important process with the collection of baseline data necessary to judge the effectiveness of QL programs.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on different aspects of policy, practice, professional development, dissemination, and assessment, the National Numeracy Network will provide a catalyst for quantitative literacy, especially in grades 10 to 14. QL programs participating in the network already are working with organizations that can directly influence a wider audience to create public pressure for QL. NNN institutions and organizations are developing QL course materials and programs to share through professional development opportunities, the QL Resource Library, and the QL Web site. This project will play an important role in providing the information necessary to make QL education a reality.\r\n\r\n",
