 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Peter Lavrentyev and Robert Duff of the University of\r\nAkron to examine taxonomic composition of planktonic protists in relation to their key functions\r\nat the NOAA Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve (OWC NERR). Samples\r\nwill be collected from four stations along the stream-Lake Erie transect at monthly intervals in\r\nconjunction with the ongoing long-term monitoring. Microbial community structure,\r\ndistribution, and dynamics will be examined under different hydrologic and climatic conditions\r\nusing molecular, digital video, flow-cytometry, and microscopic methods. This study will\r\ngenerate a library of protistan images and ribosomal DNA sequences which will contribute novel\r\ntaxonomic and ecological data to the scientific community and publicly accessible databases.\r\nThe taxonomic survey will be supplemented by field experiments, which will examine the effect\r\nof differences in microbial community composition on two functional aspects of the community:\r\ngrowth and grazing.\r\nProtists (unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms) play an important role in aquatic ecosystems\r\nby regulating bacterial and primary production and regenerating the bulk of inorganic nutrients\r\nbut the relationship between their diversity and functions remains poorly understood. This study\r\nwill increase our knowledge of microbial life in critical estuarine/coastal wetland environments\r\nand improve our ability to predict complex and dynamic microbial processes in the Great Lakes\r\nand the coastal ocean. On a yet broader scale, the study will provide new insights about the\r\nrelationship between biodiversity and function in natural communities. Finally, this study will\r\nhave an impact on the infrastructure of education within the PIs institutions and beyond.\r\nStudents at UA and FIU involved in the project will experience a wide range of professional\r\nactivities and will be involved in all aspects of the research enterprise. In addition, this project\r\nwill provide information for the OWC NERR visitor center exhibit and thus contribute to the\r\ngeneral public understanding of the importance of preserving biodiversity and estuarine/wetland\r\nenvironments. The results of this study will be invaluable in informing decisions on conservation\r\nand environmental management these important habitats that have become increasing threatened.",
