 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve the accuracy of geological chronologies based on cosmogenic isotope data.  It combines research on computer models of the effects of various processes on the rate of accumulation of cosmogenic isotopes in geological formations, the development of a database of data (such as isotope abundances) and environmental parameters useful for cosmogenic isotope dating (such as solar output and the state of the terrestrial magnetic field at different times), and an artificial intelligence (AI) system to support the use of cosmogenic isotope accumulation models in dating.  The AI system will act as an expert system guiding the user in the choice of modeling tools and data, and integrating the selected models and data.  The combined AI/database/modeling system will be built using a component-based architecture to make it simpler to modify and extend as new processes and data sets are added.\r\n\r\nBecause of the central importance to geological inference of establishing the age of geological structures, this project, if successful should be helpful in a number of problems in research and applied geology.  The project will also strengthen the connections between the geological and computer science research communities, both by virtue of the collaboration itself and by demonstrating the potential for exploiting information technology to further geological research.",
