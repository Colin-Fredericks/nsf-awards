 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regional centers in manufacturing and information technology in the ATE program are to work closely with regional industry to increase the numbers of well-educated technicians.  This collaboration should change the way community colleges educate technicians and increase employer satisfaction with those students who become employees.  The Community College Research Center documents and evaluates the activities of the ATE regional centers in information technology and manufacturing to determine the extent to which and under what circumstances the regional centers are achieving the goals.  Among issues to be addressed are the structures and mechanisms to adapt and implement exemplary instructional materials into new contexts; the role of faculty as change agents in reform of programs, departments, institutions, and systems; and the process by which institutions build their capacity to address the challenge of educating a highly qualified technical workforce.  The methodology is a mix of quantitative measures, which use the data generated by the Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University, and qualitative measures, that include site visits to the regional centers interviewing students, faculty and administrators and also employers.  The report should be helpful to community colleges in their role in providing educational access to productive, long-term occupations and further education for a diverse population of students.",
