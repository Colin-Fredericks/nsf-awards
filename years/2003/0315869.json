 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme climate changes, including drought, limit the growth and productivity of many crop plants. Unfortunately, genetic approaches to decrease water loss in plants by altering basic metabolic pathways or decreasing gas exchange through the leaves have often negatively impacted plant growth under optimal conditions. To selectively increase tolerance to stress, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in sensing environmental stimuli. Lipids, specifically inositol phospholipids in the plasma membrane i.e., outermost membrane of a cell, provide an early sensing mechanism for changes in water potential. The overarching hypothesis is that by altering the mechanisms plants use to sense changes in water potential, one can selectively alter a plant's response to stress without compromising normal growth. This research will identify the specific proteins that regulate the metabolism of plasma membrane inositol phospholipids. The project will use a combined molecular, biochemical and cell biological approach to identify and characterize the genes and proteins regulating this plasma membrane sensing system. Once genes have been identified that predict plant responses to osmotic stress a genetic approach will generate plants with altered lipid metabolism and altered plant responses to drought.\r\n\r\nImportant fundamental outcomes of this project will be: 1) identification of selective proteins to target for improving plant responses to environmental stress such as drought; 2) increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which these proteins function to regulate membrane inositol phospholipids metabolism during stress response; 3) production of transgenic plants with predictably altered responses to environmental stimuli; 4) support for undergraduate and graduate research and training and the production of transgenic plants to be used as teaching material for undergraduate laboratories. \r\n",
