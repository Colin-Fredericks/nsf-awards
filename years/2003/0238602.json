 "awd_abstract_narration": "0238602\r\nLarsen\r\n\r\nThe UAF Experimental Petrology Laboratory is currently capable of performing experiments at conditions characteristic of shallow crustal magma chambers, to depths of ~20km (at T ~850 degrees C) and temperatures to ~1100 degrees C (at P ~200 MPa).   Funds from this grant will support the acquisition of a piston-cylinder apparatus that will enable us to perform experiments on crust and mantle-relevant compositions at pressures up to ~4000 MPa and temperatures to ~2000 degrees C.  Currently, many researchers rely upon this type of apparatus to address important questions relevant to understanding volcanic and tectonic processes, such as melt generation in the mantle at subduction zones and mid-oceanic ridges, cation and anion diffusion rates and element partitioning between minerals and melts, phase equilibria of important deep crustal and mantle minerals, and studies on materials appropriate for other planetary environments.  The acquisition of the piston-cylinder apparatus will serve an important purpose in extending the range of experiments possible on existing NSF supported projects within the volcanology group at the UAF Geophysical Institute.  In addition, it will open the door for those interested in other aspects of high-pressure research on crustal and mantle rocks relevant to the Earth, as well as other planetary systems. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
