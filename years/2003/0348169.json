The organizers are Dr. Mohamed El-Shall, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, Dr. Mostafa El-Sayed, Professor of Chemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia and Dr. Hany El-Nazer, President of the National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  The objectives of the workshop are to: 1) discuss the state of the art of laser technology in research in both countries; 2) address the fundamental science and technology of laser chemistry; the applications in materials including nanostructures, thin films, terahertz spectroscopy, nonlinear optical properties, material shaping, surface modifications and applications in biomedical research, including characterization and imaging of tissues, and 3) stimulate cooperative research in the field of lasers between American and Egyptian scientists. Areas of fundamental science and technology of lasers to be covered will include spectroscopy, photochemistry, materials applications, nonlinear optics, nanostructures, and thin films.  Areas of research to be addressed are: 1. lasers and properties, applications in fundamental science. 2. applications to materials and 3. applications in biological and medical sciences. The final session will include a panel discussion of the outstanding problems in the fields of particular interest for development in Egypt, and the plans for joint projects and research collaboration.   \r\n\r\nScope:  This is an interdisciplinary workshop with participants and speakers from chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biological and medical fields.  It will allow scientists from the U. S. and Egypt to exchange experiences, ideas, and information and to build collaborations to promote laser technology with potential mutual benefits. The synergism produced by bringing together the researchers in these areas is expected to enhance the collaboration between the two countries and to take the field of laser science and technology a step closer towards realizing its enormous potential for novel technologies, and to economic developments involving the private sectors in Egypt and the US.  Support is planned for 15 prominent U.S. researchers who will address important issues, and who will help define future joint research.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities, with partial support from the Division of Materials Research.  \r\n",
