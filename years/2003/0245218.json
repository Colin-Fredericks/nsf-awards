 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project, jointly run by Carnegie Mellon and General Motors, focuses on the development of computational tools to express product brand.  The technology, known as shape grammars, requires unique approaches to computer implementation.  The four main contributions from this work will be 1) furthering the science of shape grammar implementation, 2) further understanding of the logic of brand, 3) articulation of design objectives for aesthetics through a mathematical (utility) function in conjunction with optimizing search strategies, and 4) further advancement of the field of automated design synthesis.\r\n\r\nThe approach will be as follows: 1) Create a shape grammar that captures the core views of a product, in this case a vehicle of a given brand. 2) Provide an inter-relation between those different views. 3) Use the inter-relation between the 2D views to create a 3D grammar of the product and its brand. 4) Create computer technology to enable implementation of the 2D views. 5) Specify the technological requirements of a 3D implementation. 6) Use an optimization-based search strategy to automate the generation of products that fit within a brand. 7) Use a utility based decision tool to select among the generated designs and tune the automated algorithm.  All of the findings of this work are general, with broader impacts that go even beyond the auto industry.  The goal is to help companies better understand their brand identity, place their contemporary styling within the context of their historical product line, and provide a clear communication between engineers and industrial designers/stylists.  One graduate student will have extended visits to GM each summer over the life of the project. GM will in effect serve as a test-bed for this award.\r\n",
