 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the synthesis of hydroxy phosphonates with high enantiomeric excess, the structural elaboration of hydroxy phosphonates and synthesis of phosphonates via palladium coupling to P(O)-H and P(O)-Cl systems.  The reactions developed for the elaboration of allylic hydroxy phosphonates will be applied to the synthesis of ceramide analogs. \r\n \r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Christopher D. Spilling in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis.  Professor Spilling will focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the catalytic, asymmetric phosphonylation of aldehydes and on the discovery of new transformations of allylic hydroxy phosphonates for the synthesis of biologically active molecules.  The research has broader impact for medicinal chemistry and the agricultural industry.  Further, the project will provide an excellent opportunity for the training of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n",
