 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Eastern New Mexico University provides 20 scholarships for students in the targeted areas of mathematical sciences, computer science, and electronics engineering technology. This project develops develop sustainable infrastructure and assessment-based methodologies for improving the graduation chances, employment opportunities, and quality of learning for the ENMU Department of Mathematical Sciences students.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this program promotes success through the Department of Mathematical Sciences' dedication to student learning and its focus on student centered learning.   The project provides a comprehensive, sustainable, assessment-based, academically progressive plan for project implementation. The project implementation plan includes recruitment, a candidate selection process, a retention-based educational process, work placement skills instruction, optional internship opportunities, and an internal and external dissemination plan.\r\n\r\nThe project makes effective use of existing ENMU support structures, creates new structures, and enhances existing structures to meet project needs. The project utilizes and enhances existing student support structures during the process of recruitment and admissions, tutoring, advising, retention, internship, and high-technology job placement of graduates. By using and enhancing existing ENMU resources, the quality and efficiency of the project increases, the sustainability of the project methodologies is improved, and it allows the CSEMS Principal Investigators to focus on other project functions. The program creates a Learning Community composed of CSEMS scholars and other Department of Mathematical Sciences students. The CSEMS Learning Community is implemented within the Eastern Learning Community program. Working together with instructors and other students in a collaborative learning environment enables students to make connections, form friendships, and accomplish their educational goals. The integration between courses and increased opportunities for interaction outside the classroom makes the learning communities a valuable learning experience for the CSEMS scholar.\r\n",
