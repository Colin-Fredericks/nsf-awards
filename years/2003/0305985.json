 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe main theme of the proposed work is on understanding the widespread\r\nphenomenon of dynamic scaling in extended physical systems, building\r\non stability analysis of coherent structures such as self-similar\r\nsolutions, nonlinear wave pulses and vortices. The paradox of dynamic\r\nscaling laws is that typically they can be predicted by back of the\r\nenvelope calculations, yet defy rigorous analysis for years.\r\nWe will study scaling and stability in a variety of problems of high\r\ncurrent interest: the trend to self-similar behavior in Smoluchowski's\r\nmean-field model of coagulation; scaling and stability of fingering\r\npatterns in viscous fluid flows; models of domain coarsening in phase\r\ntransitions; existence and stability of solitary waves in\r\ninfinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems; and stability of Bose-Einstein condensates with vortices. The work will involve the development of improved methods for stability analysis in nonlinear systems, for the rigorous analysis and numerical computation of self-similar solutions and nonlinear waves, and for physical modeling of step-terrace structures on crystalline surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe general aim of this work is to improve understanding of large-scale\r\ndynamic behavior in complex systems.  We aim to develop new and effective mathematical methods and concepts for the modeling and analysis of dynamic behavior in a variety of problems of high scientific interest. We study fundamental mathematical models for the large-scale dynamics of: agglomeration of small particles; mixing patterns in viscous fluid flow; microscopic structure of metallic alloys and semiconductor surfaces; waves on fluid interfaces; and quantum vortices in super-cold gases.  Many issues that will be investigated are of fundamental interest in condensed-matter physics, aerosol physics, chemical engineering, and materials science.\r\n\r\n",
