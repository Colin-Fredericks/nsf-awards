 "awd_abstract_narration": "0335110\r\nWillner\r\n\r\nUltra-small photonic crystal structures have emerged as a potentially critical technology due to their promise of small size, ability to perform many functions on a single chip, and low cost. However, key challenges remain in order to match specific fabrication designs to system performance.\r\n\r\nThe PI will combine expertise in optoelectronic device fabrication (CalTech) and optical systems design (USC) to link these unique structures with potential revolutionary applications. He intends to innovate a common technology platform that can: (i) accommodate different types of devices, (ii) provide monolithic integration, and (iii) operate simultaneously on many wavelengths. He will emphasize that these devices will generate and process an optical signal in new and exciting ways.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will concentrate on: \r\n(a)\tclassical networks: enabling all-optical data-packet processing for =40 Gbit/s signals, including: correlation, header recognition, AND/OR/XOR logic, addition, and check-sum.\r\n(b)\tquantum networks: enabling highly-secure communications by secret-key single-photon generation and transmission. We will determine the effects of fiber dispersion, PMD and nonlinearities.\r\nHe will build \"nanophotonic chips\" that include: (i) quantum dot lasers, and (ii) optically-pumped nanocavity logic gates with gain.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The research will help remove key obstacles that may prevent the realization of ultra-high-performance and highly-secure future dynamic all-optical networks. The PI will also make strides towards a single, integrated materials platform for many types of applications.\r\n\r\nEducational Impact: The PI will provide a multidisciplinary collaborative environment that will incorporate students from: (a) Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships and Minority Undergraduate Research Fellowships, and (b) USC's Undergraduate Research Merit Scholars Program.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This vertically-integrated collaboration between device and systems groups will find a connection between device parameters and systems performance.  Moreover, developing a common materials platform is a significant step forward, as is finding building blocks for packet-based classical and quantum networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
