The Roundtable consists of 30-35 chemical scientists and engineers from academia, industry, private organizations, federal agencies and laboratories.  The CSR will address by regular meetings and workshops crosscutting issues in the chemical sciences.  It will discuss and explore research, education, and economic issues important to the chemical community.  The overall purpose is to foster progress and strengthen the infra structure for U.S. chemical science and technology by bringing together a broad representative group from many sectors.  It will disseminate its deliberations via publications.  The charter of CSR prohibits it from making formal recommendations to any government funding or regulatory body.  Its structure allows for open and uninhibited commentary on important topics that will stimulate further studies and initiatives as appropriate.  Workshops are under consideration during the grant award on topics with a chemical orientation such as globalization, water and sustainable development, education, academic entrepreneurship, security, law and communicating chemical issues to the public.\r\n",
