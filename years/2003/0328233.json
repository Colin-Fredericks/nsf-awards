 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0202796. PI: Dan Knopf\r\n\r\nMy research centers on geometric evolution\r\nequations, notably the Ricci flow and related curvature flows. I plan\r\nto study seven areas in which I have obtained prior results, and where\r\ncontinued work is likely to yield new and useful mathematics. [1] When \r\na flow converges, it is valuable to study the stability of its limit, in\r\norder to improve our global understanding of the dynamics of flows. [2] If\r\na flow fails to converge but behaves in a nonsingular way, one can still\r\nstudy the dynamics of this collapse by classifying the asymptotic behavior\r\nof nearby solutions. [3] In most cases, a flow does become singular; so it\r\nis of paramount importance (particularly in regard to Hamilton's program\r\nto resolve Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture) to develop a better\r\nclassification of singularities. [4] The basic method of studying\r\nsingularities is the construction of a sequence of parabolic dilations\r\n(blow-ups). To take limits of these solutions, one must obtain (partial)\r\ninjectivity radius estimates by various means. [5] The most powerful (but\r\nperhaps most difficult) way to obtain such injectivity radius estimates\r\nwould be to study and extend existing Harnack estimates of the type\r\npioneered by Li and Yau and further developed by Hamilton. [6] It is \r\nalso useful to study the asymptotic behavior and stability of parabolic\r\ndilations at certain model singularities (a method which has been very\r\nfruitful in studying the mean curvature flow). [7] Further information\r\nabout singularities can be obtained by constructing and studying solitons:\r\nself-similar solutions that often arise as limits of blow-ups. Moreover,\r\nKaehler Ricci solitons have interesting connections with complex geometry\r\nand algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeometric evolution studies the way an\r\nobject's shape changes. In some cases, such as the mean curvature flow and\r\nporous media flow, the motivation is to model certain physical phenomena\r\nsuch as the motion of an interface in forming metallic alloys, the shape\r\nof a thin film of highly viscous oil, or the flow of oil in shale. In\r\nother cases, the goal is to improve the shape of an object, either to find\r\noptimal (most efficient) shapes, or else to help mathematicians recognize\r\nand classify geometric objects. My own research is part of a large program\r\nto resolve one of the most compelling open questions in mathematics: the\r\ndesire to understand and classify all possible 3-dimensional shapes. But\r\nregardless of whether their motivation comes from material science or pure\r\nmathematics, all geometric evolution problems have much in common; so that\r\nthe field benefits from rich cross-fertilization. In particular, ideas and\r\ntechniques that are developed for any of these highly nonlinear problems\r\nare usually quickly adaptable to related applications.\r\n",
