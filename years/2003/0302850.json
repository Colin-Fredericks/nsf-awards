 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is for planning Cal-OPTEC (Optics and Photonics Technology Education Center) as an ATE Regional Center, the purpose of which is to improve photonics curriculum for community colleges as well as address critical long-term labor shortages in the industry.   To be launched by the California Photonics Consortium (a group of community colleges, baccalaureate institutions, industry representatives, a national laboratory, and workforce agencies), Cal-OPTEC works under five goals:  1) To increase the number of students seeking postsecondary education in photonics; 2) To enhance instructor knowledge of photonics; 3) To improve curriculum in the areas of laser technology, precision optics fabrication, and fiber optics technology; 4) to enrich the availability and efficacy of photonics programs; and 5) to expand linkages among community colleges, industry, high schools, and baccalaureate institutions.   \r\n\r\nCal-OPTEC intends to accomplish these goals by exposing youth, parents, counselors, and displaced workers to the opportunities and education needed in the field; by providing professional development for high school and community college instructors; by expanding, improving, reviewing, and packaging curriculum in three photonics areas; by working with industry to monitor the needs of the California photonics industry, and initiate new programs far enough in advance to fill industry's needs for skilled workers; and by improving communication among photonics interests in California.  The results of these efforts will lead to a well-developed curriculum in three technical areas that is transportable and articulated with high schools and baccalaureate, an educated pool of high school and community college instructors, and well-trained workers in sufficient numbers to support the photonics industry's growth and global competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe planning project will bring together the partners in sessions to work out the details of the way such a Regional Center should be constructed.\r\n",
