 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research studies tree identification methods among the Aguaruna Jivaro, an indigenous group of the Peruvian Amazon.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that many tropical forest peoples can identify tree species simply by observing the visual, olfactory and gustatory characteristics of the trunk and bark This stands in contrast to the identification methods outlined in Western taxonomic keys that rely heavily on floral, fruit and leaf characteristics to make tree identifications. Fruit and floral characteristics show a high degree of similarity among trees of the new world tropics, making them more problematic for use in identifying these trees. Additionally, they tend to appear seasonally, and may be difficult to reach if they are high up in the canopy.  For this reason, indigenous methods of tree identification, especially those involving trunk characteristics, would be useful to study.  However, to date, little in depth research exists on the ways that indigenous peoples recognize and identify the organisms in their local environments.  This project will address the question: What are the perceptual and ecological clues that allow the Aguaruna to recognize and identify tropical forest trees? Broader impacts: Aside from contributing to the education of a young social scientist, the research findings will also be beneficial for tropical forestry and conservation projects in the Peru and adjacent countries by adding to efforts to find easier methods for identifying new world tropical trees based on sterile characteristics.\r\n\r\n",
