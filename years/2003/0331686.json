 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  Texas  A&M  System  Louis  Stokes  Alliance  for  Minority  Participation  Phase  III \r\n(TAMUS  LSAMP  III) program proposes to  nurture the future. The program will \r\nendeavor to sustain and extend hard-won academic gains in retention and learning \r\noutcomes for under-represented minority (URM) students in science, technology, \r\nengineering and math (STEM) disciplines, which have been achieved in partner \r\ninstitutions  during  TX  LSAMP  Phase  I  and  II.  However,  the  foremost  aim  of  the \r\nproposed program will be, to advance the preparation of under-represented minority \r\n(URM) students in science, technology,  engineering  and math (STEM) fields for \r\nprogression to STEM graduate degree programs and to K-12 teaching in STEM subjects. \r\nLed by three veteran TX  LSAMP partners, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for \r\nAcademic  and Student Affairs Texas A&M University System (TAMU System) the \r\nproposed Texas  LSAMP Phase  III program  will extend participation in its central \r\nactivities to the students of six additional TAMU System universities.   \r\n \r\nThe proposed TAMUS LSAMP III will be a five-year, three-pronged program.  \r\nThe first prong  of  the  program  features  initial  two-year  pilot  strategies  for \r\nconducting and modeling new, and institutionalizable .Pipeline  Repair. tactics, which \r\nare  intended  to  help  renew  endangered  URM  STEM  enrollment  of  new  students  at \r\nTAMU  and  Prairie  View,  because  these  institutions  enroll  and  graduate  the  largest \r\npopulations of URM STEM undergraduates in the TAMU system.  \r\nThe second prong of the TAMUS  LSAMP  III program will include the core \r\n.Undergraduate  Student  Development.  strategies, which  will  be open  to  students  of \r\nall Alliance institutions. The strategies of this prong will operate throughout the five \r\nyears of the TAMUS LSAMP III program. This prong will aim first, to advance retention, \r\nand academic attainment by improving the self-direction (self efficacy) of STEM URM \r\nstudents, and then, to improve the quality of learning for URM STEM students, and \r\nhence their persistence toward  graduation,  and progression, through undergraduate \r\nresearch and teaching experiences.  \r\nThe  third  prong may  be characterized as  .Graduate  School  and  Teaching \r\nArticulation..    It  will  consist  of  strategies  for  proactively  negotiating  an  assisted \r\ntransition of TAMUS  LSAMP students to STEM graduate programs,  and preferably \r\nthose with strong systems to support URM student success, as well as encouraging and \r\nassisting URM STEM students pursue professional K-12 teaching. These strategies of \r\nthis prong will be implemented in years three through five and will be made available to \r\ntarget population students from all TAMU System  LSAMP campuses. What all three-\r\nprogram  prongs  will  have  in  common  is  the  commitment  to  seeding  URM  STEM \r\nstudents with forward-looking, ambitious perspectives toward life-long learning.",
