 "awd_abstract_narration": "WHYNET: Scalable Testbed for Next Generation Mobile Wireless Networking Technologies\r\nThe next generation of wireless communication technology is likely to rely on cross-layer interactions\r\nthat extend from the application layer down to the physical devices. This project proposes to design and\r\ndevelop WHYNET, a Wireless HYbrid NETwork testbed to facilitate detailed study of such interactions and\r\ntheir impact on application level performance in heterogeneous wireless systems. The eventual technical\r\nimpact of this testbed will be to redefine how specific innovations in wireless communication technologies are\r\nevaluated in terms of their potential to improve application-level performance as well as how alternative\r\napproaches are compared with each other. Its broader impact will be to redefine how students are trained in\r\nwireless technologies by providing a multi-disciplinary 'hands on' environment to complement purely\r\ntheoretical classroom training.\r\n\r\nWHYNET is envisaged as a hybrid testbed that combines the realism of physical testing with the\r\nscalability and flexibility of simulations. The hybrid testbed will be a networked federation of geographically\r\ndistributed, heterogeneous wireless physical testbeds with multiple protocol stacks (CDMA 2000 cellular and IP), next generation physical technologies including UWB (Ultra Wide Band), MIMO (Multiple Inputs,\r\nMultiple Outputs) and SDR (Software Defined Radios), and a parallel & distributed multi-tool simulation\r\nframework. Beyond providing a more accurate & flexible evaluation framework, the hybrid testbed will\r\nfacilitate a smooth transition from an abstract simulation model to an operational implementation within a\r\nsingle framework. For instance, protocol prototypes can communicate with simulated lower layers for\r\nrepeatable results, or receive and process variable rate real multimedia application inputs for perceptual\r\nevaluation. Once the physical hardware devices are ready for testing, a portion of the target network system\r\ncan be configured with real devices while the rest of the network can still reside in the simulated hardware\r\ndomain. The effort will also generate a repository of wireless networking scenarios, measurements, models\r\nand implementations. A representative set of studies will be used to demonstrate the unique contributions of\r\nWHYNET for cross-layer optimization studies in particular, and mobile wireless networking in general. These include sensor networks, energy-aware networking, protocols & middleware for multi-access networking, and adaptive transport and security protocols. The testbed itself will be accessible by the research community via a web-based mechanism that will allow remote uploading of models, implementations, and configurations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is likely to have a broader impact on two fronts: the training of future generation\r\nof wireless engineers and wireless technology standards. Wireless engineers will need significant technical\r\ndepth to contribute to a rapidly developing technology and significant technical breadth to understand how this\r\ntechnology fits into a market driven economy. The latter category requires engineers who are trained in\r\ninsystemslt aspects with an in-depth understanding of trade-offs and interactions across layers of a wireless\r\ncommunication system. The current course structure is not designed to produce well-trained engineers of the\r\nsecond type. The project team feels strongly that broad systems training can only be accomplished in i.hands-\r\nonlo experimental courses or projects where the students see the tradeoffs involved in real system design. The proposed testbed can enable these types of courses across the curriculum. Even though today wireless is a\r\nvertical technology, 4-5 years from now, the most interesting and challenging problems will be those related to wireless systems, so we believe that an inter-disciplinary yet closely-knit engineering program such as ours is well suited for the training of wireless engineer of tomorrow. By providing a scalable platform, methodology, and tools to support objective and accurate evaluation of protocol and technology alternatives, we expect that the testbed will also play an important role in shaping standards activity in IETF and related bodies.\r\n\r\nA multi-disciplinary, multi-institution team has been formed to achieve the ambitious objectives of the\r\nWHYNET project. The team members have substantial expertise in design and management of physical and\r\nsimulation testbeds (Bagrodia, Gerla, Rao, Takai), development of novel radio technology (Daneshrad, Fitz,\r\nMitra), wireless systems (Mitra, Rao, Srivastava), protocol design (Gerla, Krishnamurthy, Mohapatra, Royer, Shen, Srivastava, Tripathi) and performance evaluation (Bagrodia, Gerla, Molle, Rao, Tripathi). Many of thePIs have successfully worked together on previous collaborative projects. We have also received strong support from a number of companies that play a critical role in this space including Microsoft, Hughes\r\nResearch Laboratories (now part of Boeing), ST Electronics, HP, Ericsson, Intel, and Xtreme Spectrum.",
