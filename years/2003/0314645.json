 "awd_abstract_narration": "The action potential is the universal signal in the nervous system throughout the animal kingdom. Action potentials are very similar in different parts of the nervous system and between different animals. Information is instead encoded in the frequency and temporal pattern of series of action potentials. Several factors contribute to generating these patterns. Among these, the diversity of ion channels carrying, potassium (K+) ions, known as K+ channels, is one of the main factors contributing to the shaping of neural signals.  A large number of new K+ channels have been discovered recently through genetic molecular analysis. Additional discoveries can be expected as the full sequence of the genomes of several animals becomes known. A major task of future research is to understand the physiological roles of these channels.  \r\nThis project will study a new K+ channel gene family, known as EAG, recently identified and cloned from flies and mammals.  The products of EAG genes have been introduced into model cells, where they result in the formation of K+ channels with unique and intriguing functional properties. The task is to determine if they have the same properties in their native environment in the brain and to unravel their roles in neural signaling. To discover the functional roles of EAG channels, experiments are designed to explore which brain cells normally contain the products of the genes encoding these channels. Electrophysiological techniques are then used to study their properties in native cells, and their role in shaping neuronal signals.  Previous investigations in the applicant's laboratory have shown that several EAG gene products are particularly prominent in neurons in the cerebral cortex, and their unique distributions suggest that EAG channels play specific roles in particular cortical circuits. This project will test the hypothesis that EAG channels have crucial functions in regulating the state of excitability of specific cortical neurons, including determining whether or not sensory information enters the cerebral cortex and hence in modulating states of consciousness.  This study will contribute to the unraveling of the function of novel K+ channel genes and advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which the brain processes information.  This study will contribute to the development of methods to discover the roles of newly found genes, and multidisciplinary training to a graduate student.\r\n\r\n",
