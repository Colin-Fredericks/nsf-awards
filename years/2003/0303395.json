 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration between the groups of R. Doherty and S. Kalinindi at Drexel University and F. Landgraf at the Institute of Technological Research (IPT) in Sao Paolo, Brazil examines the evolution of texture during plastic deformation of electrical steels. The project focuses on the retention of the desirable <100> fiber texture normal to the sheet in rolled and recrystallized Fe-Si electrical steel. This texture is known to be the ideal texture of motor cores that are radially magnetized. A related effort on the modeling of the magnetic properties of the textured steel is carried out by M. Sablik, Southwest Research Institute, and C. Gutierrez, Southwest Texas State University, in collaboration with the Brazilian group. The research examines the development of the deformation microstructure, on a grain-by-grain basis, in fully characterized, directionally solidified, Fe-Si columnar samples, during plane strain compression. The compression is applied along the fiber axis.  The objectives are (i) to develop the insights required for fully predictive models and  (ii) to provide samples in which the microstructure, relevant for recrystallization, has been characterized as a function of deformation. \r\n\r\nThe processing method, developed for the scientifically studied columned-grained ingots, is then, in close collaboration with the Brazilian group, applied to the industrially important twin-roll cast sheets. The final technical objective is improved electrical motor steel. In addition this project increases further the scientific and education interaction with the group in Brazil, adding a valuable education experience for the students in both countries. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
