 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop titled \"NSF Workshop on Nanoscale Mechanical Engineering\" to be held at NSF on June 15-16, 2003 is being proposed.  The goals of the workshop are to foster the continued emergence of nanotechnology as a major focus area within the mechanical engineering community; to identify the critical sub-areas within nanotechnology to which mechanical engineers will make key contributions; to address to what extent the emergence of nanotechnology will require a paradigm shift in mechanical engineering education; and to recommend to NSF the steps it can take to nurture this transformation.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of approximately 30 invited talks, a poster session, and a panel session/open forum. The invited talks will give highlights of research in areas including nanofabrication, nanomechanics, nanoscale transport, nanoscale imaging, and nanoparticles and nanostructured materials. Speakers will be drawn from both academia and industry.  The panel session/open forum will have as its object the development of specific recommendations regarding what the mechanical engineering community can do, and what NSF can do, to foster the continued development of nanoscale mechanical engineering.  Following the meeting a report will be prepared summarizing the Workshop and detailing the recommendations that emerge. This report will be provided to NSF and posted on the NSF web site.\r\n",
