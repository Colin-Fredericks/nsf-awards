The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Auburn University (Lead Institution), Wayne State University, NASA, Alabama Power Company, Alabama Development Office, City of Auburn, Bessemer Chamber of Commerce, Montgomery Chamber of Commerce, Renascens Company, Resource Innovations, United States Steel Corporation, Golden Flake Snack Food Company, Southern Sales & Marketing Group, BOWATER Company, Capitol Vial, GTI, McPherson Oil Products, Southern Ductile, American Cast Iron Pipe Company, Barber's Dairies, Citation Foam Casting Company, Foundry Coatings, Haldex Friction, Jenkins Brick, Mason Corporation, Neptune Technology Group, Riverside Refractories, Sloss Industries, SMC South, Southern Foundry Products, Southern Foundry Resins, Specialty Wood Products, Teksid Aluminum Components, U.S. Pipe, Vulcan Materials, and Wayne Industries.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this partnership is to facilitate the transformation of knowledge into innovations that will create new wealth and strengthen the regional economy in the area. A Knowledge Sharing System based on the latest information technology will be developed to expedite technology transfer. Students, faculty, and county technology outreach agents will use this new system to transfer knowledge from academic and federal research laboratories to regional industry in a systematic and efficacious manner. A diverse technologically literate workforce will be trained in modern manufacturing technologies and processes. Educational outreach in the form of short courses will be available to keep industrial partners at the state-of-the-art in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nAlabama has lost over 48,000 jobs from over 273 plant layoffs and closings since 1998. The state has a very poor record of technology transfer and commercialization, especially for manufacturing companies. The state sees diversified manufacturing as being very significant in their economic future. The proposed effort of knowledge transfer, workforce education and training, and establishment of a strong enabling infrastructure for sustainable innovation will provide jobs and a workforce to perform those jobs. This will result in economic and societal well being in the state.  The effort will improve the competitiveness of the existing manufacturing sector and bring new manufacturing companies into the state.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in advances in knowledge through fundamental research in engineering in general and manufacturing in particular and in establishing a model for technology transfer and industrial outreach.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity include educational diversity, educational outreach to industry, and regional economic development to ensure long-term sustainability of economic and societal well-being. Underrepresented groups will be represented in the activities of the award.\r\n",
