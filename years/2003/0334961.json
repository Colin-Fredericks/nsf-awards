 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nEF-0334961\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Dr. Maureen Kearney and Dr. Olivier Rieppel of the Field Museum of Natural History to study the evolutionary history of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes).  With over 7,700 species, squamates are the second largest group of terrestrial vertebrates.  Many critical questions in squamate evolution remain unresolved, such as identification of the most primitive lineage of squamates, the origin of snakes, and the relationships of venomous snakes to other snake lineages.  An international team of eight investigators from diverse institutions (Brigham Young University, Field Museum of Natural History, San Diego State University, State University of New York-Stony Brook, University of Adelaide, University of Texas-Austin, and Yale University) will collaborate to resolve squamate relationships.  Anatomical data from living and fossil forms will be combined with DNA sequences from 50 genes for 142 representative squamate species.  Anatomical data will be obtained using traditional methods, as well as new technology such as high resolution X-ray CT scanning.  DNA data will be generated by incorporating new tools and databases from recent vertebrate genome projects. Drs. Kearney and Rieppel will be responsible for the collection of anatomical data for extant and fossil species, and Dr. Jessica Maisano (University of Texas-Austin, subcontracted through the Field Museum) will be responsible for the CT-scanning portion of the research. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the evolutionary history of squamate reptiles is critical for a complete picture of vertebrate evolution and ecology.  Venomous snakes pose an important threat to human safety in many parts of the world, and identification is critical for effective treatment; an innovative web-site will be produced allowing snakebite victims and medical workers to identify the venomous snakes in their area.  Postdoctoral researchers and students will be involved in all aspects of this project; thus the training of many future biologists and educators will be supported.\r\n\r\n",
