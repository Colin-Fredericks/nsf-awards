 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the production of cement-based materials for residential\r\nconstruction using extrusion so as to produce functionally graded microstructures and then\r\nmeasure and compute the engineering properties provided by such microstructures. The\r\n two primary objectives are: to develop construction components (e.g., siding) with graded cellular\r\nstructures that are highly porous in the center and dense on the outer surface, thereby reducing the\r\ndensity without producing high permeability and low strength usually associated with highly\r\nporous materials and to produce components (e.g., beams) with graded fiber\r\nreinforcement such that highest concentration of fibers occurs at the bottom of the beam where\r\nthe tensile strain is greatest, thereby taking advantage of the substantial mechanical benefits of\r\nfibers in extruded cement-based composites with a lower overall fiber volume through efficient\r\nengineering of the microstructure. Co-extrusion of multiple constituents and multiple cycles of\r\nextrusion will be used to process these materials. Specimens will be examined using scanning\r\nelectron microscopy to determine whether the processing is producing the desired\r\nmicrostructures. Engineering properties (modulus, Poisson ratio, strength, fracture toughness)\r\nwill be computed based on microscopic and macroscopic scales. The computed properties will be\r\ncompared with measured properties and with observed microstructures so as to demonstrate\r\nvalidity of the computation and to refine the computational method as needed. \r\n\r\nA relevant broad impact of the proposed research is its potential to increase the use of advanced\r\ncement-based materials in residential construction. These materials have important advantages\r\nover the more traditional wood-based materials (fire resistance, durability), however, their use has\r\nbeen limited by their high density and low toughness, issues addressed directly by this research.\r\nAn industrial advisory group will help assure that the research is suitably innovative, industrially\r\nfeasible, and economically viable  The proposed research will also impact education, adding studies of residential\r\nconstruction in the civil engineering curriculum and making studies of construction materials\r\navailable to students in architecture.\r\n",
