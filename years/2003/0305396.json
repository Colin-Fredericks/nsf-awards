 "awd_abstract_narration": "\\This soft condensed matter physics project will investigate two types of statistically sized, non-thermal systems, in which individual elements are large enough that thermal fluctuations play no role in the dynamics.  In such systems, definitions and meanings of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature can require new approaches.  The two systems are physically quite different: Fluidized granular media versus crumpled elastic sheets.  In both systems, experiments probe the equivalence of temperatures defined by fluctuations of various dynamical and kinematic quantities.  Further, frequency-dependent mechanical susceptibilities will be measured to examine whether the time-dependence of the fluctuations also determine bulk mechanical linear response via generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.  One of the experiments is also designed to study spatial correlations in the fluctuations, since there are indications that spontaneously formed linear structures known as force-chains may play an important role in stress transmission even in the flowing state of granular media.  Graduate students will be exposed to a variety of techniques such as high-speed video imaging, diffusing-wave light scattering, stress measurements, fluorescence microscopy, and acoustic measurements.  Some projects are reserved for undergraduate students who have been integral to research efforts under prior NSF support.  The new research results are disseminated via a website and are incorporated in a new graduate course in soft condensed matter physics that is co-taught with UMass colleagues.\r\n\r\nExperiments are proposed to study the statistical behaviors of systems with large numbers of large particles, to which conventional techniques of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics do not apply.  The two physical systems studied are fluidized granular media and crumpled elastic sheets.  Other systems in which similar issues arise are foams, suspensions, emulsions, all of which are technologically important.  The experiments will probe whether concepts such as temperature and entropy can be extended to out-of-equilibrium systems such as these.  Further, the project will study whether the relationship of temperature to the response of a material to external forces can be extended far away from equilibrium.  Graduate students will be exposed to a variety of techniques such as high-speed video imaging, diffusing-wave light scattering, stress measurements, fluorescence microscopy, and acoustic measurements.
