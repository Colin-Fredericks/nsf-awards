 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rawdon\r\n     The investigator, collaborators, and students study\r\ndifferent knot energy functions and their optimal configurations.\r\nSpecific topics include: characterizing the shape of ropelength\r\nminima; finding relationships between the optima of different\r\nenergy functions; studying polygonal energy optima as a function\r\nof the number of edges; determining the role of flexibility in\r\npulling knots tight and in packing them efficiently; exploring\r\nthe structure of polygonal knot space near ropelength minima;\r\ndetermining relationships between different notions of polygonal\r\nropelength.\r\n     From the massive knots of cosmic strings to the microscopic\r\ntangling of DNA, knotting and tangling are a part of nature.  One\r\nphysical attribute of a type of knot is its minimum ropelength\r\n(i.e. the amount of one-inch radius perfectly flexible rope\r\nneeded to tie a configuration of the given type of knot).  The\r\nidea of ropelength has been used by biologists, physicists, and\r\nmathematicians to predict the packing of helical DNA, the speed\r\nat which knotted DNA moves through gel, and the average shape of\r\na knot within a large population of different configurations.\r\nWhat is so special about ropelength-minimizing conformations that\r\nthey predict the behavior of real physical knots?  What spatial\r\nattributes influence this behavior?  Furthermore, real physical\r\nmaterials have inherent limitations, such as resistance to\r\nbending.  How does one incorporate inflexibility into\r\nmathematical models of macromolecules?  How does the flexibility\r\nof the material affect how the knot tightens and how long lengths\r\npack into small spaces?  In particular, can this knowledge be\r\nused to design knot-making materials that are both strong and\r\nresistant to slipping?  The investigator, collaborators, and\r\nstudents study these fundamental questions about knotting and\r\ntangling in real physical systems.  These studies lead to a\r\ndeeper understanding of tangled structures present in\r\nnanotechnology and biotechnology and to better models of knots\r\nmade with real physical materials.\r\n\r\n",
