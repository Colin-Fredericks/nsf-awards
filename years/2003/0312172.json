 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the role of ternary alloy additions to aluminides in decreasing their brittleness. This study deals with the evaluation of thermodynamic properties of Ti and Nb aluminides, and determination of the stability of various alloy phases in different environmental conditions. This research will enable to evaluate the phase stability of intermetallic aluminides that are candidate materials for many industrial applications. The stability of alloy phases also depends on the environmental conditions. Study of phase stability in the aluminide systems at different temperatures and environmental conditions also falls under the scope of the proposed research. A major goal is to determine the thermodynamic properties of aluminides with/without ternary alloying addition such as Cr, Zr, Mo, and V, using solid-state galvanic cell equilibrium technique. In addition, theoretical models will be developed to predict the stability of alloy phases based on the results of the thermodynamic and mass transport experiments. The reaction products will be analyzed using several techniques such as Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Electron Microprobe Analysis (EPMA), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Micro-hardness Tester. The work is expected to generate a newer understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of stable phase formation. The results of these studies are expected to ultimately lead to the development of an innovative cost-effective method of processing aluminides for commerce.\r\n%%%\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research consists in the development of a laboratory capable of conducting both experimental and theoretical research in the area of advanced materials at the university to enhance the understanding and application of intermetallics in various fields. This research aims at improvement of our understanding of the phase stability in advanced materials and also provides a basis for the development of newer intermetallic aluminides. The present research program would provide a wide variety of expertise in teaching and research, a strong base of external research support and to instill new creative and critical thinking among students. Enrichment of scientific research is possible through the variety of learning perspectives that is available in this environment. The funding of this research provides an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students including underrepresented minorities to develop understanding and experience in the metallurgical and process areas of research.\r\n***\r\n",
