The conference will focus on current forefront research in physics education and will provide the American community with a unique opportunity to interact both with the international community of physics education researchers and with each other. A distinguished committee of senior physicists, education specialists, and education researchers will review applications and select grantees. Each travel grant will cover the costs of travel, registration, room, board, and a copy of the proceedings.\r\n",
