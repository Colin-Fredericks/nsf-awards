 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electric power system is one of our nation's critical infrastructures. Interruptions create\r\nenormous economic and social impact. Momentary outages and voltage sags alone account for\r\n$25-400 billion/year in the US. When coupled with FACTS technology, modern energy storage\r\nsystems (ESS), such as batteries, flywheels, SMES, and super-capacitors, can improve stability,\r\npower quality, and the reliability of power systems. Many power system problems can be\r\nimpacted more effectively by utilizing active power control. Integrating energy storage system\r\ninto FACTS devices can provide dynamic decentralized active power capabilities and give\r\ntransmission service providers much needed flexibility for mitigating transmission level power\r\nflow problems and lead to more economical power delivery, better power quality, and improved\r\nreliability. This project will develop a scientific framework to guide the technical decision-making\r\nprocess of when, where, and how to integrate FACTS/ESS into the bulk power to\r\nalleviate dynamic perturbations and improve transmission congestion and loop flows.\r\nThis work will generate benchmark systems for three energy storage technologies (battery,\r\nSMES, and super-capacitors), and develop a modular benchmark power grid model for\r\nevaluating ESS performance. This study will culminate in a comprehensive set of guidelines and\r\nmetrics for the implementation of FACTS/ESS in power systems.\r\nThe intellectual merits and tangible outcomes of this research include the development of\r\ntheoretical understanding of power system responses to dynamic active power\r\ninjection/absorption, a comprehensive characterization of the primary energy storage\r\ntechnologies with the corresponding power electronic interfaces, and a comparison of the\r\ndifferent FACTS/ESS with respect to typical applications.",
