 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to establish methods for\r\ntheoretical study of algorithms for which the access to the input data is\r\nprovided in an implicit way. Such models of computations arise naturally\r\nin the context of algorithms working with large data sets. The implicit\r\ninput may correspond either to a partial data in situations when the\r\nentire data cannot be directly accessed (for example, because it is\r\nprohibitively expensive), or it may correspond to compressed or coded\r\ndata. It happens when only such data is stored in the system and no direct\r\naccess to the real data is provided or is available.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, complexity theory deals with the classical definition of\r\nthe explicitly given input data: the input is given explicitly and the\r\ngenerally accepted standard is to search for algorithms having the\r\ncomplexity linear, or at least polynomial in terms of the input size. Such\r\nalgorithms are viewed usually as the most efficient. However, this\r\nsignificantly changes if we deal with massive data. It is sometimes\r\nnecessary to find good algorithms which deal with implicitly given data\r\nand access only small part of the data (e.g., a random sample), or small\r\ncompressed or encoded representation of the data. The information which we\r\nhave about the data is now of size which would be substantially much\r\nsmaller than the size of the whole original input. In the extreme\r\nsituations it can be even constant (small sample sufficiently well\r\napproximating, with high probability, the exact output).\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this research is to understand the relation between the\r\ncomplexity of the problems in the classical model (where the access to\r\ndata is given explicitly) and the problems in the model in which the\r\naccess to the input is implicit. The main focus is on study algorithms for\r\none- and two-dimensional compressed texts, algorithms for property\r\ntesting, and sampling-based approximation algorithms. In case of texts the\r\nimplicit input is the compressed version of the input and in the case of\r\nproperty testing the reduced input is usually a small sample of the input.\r\nIn the latter case, the we also deal with the problems on preprocessed\r\ninput: an oracle provides fast answers to some basic structures underlying\r\nthe input data, e.g., (in geometric setting) orthogonal range queries. In\r\nthis case the implicit access to the input is constrained by range of\r\nallowable queries and by the input data representation. The goals for this\r\nresearch are to advance the state-of-the art in algorithms with restricted\r\naccess to the input data in general, in particular algorithms for\r\ncompressed texts and sampling-based property testing and approximation\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is wide and it involves advances\r\nin computational complexity of new classes of problems: pattern-matching\r\nin compressed or fully compressed one and two-dimensional texts, property\r\ntesting with access only to a small portion of the input data and abstract\r\ncombinatorial algorithms dealing with implicit input data. It is a belief\r\nof the investigators that new aspects of the algorithmic efficiency\r\nexplored in this research may initiate an important and novel area of\r\ncomputer science. This would be of great importance in time and space\r\neffective processing of massive data, as well as of great importance in\r\npure theory. The end-result of this research effort are an understanding\r\nof the effects of special access to the input data on the efficiency of\r\nrelated algorithms.\r\n",
