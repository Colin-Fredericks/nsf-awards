 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nMotivated by design problems i anotechnology and by key theoretical problems of interest,\r\nwe consider a paradigm whereby the plant description depends on one or several parameters that\r\nare subject to design.We propose a general framework for I tegrated Parameter and Controller\r\n(IPC)design that allows multiple performance requirements.We propose to address the problem\r\nof designing these parameters in conjunction with the feedback controller i order to achieve one or\r\nmore objectives.We then propose to address and solve the underlying optimization problem.The\r\ntheoretical underpinnings will rely o ew results in the non-convex optimization literature that\r\nutilize convex relaxation i order to get global optimal solutions.The potential of our approach\r\nto yield e .ective solutions to the resulting problems is demonstrated by our recent work that\r\napplies the proposed methods to the robust synthesis problem in 1 giving the only global optimal\r\nsolution to this important problem.Aside from its contribution to the theory of control design,\r\nthe IPC design tools to be developed will be used to address several practical problems where the\r\nsimultaneous parameter and controller design can have a large and measurable impact.Speci .cally,\r\nwe will address a signi .cant nanotechnology design problem i volving ultra-high resolution micro-\r\ncantilevers.This problem will take adva tage of existing expertise i the laboratory of the PIs and\r\nwill be conducted i close collaboration with the relevant industry.Based o the interdisciplinary\r\ntools eeded for IPC design theory,we also address educational goals that are made possible by\r\nthe proposed research.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the novel approach for a well recognized\r\nunsolved problem of integrated parameter and controller (IPC)design.The proposal will contribute\r\nsigni .cantly to optimization based methodologies in control theory solving hitherto unaddressed\r\nproblems that are of importance for practical control design.The proposal lays particular emphasis\r\non applying the theory developed to micro-cantilever based technologies in the context of IPC\r\ndesign.The theoretical paradigm is well suited and timely for furthering this technology.\r\nApart from the theoretical impact the related technology to be developed will be applicable\r\nto practical problems i the two hundred million dollar scanning probe industry.The PIs have\r\nsigni .cant collaboration with industry and the technical knowhow developed will be guided and\r\ntransferred e .ectively to the industry.E .ort will be placed on integrating the software developed\r\non a typical Matlab platform.This will enable wide use of the tools developed by the related\r\ncommunities.The main topic of the proposal provides a unique opportunity to expose the student\r\nto the importance of plant structure that facilitates good overall plant-controller performance.A\r\nnovel course that builds o the ideas and results of this project to motivate the general philosophy\r\nand techniques of integrated parameter and control design will be developed.\r\n1",
