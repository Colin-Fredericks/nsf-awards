 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  The overarching goals of our project are: (i) to revitalize undergraduate chemistry laboratory instruction by demonstrating the role of underlying principles of experiments to areas of current scientific, technological, and public interest; (ii) to allow students to relate the relevance of atomic and molecular and phenomena in understanding macroscopic phenomena; (iii) to adapt methods proven successful in lecture settings and experiments from the research literature in the laboratory curriculum.. To achieve these goals, we are adapting, implementing and developing experiments for undergraduate chemistry laboratory courses at different levels. These experiments combine the atomic and molecular resolution of Scanning Probe Microscopy with molecular modeling to relate microscopic phenomena to macroscopic applications. The experiments demonstrate the relevance of fundamental principles of basic science to areas of applied science, such as nanotechnology, where understanding atomic and molecular-level processes is critical in designing the next generation electronic devices. Many of the experiments are adaptations of experiments derived of the research literature, demonstrating to students the process of science. By performing these experiments, we expect that students will develop a greater understanding and appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of science and the interplay between science, engineering, and technology. The project affect all science and engineering undergraduate students at Columbia University, a diverse ethnic population evenly mixed in terms of gender. To further broaden the population of students involved, we are also collaborating with chemistry faculty at Norfolk State University, a historically black institution.",
