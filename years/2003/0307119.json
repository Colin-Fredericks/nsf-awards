One important set of tools to obtain\r\nthis information are rigorously verfied asymptotic expansions. In the case \r\nof changing, nonlinear boundary conditions another crucial component is \r\nthe study of mechanisms that govern the development of (near-)singularities. \r\nThe second main theme is then the application of this information to \r\neffectively obtain knowledge about (reconstruct) the parameters of the system \r\n(e.g., the location, and the character of the inhomogeneities) from data \r\nmeasured  on an accessible part of boundary, or in the ``farfield''. Initially \r\nthe focus will be on steady state and time harmonic situations, with consideration \r\nof scalar equations as well as  systems (in particular Maxwell's Equations). \r\nLater on fully time-dependent cases will also be studied. The work has an \r\nessential computational component. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe particular applications that will be investigated concern 1) anti-personnel \r\nmine detection, using Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR) data, and 2) corrosion/oxidation \r\nimaging (and control) using partial voltage and current data. But many other \r\napplications of significant interest come to mind, for instance in the field of \r\nmedical tomography. It is expected that the combination of analysis, asymptotic \r\nanalysis  and computational work contained in this project will allow for the \r\ndesign of detection (and location) algorithms that are more precise (less sensitive \r\nto noise), and much faster than those of a general purpose nature. For \r\nreconstructions it is envisaged to work on experimental as well as synthetic data.\r\nI intend to organize two small workshops in the second and third year (of the \r\nperiod covered by this grant). The first will be devoted to mathematical\r\nand computational aspects of corrosion/oxidation modeling. The second will be \r\ndevoted to GPR mine-detection. The participants will be mathematicians and \r\nengineers. \r\n\r\n",
