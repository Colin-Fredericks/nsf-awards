 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty-eight needy students majoring in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Manufacturing and Construction Management have the opportunity to be beneficiaries of a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEM) scholarship to enhance their opportunity to complete a degree in a technical major. The scholarships are administered by the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Engineering Program (MEP), whose major objectives are to recruit, retain and graduate educationally disadvantaged students pursuing technical majors.  The students selected for a scholarship are expected to progress in their chosen technical discipline and required to meet with their faculty advisor and counselor in the MEP program to discuss progress, academic advising, and other retention efforts administered by the office.  \r\nThe CSEMS project alleviates a financial burden for many students on our campus.  It also creates additional opportunities in the area of practical work experience and professional development.  The project receives extensive support from our campus and community to include faculty, students, professionals and local industry support.   Additional resources for CSEMS participants continue to grow, including an upgraded computer lab with donated equipment from industry and individual donors.  The previous CSEMS project included extensive participation of under-represented groups and has made a significant impact on retention and professional development of the students.  This scholarship program also helped to create SOCES (Students Obtaining Career Experience & Scholarships), which created internship opportunities for our student",
